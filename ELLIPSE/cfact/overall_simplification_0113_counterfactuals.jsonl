I think changing this rule is not a good idea because it has upset many people. Some students love to play sports but don't get B's. They really care about sports and spend lots of time on them. Sports also help them talk to others. There are students who get B's and play sports a lot with their friends. But if the rule changes, some friends can't play anymore. This seems unfair to them. I play sports too and I might know how they feel. They could feel sad and without power. So, please think again about this rule change. Thank you."}

If they can't join a team, they might feel left out and miss the friendship with other students.\n\nI believe letting more students play sports could help the school make more money. This extra money could improve the school's buildings, sports gear, and cafeteria food.\n\nAlso, if students with a C don't get better grades, they could get in trouble on their sports teams. This could make them want to do better in school. I think this plan would help both the school and the students with C grades. Many students would probably like this change.

One reason is that it would help our community and make it healthier. It would also stop people from doing bad things. More people would stop throwing trash everywhere. This would mean others don't have to clean up as much. It would also make people more active. If everyone threw away their trash the right way, we wouldn't need community service for picking up litter. So, it's good to have community service until people stop littering and start acting more responsibly.\n\nAlso, if there was less littering, people would have more time for fun activities instead of cleaning up. This could make our community friendlier. Kids would learn not to litter if they knew they had to do community service for it. This could lead to them getting better at not littering. Having a rule for community service could really make our community better. It would be safer and nicer for all of us."}

{"text_id": "8779EFBFA404", "output_essay": "In conclusion, some may think that making your school day two hours longer is not a good idea, but it is helpful if you think about it. Students might say it's a waste of time, but I don't agree because there are good things about it. For example, you would get more days off. With these days, you can work more or focus on school tasks like projects or homework. You'll also have more time to hang out with friends and family, study, or sleep, which can help you do better in school. Another good thing is that teachers can teach more in one class because the classes will be longer. You might not even have to worry about homework because you can finish it in class. This lets teachers go through lessons faster. School would also be less stressful because you have more time to catch up on things, even if they are not about school. You would get a three-day weekend, which you can use to study, do homework, work more, or catch up on things you are behind on. Being less stressed makes life easier. Some students might say that going to school for four days a week is not good because you stay longer at school. But I think it's not bad because you get many benefits. You get an extra day off, you can get through schoolwork faster, and you feel less stressed. This means you'll do better in school and other areas. It lets you work part-time to save money for college, have more time to study and focus in school, and catch up on things you are behind on. Saving energy and resources is also important.

We must face things sometimes so we can talk about what we know. Life is about learning from our mistakes; we grow as people and get real experiences. Now I'll talk about my first reason.\n\nMaking mistakes and learning is my first point. I have many friends who depend on others' troubles; they haven't faced tough times or learned how to handle life. These people only know about life from others. I think some trouble in life is good. It helps you become a great person; you learn to look after yourself, you see life differently, and many things change.\n\nGrowing as a person is my second point. As a teenager, I've had some failures, like trying out for cheerleading and soccer. In the end, I learned I wasn't good at soccer and didn't like it. I also realized I'm not the girl who smiles all the time or tries to look super pretty. I found what I love. I started playing rugby and joined JROTC at school. I began to discover the real me. I realized I'm not a typical teenager, and I have something special. Now I'm grateful to the coaches who rejected me because I'm doing what I love, and it makes me feel good and proud.\n\nReal-life experiences are my last point. This was tough to discuss. After not making the soccer or cheerleading teams, I was sad and couldn't believe it. One day I told myself, 'Things happen for a reason.' It was the best advice I gave myself. I thought it would be hard to tell people why I didn't make the team or why I wasn't good at things. I lied to many people, saying I quit, but it wasn't true. Lying made me feel bad inside. I don't like to lie, so I started telling the truth, and it felt good. Yes, some people stopped talking to me, but others came into my life and forgave me.\n\nIn conclusion, life is sometimes about having fun, loving yourself, learning from mistakes, standing up again, trusting friends, and asking for help. Learning to stand up on your own is tough. We always need friends, and falling down can help us stop pretending to be perfect."}

This is true for those who want to change how schools and student life are now. For some of us, picking up trash feels like we are being punished. But helping kids is nicer for me.

She wants to let students bring phones and use them when it's lunchtime or other free times, but not during class. I think it's a bad idea to use phones during free time and lunch because people might share test answers, start fights over small things, and call friends at other schools with different rules. People could share answers to a big test. They might share wrong answers, and others might copy them. The teacher could have different tests for each class. Then, people would be angry at the one who shared the answers. For example, my sister's friend sent her math quiz answers, and she got caught and failed. She told me, 'Don't let someone drag you down with them; it's important.' People could start fights over small things. They might have their phones stolen. They could blame someone who didn't do it and get them in trouble. They might argue over a nicer phone. Once, my friend got into a big problem because of a phone. She said, 'I'll never use my phone at school again.' Also, texting friends at other schools could get your phone taken. Not every school has the same rules. You might get in trouble for a simple mistake. People need to focus on class and school. School lasts only 9 hours; after that, you can text all you want. I used to get in trouble and have my phone taken until my mom said, 'You have all day to text; focus on your grades.' In the end, the principal is rethinking the cell phone policy. She wants to allow phones during free times but not in class. This is because people might share test answers, start unnecessary drama, or call friends at other schools.

{"text_id": "59245E1C5BF0", "output_essay": "Students should have to take an art class or a choice class. Students who go to an art class can show their feelings better, know what they want, and care more about their work. Some even have a good mood. Art is made to entertain and teach us. For some students, art class is very fun because they can be creative and learn what art means. Art can teach you a lot and it helps you stand out as unique.\n\nFirst, an art class lets students show their feelings. Each student has their own way to do this. Some use music, some use painting, and some use acting. Also, many students like to show their feelings by writing music, painting, or acting. When students share their feelings, it can make them feel less stressed. But in art class, they don't just learn to show their feelings. They also learn about art and its history.\n\nSecond, art helps students make choices and know what they want for their future and what they have now. Many students don't know what they want. They can't decide which way to go. Art class can help students figure out what they want. It's like picking a branch from a tree, like music, painting, acting, or others like making things, designing, and building.\n\nOn the other hand, the happiest students in school are the art students. Why? Thanks to art teachers and their classes, students feel good about themselves and are proud. Students in art class talk and share ideas to get to know each other. This makes them confident and self-trusting. A student who is happy and confident is passionate in all they do. They do well at work, homework, and when they are with family or friends. They are also more active. Why? Because their lifestyle gives them energy. They keep moving and their minds are always busy.\n\nFrom what I've said, it's easy to answer the question, 'Should students have to take an art class, or should it be a choice?' Students should take an art class. Some might think that art is not as useful as other subjects like math in science or English in government, but they are wrong. Art makes students' attitudes better. If a student is grumpy, silly, and lazy, it shows they don't care and won't try. But with a good attitude, students show they do care."}

Also, some students need to do community service, and picking up trash could be one option for them.

If we clean it up, we help animals, plants, and trees. These are all important for our survival. Plus, less trash means less pollution.\n\nStudents should understand on their own that littering is bad for our planet. If someone sees another person litter and not pick it up, they should ask them to put it in the bin. If everyone cared about the Earth, they would work to keep it safe and clean. So, I think having students clean up trash is a very good idea. They could take turns doing it. We could also pair them with an adult and go to different areas to clean. This is a good way to make our planet cleaner. I support the idea of students picking up trash, and I want to help or get others to help too."}

So, I suggest a third rule: students can use their phones during lunch or free time but cannot use them in class or during big school events, unless it is an emergency.

It doesn't matter what job they want later, because learning anything is good. Kids often think about jobs like being a doctor, scientist, or lawyer when they grow up. They don't think much about other jobs because they think they won't make enough money. But if art was a must, some might like it and want to do it as a job. It's okay to find science hard, as everyone likes different things. Art can make school less stressful when other subjects like math or science are tough. Art is fun and not as hard. Some people might say it's not good to make everyone take art if they don't like it. But students already take classes they have to, not always because they like them. These classes teach about life and help with future problems. Art is very helpful, like when choosing colors to make a home look nice. Picking colors and arranging things at home shows art skills.

{"text_id": "F05EB1468473", "output_essay": "Dear Principal,\n\nI think that students should do community service for three good reasons. First, it helps make our Earth a better place; second, it can make our school look good; third, it teaches us to keep things clean. Let me explain these points more.\n\nThe first reason is the big amount of trash in our oceans. About 25% of the ocean's surface has trash, which is worrying. Rain can wash trash from beaches and rivers into the ocean. This can make our water dirty and make people sick. So, it's important for us to help clean up.\n\nSecond, if our school is clean, people will think better of it. A clean school might show that we respect the principal. It could also bring more praise or money for the school. If we make teams of four to clean different places, we can clean faster. The more teams we have, the faster our school will be clean. This is another good reason to do community service.\n\nThird, doing this work shows we are clean and serious about our duties. It can also get us ready to be better grown-ups. Plus, it means less work for the people who keep our school clean. The more serious and responsible we are, the more we help keep the school nice.\n\nIn conclusion, community service is good for our planet, our school's image, and for us growing as people.

There are many reasons why cell phones should not be allowed in school. First, they take your attention away. For example, if you are texting or making a call while the teacher is teaching, you learn nothing. It's hard to catch up and understand what you missed. Learning new things can be hard; it's even harder to learn what you skipped. Another reason is that if kids don't listen in school, they won't finish school. Then they won't get the great job they always wanted."}

Cell phones can be in school but should be off in class. If a phone rings in class, it can bother everyone. I think school heads should let us use cell phones during lunch. We should bring them to school but keep them off in class. We can turn them on after school or before classes start. We could keep phones on in class but quiet or on silent mode for emergencies. But we should not use them when we are working in class or taking a test. If there is a family emergency, we should keep phones on silent or vibrate mode at school. This way, we can check a text from our parents if we need to. Then we can put the phones away in our bags or pockets. Students like to text and call friends on their phones. They should do this after school, before school, during lunch, or free periods. School heads should let us bring phones to school. Some schools do not let students have phones. I don't know why. It is normal for people to want cell phones, especially teenagers. I would tell all school heads to agree with Policy 1. They should let students bring phones to school. They should let us use them during lunch or free time. They should make sure phones are off in class or on silent or vibrate mode before we go into class or start work."}

This can make the country's economy stronger and help the environment too. Some people think that schools should also use more energy to make the school day longer. This would save money because it costs less. Energy will be stronger than usual, and schools can use it whenever they need it. With more energy, people can do more work in school. Teachers will have more time to teach. This energy is safe; it won't hurt your eyes or any other part of your body. It's all natural. The main thing for schools is that they will spend less money. People say that schools will save money with this kind of energy. Businesses are making money, but it still costs schools less. Schools like this because they don't have to worry. For example, if the power goes out, they can still use this energy. They will save time, and schools will work better. Students will always be at school because there will always be energy. Businesses have started using this energy too. It's easier for them. All companies use a lot of energy and spend a lot of money. But they chose to use this new kind of energy because it has many good points, especially for big companies. In the end, I believe that these energy resources are the best. They will cost less, and people will have more time to work. Schools need this energy, and it will bring them many good things."}

While some don't like the idea of online classes, others think it's good. They say online classes save time, so students can do other things. Also, students who have trouble getting to school will find it easier to learn from home. \n\nFirst, online classes at home are better because they don't take as long. For example, these classes happen at set times. A class must end when the time is up. Students can then plan when to study and when to work. In the USA, many students borrow money for school. Working while studying online can help them pay back these loans. It's clear that online classes are helpful. \n\nAlso, for students without cars, online classes are the best choice. In the USA, not having a car is a big issue, especially for students. They rush to catch buses or trains every morning to get to school on time. Sometimes, they might miss class because of this. Online classes can fix these problems. Students can then spend more time on their studies instead of worrying about travel. \n\nIn the end, online classes save time and let students work to make money. They also help students be on time for class when they might be late because of travel issues. This means students should take classes from home using the internet or video calls."}

But if the school does this, many students might leave because we have other things to do after school. Teachers have families and kids too. They would have to stay longer at school, which I don't think is good. \n\nWe shouldn't make the school day longer because it's hard on us students. As I mentioned, we have jobs after school. Sure, more school time could be good, but what about our after-school issues? Also, teachers and students need time to enjoy with friends and family. If we add two hours, teachers will have to prepare more lessons. That takes planning and time. \n\nAnother reason not to make the day longer is that we'll be too tired. If school ends at 4 p.m., we'll go home, do homework, and work on projects. We'll be exhausted. It might seem nice to spend more time at school, but we need to rest. \n\nAlso, there's the problem of food. Some of us don't eat school food, so we'd need to leave earlier to pack lunch and snacks. Not eating well makes us tired. If we don't sleep enough, we lose energy. \n\nIn conclusion, following this plan isn't a good idea. It's too much, and it affects teachers and students.

Here are some reasons why failing can help you succeed: Not having enough money can stop you from being successful. Trying hard is important too. If you lose interest, you might quit your goal. Also, having friends who don't help or give good advice can be a problem. Money can be a big issue. I'll face this after high school. I'll need to work to pay for college. But I'm willing to work hard to reach my goal of going to college. You also need to stay interested to succeed. If you get bored, you might give up on your goals. And having good friends matters. They should help and guide you. Bad friends might lead you to make poor choices, like doing drugs. They can stop you from succeeding. In the end, I really agree with Churchill.

They might find their classes tough. As you grow up, school can get harder.\n\nSecond, I believe you should let students who want to learn be in activities or sports. If some students don't want to learn, you could take away their free time like breaks or lunch. Give them their free time back when they improve. But please don't stop the ones who are trying from having fun.\n\nThird, it's not fair that mostly students with B's and A's can do sports. This can make other students feel bad.

I agree with him because he said, \"success is about moving from one failure to another.\" This means if you really want a better job, or to buy your dream house, you will face tough times. As I've said before, things are hard in life; they all need sacrifice, but you can reach your goals. You should not quit because if you do, you will not succeed in life. \n\nI agree with Churchill for two reasons. First, his words push people to understand that nothing is easy or impossible. You must be willing to do what it takes to meet your goals. His words tell us to keep going, never stop, and always learn from our mistakes while looking ahead. \n\nThe second reason is to always keep your excitement; this is very important. If you lose your excitement, you will not achieve anything in life. No matter what happens, as I said, look ahead. Forget the things that slow you down and see the world with hope.

If you want to play sports, you need to do well in school. Then, in high school, if you have good grades and are great at a sport, you might get a scholarship for college. Also, in college, if you have good grades and are great at a sport, you could become a professional athlete. Every kid who plays sports dreams of this. I know many kids who are great at sports but can't play because their grades are too low, like a C or lower. It's not too hard to get a B average.

You might just do the work to get a good grade and not remember it for the future when you need it.\n\nGoing to school is good for learning and for getting along with others. You learn how to talk to people and how they talk to you. In class, if you get something wrong, it's explained and you understand why it's wrong. This helps you learn better.

Some think that failing is not important in trying to succeed. But failing is important because it teaches us lessons. When we mess up, we learn something new. If we share what we learn, we can succeed even more.\n\nFirst, when we mess up, we try to learn from it. Take a girl who wants to join a basketball team. She is scared she won't make it. This fear stops her from trying her best. At the tryouts, she doesn't do well because she is scared. She doesn't make the team. But she learns from this. She knows she can't be scared if she wants to succeed. The next year, she tries again and makes the team. This shows that we can't let fear stop us. If we don't mess up, we won't try new things. And if we don't try, we can't succeed.\n\nAlso, when we learn from our mistakes, we tell others. This helps everyone do better. For example, teachers tell students what's right and wrong. They use their own experiences. Students learn and find their way to succeed. Teachers also succeed by helping students become smart and talented. When we repeat advice, we remember it better. This stops us from making the same mistakes. It's good to help and guide others. But the best thing is to keep them excited and not give up when they fail. Success happens when we do good for others and don't give up.\n\nFailing is important in trying to succeed because we learn from our mistakes and tell others. This helps everyone do better. Failing shows us what to do next and how to do it right. By remembering our mistakes, we can advise others and not make the same mistakes again.

They could also spend more fun time with their families. If a student gets home earlier, he can rest by sleeping, eating, or talking with friends. He can do things he likes, such as hobbies or going out with his family. For example, my sister loves to dance ballet, but she can't after school. She dances at night or on weekends. Also, many parents miss out on fun times like picnics because their kids are in school. If school ended earlier, parents could make new memories with their kids. A shorter school day means students won't be so tired. In many places, the school day is too long. Students are too tired to do anything when they get home. They wake up at 7:00 AM and wait for the bus until 7:40 AM. They have more than four tough subjects that tire them out. School ends at 3:00 PM. Students feel trapped, like in jail. How can they keep going if they're this tired? A shorter school day also helps students manage their time. This is important for those who study and work. Some students work after school to save for college. If school ended earlier, they could rest or do homework before work. Last year, a boy in my class worked late. Our teacher asked why he didn't do his homework. He said he was too busy working to pay for college and help his family. He would have done it if he had more time after school.

Nothing is easy; you must always put in a lot of effort. If you fail once, it's fine.

But I don't like Policy 2 because if there's an emergency at school, students can't call their family. Even if the school has a phone, it's not enough. What if a student is stuck in a room and no one knows? They need to call for help. Kids should not have phones in school because they might cheat by looking up answers on the internet.

For instance, some students from other countries can't go to school to learn English or join classes like other students. I think it's great that some schools offer this program to students.\n\nMy first reason for liking this program is that students can learn at home. They can study English, Spanish, French, or learn things like 'How to fill out a job application?' They can do all this learning at home.\n\nMy second reason for liking this program is that students can choose when to take online classes. They can also pick which days to study. Not just students, but also people who have never been to school can learn with this program. Now, they have a chance to learn.\n\nSome people don't agree with me. They think that without going to school, students will miss out on learning chances. They also think the internet is not a good place for learning.\n\nIn conclusion, this program is a great chance for students and others who want to learn from home."}

Winston Churchill, a past leader of Britain, said something that really shows a common belief. I agree because I think you can't learn without failing first. You need to make mistakes to really understand and avoid them later. Failure is key to success because you can't just look at something and know it all; it takes time and learning. Many smart people would agree. We learn the hard way or we don't learn at all. We get inspired and work to reach our goals and learn to do things well.\n\nAn example of how failing is part of success is my mother, Generic_Name. She moved to the United States as a teenager and had me when she was young. She hoped to do great things here, things she couldn't do in her home country. As time went on, she saw that success wasn't coming easy. My mother cared about money, but she cared about me more. When I was 7, she told me, 'I have to be a good example for you, because you were born here and won't have to struggle like I did.' She knew she had to work hard to overcome her worries. My mom didn't think badly about her choices or give up. She could worry or go for it with hope. Ten years later, my mom works as a supervisor at Generic_School. She shows me that hard work is worth it. You have to keep going, make mistakes, and handle stress to reach your goals. I'm thankful for everything she's taught me through her own hard times. Now at 17, I understand that struggle isn't just when you're sad or having a tough time. Struggle happens when you're doing your best to reach a goal. It's okay to struggle; it's just the start of the path to the future you dream of."}

They need time for fun activities and to relax. Schools are not businesses, even if businesses benefit from hard work. Young students can't handle the same work as adults. If they try too hard, they might break down. It's not good for their health to work until they faint. Teens need hobbies to learn about themselves. But school and homework fill their day. They can't get jobs or take extra classes like music or sports. They have to wait for summer to do these things. Still, learning is key for young people. They should do well in school. They will have tough times later, but not now. As they grow, college will push them to work hard. High school is harder than middle school, and college will be harder still. Having three days off isn't the best way to learn. A five-day school week is better. So, school hours should stay the same."}

Take school, for example. To graduate, you must pass ESOL tests. You might fail at first, but that doesn't mean you should quit right away. You get another chance to make it work. The most important thing for success is to keep your excitement to make your dreams happen. You are the only one who can make your dreams real. Without excitement, you are lost. You can't do anything without energy and not giving up. Some people win on their first try. But if you fail, it doesn't make you a loser. You just need to try harder and with more excitement. If you fail, you can try again to fix your mistakes. This makes you better and stronger. Then you can succeed more. To those who want to quit, don't stop. Keep moving. Success will come to those who do everything to win. This is why I agree with this great saying by Winston Churchill."}

The main reason I say this is because playing sports doesn't stop kids from learning. If you take away sports, it will hurt children. For example, if a kid wants to be a football, basketball, or soccer player, they won't be able to reach that dream if the school stops sports and activities. I believe you should let kids play these sports, but only if they don't have D or F grades. This way, if a kid really wants to play, they will work harder to get better grades. As a student, we all want to show who we are and have a break to play sports and games. Kids love this, and they will be sad if you take it away. Playing sports can also help you get into a good college because colleges like to see that when they decide who gets in.\n\nI also want to say that many kids want to have pep rallies and watch their friends and family play sports. As a student here, I would be sad if I couldn't play sports or do activities. Playing sports helps kids feel less stressed and more alive. If you take away sports, you take away their fun. Kids at this age want to have a good time, and even though we might give them a lot of credit, it's still not fair to stop them from following their dreams. Plus, we're in school for about eight hours, and after that, we want to do what we love, like going to sports and activities.\n\nThank you for your time and effort. I hope you understand.\n\nSincerely,\n[Your Name]"}
{"text_id": "462EC285B036", "output_essay": "Success is not easy to get; it takes a lot of work, staying focused on your goals, and not giving up. You might fail a few times, but this will make you strong and help you avoid making the same mistake twice. Life is about learning from failure. I agree with what Winston Churchill said, \"Success is moving from one failure to another without losing your excitement.\" \n\nWorking hard will make you strong if you fail. Being dedicated is key to success. Dedicated people usually get what they want because they care a lot about their goals. Also, working hard makes you a better person and shows you how hard it is to get something you really want. Everyone wants to be successful, but not everyone is willing to work hard for it. You won't be successful if you don't give up some things. \n\nYou might fail sometimes, but you shouldn't stop or give up. There are many stories of people who became successful after failing. Albert Einstein is one example. He made many mistakes in his experiments. People didn't believe in him, but he ignored them and kept working. Now, he is one of the most famous scientists, and what he found out is taught everywhere. So, no matter how often you fail, you should get up and keep trying. You learn from mistakes, and if you fail, you get another chance to do better. \n\nStay focused on your dreams. Everyone has dreams or goals, and if you stay focused and don't let anything stop you, you will see results. Even if you feel like giving up, take a break and then start again. Keep going after your goals. Remember, \"Nothing is impossible.\" \n\nIn conclusion, success is about staying excited; failure is a chance to see what went wrong and do better. I think failure gives you more reason to keep trying for success. If there was no failure, getting success would be too easy."}

But I think students should choose if they want to study art. Here are my reasons: First, not everyone loves art. For instance, some prefer dancing or sports, so they should pick what they learn. Second, students have other important subjects like science and math. These subjects are needed to graduate. Adding an art class might be too much for some. So, they might want to take a different class, like a fitness class if they enjoy sports. Third, art isn't the only way to have fun or be creative. Other classes can also teach us new things and let us enjoy our interests. In the end, I feel strongly that art shouldn't be a required class. Not all students enjoy drawing, painting, singing, or acting. Students should be able to pick their own electives. Some people love art and think it helps with creativity and can be a hobby.

But there are bad points too. Longer school days might make students more tired while they're at school. They might also skip school more, and missing a day could hurt their grades a lot. With longer school days, teachers can explain things better. This is helpful for tough subjects like math and chemistry. Students might do better on homework over the longer weekend and come back to school less tired. Many students don't sleep enough and feel worn out at school. A new schedule could help them feel less stressed. But, because the days are longer, students might get too tired in class. They could fall asleep and not finish their work, which would make their grades worse. If students skip more classes because the days are long, it's a problem. Missing school means they'll miss a lot of class time, fall behind, and their grades will suffer. A four-day week has ups and downs. We need to see how students handle it.

Not everything goes as you hope. Failing can make you work harder and find better chances. Most people see failing as a choice, but it's not. Always try to do well, even in small things or new things. If you give up and don't try, you won't get far. If you stop trying, you won't get the job you dreamed of as a kid. You might end up in a job that doesn't pay well. Many students want to finish high school and go to college for a better future. Some students drop out because they don't want to do homework, fail tests, or important classes. They would rather stay home, sleep, and do what they want. Parents want their kids to do well. When kids fail, some try again. They get good jobs and live on their own. Working hard and doing your best leads to a better life and education. Everyone fails and learns from mistakes.

If we don't give up things for what matters most, we can't do anything good. For example, when I was young, I knew someone who wanted to be a doctor. She needed to study in another city to do this. But she didn't want to leave her grandmother alone. So she didn't give up living at home for her dream. She stopped studying to stay with her grandmother.\n\nWe must fight to win because we all want to make our parents proud. We find success when we fight for what we want. My biology teacher, Generic_Name, once told me about her struggle. In high school, she had many problems with her family. They didn't want her to be a teacher. But she didn't give up. Now she is a biology teacher and explains things very well. It was hard for her to reach her dream. She had to fight her problems and her family. She worked and studied very hard to get what she wanted.\n\nWe must stay hopeful, thinking we can do it. When we are hopeful, we can make our dreams come true. I remember my mom saying we should always be hopeful. She wanted to go to college to help her family and have a better life. But her friends were negative. They said she shouldn't go to college without money. So my mom began to think negatively because of her friends. She thought she couldn't reach her goal to become someone important with a good job to help her family and give them a better life. This shows that with a hopeful mind, people can do what they want to reach their goals.\n\nIn conclusion, we need to be strong because if we are, we can go after and get success. We need to be more determined and ready to be hopeful, successful, and kind. A person who has worked hard in the past to be someone with a career and education; but to be that person, we need to give up things and work very hard to study well.

Going to a real school, not an online one, means you're less likely to get distracted, unless you like to joke around or be silly in class.

I believe learning from home is a good option. It offers almost the same good things as being at school, but you do it from home."}
{"text_id": "DFD2C3047A7F", "output_essay": "Do you think that watching videos or going online can help you learn well at home? Many students like to go to school because it's easier to understand things there. Learning online can be confusing and hard to follow. Also, some people want to try online learning but don't have enough time. Without a teacher there to help, online classes might not work well for learning. \n\nFirst, it's tough for students to learn online if there's no teacher to help right away when they don't understand something. Sometimes, people feel like quitting these classes on the first day because they can't understand the teacher. They can't go over the parts they don't get until they understand. Staring at a computer too long can also hurt your eyes and make you dizzy. \n\nSecond, some students can't get online or don't have a computer because they don't have much money. This is a big problem because they want to learn at home when they have free time. But they often don't have free time because they have to work a lot. Schools should give computers to students who can't come to school every day or can't buy one because they need to work to pay for things at home. \n\nThird, students who have to look after their family and do housework don't have time for online classes. They have to stay home to cook and clean instead of learning to get ready for a good job later. \n\nLastly, for all these reasons, online classes can be tough for students who can't take them at home. But, many students think it's a good idea for those who don't like school or can't make time for it. Even though learning online without a teacher is hard, it's always tough for students with lots to do at home. It's hard for them to fit in online classes."}
{"text_id": "40007FDDC453", "output_essay": "The Importance of Failure in Achieving Success\n\nWinston Churchill, a past leader of Britain, once said that success is moving from one failure to another without losing your excitement. I believe that failure helps us succeed. I will talk about three reasons why this is true: failing teaches you, makes you careful, and keeps you honest.\n\nFirst, failing teaches you. When you make a mistake, you try not to do it the same way again. Instead, you try to do better. For example, as a kid, I kept falling off my bike. But I didn't stop trying. After many tries, I finally learned to balance. Some people don't succeed because they give up when they face problems. If you keep trying, you'll become stronger and won't fall as easily next time.\n\nSecond, failing makes you careful. You value what you have because you remember the effort it took to get it. You feel good when you look at these things. Like when I bought my first phone, I felt good. It took a long time to save up for it, but I worked hard. Even though it's broken now, it was very important to me back then. I keep it to remember that time.\n\nThird, failing keeps you honest. If someone asks how you succeeded, you'll say it was because you didn't quit. You worked hard, fell many times, but always got back up and kept trying. I'm honest about falling off my bike many times. But I kept going because I was excited to ride, to go fast, and to have fun.\n\nIn conclusion, these points show that failure is part of achieving success. We should use these ideas to encourage people to take chances. We should tell them that when bad things happen, they need to keep going, and they can succeed. I think everyone has failed at some point but didn't give up."}
{"text_id": "936D63E8CE0B", "output_essay": "Failure is the best way to learn how to succeed. It pushes you to keep going when things are hard. Failure is important in trying to succeed because it makes you strong, helps you learn from your mistakes, and gets you ready to do well.\n\nFirst, failure is important in our lives because it makes us strong. You don't quit when things are hard. You work harder to succeed. Failure helps you get better at things you're not good at. For example, getting better at math can change your life. Failure gives chances to those who are willing to try. It adds meaning to life as you try your best to win.\n\nAlso, failure is important because it helps you learn from what you did wrong. It makes you forget the past and focus on what you can do now to succeed. For example, college students who leave school and then go back often move from failure to success. You also make smarter choices. Going through failure makes you believe in yourself more and know you can try again.\n\nSome people think that if you fail, it's because you didn't work hard enough. They give up too easily. They wait too long to do things. For example, some people wait for others to do their work instead of trying themselves. People who fail and don't organize their lives well choose to fail. Many who fail don't take the chance to try again and succeed.\n\nIn the end, failure is very important in our lives. It helps us grow. We have all failed at some point, and it is the biggest push to help us win.\n\nFailure is the best way to get smarter. Luck comes from taking risks and failing. Life will be tough, but without failure, you wouldn't learn how to get back up."}

Online classes let students and people all over the world learn in a new place. This is great for students who live far from school because online classes help them learn and show off new skills.\n\nSome students get better at using computers when they take online classes. Also, these classes can be finished faster. Teachers are trying to make online classes work like regular schools.\n\nBut, there are big differences between going to regular classes and learning online. For example, in online classes, you see your teacher on a computer. Everyone else is also on the computer. This can be boring or hard. But, you can finish some classes faster.\n\nGoing to a regular school is another choice. Many students like it because it's more fun. They meet new people and achieve new things. But it can also be hard because they have more classes each day.\n\nThis new way that schools are using is good for reaching our goals faster. If I could, I would learn from home. It would make it easier for me to finish my classes on time.\n\nIn the end, schools that use this way of teaching are helping education reach new places.

So don't stop trying. Keep trying to get what you want. You must be brave to get everything you want. \n\nFailing is useful. It pushes you to try over and over to succeed. It can make you sad, but don't stop and don't let anything hold you back. Keep moving forward. \n\nHe was right to say that because success often comes after many failures. Sometimes you might succeed on your first try. If you want to win, you must work hard. All the famous people in the world failed many times, but they didn't stop. They kept trying and eventually got what they wanted. \n\nAll the inventors succeeded after failing a few times. They tried many times to make their inventions work. No, success isn't easy; you must work very hard to succeed in life. \n\nYou must do your best to achieve it. \n\nHere's an example: when you try something and fail, you might think, 'I can't do it, I won't try again, it's too hard.' But if you're excited, you can do it. Just try again and again until you can do it. \n\nSuccess is about moving from one failure to another without losing excitement.

{"text_id": "1557E40A4AC9", "output_essay": "School is very helpful to students. It gives them many experiences and chances to do different things. In school, students can choose classes like drama, art, and music. These classes let students try new things and help them grow as people. Some people think that students must take music, drama, or art classes. I strongly agree that students must take one of these classes, and I have a few reasons why. First, students can find out what they like, which can help them choose a job in the future. For example, many older students have a hard time picking a major in college and a job for later. But if they have to take music, drama, or art, they pay more attention and learn more. This might make it easier for them to find out what they like. Also, they can get better at it. If you're good at something in one of these classes, you've found a way for your future and improved your skills. I think that more experiences mean more chances. Next, some students pick an elective because they think it's easy and not helpful for college. I don't agree with this. Music, art, or drama classes are linked to other subjects like history, science, and physics. For example, in music class, we learn about music's history and how instruments like the piano and drum started. We also learn about how sounds are made in science. So, learning anything is always useful. On the other hand, if you do well in these classes, it can change you for the better. If you're shy, you might become more outgoing, brave, and a leader. This is because these classes often need you to work with others and share your ideas. For example, I was shy in 9th grade in some classes because they were boring. But in photography class, I was different. I talked a lot, shared ideas, and was a leader. This class was right for me. I found out I liked photography and started studying it. Now, I work as a wedding photographer on Saturdays and love it. The photography class changed who I am and my life. So, I think making students take music, drama, or art classes is good for them. In conclusion, these reasons show why students must take these classes. They are as important as other classes and can help students find what they like, be useful later, and change them in good ways. If these classes are required, they will be very helpful to students."}

If they do, students might choose not to come because it's too short. Even though schools don't like this idea, students might enjoy having only two hours of class. But some students won't like it because they want to learn more and finish school faster. To save energy and resources, the whole world needs to work together, not just schools. It's not right to cut school hours without asking factories to do the same. If school is only two hours, students will just stay home and play games or watch TV. This means energy won't be saved. Some businesses work only four days a week, but schools need more than two hours to teach. The University of Washington says schools need to teach longer than two hours. They also say people will waste energy at home anyway. For example, I have a computer, phone, and TV. Sometimes I use all three at once. Some people try to save energy, and it's important to them. But if school is only two hours, students will use more energy at home. This is not a good idea. In short, saving energy is good, but not for schools. We need more time to learn.

{"text_id": "48CD3C2E57E9", "output_essay": "Do you want to pick an art class as an option? Music, drama, and art should be choices because not all students like these subjects. If they have to take them, they won't do well and will get poor grades. Optional classes let students who want to learn new things do so. These classes are good because they can help you get a better job and make extra money. For example, if you learn to draw in art class, you might make money by drawing for a company's catalog. This can make you more flexible in life. Some students pick these classes because they are easy and fun. They go to class happy and try hard. I took guitar class for two years. It was enjoyable and helped me relax. It also helped me get good grades and improve my GPA. Students like me pick these classes for these reasons. It's better to have them as options so you can choose what you really need. This year, I didn't take art because I wanted to finish my subjects for an advanced diploma. If I had to take art, I couldn't have done that. Choosing classes that make you feel sure is important. Some students want to study art in college. They can start learning about it in high school to see if they like it. For instance, a student picked music but changed his mind when he found it hard. He realized music wasn't for him. Some think all students should learn art to gain a new skill. But I believe students should decide if they want to learn it. If they're not interested, they won't try and will get bad grades. This can hurt their GPA and their chance to graduate."}

Often, you will fail before you succeed. We should think differently about failure. It is not something to run from. It is a chance to learn what does not work. I believe failure will always be the same. When I fail, I do not want to try again. I also lose my excitement, and I think a failure cannot be made right. For instance, if people laugh at you or say mean things in class or at work, it makes you feel shy and ashamed. But I believe when you fail, you can fix it, or you learn a lot from it. It is up to us. It is just a mistake in our life that we have to fix. Next time, we should try not to fail again."}

Then, a parent must come to the office to get it. The teacher won't give it back directly. They will send it to the office. Kids usually start having phones in 6th or 7th grade.

Many students feel they need their phones to text or call others. Some students don't turn off their phones. They just set them to silent or vibrate. But you can still hear the vibration.

{"text_id": "5A138047A49F", "output_essay": "Long ago, Winston Churchill, a leader from Britain, said, 'Success is moving from one failure to another without losing your excitement.' I think he was right. To be successful, you need to stay excited. First, think about people who make new things. They often fail. But they don't stop trying. Why? Because they are excited. They know they might fail many times. But they keep their excitement and bravery. They try over and over because their excitement for success keeps them going. If they stop, they lose their excitement and fail. We don't want to fail, and neither do they. Next, consider what they get if they succeed. They can get a patent and sell it to companies. Then they get money without working. They also get famous. Like Thomas Edison, who made the first light bulb. What they make goes into history books and newspapers. People remember them. They stay excited about what they can get from success. Everyone knows Thomas Edison, right? He made the first light bulb. He failed a lot but never stopped. Finally, he did it. He made the light bulb and got rich. He also became very famous. His work is in history books. We still know what he did. Edison kept his excitement, and that's why he made it.

First, we see others who are very successful and we want to be like them or even better. We work all the time to reach our goals. For example, students go to school early, and people go to work. We spend most of our day getting ready to be successful later. We keep our eyes on our goals, even if we fail. It's hard to work towards success, but we all want to show we are strong. If not, we won't have a good life. We face problems every day and try to solve them, no matter how tough they are. In the end, don't stop trying, even if you fail a lot. Keep going to do great things and be successful.\n\nEveryone can choose to be successful, even when it's very hard. When we fail, we might feel weak and think we can't do it. But this feeling makes us work harder to reach our goals. I face failure every day but I keep trying to do well. I won't stop until I get what I want. For example, I did poorly on an anatomy test. I felt bad because I wanted the best grade. But I didn't stop. I took the test again and got the grade I wanted. When I came to the USA in 2014, I didn't know English. I spent two years just learning the language. Others were ahead of me, but I got better grades. I stayed an extra year in high school to graduate. I didn't quit because failing made me want to succeed more. Look at Mohamed Salah, a famous soccer player. He used to sit on the bench. He practiced a lot by himself. Now he's the best player in Europe. So, don't let failure beat you. Use your inner strength.\n\nTrying and failing can lead to success. If you work hard, you'll get to your goal. Learning from mistakes helps us do better and not make the same errors. Having courage lets us try again and chase our dreams. Having a goal is important. It gives life meaning and helps us keep going after we fail. I want to be an eye doctor. Remembering this goal helps me get up after failing. People with dreams keep trying, no matter how many times they fail. Without dreams, it's harder to get back up. But we should all have dreams. Why live without them? You won't succeed without a goal. Chances don't come every day, so focus on what you want. When we see others doing well at work, we might feel jealous. But don't be scared to try and fail. You need to take risks to grow.

{"text_id": "BC0643D3DF44", "output_essay": "Do you think you will succeed after failing many times, or do you think failing a lot doesn't help you succeed?\n\nThe path to success is not very wide. Some people may start off on the wrong foot, but they will learn from their mistakes and get better. Then they will find their own way to succeed. I believe that if people keep their excitement for their work, even with many failures, they will make it in the end.\n\nFor me, failure isn't something to fear. Just be confident and believe in yourself to keep moving forward. You might be the next person to make it.\n\nOne reason I think people will succeed after failing a lot is because failure is just a part of life. Everyone fails at some point. But if you get past it, you become stronger.\n\nSo, how do you get past it? First, stay calm when you fail. Keep a clear head. Then, talk with some friends. Share your story and figure out together why you failed. Find solutions and remember them so you don't make the same mistake again. This way of solving problems can help you succeed faster.\n\nAnother reason I think people can succeed after failing is a saying from China: 'Failure is the mother of success.' Many people know this because success often comes after failure. For example, my uncle named Generic_Name started a company after college, but it failed and went bankrupt several times. Despite this, he kept working hard. He wrote down everything he learned about running a successful company. With this knowledge and effort, he finally made it and now earns a lot of money.\n\nAlso, if you've failed a lot before, you can avoid bad choices in the future. Why do some men in their 30s and 40s seem smart and attractive? Because they have great life experience. Experience is very important. It helps us get better at anything we do. For instance, if someone with a weak body wants to swim in cold weather, I can tell them not to because I got sick doing that. Experience helps you and others. As you get older, you can react faster to things you know. Sometimes being older is an advantage. You can make good choices quickly.\n\nIn conclusion, I think failure isn't bad. If you keep chasing your dream and believe in yourself, failure can actually help you. People who have succeeded without failing might make mistakes because they can be too proud. That's just how people are. Plus, in the future, you can teach your kids how to succeed using your own experiences. These lessons are priceless. So don't be afraid of failing. Keep working with excitement and let your failures make you stronger."}

Making the school day longer means students have more time to learn, do work, finish projects, or catch up if they were out. If there's a test, they have more time to take it. They also get an extra day to do things outside of school or sleep more. Some students and teachers pay their bills with cards automatically, but others don't trust this and pay every month. Having Friday off is helpful for paying bills or shopping for food, especially for those who help their families with these tasks. But, there are downsides to a longer school day. Many students start work at 5 PM or right after school. They would lose work time if school ends later. For example, I work at 4 PM, and from Wednesday to Sunday, it's very busy. I finish work at 1 AM from Wednesday to Thursday. From Friday to Sunday, I work until 2:30 AM. When I get home, I eat and shower to get rid of the restaurant smell. It's already hard to wake up the next day without school being longer. If school hours are extended, waking up at 6 AM will be even harder for me."}
{"text_id": "41F11AC58B17", "output_essay": "Is learning online easier than going to school? Some people believe going to school helps them learn better. Others think online classes are better because they can study whenever they want. Many students prefer to get up early and go to school for help rather than not getting any help at all.\n\nGoing to school might be better for students because they can talk to others when they don't understand something. Students in online classes can get up when they want and do their work at a time that suits them. They can also video call their teachers to talk about homework or ask questions. At school, you must do all the work given to you.\n\nEveryone learns in their own way; some find it hard to understand their studies. Others speak a different language, and many have trouble understanding what they learn. We all have our own challenges, and we don't all learn the same. That's why we have both online classes and school. This way, people can choose the best way for them to learn. Going to school is good for many kids. It helps them understand the world better and can help them get a good job or join the military.\n\nWhether you learn online or go to school, it can help you in the future. It teaches you about different cultures, our country, how to handle money, and most importantly, it helps you learn to read and write."}

Countries like the United States and China work hard and focus on education and technology. They are the most advanced countries. But many countries do not focus on education. The New York Times says Afghanistan, Iraq, Uzbekistan, and Egypt have low education levels. Now, it is easier to learn. Students can take classes and join meetings online. They do not need to go to school or learning centers.\n\nStarting to learn is not difficult today. You just need to decide to do it, and then you can succeed. Some people cannot get an education for different reasons. The internet helps those who cannot move around easily, girls in Gulf countries who cannot leave their homes, and people who must work to support their families. For example, my sister is in college and works full time to help our family. She wants to be a dentist but cannot go to college because she is busy with work. Online classes let her learn and reach her goal while she works. A U.S. government report says 90 percent of immigrants are not rich and must work. Online classes help them learn and become better citizens.\n\nGetting to a place to learn can be hard, but online classes solve this. Many people cannot pay for their children's travel to school. Now, kids can learn from home because of online classes. They can use their skills to improve the world. In the past, people did not go to school because it was too far and they had no way to get there. Now, you can reach your goals from anywhere by going online. There are many videos on different topics. We all know that we need knowledge.\n\nOnline classes are also easy and useful. You can meet different people online and share ideas. You can choose your teacher and when to take classes. If you miss a class, you can check online later. If you do not understand something, you can ask your teacher online. No one should miss out with so many choices.\n\nIn the end, everyone in the world has the right to learn. There is no age limit for education. Knowledge lets us think, observe, and do things. It makes us strong and trustworthy. With online classes, we can learn anytime. Education is the key to success. All advanced countries know how important it is. Online classes help many students who cannot pay for college but still want to learn. They help students with other problems too. Online classes have removed these problems and opened up a world of learning."}
{"text_id": "73FC87C4FDF9", "output_essay": "I agree with the old British leader's idea that success is moving from one failure to another without giving up hope. I believe this is true for many reasons. People with hope always reach their goals: A hopeful person can do what they want because they always aim higher, and this leads to success. If a hopeful person fails, they try to do better the next time. This way, they reach a goal each time. Hopeful people work hard to meet their goals and don't make excuses. Failures teach us for the future. When you fail, you learn things that will help you later. We sometimes need to fail to succeed because we learn from our mistakes. It's not nice to learn by failing, but it's often how we find success in life. Hopeful people are full of energy. A hopeful person always wants to do things. They are full of energy and like to help others. Energetic people are usually happy and look good. To sum up, I agree with the British leader that success is about not giving up hope, even when you fail. I think failing is a part of life, and with hope, we can get past any failure we meet."}

Students can get information quickly and easily with smartphones. But, students today get lower scores on average. This is because smartphones can be both good and bad. So, using smartphones in school can hurt how students study. As more students use smartphones, many teachers let them use phones in class. This is to help find and learn about different subjects. But, most students use their phones for fun too. Phones make students lose focus in class. This is because things like social media, games, and other stuff take their attention away. Since smartphones came out, people can talk to others anywhere and anytime. They use the internet to do this. But students are young and can be easily swayed. They might pick up bad habits from all the information they see. If students have their phones in school, they depend on them too much. They use the internet too much. Schools have many other ways to learn. So, schools should control how students use smartphones."}
{"text_id": "2D47FB310B00", "output_essay": "I completely agree with the former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill. He said that before you can succeed, you must face many challenges. He also said to keep your excitement, even when you keep failing. I think this is true. When we fail and lose our excitement, we might give up on our dreams and the success we want. But if we stay excited, nothing can stop us. We will reach our goals and do what we dream of. Another point is that losing your excitement is like losing everything. Without it, you won't work towards your dreams. You'll just let them slip away. That's not good. You must always work hard for what you want and the success you hope for. The idea that 'success is moving from failure to failure without losing excitement' is very important. It means a lot in real life. We often quit when we fail. But this idea tells us to never quit, even in tough times. If we keep trying for success and believe in ourselves, we will get it. I wrote this because I agree with Churchill's words. They inspire anyone who reads them. They encourage you to keep going for your dreams, even when times are hard. They also explain what success really means. It's about facing many challenges before you can succeed. This idea is useful. It shows what to do to succeed and how key your excitement is. If you lose your excitement, you won't keep searching or fighting for success. I also learned that you must keep trying, no matter how many times you fail. If you don't fight for your dreams and success, no one else will. So, let's stay positive and keep fighting for what we want. You choose where you want to be and when to stop. Show the world that you can be a winner if you want to. To be successful, you need to stay excited and never give up on your goals."}

At home, students can easily be drawn to video games or other things. Also, some students might not take online classes seriously. They might skip classes more often.\n\nGoing to school is better for students. At school, they can make friends and meet new people. They can work together on projects, which may not happen in online classes. If teachers give students projects, the school usually has what they need, like books and computers. Plus, students can get help from their classmates or other teachers. Being around others at school makes learning more fun and interesting.\n\nSome classes need to be in person. For example, P.E. class and science classes with experiments. In biology, students look at cells under microscopes. These classes are not as good online because you can't do experiments. Students miss out on a lot.\n\nSchool offers programs and clubs that you don't get with online classes. Special courses at school are very helpful. Many students need these courses. They include group activities. Classes like photography also need to be at school. They are not just about ideas, like art and music classes.\n\nIn conclusion, online classes are not as useful as going to school. School has more to offer than online classes. It has more help, clubs, and resources for learning. So, students should go to school instead of taking classes online. They have more chances to do things at school."}
{"text_id": "867EF045947A", "output_essay": "\"Success is about moving from one failure to another without giving up.\" This quote means that we should keep trying even when we fail. If you fail a thousand times, it's fine. Don't be upset because one day you might achieve your dream. Failure is just a part of your life. I agree with Churchill's idea that failing is important when you want to succeed. This is because you learn more, stay hopeful, and learn to admit when you're wrong.\n\nFirst reason: learning more. When you fail, you learn things that can help you reach your dream and be successful. For example, if you had a bad boyfriend and the relationship ended, you wouldn't date someone like him again. You've learned from that bad time, and it helps you make better choices.\n\nSecond reason: staying hopeful. You should think of failure as something good. You can't let yourself feel sad or hopeless when things don't work out. For example, my mother wanted to drive, but she kept failing the driving test. She was upset at first, but she didn't give up and finally passed.\n\nFinal reason: admitting when you're wrong. It's hard to say it's your fault when you fail. For example, if you fail a test because you didn't study or listen in class, you might not want to say you were wrong. But when you start to admit your mistakes, you try harder not to fail again.\n\nIn conclusion, I think we should keep trying even when we fail because we live in a place with many chances to do something. Failing teaches us about life, helps us learn, and makes us admit our mistakes. We live in a place with many chances to do something."}

Second, the people who fail a lot are usually the most excited. They keep trying hard to reach their dreams, no matter what. They always stay excited and want to do well in life and get a good job. Third, everyone must know that failing is normal. They should keep going and work hard to succeed. It's tough, but they have to give it their all. Only people without goals give up when they fail. To sum up, I agree with Churchill. Failure is a big part of getting to success. Everyone fails before they succeed. The ones who fail the most are often the most excited.

This lets students learn from home and finish their studies whenever they want. I think this is a good choice for students. It helps those who want to plan for their future. \n\nOnline classes can help certain students. Some students want to take online classes because they can't go to a regular school. Students with babies have duties that keep them from going to school. They would like online classes. Also, people who work to pay for their needs could learn this way. In short, online classes or video calls are good for anyone who wants to finish high school or their studies. This can help them reach their goals. They can sign up for these courses. \n\nIt's good that schools offer learning from a distance. Many people don't finish high school or their studies for different reasons. For them, this is a helpful choice. They can learn, meet school requirements, and reach their goals. If they missed their chance before, now they have a new one. They can get their dream job or career. For those who can't get ready for their goals because of their situation, this makes life easier. They don't need to go to a regular school. In summary, it's a tool for those who really need and want it. \n\nI believe this will really help people who want to learn. There are many chances out there. But if we don't look for them or learn about them, how can we reach our goals? Goals won't come knocking on your door; we have to chase them. Some people wait for chances to come, but that's not how it works. We have to find them and do everything to reach them. If someone wants to succeed, there are many ways. If they don't, it's because they don't want to. When we really want to learn and succeed, we will use our rights, time, and voice to do what's needed. That will be our best day. If we don't work for ourselves, no one else will. This choice will help us become successful, if we want it. There are many options, but we won't reach our goals if we don't look for them."}
{"text_id": "AF6A4C253262", "output_essay": "Yes, students can gain from learning at home because they can take their time to think. They can learn more than at school. They can stay home without worrying about time. They can do their work or homework whenever they want, even on weekends, like Sunday morning or night. If students study online, it's better. They can be alone without noise or distractions. They don't have to wake up early, sleep well, and don't have to rush to the bus if they study online; they can be at home and work another job too.\n\nIf they study online or at home, they can be in a quiet place. For example, the library is very quiet; they can go there to do homework, classwork, or study for tests. A benefit of studying at home or online is that it's good in their last year of school; they can have fewer classes in their senior years. If they have four classes and only need to attend two each day, they will have more time to work and study what they want.\n\nA computer makes work easier; you can finish tasks quickly. Online classes are good for students because they can learn about the changing world. Our technology is very good and advanced; they can use a computer to work as fast as they want. Students can do their homework on the computer and send it to their teachers. Online classes are easier than regular school. They help students pass faster; in regular school, you study a class for a year, but online, you can finish in a week; it's more useful.\n\nOnline classes make students work alone; there's no one to help them or cheat. They are good for students who sleep in class, don't work, or play around. If they study online, they have to work because they paid for the class. Working alone helps them understand and learn. They should work alone to learn new ways. If they make a mistake, they will learn from it. By studying online, students will show and improve their computer skills without a teacher's help.\n\nIn conclusion, the choice some schools offer for online classes is a great chance for students to take action and study online. This choice will help them finish school early."}
{"text_id": "6D09A01DEF15", "output_essay": "Failing is key to success. Have you heard that many successful people think that after many failures, big success will come? This is true and has happened a lot in history. To succeed, you must work hard. Success won't just show up at your door. A successful person fails many times but keeps hoping. They often get more than they wanted because they work harder. Failing a lot doesn't make you dumb. It means you have a big goal. With a small goal, you wouldn't fail as much.\n\nFirst, to succeed, you need lots of experiences. You can't get experience without failing. When you fail, you learn from what went wrong. Then you try harder to solve your problems. You might fail again before you find the right solution. For example, if you're learning to drive, you need to take risks and practice. You might crash, but you'll learn and become a better driver. Practice also puts you in different situations. At first, you might fail, but with time, you'll get through them easily.\n\nAlso, someone who keeps hoping after many failures will become very strong. Strong people take risks and aren't afraid to lose. They keep fighting for their goals. Say you're a scientist studying white blood cells. You do many experiments that fail. But you don't give up. You try again and again until you find something new and important. This is how strong people succeed.\n\nIndeed, many great people started with nothing. They had big goals and kept trying despite failures. If they hadn't failed, they wouldn't have worked as hard. For example, many top soccer players began on dirt fields or small teams. They lost many times before winning and joining big teams. There's an Iranian player who started in an alley. He played for local teams and then the national team. But he wanted to play in Europe. After the World Cup, a top European team contacted him. Now he plays there. He told the BBC that not playing for his dream team felt like failing. But now he's happy to be on the team.\n\nIn conclusion, Winston Churchill said, 'Success is going from failure to failure without losing enthusiasm.' To succeed, you'll face failures like stop signs. They might stop you for a bit, but then you move closer to your goal. Turning back at each stop sign takes you away from your goal. Keep your enthusiasm, and by working hard, you'll get closer to success."}

I don't think students will gain from taking classes from home or online because this will make them lonely. Nothing convinces me to support this idea. I believe that learning in person, seeing the teacher explain things, helps you learn better. Schools also have clubs for hobbies and culture that you might like because they help with talent. First, students can't make friends at home. At school, they can make many friends. You can also meet your favorite teachers. Second, there's no good reason for students to stay home. Some say getting up at 6 am is tough, and I agree. But it's not worse than being home all day and getting lazy. Getting up early makes the brain alert and ready to learn faster. Some might say homework is a problem. But they can do it during study periods or lunch. Online schools give homework too. Third, some students won't do any work at home. My school had a virtual learning day on Monday. The truth is, no one did the work the teacher put on the app called Schoology. Learning at school is better, in my view.

I am for the four-day school week with two more hours each day because it will save energy and make things better. Students will take an extra class, and they will learn more each day because they will spend more time at school, and people like being in school to learn. It will help our environment and change our lives; we need to look after our environment because we live in it.\n\nFirst, saving energy will help us keep a clean environment and there will be less dirty air. It would be good for a country to save energy so they can protect animals. Dirty air can make people sick, and it happens when we use too much energy. Using too much energy can hurt nature, animals, and people. Saving things like food could also cut down on energy use. By using less energy, the government could lower taxes on other things. If we didn't use energy for just one day, it would be great; people would spend time with their families.\n\nSecond, if students only go to school for four days a week and stay two hours longer, they can take an extra class. It will help them learn quicker because they will be at school for ten hours. Students will have more time to work on things in school, or they can get help if they need it. They like to stay longer in school so they don't have to go home, and some students love being at school because it feels like a second home to them. If a student takes an extra class, he or she might finish school with better grades. Students could also spend more time with their counselor to talk about things or if they have problems.\n\nFinally, by not using too much energy, we keep our environment clean and fresh. Our environment matters to us because bad air can kill us. It is important to many people to save resources so they can have a nice environment. The cleaner we keep our environment, the healthier our planet will be. If everyone started to save resources, our surroundings could be much cleaner. The less we use energy and things, the better it will be for our community. People would like to have a wonderful environment.\n\nPeople should think about the four-day school week because it will help them save a lot and it will make a big difference in our society. Society matters to us because the more we save energy and things, the better it will be for our health. If schools are open for four days a week, it would be easier for many people and it would save a lot of energy and things."}
{"text_id": "2390768D5D67", "output_essay": "I think my school should keep the day the same length, not make it two hours longer. Most students are already tired after seven hours. They find it hard to pay attention. They won't have enough time to be with their families. I also think having school only four days a week is not good. It will make some parents who work on weekdays worry. They may be afraid to leave their kids alone at home because some kids can't look after themselves. They might do something wrong and get into big trouble. \n\nThe first reason is that students won't have enough time for homework, which could make their grades drop. They might get scared if they have bad grades, and some parents get very upset when their kids don't do well. They might take away phones, games, and other fun things. Students will say it's the school's fault because of the longer days. They'll feel stressed and can't focus after studying for seven hours. It's not right that they get in trouble with their parents because of this. \n\nThe second reason a four-day school week is a bad idea is that students might forget what they learned. They might not do well on tests because it's harder to focus at home. Without someone to encourage them, like a teacher, they might put off their work to play with friends. By the end of the day, they haven't done anything. They forget their tasks. Not all students can look after themselves, and some parents have to work. They'll need to find someone they trust to watch their kids, which can be hard and costly. Bad things can happen if kids are left alone, especially if they don't have good friends. It also costs more because kids eat more at home and parents have to pay for childcare. \n\nThe third reason we shouldn't make the school day longer is that we need time with our loved ones. Too much of anything, even school, can be boring. We're used to our current schedule, and changing it would make us all feel strange and eager to go home. Teachers won't have enough time to mark papers. Students will be more stressed because they won't have time to relax, play, or nap. \n\nIn conclusion, after seven hours, it's hard for students and teachers to focus. Students need time for homework, and teachers need time to mark work. We all need time with our loved ones. It's better to go to school five days a week because we learn more and don't forget as much. I think we should keep our schedule the way it is because we're comfortable with it."}

I think summer is better. We can sleep longer, there's no school, and we can do lots of things outside. First, we can sleep longer. In summer, we can wake up late and spend more time at home with our family. Then, we can help around the house and do other things at home. Next, there's no school. This means we have more time for family or kids. If you have kids, you can spend more time with them. With no school, there's no homework or projects. So, people can use their time for different things. Also, we can do lots of things outside. In summer, people can go out and do what they like.

And you have to be good at managing your time, starting and ending class when you should. But sometimes, you have other things to do, and sticking to a schedule can be tough. \n\nWhen people take classes online, they have to treat it like they are really at school. Some classes are tougher than others. If they find a topic hard, they need to find help on their own. They might look online or watch YouTube videos. This is because they don't have a teacher or classmates nearby to help. It's usually better to have people around. They can explain things in a way that's easier to understand. But this isn't something you get when you learn from home. \n\nTalking to people is another issue. There are many different cultures. If you don't have classmates to talk to, you might feel strange or shy when you meet people outside. Or you might seem rude without meaning to. Sometimes, it's the opposite. Some students want to go to school to meet people. But their parents want them to stay home for school. This can make students feel lonely and lose their social skills. \n\nOnline school has its own timetable. Students need to be on time for class. They need to finish all the work for the day.

This could happen if you pick your classes carefully, and don't take extra ones that won't help you. Art should not be a required class in schools because there are many other classes that could help you more. They can give you information and ideas about what you are interested in. Students should be able to choose art as an extra class, and there are three reasons for this.\n\nFirst, not all students like or are interested in art. Some students prefer harder classes like Sociology or Languages. They want to think and work harder than they would in an art class. This can make them feel good and help them succeed in life. For example, my last year of high school was hard because I chose classes like AP Chemistry and Pre-Calculus. I liked these classes. They made me work hard and keep trying until I reached my goal. Some students want to get better at something hard that makes them feel proud. Art won't help everyone get better because each student has different goals, and art might not be one of them. Making students take art can get in the way of their goals. Art should be an extra class so students can pick what they are good at and what they think will help them succeed.\n\nSecond, it depends on the student's future job. Students would take classes that match their future goals. Making art a must limits their choices and stops them from taking classes that would help them more. For example, in ninth grade, my school made me take art. They didn't ask if I liked it or if it was important for my future job. This was hard for me because I felt I was wasting my time in art class. I could have spent that time on something I liked or something that would help me more. Students should be able to choose art as an extra class. This way, they know which classes will help them have a successful future. Putting a lot of effort into something you won't need can be bad because you lose time that could be used better. Students should think about their future because even small things can help them later.\n\nLastly, most students don't like school because it gives them extra work they don't need, like Art. But if the school lets them choose, students will make choices that help them enjoy school and succeed. For example, when I was in seventh grade, I didn't like school because I couldn't choose any extra classes. This made me hate school and see all my classes as hard. Sometimes students need a break so they can keep going. Students should pick what they want, not just what the school wants. This makes students feel free and helps them enjoy school. Art isn't so important that everyone must take it. What's important is the student and how to make them feel good so they can become successful and maybe change the world. This can happen by letting them think carefully and giving them some freedom.\n\nSome people might say students must take an art class because art is everywhere and they will need it. But art could be less important in life. Sometimes art won't help you reach your goal. Students should be able to pick classes that will really help them later and make them smarter. Students should be able to choose art as an extra class, not because they have to, so they can do what they like and maybe do better in the future."}

For example, they turn on the shower and leave the water running even when they're not in it. This wastes water and energy. In places like Africa, people really need water. They don't have enough food or showers like we do. We should not waste water. For example, some people turn on the shower and waste water while they are still using the toilet or their phone. We should value the water and resources we have at home. I think working 4 days a week has good and bad points. It's good because some people can live on their pay for 4 days of work. But others can't because they have bills and need to buy food. So, working more than 4 days can be good for them. About school, I don't think we should go for only 4 days. We need education for our future. Schools should have us come 5 days a week. With only 4 days, we would miss out on learning. We need education for everything, even with animals. More school days can help us succeed in the future. Education, being respectful, and nice to others are important for the future."}

That's what it means to me.\n\nMy team and I were at a park. It was night. We practiced our armed drill because we have a contest tomorrow. It's our last drill team contest. We were making mistakes. We were not balanced, and our rifles were not straight. But we did not stop. We kept trying until we did it right. For us, showing up every Friday is key. We think we can reach our goal if we do this.\n\nI never quit what I start, even at work. Why? Because I want to finish what I begin. I always tell myself, 'Don't quit, keep going.' I want to reach my future goals. Failing is not what I choose; winning is. Try to do what you've started or get a good spot in something. This could be at work or in school.\n\nIf someone is very worried and says they can't do it, I say, 'Don't quit until you reach your goal.' If a person keeps trying, they will win because they didn't quit. If you don't stop, you'll win in what you want to do. That's what makes me happy. I tell people to do their best.

Success doesn't always mean being the best because it's tough to stay at the top all the time. Making mistakes shouldn't be a reason to tease someone because it can hurt their feelings.\n\nOne reason mistakes are not just about losing is that sometimes people don't know how to do things right. They feel like they have failed. When people need help, others should not laugh at them. If someone can't do something, they may get angry at themselves and even hurt themselves.\n\nAnother reason is that success doesn't always mean being the best. It's hard to always be at the top. Everyone can have a good day, but not always. People often want others to think they can do anything.

{"text_id": "72DF5D84477A", "output_essay": "Many students like to take online classes to learn more. Why do they pick online classes over going to school every day? They see many good things about online classes. First, in the classroom, there are things that take their attention away; students often get sidetracked by friends while the teacher is speaking. Second, getting to school is a big deal because many students live far from school. Also, students earn the same credit from online classes as they would from being in the school class. In a lot of schools, students can choose online classes or in-person classes. Online classes let students work without friends bothering them. For example, in the classroom, some students talk and bother others when the teacher is teaching. But in online classes, it's just the teacher, and no one else is there to bother them. Also, students can ask the teacher questions if they don't understand something. In the past ten years, things like phones and computer games have distracted students. But some schools use this technology to offer online classes. This lets students learn from home. They can watch class videos on their phones. This helps many students learn and get ready for the future. The best part about online classes is that students get their credit just like they would in a regular class. Last year, I had two choices: go to a place to learn about marketing or take an online course. This chance is great because students can learn online and still get the same credit as if they went to the place. Another good thing is that in video calls, students can rewatch parts of the video if they need to. Also, students don't have to stress about getting to school. Many students are late because the bus is late, and they miss the teacher's lesson. In the countryside, schools are far from where students live. So, with online classes, this isn't a problem. They just need to turn on their computer and join the class. To sum up, online classes are a good choice for students. They get the same credit as if they were in the school. They don't have to worry about getting to school or being late because of traffic. And there's nothing in an online class to take their attention away. Plus, the online class is just like a regular school class. Lastly, students find good things when they sign up for online classes."}

Failing is needed to succeed for many reasons. For example, when I play video games online with friends, we make a team. We plan to beat the other players and win. But we keep losing. Some friends want to give up because we lose. I tell them that losing shows us what's wrong with our team. The problem was the plan. One friend didn't stick to it and played alone. I said we could win if he worked with us. Then we won a lot because we followed the plan and worked as a team. Another time, in school, I had a hard math class. The teacher gave us many tests. It was hard for me. I failed a test and thought I couldn't pass math. But I kept trying. I told myself I had to pass. I believed I could do it. I practiced a lot, worked on problems with the teacher, and did homework at home. I studied to understand the lesson and get ready for the next test. Then, I got a B+ on a test and an A on another. This was because I worked hard and believed in myself. To end, failing doesn't mean you are a failure.

I believe this for several reasons. First, success isn't easy; it takes a lot of hard work. Success can be whatever you want it to be. Believing in yourself is key. If you believe you can, you will. Many people get to success by working hard, putting in effort, and showing they can do it. Success is up to you. It can show up in many ways, like a dream, goal, or wish. It's something you work for. We decide if we want to be successful. Success doesn't have to be a huge thing. It can be small but still very important. It starts with a dream that, with hard work, can come true. Success can be any goal you have, like getting a job you want. Everyone can get there if they work hard and show they can. Some people, like the British Prime Minister, think success is close to failure. They say not everyone can be successful. They believe success is a big goal that not everyone reaches. When people fail on their way to success, they feel like they're just moving from one failure to another. So, they think not everyone can be successful. This happens because they give up after failing once. They think they can't succeed after a first failure. But I think success is something we can all get to. It's not about moving from failure to failure. To be successful, the most important thing is to never give up. Keep going, even when things are tough. Keep trying—that's how we can all be successful. Success is about chasing your goals and not stopping until you reach them. Work hard and show everyone, including yourself, that you can do it. Have faith. Believe in yourself. Anything is possible if you believe and keep trying without giving up."}
{"text_id": "09BEB819F5B9", "output_essay": "Should your school make the school day two hours longer? I think it's a good idea to have school for four days a week with longer days. First, going to school teaches us to be on time and to take our classes seriously. This helps us get better every day. School is where we learn to be good people for the future. We need to go to class, do our homework, and be on time. This teaches us to be responsible and to be good people with good goals. Also, having a longer school day can help us save energy and do more in class. With a ten-hour school day, we can spend more time on important things. We can take many steps to reach our goals. With two extra hours, we can learn more and be more active in class. For example, in class, we can do our homework and solve problems to get good grades. Next, I agree with going to school for four days with longer days. This helps students focus and is good for our education. Schools can save money on gas, and we can finish all our class hours. Plus, having a day off lets us do more homework and get great grades. The weekend is too short to do everything, like homework and spending time with family. For example, with two more hours, we can focus better and do well on tests. Having four days to do homework, take notes, and enjoy family time is good. It saves on transportation costs, and we still get the same amount of school time. I always focus on my future goals. School is the start of our future. I try to learn more and set goals to be a better person, find a good job, and be happy. Some companies work for four days with ten-hour days. Using your time well, taking notes, and learning is key to a better life. Always try to learn from the extra two hours and practice at home. For example, taking notes at home for tests or homework is a smart choice. In conclusion, we should think about making the school day two hours longer and having a four-day week. We need to think about how we use our time every day for a good future. Remember, school is the best way to get a good job and a successful career."}

It would help those who work on weekends. They could use the extra day to catch up on schoolwork they missed during the week.

My friends who like to draw also don't have time because of their jobs. They only have time to do their homework. If we had an extra day off, students who work on weekends could do things they can't do on weekdays. This schedule could also be good for teachers. They could spend more time with their families or look at student work. But there could be problems. Some students might get bored. Having longer school days might make some students feel stressed or anxious. Students who don't like school might try to skip the longer days. This means the school would have to work harder to keep students from skipping. Some students might like the four-day week, but others might not. We should try it to see if it helps or hurts students. I think most students would like it. I have many friends who work during the week and on weekends. They struggle to find time for school work.

Everyone can fail; nobody is perfect. No one likes to fail, but when we do, we get smarter and stronger. If you fail once, you learn for next time so you won't fail again. But I don't agree with the idea that 'success is moving from one failure to another without losing excitement.' I don't believe that failing makes you a failure. We fail often, but that doesn't mean we are failures. We should keep our excitement and get better than we are now.\n\nSome people think life is not about failing.

If you don't pass a class, you might have to take it again next year or in summer school. Counselors often don't want to change schedules because they think art, music, or drama credits are important. This can upset students, especially if counselors don't help. Also, if a student fails, counselors can get mad at them.\n\nSchools offer many different classes; you don't have to take just music, drama, or art. You can try cooking, Spanish, other languages, or gym.\n\nI find art, music, or drama classes boring because the teachers don't seem to care, are not patient, and are slow. This makes the class not fun. Teachers should try to make classes more interesting and change things up every year. For example, I had already finished Art 1 and Art 2, but my counselor put me in Art 1 again. After I talked to her, she took me out of the class because I didn't need it.\n\nI've never taken a music class because I don't want to play instruments. It's not for me.

I've had a tough time in school, hung out with the wrong friends, and missed a lot of classes. These things had bad results. I failed my first year of high school. This put me behind and it was hard to stay motivated. I had to change schools every two years because of family issues. This became so normal that I didn't want to try, knowing I'd move again. My grades were bad. Then, in my third year of high school, I moved once more. I saw how far behind I was and decided to work hard at school. I worked very hard in every class and studied for every test. I almost gave up because I kept failing. But I kept asking for help and finally got it. With help, I got better at studying and remembering things. These small changes helped a lot. Even though waking up early for school is hard, I made sure to sleep well and be ready for each day. Now, I'm in my last year of high school. It's a stressful time because you have to decide on a career. I want to join the military.

Learning from home is great because you don't have to wake up early, dress up, or deal with other students and their problems at school. \n\nLearning at home is cozy. Some students choose this because they are pregnant, move a lot, or get nervous talking to others at school. For me, going to school is not a good choice. I wish I could take online classes or talk to a teacher on a video call. I get nervous at school. I worry that people judge me or talk about me if I don't do homework or get something wrong. Meeting new people makes me nervous and uncomfortable. This makes me not want to go to school. I haven't asked my parents about online classes because I have good friends and it's my last year in high school. I believe I can finish, and so can others. \n\nI've seen that things that distract you can make it hard to learn. There are many distractions at school. Problems with other students are the worst. They can really change how you feel about learning. In my second year of high school, my friend had a bad time that shows this. We got a new student. My teacher asked my friend to help him feel welcome. Soon, some girls said mean things to my friend and the new student. My friend went home crying. Later, she told me she would do online school to focus on her work. I think that was the best choice for her. \n\nWhen a teacher talks to a big class, it can be hard to understand. Talking to a teacher one-on-one through a video call can help you learn better. With these reasons and stories, I think online learning is a good choice for some students."}
{"text_id": "876A8C32BB9C", "output_essay": "Winston Churchill, a past leader of Britain, once said, \"Success is moving from one failure to another without losing your excitement.\" Is failing important in trying to succeed?\n\nI think that Winston Churchill was right. Success can happen in many ways but always includes one main thing: failure leads to success.\n\nOne reason I agree is that when you fail many times, you learn one reason why it didn't work. Look at President Abraham Lincoln. Before he became president, he lost two elections. Each time he lost, he tried a new way to win. He had to connect with what people wanted and dreamed about.\n\nSuccess grows from failure; here's an example: I was on the wrestling team and lost a lot in practice. This helped me learn all the moves my teammates used. In my weight group, I kept getting better, even though I was still losing. I worked so hard that in my first real match, I was chosen to start because I had become stronger than my teammate. I was the best in my group in every match I fought.\n\nThis is why I agree with Winston Churchill. I believe that failing turns into success. Failing is always an important part, and you shouldn't feel bad about it."}
{"text_id": "76156CCBF662", "output_essay": "Elective classes might not look important but they can help students learn new things. Some like to draw, others like to dance. I believe these classes are important for school. Some classes help students get the credits they need to finish school. Elective classes add to these credits. For example, classes that give credits include Art Foundations, Dance, Intermediate Band, and Chorus. There are more classes too. If students take these classes, they can help them pass the year. In school, we have many classes that help, but sometimes students don't like the electives. They skip them and then they fail. They can't finish school because they don't have enough credits. Also, Army is a good elective class, but not everyone likes it. Maybe they don't like the shoes, jacket, or pants. But the school has many classes that can help students pass the year. For example, I have an art class. I don't really like art, but it helps me pass. The teacher is very nice. He is patient with us and never gets mad. So, elective classes are not always bad. Sometimes students just don't want to study or work hard. They want things to be easy. If students want to finish school, we need to be on time, do our homework, take part in class, and listen to the teachers. We must follow the school rules, be friendly, and go to every class. If we do these things, we can be good students. When the year ends, we can finish school because we followed the rules, did what the teachers said, and were patient, responsible, and respectful."}
{"text_id": "9E987A93FC75", "output_essay": "Failing is important for our success. We all have faced problems at some point. Some failures are big, others are small. Failing can change our lives and help us improve. Everyone fails in different ways. It could be in school, with friends, or in other areas. We think failing is important. But some people try to be perfect and don't believe in failing. Failing is like making a mistake that happens often. It's tough when we fail at something we worked hard for or really wanted. Like doing badly in classes we like, or not finishing high school. Failing shows us how to keep going or try again. It also tells us to keep trying until we make it. Some failures are hard to accept. Like when you love someone and want to tell them, but they are with someone else. It's hard to let go. Some people say failing helps us see things differently. It pushes us to work harder for what we want. I think failing is like learning to ride a bike. You might fall but you get back up. Failing is also like climbing a tree to get mangoes. It's about working hard to reach a goal. Our wins can be like mangoes. Some are sweet, some are sour. Sometimes we need help, other times we do it alone. But our hard work will pay off or make us happy. Failing is a step towards success. It makes us better, teaches us to keep trying, and helps us see new things. Failing is needed to stay hopeful and not quit. It reminds us that making mistakes is normal."}

Do I agree with him? Yes, I do agree with Winston Churchill. Winston Churchill did not want his ministers or people to fail because they couldn't improve. These people don't want failure; they aim to get better every day. As ministers, they stand for God and are different because of their faith. They want to keep their excitement to progress in their work. A minister will remove the failures they don't want because these failures can make them less excited. Ministers understand that failure tries to take away their excitement and stop them and their people from advancing. The enemy wants to halt their progress. But God empowers the minister and the church to be stronger than the enemy. God strengthens His followers to believe in Him. The followers must be stronger than the enemy who can harm those with faith. God gives His people more strength to overcome the enemy. The church's minister is strong through God. He wants to prevent people from losing their excitement to follow Jesus. For him, it's very important to keep believing and growing stronger because Jesus will return. They have to fight for their salvation. Minister Winston doesn't want his people to lose their excitement for Jesus. Every night, they pray for their minister, his family, and the church. He strives to improve for God. The minister hopes that God is always with his church to guard them against the enemy. This belief keeps the people going; they are stronger because God shares His spirit and supports His followers. God battles for them. They trust in a God who makes everything possible for believers. He is unique because He made everything we see. It's hard for people to keep going because the enemy can be very strong, but they always have faith in Jesus. To sum up, we understand that the British leader Winston Churchill keeps facing failures to remove them from their church."}

But not everything works like that; different things have different jobs or create something people agree on.\n\nFirst, not everyone thinks the same or agrees on the same things. Some people only care about their own future, not others'. There are good and bad people in the world. Sometimes, bad people try to hurt good ones. Good people may have trouble because they don't want to call the bad actions 'crimes'.\n\nSecond, the person who said this should give clear reasons to others. As a leader, you must speak clearly and set a good example for your city, county, or state. When a leader is a good example, people live well together. They have good reasons to help each other. A community that sticks together is strong.\n\nThird, to get attention, you don't need to be perfect at speaking to inspire others. Not everyone can be powerful in a community. Some want to be a school principal or a country's president. Being a president or in charge of others is hard. It's tough to keep control and everyone's attention.\n\nIn conclusion, leaders of a country or school must give good reasons and talk clearly to people. They should show a good way so others can find better chances to improve."}
{"text_id": "916C937AF222", "output_essay": "Art is important in our lives. It helps to get rid of bad feelings and bring in good ones. Whether it's acting, music, or painting, these things let us show our emotions without talking. Art also shows off skills. This makes us wonder: should we have to take an art class? I think we should because some students need to find their skills, students should learn why art matters, and finding their skills can change their lives. First, many people don't know their own skills. They might think art or acting is too hard and that they can't do it, but that's not true. For example, if I see a great drawing, I might think only a skilled artist can make that. But if I watch how the artist works from the start, I start to think I could do it too. Artists and musicians often seem calm and give off good vibes because they see the world differently. So, we need to find our skills to do things we love and stay positive. Also, we must see how important art is. Imagine a world with no art; it would be boring. For example, acting is part of everyone's life; most homes have a TV, YouTube, or Netflix. Without art, there would be no museums, no beautiful buildings, or designs. Even photos are important; without them, we wouldn't have memories with friends and family. Everyone shows their skills in their own way. In photos, each photographer has their own style that grabs people's attention. So, art is key in our lives, and we can't picture a world without it. Some might say that normal classes are more important than art, especially for students who are finishing school early or taking advanced classes. But when they find their skills, they might change their minds. For example, my friend liked math and wanted to be an engineer. But after a photography class, he found his skill in taking pictures and chose to become a photographer. Another person loved acting after college and left his job to work in acting. He is now a well-known writer for plays. In the end, high schools should make students take an art class because everyone has an art skill they need to find and use. Everyone needs to know how important their skill is and how it can change the world. Finding our skills can change our lives and jobs. Art makes us happy and improves our lives."}
{"text_id": "8CB337D8D65C", "output_essay": "Should students be allowed to learn at home? I think students should learn at home because there are fewer things to distract them than in regular schools. I say this because schools have many things that take away attention. Students might not learn well or might fail because of this. For instance, students often get to class late because they spend too much time with friends and don't watch the clock. When they are late, they miss learning and also stop others from focusing. Learning at home is good because there is no rule about when to be there. Students can learn quicker. Some students are late to school because they wake up late. Being late means missing lessons and bothering others who are trying to learn. At home, you can learn without waiting for others. If one student doesn't understand something, the whole class has to wait. This slows everyone down. But, there are also reasons why learning at home might not be good. One reason is that at home, students might not have a set time to study. They might wake up late and not study much. Also, at home, things around them might be too familiar and cause them to lose focus. In the end, these are my thoughts on why students should be allowed to learn at home."}

A cell phone is a small tool that can give students lots of information. You can find many things online, and you don't need to buy paper or carry heavy books anymore.\n\nOne reason is that cell phones give students lots of information. Students can look up things they want to know anywhere. They can find answers easily. It's good to have a small tool that helps you everywhere. You don't have to wonder about things you don't know. You just use your cell phone and ask.\n\nAnother reason is that you can find many helpful things online, like video sites that teach you or apps made for learning. You can go to YouTube and watch videos about science, math, and history. There are also apps like BrainPOP for learning. These things can teach you a lot in class.\n\nThe last reason is that cell phones save you money and are better for the environment. You don't need to buy paper anymore. You can get all the information on your cell phone. Another plus is that you don't have to carry heavy books that can hurt your back. Now, everything is on your cell phone and you can get to it anytime. So, you don't need to carry books.

{"text_id": "31FB79E16333", "output_essay": "Cheating, bullying, and cellphone sexual abuse are common problems in schools. Students might misuse their cellphones because they don't fully understand their duties. Using a phone in class takes attention away from schoolwork. This leads to late or unfinished assignments because students focus on their phones instead of the lesson. Even though phones are a big distraction, a study in California found that one in five students cheats on tests with their phones. Still, if there's an emergency, students can use the school office phone. This means they don't need to keep their phones with them. It's hard for students to give up their phones because they're used to them. But if schools ban phones, students will learn to manage without them. Phones interrupt classes and stop students from paying attention to the teacher. For example, students might text, play games, or take calls, even when the teacher is in charge. This means the best rule is to not allow phones in class. Students can keep their phones outside class. They should hand them in at the office when they come in. They can get them back at lunch or after school. Often, fights in class happen because of phones. For example, playing music loudly can bother other students. Also, when students use their phones, they don't finish their work and lose interest in their lessons. Some students say it's fine to have a phone if it's put away. But a study at the University of Arizona showed that phones distract students a lot. Students with phones nearby only paid attention about 40% of the time. Those without phones paid attention 85% of the time. This shows that to stop distractions, we need to keep phones out of the classroom. Phones hurt students' focus, and having online work is no excuse. Classrooms have laptops for that. In short, students don't need phones in class. The bad things about phones are worse than the good things. In the end, phones are bad for students in class. They cause distractions and annoyance."}

Many people who have done well have failed a lot. Famous sports stars like Cristiano Ronaldo, Messi, Michael Jordan, and LeBron James have all failed many times before they were successful. For instance, Cristiano Ronaldo had to move away from Portugal and his family when he was young. He did this to join a top football team in Europe, Manchester United. \n\nThere are billions of people in the world who are too afraid to fail. Why? Because they are scared of what others will think or they don't want to feel stressed. Michael Jordan was not scared of failing. Every time he missed a shot in basketball, he would keep trying until he scored. \n\nEveryone wants to do well, but we all have one big dream. It might be to collect money for people in need or to be a pro soccer player. Think about Steve Jobs and the iPhone. If he had never made the iPhone, we wouldn't have it today.

Also, cell phones in class can stop students from acting out. The school can check what students are looking at, like which websites they go to when they are not busy.\n\nSecond, it is easy to use. It helps save time when looking for exact information online. It gives different answers at the same time as talking with classmates and teachers. Teachers can make sure everyone is learning the same thing.\n\nThird, it is useful. You just type or speak what you want to know, and you get answers right away.

But, having to stay in class longer might upset students. Not everyone thinks this is true. A longer weekend could help students study more for tests. More hours in school could mean learning more, getting better grades, and understanding lessons. If students have more time with friends, they can work on school projects together. Some people also think that more time with friends at school is fun. They say we need a four-day school week to reduce stress for students. But this idea has problems. On weekends, students don't want to study. They think they have enough time and would rather spend time with friends or family. Being in school for two more hours could make them too tired and stressed. They might not listen to their teachers. Students can get help from friends at home; they don't need to be at school for that. It's also important to spend time with family. Family is more supportive than friends and should come first. A four-day school week is not needed. Two extra hours in school would just make students more stressed and tired. Keeping students in class too long can make them anxious. A four-day school week might seem like a way to reduce stress. But students will find two extra hours too tiring. Schools already have extra time like 'Cougar Time' or 'Lion Time.'

I think that students would pay more attention if they studied at home because many of them have jobs, bills, and families to take care of.\n\nOne reason why it's good for students to study from home is that they have busy lives outside of school. If they went to school, they would hardly be at home. They need to make their own decisions, do their own things, and create their own future. Most students work long hours and get home late. They wouldn't want to get up early for school the next morning.\n\nAnother reason is that students have to pay for things. They need to buy stuff, pay for their bills, food, and housing. If they don't pay for these things, they can't reach their goals or live without problems. To avoid debt, they have to work to afford what they need.\n\nLastly, some students have families in their home countries. They help them and send them money. The more they earn, the better, because they support not just their parents but themselves too. We are all different students with our own reasons and goals.\n\nAs you can see, people think in different ways and have their own reasons.

I would use this time for volunteer work, playing basketball and ping-pong with friends. I could also do my homework or study for tests. Then, I'd still have time for my own things. Plus, I get a two-day weekend to rest. This schedule is flexible and lets me do what I want, which is good. Some people might say a longer weekend is better.

Third, it helps students who have trouble getting to school. But, some parents think their kids should be in school like everyone else and that schools need to find other ways to help these students.\n\nI believe this program will really help students who are sick. For example, my sister had leg problems and it was hard for her to go to school every day. If this program was around four years ago, it would have helped her a lot. Also, sick students at my school were excited about this program because it's hard for them to go to school when they're not feeling well.

Keep your excitement. It helps you think quickly and make good choices. My third point is that success needs hard work. It's not easy and takes time. You have to be at your best. If not, you might lose focus. Hard work will be worth it in the end. But don't forget all the effort you've already put in and what you still need to do.

We can't quit! When we start something, we should expect to fail. When I moved to America, I didn't speak English. I couldn't work or go to school. Then I chose to learn English. After a year, I felt no progress because I couldn't understand others. But I kept learning. I used YouTube to teach myself. Slowly, I began to understand a bit, but I couldn't talk. I tried hard to listen and speak well. I didn't stop; I kept learning. Over time, I got better at speaking and listening. I went to school, got a job, and made friends. In Ethiopia, I didn't like school and didn't get education. My younger brother told me to study and do well. I said it was impossible because I knew nothing about education. He told me to just try. I agreed and started studying, but it was tough. I told my brother I couldn't do it. He offered to help. We studied together. Still, I didn't do well, and my brother was upset. But I was learning how to study and understand the education system. I got used to doing homework and classwork alone. After much practice, tests got easier. At last, I was second best in my class. Then I kept studying and doing well. I started to love school too. Failing is part of success. If you fail at first, just keep trying. Never quit! So, I believe what Churchill said, 'Success is going from one failure to another without losing your excitement.'"}

This would impact not just students but everyone involved.\n\nI think schools should not make their days longer because the school day would be two hours more. Most students are busy during this time. For example, some students play sports, others work, many want to spend time with their families, and they all have homework. There are many reasons. If teachers stayed later at school, they would end their day very late. School staff would also finish late, leaving them little time for themselves. On the other hand, one good thing is that school would happen for only four days a week. This means a three-day weekend, giving more time for fun and family. Another good point is that students would come to school more rested and less tired. This is true for teachers and staff too. Also, if students went to school just four days a week, it would save energy and resources like some businesses do.\n\nIn the end, these are the good and bad points of longer school days. Even though there are some good things, school days should stay the same. Changing them could cause problems."}

If they don't like them, the classes will be a waste of time and won't help. For example, a student who loves sports won't get anything from a drama class. He'll be bored. It won't be useful for him.

I don't think my school should do this and make each day two hours longer. This is because students will have less time with their families during the week, less time to do homework, and less or no time for school activities.\n\nStudents will have less family time during the week. Most students like to spend time with their families. They learn from their parents that family is very important. I want to spend time with my grandmother. She is staying with my aunt and is visiting us in the United States. I will miss the good times with her, talking about my home country, old friends, and my brothers and sisters in El Salvador. If school is two hours longer, I won't have time to see her and enjoy our talks. She will go back to El Salvador soon. I will get home from school too late, and my mom gets home late from work. She can't take me to see my grandma. I work on weekends because my sister and I only live with our mom. We don't get help from our dads, so I need to help pay the bills. Also, students won't have time to do their homework.\n\nHomework is important for good grades and learning what we do in class. If we get home late, we won't have enough time for homework. We need to eat and rest. For example, I get home, change clothes, cook for my sister and me, and help my mom with housework. I rest because I'm tired. I'm in my last year of high school and have a lot to do. I'm thinking about college and what to do after high school. My body and mind are tired and stressed. Then I do my homework, and it's already late. It's hard for students if school is longer.\n\nAlso, students will have less time for school activities. Schools want students to join sports, clubs, and get extra help after school. Many students at Generic_School play sports. They love their sports. If school is two hours longer, it will be too late for them to play. They might not have enough time to practice. My grandmother says, \"practice makes the master.\" This means you need to practice a lot to be good at what you love. Some parents don't want their kids out late. If school ends later, sports practice will end too late. Students will get home at night. Many great athletes get noticed in high school. Sponsors watch them play. If they're good, they get sponsored. Athletes need to practice and play to get better. With less time after school, they can't practice, do homework, rest, and enjoy being young.\n\nSome people say schools should have a four-day week because there's more time to learn and study on weekends. But they're wrong. They forget that students can use the extra day to ask questions and get help from teachers. Also, many students work on weekends. They don't have time to study because they need to work to help their families. For all these reasons, the school should not have a four-day week and make the day two hours longer."}

But some say, \"Success is moving from one failure to another without losing excitement.\" This idea can help or hurt people. It helps if it makes people keep trying. But it hurts if people get tired and stop trying after failing. If they give up, they won't know if they could have succeeded the next time. I think this is a big problem. We should use our failures to keep us going. For example, imagine it's your last year in high school and you want to graduate. You try your best, but you fail English in the second quarter. You need an A, not an F. Even though it's your last year, you don't give up. You try harder in the third quarter. You use your failure to push you to do better. Success is all around us - in stores, sports, and jobs. Stores show success when they grow from small shops to big businesses. Even when they make mistakes, they keep going. They don't give up. In sports, teams play to win. Take soccer, for example. Teams in Europe compete to be the best. They play in the Champions League. The best team wins. Real Madrid has won for three years. They show success. Some people think failing means you should stop and not try again. They think if you fail at the start, you'll fail at the end. These people don't push themselves. They don't reach their goals. They stay the same. I believe it's important to listen to people who have already succeeded. They can give advice to help you reach your goals. Their advice can help you keep going when you're stuck. If you fail, don't give up. Use that failure to climb higher and never stop."}

Failing is when you don't go to school to learn, even though you can, while some can't. Failing is when you spend too much time on games, social media, and with friends. Failing is when you are lazy.\n\nFailing is not going to school when you can. School is very important; to succeed, you need to go and learn. Some go to school but don't learn. They go for fun, and that's close to failing. Failing is bad. You might end up without a home, asking for money, feeling ashamed. People who fail might wish they had gone to school and succeeded when they had the chance. Others don't have the chance but still go to school and work hard to earn money.\n\nFailing is caring too much about games, social media, and friends. Focusing too much on games can make you want to quit school and play all day. It can make you angry and hurt others. Social media can make you care only about yourself. It can lead to feeling sad if people say mean things. Caring too much about friends can also be bad. They might make you do bad things and disrespect your family and teachers to fit in. This can make you fail in school.\n\nFailing is being lazy. If you're lazy, you won't do things right, like schoolwork. You might not help others when they ask. Laziness is bad. It can make you fail and repeat grades. It lets your parents down after they helped you go to school. If you try, you can succeed and make your parents proud.\n\nIn conclusion, work hard to succeed. If you don't care, you'll fail. Believe in yourself and do things right. Be thankful for your parents' support."}
{"text_id": "AD7F1F3996C9", "output_essay": "Schools should teach students for 10 hours over 4 days. I think that a longer school day would give students more time to learn and longer weekends to rest. But, they might not have enough time for their own activities. One reason schools should make the school day longer is that students could learn more. With more time in class, students would get less homework because they could do more work at school. Teachers could go over lessons better, so students would understand more. Schools would keep up with teaching; they might even get ahead. More time in class would also mean more hands-on learning in subjects like science. Students who don't have enough class time often do poorly on tests, only learning the main ideas. More class time would let teachers cover everything well. Another reason a longer school day for four days is good is that students would get a longer weekend. They could sleep more on Friday mornings and not worry about school. During the long weekend, students and teachers could spend more time with their families. Students could also play sports or do other fun things. With a three-day weekend, they could even take a short trip. The break would help them relax after a week of tests and homework. If they missed a day, they could use the weekend to catch up. Teenagers who are old enough to work could do so on weekends. A third point is that even though students would be in school more, they might not have enough time for themselves. Sports and jobs could be hard to do during the week. High school students who want to work might think about leaving school because of the extra stress. This could make their grades worse. With such a busy schedule, some might want to skip school. Younger kids might get too tired with the long days. It's not good to make them learn for so many hours. Teaching and learning for 10 hours over 4 days, with a long weekend after, is an idea to think about. I agree that a longer school day and weekend could help with learning and give needed breaks. Still, it's important to make sure students don't have a hard time finding time for themselves."}

These problems include using cell phones the wrong way, disturbing the class, and hurting students' ability to think and analyze. \n\nFirst, cell phones should not be in the classroom because students might use them for the wrong things. They could go on social media or bully others during class. They might use apps like Facebook, Twitter, and Messenger. They could also post pictures of other students without asking on Snapchat. This can make others feel bad. \n\nSecond, cell phones should not be in class because they can interrupt the class. Students might not pay attention to their work if they can use their phones. They might play with their phones instead of learning. This could make their grades go down. For example, a student's grades could fall from an 'A' to an 'F' if they get distracted by their phone. \n\nLast, using cell phones in class could hurt how students think. They might depend too much on looking up answers online instead of thinking hard.

It offers more chances to students who can't be in school every day. It's a simple way for students who have disabilities or are sick to learn too. Each student has a different life. Many students work and study at the same time. Online classes help those who can't get to school on time, work far away, or have families. For instance, at my school, about thirty girls are married and have kids. Some of them use online classes and do better than those who miss school once a week. This also helps students who want to go to college, since many college courses and tests are online. Disabled students would gain a lot from this. They could learn from home and be like other kids. This would save money for counties and families who pay for private schools. It would also help families save time from driving their kids to school. Plus, we could catch up on classes or do them from home if we're sick, late, or can't get to school. I think this will be the most popular way to learn in ten years. Some people don't like this idea. They think students will skip school. But I respectfully disagree. Online classes for kids who haven't finished school need a good reason and family permission. That's how schools can keep control. Online learning has many benefits for students and society. We should use our technology to make life easier, but we must control how our kids use it. In summary, learning online is a good, modern way to learn that helps students and society."}

What he means is that success is hard. People face many hard times and might fail at first. Many will see you as a failure, but you can show them they are wrong. The question is, are you ready for this, or will you quit? Failure is a big part of our lives. It happens at school, work, and home. We deal with failure, which is the opposite of success. We are scared of failing because we don't want to let down others or see ourselves as losers. But this isn't true. When you try for something big, you might not make it and feel embarrassed. But don't let that control you. Failure is important for your biggest success, if you think about it the right way. Failure is not the end. It teaches you how to reach your goals. Famous people like Albert Einstein and Walt Disney failed many times. Einstein had trouble with English and was kicked out of school. Disney wanted to build a theme park, but people stole his ideas, and he had many legal problems. They could have quit. But they didn't give up and are now known all over the world. Einstein is called a genius, and Disney is very famous. They failed but kept trying. Some people might not agree with Churchill's idea about failure and success. It's normal to feel sad when you work hard and fail. If you don't accept your sadness, you won't understand why you failed. It's okay to feel sad. But Churchill's main point is that you should get over the failure with new excitement and keep trying. You have to learn that everyone makes mistakes, but you can always try to fix them. In the end, failure can help us improve and face our problems again, which leads to success. Now, you know better and can make good choices.

They could be busy with sports, a job, or taking care of their family. If schools make music, drama, and art classes required, some students will be unhappy. They might not like these subjects.

I still have to study and do well in school during regular hours. No one wants to be in school longer. I know girls who have babies.

{"text_id": "EE1CEEADB315", "output_essay": "Some high schools make students take a music, drama, or art class to finish school. Students should not have to take these extra classes if they don't want to. This is because having too many classes needed for graduation can make fewer students finish school. In many high schools, you need more than 24 credits to get an advanced diploma. It's already tough to get all these credits. Adding more classes might make some students quit school. Kids also have a lot of homework. If they take these extra classes, they might spend hours on art or drama after school. This could mean they have less time for homework and their grades might drop. These classes can also be costly. They often have fees or you need to buy things. For example, a photography class might need a camera that costs around two hundred dollars. Some classes can cost more than a thousand dollars because you need to pay for clothes, buses, trips, hotels, food, music, and dance teachers. Making a student take an extra class is not good. It can make fewer students graduate, they already have enough homework, and it can be very expensive. Some extra classes can help with future jobs. But making teens take a class that is not useful for their future won't help them.

Take hairdressing, for example. Someone might mess up a hairstyle, but that doesn't mean they'll give up. They might keep trying until they get it right, or they might ask their teacher for help. Once they get the hairstyle right, they'll feel proud because they didn't give up when it was tough; they kept going, one step at a time.\n\nMistakes are also good because they can teach you important life skills. Messing up a hairstyle can be annoying. Being annoyed can lead to anger, and anger isn't good. For instance, if you get angry over a hairstyle, you might forget where you are. You might speak in a harsh way. But if you learn to manage your annoyance, you won't lose customers or your job. Managing your feelings is a very important skill.\n\nMaking mistakes can also help you make new friends. Say you mess up a hairstyle. Maybe someone else is having trouble with it too. You can work together to figure it out. You might start talking about the hairstyle to see if you're doing it right. Then, you might start asking each other personal questions like what your favorite color is or what animals you like.

One, excitement helps us keep trying; two, failing teaches us to improve; and three, with excitement, we can achieve our goals. I want to talk about these reasons. Excitement isn't just about us. Others can help us too. For example, if I want to quit after a failure, someone might help me do better. I can also encourage others and show them easier ways to do things. Many people fail at a job but try again with more excitement and do better. But some people quit after failing and don't try again. Like when a business isn't making money, the owner might close it without trying to improve. In a company, it's normal for people to lose excitement. We all make mistakes and aren't perfect. Second, failing isn't always bad. It helps us learn to do our jobs better. If I work hard and make a mistake, but my boss encourages me, I'll feel more excited. But don't just be excited for money. With enough excitement and a positive attitude, we can do great things, even if we fail. Failing can be a good way to learn and improve. I like this because I know staying excited isn't easy. I've made mistakes and thought about quitting. But that's okay. It's sad when people quit and don't want help. Some people give up, lose their jobs, and their excitement, and don't try to improve. But for most, failing can be good. Third, with excitement, we can do and be better, no matter how many times we fail. For example, when I was 11, my dad encouraged me to do well in school and with homework. Now, as an adult, choosing a career is harder. But I remember my dad's lessons and stay excited, even when I fail. Sometimes, failing can lead to big changes, like going from a coworker to a manager. That's great because you learned from mistakes and stayed excited. In a company, if everyone is excited and wants the company to be the best, it's good for everyone. In conclusion, I strongly agree with Churchill. We can do better if we want to. No one is perfect. We can make mistakes, learn, and stay positive. Just do your job and move from one failure to another without losing excitement. I will always stay positive and excited, no matter how many times I fail."}

It makes you want to try even harder. Your brain helps a lot. It makes you think more and try to win where you failed before. If you're a student worried about grades, remember that failing feels awful. Trying your best to succeed is the best thing. That way, you pass what you need to. This is why I agree with Winston Churchill. If you fail, keep trying to succeed. Don't quit. Success is tough when things are hard, but you can make it if you don't quit."}
{"text_id": "1623E0390923", "output_essay": "Some companies work only four days a week for ten hours each day to save energy and resources. Should schools do the same by making the school day two hours longer? I don't think schools should do this. It won't save much energy or resources, long days can make students upset, and they need time for activities after school. \n\nFirst, a four-day school week won't save much. Schools might save on bus fuel, but not on electricity. If schools are open for two extra hours each day, they will use more electricity, not less. \n\nSecond, being in school for too long can make students upset. Some people can't stay focused for a long time. For example, in my country, school is only four and a half hours long. When I moved to the United States, I found the longer school days very hard because they were almost twice as long. \n\nThird, students need time for things like sports, clubs, and helping in the community. These take a lot of time. With a ten-hour school day, students won't have much time left for these activities. Also, some students work after school. If school days are longer, they might not have time for their jobs and could lose them. \n\nIn conclusion, it's not a good idea for schools to have a four-day week with longer days. It won't save much, it could make students unhappy and hurt their grades, and they need time for other activities."}

If it were me, I'm sure I wouldn't focus. I would get distracted by hanging out with friends and family. However, taking classes at home could be good because I could stay with my family, start work early, and join in more since I can be by myself. I like being alone. Another plus of home school is not having to drive or deal with traffic. It also saves money. If I studied at home, my mom would make sure I focus on school. She really wants me to pass. But I might not like working alone. Sometimes I like it, but I usually prefer working with a friend. A nice thing about home classes is making your own schedule. Unlike school, you can sleep more, wake up, and start classes, or do them later."}
{"text_id": "3B3E4BEBE32D", "output_essay": "Some schools let students use cell phones in class for learning. I think this is good because it helps students with what they are learning. Cell phones are useful in class because they work like a dictionary and translator, they make finding information easy, and they are cheaper than buying a book. Also, they help our brains learn big ideas that make us smarter and let us learn faster. One reason schools let cell phones be used in class is because they are great for looking up words and translating. Generic_Name, my Spanish teacher, told us it was hard for him to learn English because he didn't have a good dictionary. He always had to ask his teacher for help, which caused problems. When he became a teacher, he talked to other teachers and the principal about letting students use cell phones in class. He said, \"Everyone is smart in their own way, but with great tools to gain wisdom, it can make a good difference.\" Generic_Name worked hard to become a teacher and now he helps his students so they don't have the same problems. Another reason schools let cell phones be used is that they help us look up information quickly and don't cost as much as books. In my classes, we use cell phones to research topics. Students like to read on their phones, and schools can't always give out books, especially if they get lost or broken. For example, in Biology, three students lost their books and had to pay for them, but they didn't have the money, which was a big problem. My third reason for liking cell phones in class is that they help our brains learn important things and let us learn quickly. Long ago, famous writers shared their research and stories. Now, technology lets us get this information faster, first in books and now on the internet. Cell phones help us understand and learn quickly because of those writers and technology. Some people think that high school education is worse now because of technology. They think it makes us less able and want to go back to old ways of learning. But I think using cell phones in class for learning is not bad. I know they can be distracting if we play games all the time. But we can have fun with our phones later. When it's time for learning, we should use them if the teacher says it's okay. In conclusion, cell phones are a great way to learn and understand what we need. If we use our phones wisely, it can make a big difference. Schools that let us use cell phones help us learn new things. Some people still like books and think they are better, but not everyone feels the same because technology has changed everything. Others would rather download books than buy them or pay for lost ones. Lastly, cell phones can help our brains a lot because of all the good and important information technology gives us in a simple way."}

This plan would give students and teachers an extra day off to relax and do what they want, like going out with friends or just taking a break from school for a day. The goal to save energy and take care of our planet and community is great. One reason for this change is that we would have school for four days instead of five; I think everyone would enjoy an extra day off from school or work. It's great that we can help save energy and resources; by doing this, we are helping our school and our community. School days would last ten hours, but if all the students are okay with it, it would be good for everyone. We would not have school for one day, and the companies get what they want. We also get something good from what they are doing. The whole point is to keep our community nice and clean and to be smart about using energy and resources. We should agree with the companies because it helps our environment and keeps us safe. Plus, we would have a four-day school week—who wouldn't like that? This is why I think my school should agree with the companies to save energy and resources."}
{"text_id": "64B8BE656432", "output_essay": "I believe my school should not use this plan because it's not good for students who want to get ready for college and get a good education for a better future. For instance, if they go to school for only two hours, they might not be ready for college. Maybe half of the students would pick a school with a four-day week and longer school days by two hours. This is fine for students who don't care about their future and just want to work all the time. I know many Hispanic students work more than they go to school to help their families. I think if a student works more than five or six hours a day, it's very hard, and they might quit school because it's like having two jobs. For me, going to school is very important. If you go to school and finish, you can get a good job later. If you work hard and are dedicated, you can succeed. For a Hispanic family like mine, nothing is easy. We came here for a better future and education. To us, education is the key to becoming someone important. So, I think it's not right if my school uses this plan. It's not fair to students who really want to learn and go to college. It's only good for those who don't care about learning and just want to work all the time."}

But often, people don't like to mess up. They think it makes them look dumb. This isn't true, though. When you mess up, you learn more. You find out step by step how to do things right. Failing is key to doing well in life because it helps you reach your goals. Everyone fails because no one is perfect. But when you do something wrong, you need to fix it. When you mess up, you learn better ways to act; and your life gets better. Then you can get better jobs and more chances to do well because you learn from your failures. This makes you stronger. I agree with Churchill that doing well means moving from one failure to another without losing your excitement. If you fail but stay patient and excited, things will turn out okay. You can keep going for success by fixing your mistakes. This pushes you to keep trying until you get it right. It also encourages you to keep going and always try your hardest to learn more. Failing is the best way to learn in life because it teaches people to never stop trying and to always do their best. This makes others proud of them.

{"text_id": "3CDE1D9E6E57", "output_essay": "Many people argue about whether schools should let students learn from home. Some parents don't like the idea of their children staying at home for school. However, I think students should have the choice to learn from home. Here's why. Every student learns at their own speed. Some need more time to understand their work. Others do not. When I was young, my teachers did not help if I was confused. They just kept teaching. This hurt my grades. If I could have learned from home with a teacher's help online, it would have been much better. Students should have this choice. Another reason I support learning from home is that students are often too tired to go to school in the morning. They might miss a whole day of school. This can make it hard for them to learn. I have a friend who learns better at home. He finishes his work and even starts new lessons. Learning from home can help students who struggle with regular school. Lastly, not all students can take the classes they need for their future jobs at school. For example, a student who wants to be an architect should take classes for that, not other subjects. Learning from home lets students choose what they want to study. It also gives them time to think about different things they might want to learn. In conclusion, I believe that learning from home can help students focus, finish their work, and learn more about what interests them."}
{"text_id": "CEC40123BE8D", "output_essay": "Failing is important when you want to succeed. When you fail at anything—like a video game, a test, a soccer match, or love—you don't lose. You learn. Failing makes us tough and wise. This is why we think older people know a lot. They have lived through many things. People who do well in life are excited about what they do. But those who fail once and never try again, they don't chase their dreams. Dreamers, people who want to make a difference, have failed many times. I'm sure that someone like Bill Gates or Steve Jobs didn't win on their first try. People might tell you 'you can't do that' or 'that won't work.' But excitement and learning show them that yes, I can, and yes, it will work. I believe what Prime Minister Winston Churchill said about failing and being excited helping you succeed. Success can be different things, like doing well in school, being a great dad, or finding love. I am someone who doesn't quit. I know when one thing fails, better chances will come. I plan to keep chasing my dreams and not stop when things don't go as planned. Hope is the last thing to lose, and I don't plan to lose mine."}
{"text_id": "03FDC60BE33B", "output_essay": "Most students like to take classes online. In the past five years, over three thousand students have finished their studies online. They like it because they can learn in a quiet place, get better at using computers, and do their work by themselves. It's simpler to stay at home than to go to the bus stop. Many students work late, so they can sleep more and still go to online classes. They can take their time with homework and projects. Some students don't like school and don't do well there, so learning online is better for them. \n\nFirst, students can study in a quiet and safe place at home. They can pay attention to what they are learning without anyone bothering them. There are no problems with other people. At school, some students are bullied. Learning online can lead to better grades and health. A quiet place helps you work harder. It's also quick to look up information. Like doctors and bosses, working in a quiet place helps you think and come up with new ideas. \n\nThen, students learn about computers by taking classes online. Jobs everywhere need computer skills. Online classes teach you to use a computer well. Computers are very useful for learning. They help you work fast and find what you need. Some people think online classes are bad because you don't learn about other cultures. But computers can teach you anything. Online classes also help you pass and connect with the world. \n\nLast, online classes make students do their work by themselves, learn fast, and focus better. It's important to know how to work alone. Online classes need you to work by yourself. This helps you learn quicker. Working alone is like getting ready for a quiz or test. It can lead to better results. Students who work alone often get the best grades. Teachers want you to work by yourself. It makes life easier. A saying goes, \"A person who works alone will have a great future.\" Don't cheat. It's bad for you. Online classes help you work alone and well. \n\nIn the end, online learning is a great choice from schools and helps students a lot. It lets you take your time. Online classes teach you more, improve your computer skills, and help you work alone to reach your goals. People take online classes to finish school and become doctors or engineers. They might be quicker than normal classes. For example, if you work alone, you can solve problems easily. Online classes have good effects on students."}

Some people think learning from far away is not good. They worry about not getting the lessons and having many questions that need quick answers. But others think it is the way schools will be in the future. If a student can't go to class for personal reasons, learning from far away is the best choice. People still fight over this topic. Some schools let students join classes from home using the internet or video calls. This way works well because students work a lot during the day. If they can't go to school for personal reasons, they can still learn in a safe place. Many studies show that most high school and college students work three to four days a week. Students are very tired all day, so they don't do their best in school. If schools let students learn from home, they can do better because they will have enough sleep and rest. Every student has different things to handle outside of school. Sometimes these things can stop their learning. If a student misses a day of school for many reasons, like doctor visits, holidays, being sick, and other problems, he or she can join class from other places using the internet or video calls. This helps students keep up with school and handle their personal life. The last reason why learning from far away is better is that it is safe. When students go to school, they can face many bad things like drugs, alcohol, and more. Schools are not always the safest places for students. School shootings and bullying are big problems, and learning from far away can fix these problems. Some schools let students join class from home using the internet or video calls. This is good for students because many of them work. If they miss school for personal reasons or by mistake, they can still be part of a safe learning place.

It's not terrible, but it's not as great as some people think. Work and school should stay as they are. We shouldn't let anyone change that. I believe things should stay the same because it could confuse some people. Business people want to improve things, but they should ask others for their thoughts. They should see if changing is a good idea or not. Some students would benefit by having more family time, more time for homework, and more time to study. But many students have part-time jobs. It's tough to go to school in the morning and work in the afternoon. If school ends two hours later, students won't have time for work or homework. This will stress them out. It's better to keep things as they are. We could vote and see what people think. But I believe the bad points outweigh the good ones. We should think about the students, not just ourselves. Schools are meant for a five-day week. They want to change it to save energy and resources. But adding two hours each day is like having a full five-day week. Some students might like the idea at first. But they might regret it when it gets too hard. Business people should keep things the same. They want to make more money, but it's not good for everyone. They're making things confusing. I think all students would agree and not want this change. It's about keeping our school and work time safe.

{"text_id": "BCBE999300EA", "output_essay": "Why did Winston Churchill say, \"Success is about moving from one failure to another without losing your excitement\"? Because most people who didn't reach their goals just quit and forgot about them. Excitement is very important for your success, even more than your failures. If you fail and lose your excitement, you won't try again to get what you want. Quitting because you failed is a big deal. Everyone has failed at some point. For example, no one wins without failing first; if you lose your excitement, it will cost you a lot; failure is how you get to success.\n\nFirst, you can't win without failing. Failing shows you your mistakes. No matter if they are small or big, they will affect you. So, failing helps you reach your goal more easily. Many rich people lost a lot at first, but they kept working. You might wonder why they kept going after failing. It's because they believed in themselves and knew they could do it. You can choose to win or lose. Trying more is better because you learn from it.\n\nSecond, losing your excitement will cost you a lot. For example, it will cost you the win you wanted, the money you could have made or spent, and the joy of winning after hard work. People who work out often say, \"No pain, no gain.\" This short saying means a lot. If they didn't work hard, they wouldn't get the body they want. Also, the saying \"Never give up\" is short but powerful. If someone tells you that, you might do everything you can because you won't quit. You'll keep going until you reach your goal.\n\nThird, failing is how you get to success. As I said before, many rich people failed at first. Now, people look up to them. I think they are trying to win again and again. Success after hard work is the best. Students study many subjects, but they work hard to get their dream job, car, house, and so on. They know the rewards of hard work. Some people say you should stop after your first failure. I think this is wrong. If you stop and don't try to fix it or work hard, you'll get nothing. What if you worked hard? You might be praised because you did it well. People will respect you more if they see you are positive and trying hard. But if they see you give up easily and don't care about doing things well, they won't want to be around you. You must be positive, keep going, and believe in yourself to reach your goal. Ignore any negative thoughts or things that might bring you down.\n\nTo end, nothing is better than winning after failing. You'll learn from your mistakes and not make them again. You need to be patient to get what you want. Success doesn't happen in one day. Remember that good things and success take time. You need a good plan to get what you want. As I said, your failures are how you get to success. You'll learn, be patient, and see your mistakes. These things might seem simple, but they are very important. They can lead you to success if you work hard and improve your way. If you think about Winston's words, they are deep and motivating. Again, never ever give up."}

Online classes would let us work at our own pace without feeling pushed. They could help students who are too busy with work or other things to come to school. Like, a student might have to leave town for a family emergency but doesn't want to get behind. They can do online work while they're away and even get help from their teachers through video calls. This is good because they get personal teaching.\n\nSome people might miss a class they need to graduate. Online classes can help them catch up and finish school on time, even if they're busy during the day. Many people might want to finish school but are too busy; online classes could make their schedules easier. Some might want to take an extra class for fun, for more credits, or to get their diploma faster. Online classes would help a lot of people, no matter how busy they are.\n\nOnline learning is a way to better education; it could help people get better jobs or save money for schools. This could give teachers more money for teaching. It might even lead to someone making new technology for schools. Online classes could help people earn more than the lowest pay. It could also help those who learn at home, as they can get their lessons online. Online education is a way to a better future and better learning for everyone.\n\nWe should have online classes at our school.

They would add two hours to each school day to save natural resources. Some people think this won't really help save a lot of resources. I think it's a great idea because it saves resources, gives us three days off, and gives us more time for homework.\n\nFirst, it saves resources. If we don't have school for one day, we will save a lot of water by the end of the year. Also, think about how much energy we use in one school day. Not having school for one day will save a lot of energy over time. Schools also use a lot of food every day. If we don't have school for one day, we will save food. With a four-day school week, we would save energy, resources, and money.\n\nNext, students would get three days off. Some students work after school. One more day off would let them rest and maybe get better grades. They could also hang out with friends. Many students can't do this on weekends because they are busy. One extra day off could make them less stressed. They often feel they don't have enough time for themselves. By the end of the weekend, they are tired and down.\n\nLastly, students would have more time for homework. One more day off means they could get ahead with their schoolwork. Sometimes, students can't hand in their work on time because they're too busy. They often have too much homework from different classes and not enough time to do it.\n\nIn conclusion, a four-day school week is a great idea. It saves resources, gives us three days off, and more time for homework. There's no bad side to having an extra day off. This model will help us think about the changes we need to make. We want a society that knows what's going on around us."}

Some think that online classes are not helpful because it's hard to stay focused on a screen for a long time. Many students get tired watching long videos and might cheat. But I think online classes are a great way to learn for students far away. They save a lot of time and money, lead to fewer students quitting school, help more people learn to read and write, and are good for grown-ups and students with kids or jobs. \n\nFewer students quit: For example, my friend was doing well in college. But then her mom got very sick and couldn't move or talk. She couldn't leave her mom and little brothers to go to college. She missed classes three times. When she came back, they kicked her out of the class. She tried to tell her teacher, but he didn't listen. She waited to talk to him after class, but he didn't believe her. It was her second year and close to the end. She needed that class to graduate. They said she had to stay another year. So, she quit school and got a job. \n\nSaves time and money: My sister's college is three hours from our house. Our dad won't let us be away from home, not even for college. So she drives six hours back and forth every three days. She hates driving, but she has no choice. If she took online classes, she would save all that time and not spend money on gas every week. She could also work more and save money. It would also help the environment by cutting down on pollution and traffic. \n\nReduces illiteracy: Online classes are also good for grown-ups. For instance, my mom had to stop going to college when I was born. She had no one to watch me because my dad worked two jobs. She couldn't bring me along. She had to leave college and has always been sad about it. She tells me she wouldn't have had to quit if she could have taken online classes back then. \n\nIn conclusion, online classes are a big chance for us because they save hours and gas. More students will finish college on time, and education for adults or moms will get better. By taking this chance, we will move forward. All students, no matter how far they live or if they have kids, can take classes anywhere and anytime they like, even late at night."}
{"text_id": "A9A92BCA4B7D", "output_essay": "Failures are Part of Success\n\nWinston Churchill, a past leader of Britain, once said, \"Success is moving from one failure to another without losing your excitement.\" Failure is a big part of trying to succeed. A person who dreams of success will face many failures but must stay excited. Sticking to it helps a person stay excited even when they fail. To reach a goal, a person will face many failures but must keep their excitement.\n\nFirst, failures are key when trying to succeed. You can't succeed without failing. Everyone has a dream and wants to make it come true, but this can't happen without making mistakes and failing. For instance, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was a big leader for equal rights. He met a lot of resistance from stronger people, but these failures helped him become a successful leader. So, in King's life, failures were key to his success.\n\nSecond, a successful life includes failures, but you must stay excited. Being able to keep your excitement when things are going wrong can make success possible. Also, a successful life is built on many failures, but you must keep the excitement to keep going. For example, Gabrielle Douglas was the first American gymnast to win gold in both the individual and team events at the same Olympics. She failed a lot in her career. Once, she broke her leg during her first big event in Japan, but Douglas got help and therapy to be ready for the next event where she did well. The main thing is to stay excited even when you fail.\n\nThird, sticking to it means you don't lose excitement when you fail. Being persistent makes you strong when you fail. Some people think that success isn't about moving from failure to failure without losing excitement. They say that failing a lot makes you lose excitement. But, many believe it's hard to stay excited when you fail. To say again what Churchill said about failure's role in success, success is about moving from failure to failure without losing excitement.\n\nIn conclusion, Churchill's words were simple but powerful. Failure is a big part of trying to succeed. It's possible to stay excited even when many things are going wrong. Being persistent is the secret to success and keeping your excitement. Success is about moving from failure to failure and keeping your excitement."}

This lets them keep getting better at their art or music, and it helps them get a job. \n\nArt classes are good for students who act on impulse because they learn to draw, color, and paint. These activities need patience, so they become more patient. Some parents think these classes should be optional because they don't seem useful every day. \n\nI believe that all schools should make students take music and art classes. They are very important because students learn something new."}
{"text_id": "8E40E03B113A", "output_essay": "Many people I know, like teachers and former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, have said that success is moving from one failure to another without losing your excitement. I think this is true. These words mean different things to me in different situations. In 2018, I see all the things people have made to make the Earth better—like technology, cars, houses. The inventors of these things failed many times before they succeeded. Thomas Edison was a scientist who gave his inventions to the world. He failed many times before he found the right way to make light for everyone. We get more success after many failures. He did not think failure was bad. It was just a step closer to success. The technology we use today shows success. Every year, we make new models. We do this not because the old ones were bad, but because we want to make them better. We are moving towards the future, towards success. I moved to America about a year ago. I saw that here, people are not afraid to fail. In school and work, we can fail and then do better. Failure is just the start of success. This is why students getting to retake tests is important. One of my own failures was the first time I took a history class here. I thought it would be easy, but I got only 13.8 percent. I worked hard, studied, and talked to my teacher. After a while, before I saw my new grade, my teacher asked me if I knew my test score. I said no and asked if it was bad. He just smiled and walked away. I got 100 percent. That felt amazing. I wouldn't have felt that without failing first. Failing makes success feel special. If we always succeed, then success means nothing. I think going from 13.8 to 100 percent is better than always getting 100 percent. In my country, everyone knows each other's grades. Students compare and feel bad about failing. But here, grades are private. Teachers want us to be smarter than them. So failing is not a big deal. It's not scary or embarrassing. Some people don't agree with this idea. Failing gives us experience and sometimes pain. But if we fail at something we can only try once, it hurts a lot. The chance won't come again. When we fail more, success costs more. It hurts more, we learn more, but our excitement gets less. Some people want to avoid failing. Or think about a criminal who fails to rob a bank. He goes to jail. When he gets out, he still wants to rob a bank because he's still excited. He fails over and over. This idea means different things to different people. In the end, Winston Churchill was right. Every time we fail, we learn and get closer to success. But success really counts when we help others and make the world better."}
{"text_id": "64DD4D04D733", "output_essay": "Saving energy is important for us because everyone's body is different and reacts in its own way. Making the school day longer has good and bad points. A bad point of adding two hours to the school day is that students won't learn more. They will just sleep or be in a bad mood because they are tired. If they sleep in class, don't do their work, and fail tests, they won't learn. A good point of a longer school day is getting three days off. But this is the only good thing. You don't save energy or resources because you use the same amount. With a longer day, you need three meals, like in a five-day school week. You also use more energy because you work harder to make three meals for four days. Making the school day two hours longer is not worth it. Our school is better now than it would be with the longer day. It's more efficient and saves more than the longer day would. Getting the food ready for the extra meals is tough. You also have to pay the people who serve the food to the kids. That's why I don't agree with making the school day two hours longer. There aren't many benefits. In conclusion, a two-hour longer school day is a waste of time and money. It doesn't just waste money, it also makes students do worse. Not many students will graduate in that situation. So, I don't support the idea of a longer school day."}

Being able to use the internet in class and at home helps students learn more in different ways. \n\nNot every student learns at the same speed. Using phones for online lessons lets students work at their own pace. They don't have to rush to keep up with others. This way, students can take their time with schoolwork, whether in class or as homework. They won't feel the pressure to move as fast as everyone else. This makes them want to learn and understand the material better. \n\nSome students don't have much confidence. They might not try hard because they're scared of failing. But if they enjoy class and have fun with other students, they're more likely to want to go to school. \n\nEven though students learn to use online activities at school, they can also get to these websites from home on their devices. Many students spend their free time online and on their phones after school. \n\nSchool isn't for everyone. People learn and think differently. Teachers are looking for new and fun ways to get all kinds of students interested in schoolwork.

This means that while some people fight without excitement, others may not know why they are fighting. But some die for their country because they want to protect and save it. Another way to talk about excitement is 'never give up.' Everyone has a duty to their life. Excitement shows what you want, what your goals are, and why you fight. People with a goal never give up. They are different; they don't have the same goals, reasons, or lives.\n\nI think the idea that failure helps you succeed is true. Failure is good because it helps you do better next time. Everyone fails; nothing is perfect. People can't be like gods; everyone has bad times, but they can fix them. People learn and try to do better. The leader of Britain is just one person; he is human like us. He made many mistakes, but he stayed positive. His country was excited, and he never gave up. Some people are like him, but some never change.\n\nBefore you win at school or a game, you usually don't win at first; you fail. But if you are brave like the leader of Britain, you will probably win.\n\nIn the end, you can make a difference if you have a goal in your life. Don't give up. Work hard to reach your goals with excitement and be ready to give up things to get what you want. Also, everyone has their own world in their mind, everyone knows different things, and everyone thinks about their future. So, if you want something, remember that you like it and work to get that goal like an expert."}

Failing is part of getting better because when you try something new, you will fail many times if it's your first time. But you will succeed at some point. I remember in 8th grade, I was worried I wouldn't pass a class. I kept trying to improve my grade, but nothing helped. Then, I spoke with my teacher alone. She told me, 'Come to every lunch, and your grade will get better.' I did that for two months, and I ended up passing the class with a B+. This is a time when I experienced what the quote means.

We can use this time to have fun, work, and be with our family. But not everyone will like this change or find it helpful. We already do homework at home. It's like being in school but in a more relaxed way. People are busy. Some students work part-time jobs because they need the money. It's also important to learn new things every day. School is a good place to learn, practice, and meet new friends. There are many good things about this idea.\n\nThe bad part is that our days will be very long. We won't have time for much else besides going to school or work, coming home, and doing what we need to do. This will be what we do for four days. But it's only for four days, which is the good part. I really like this idea. I've always thought that going to school for just four days would be better. We would have more time for things we enjoy. Life isn't just about work and study. Sometimes we forget about what's really important. School is a big part of our lives, but we should go because we want to, not because we have to.\n\nEverything has good and bad sides. But we should think about the good things more. This four-day school plan has many good points. We get three days to do what we want. No school, no work, just time with family. It's also good for students who work.

But other parents think their kids need time to be themselves. They need to visit friends and relax after school. In math, we make big numbers smaller to solve problems.

They can give it back after the student finishes their work. Apart from that, I like online classes. It really depends on the student. Everyone learns in their own way.

I want to share my thoughts with you. Let me tell you what I think about this topic. I like the idea of a four-day school week. It gives us more time at home to do homework and school work. If we go to school for only four days, we must do better in class. We have more time to practice at home and get things done well. For me, it's key to stay sharp and do what needs to be done. As I said before, we need to finish all our homework for every class. We have three days off to do our homework at home without rushing. Also, when there are tests, we can study more. This helps us do well on tests. We have a better chance to pass tests and exams. But the four-day school week also has downsides. If we have school for only four days, we must stay at school longer each day. Before, school was eight hours a day. Now, it's ten hours. This makes us more tired. Some students have jobs after school. They get tired quickly. Teachers also get stressed because they have so much work in one day. They just want to rest at home. And think about students who work to help their parents pay for things. They might not want to do homework because they're too tired. They might sleep in class the next day.

Great things can have downsides too. In the end, it doesn't matter how many days we have school. What matters is how you plan your life. If you think you can handle it, go for it.

When you aim for something that takes a while to get, the first thing you face is big challenges. This shows that reaching your goals is never simple. But this doesn't mean you can't achieve your dreams. Failure is very hard to take, but I believe it's a part of life we must go through because nothing in life is easy or free. Failing helps us do better because we learn from it. The next time, you'll remember your error and might succeed in what you're trying to do. Give yourself another chance and trust in what you're doing. You've learned from your past mistake, as people say, 'you learn from mistakes.' Failing is like a penalty for rushing, and that's not right because it's bad to have regrets later. So, think before you act because failure is hard and no one likes it. Five years ago, I tried to skate with my friend's roller skates. My parents warned me it was risky and I could get punished. But I was too excited and kept trying. Then, I broke my ankle. My dad said, 'I told you it was dangerous. You don't need punishment; life will teach you if you listen. But if you want to skate, get up, clean your knees, and don't cry. In a few months, you can skate again, and the pain will be gone. You've learned from your mistake.' Since then, I've been more motivated to show that nothing is impossible and to remember that to succeed, failure doesn't matter; just get up and keep going the right way. To succeed, the key is to never quit and work hard. Falls are like lemons life gives you, and you should make lemonade. Don't ever give up. Life is about staying strong, no matter how tough it gets. Keep going, even when life is hard. Also, don't be shy. It's not good. Don't look back; leave the past and start fresh. Sometimes, life gives you chances that others want. You should take them because I was told to make the most of chances since they may not come again. And lastly, don't rush through life. It's not about being first; it's about thinking and trying to do the right things without cheating or bad habits like smoking, drinking, or using drugs. Just be honest."}

I don't agree with this article. I know many people want chances in life and to do well for themselves. They want good things that life can offer.

Think about the good and bad of a four-day school week.\" Schools want to make the day longer by two hours to save energy for everyone. I don't agree with this article because of the good and bad points of going to school for five days and about eight hours each day.

But they don't see the hard work behind success. They only see the good parts. I wish I could succeed easily without hard work. That would be great.\n\nFirst, facing many failures can make you sad and feel lost. I've felt this way. There were days I thought I would 'die' from sadness. I had bad thoughts and felt worse. I didn't want to do anything. I stopped caring.\n\nSecond, after some time, I began to change. I didn't want to be stuck in sadness. I saw my friends happy and not having problems. I realized I was missing out on fun. I got help, spent time with friends, and started to feel less stressed and more happy.\n\nThird, meeting more people helped me change from sad to happy. I became outgoing and funny. My friends liked me more because I was fun. I was happy to be getting better. I watched videos that inspired me. Like the bodybuilder ARNOLD who said, 'NO PAIN, NO GAIN.' This means you must work hard and face challenges to succeed. Another said, 'You need a clear plan, or you'll just drift.' These speeches motivated me to take things seriously.\n\nFinally, my life was a mess at first. I didn't care and gave up quickly. But things changed when I became more positive and met people from different places and beliefs. They helped me enjoy life and be myself. My friends were kind and didn't judge me.

The world has many problems, but I believe one person can make a difference. With hard work, you can achieve anything and be successful.\n\nSuccess is like planting a seed. If you don't plant it in good soil, it won't grow. You must be smart about your goals, be sure of them, and keep working hard."}

Students can gain from online classes because they can study from where they are comfortable instead of going to school. Here are some benefits of learning from home: Students can be in a cozy spot in their house. They can travel to new places and still do their classes online without missing out. If a student is sick, they can still join the class on their computer and listen to the teacher. They don't have to spend money on school supplies because everything is on the computer. Students can stay home more and finish most of their work. They can focus better because they don't have to get up early, pick clothes, wait for the bus, or deal with cold weather. They have more time to plan their day. If they have a job, they won't be as tired and will do better at work. Online classes are good for all students, and it would be great if all schools had this choice. But for college, it's still important to go in person to learn things that will help in a job. One good thing about online classes is that students can talk without being seen, so they won't get teased. Also, with fewer students, the teacher can hear you better. This can stop bad situations. A bad thing about going to school is feeling tired, stressed, or sad. School can be all about getting good grades, and this can stress students out. If someone is bullied, they can get sad and not want to go to school. They might stay quiet because they are scared. Online classes take away these worries. You can be at home, comfortable, and share your thoughts freely. In school, some students don't talk because they are shy or scared of being wrong. This can make them feel unsure. In the end, I think online classes are good because they give students more chances to focus on their studies without the stress of what to wear, waiting for the bus, or being late. With online classes, everything is on the computer. You just need to stay home, watch the class, and do your work. It also stops you from missing classes and feeling tired from getting up early. When students are tired, stressed, or sad, it can be from the same daily routine. But with online classes, you can even eat while you study, as long as you are polite and don't bother the teacher or other students. This is why students should think about online classes."}
{"text_id": "91FDC448604B", "output_essay": "Some people get less excited when they keep failing. But failing is very important when you want to succeed because it makes you tough, keeps you going, and helps you avoid making the same mistakes. Think about how failing can make you tough. You won't stop trying, even when times are tough. For example, my dog passed away two years ago. I was very sad because I would never see my 'best friend' again. I didn't want to go to school or talk to anyone. But my girlfriend really helped me feel better. She made me tough and confident enough to face the world again. Another point is that failing keeps you going. You keep trying when you learn from your mistakes. This makes you more focused on reaching your goals. In 8th grade, I was doing badly in some classes. My parents even talked to my teachers about my grades. I asked for help and finally did well. My teachers gave me great advice and helped me with my work all year. Failing also helps you avoid making the same mistakes. This leads to success. Take soccer players, for example. They train hard to do well. Sometimes they get hurt in games or practice because they did something wrong, like not warming up right. They learn to avoid these mistakes in future games. This makes them smarter and better in their sport. Cristiano Ronaldo once got hurt and didn't play for two games so he could get better. He rested for two weeks. When he played again, he was fully ready and scored two goals against Juventus. To sum up, failing makes you tough, keeps you going, and helps you not make the same mistakes. This is why it's important for success."}

Some people say students should not have online classes. They think students will not focus and will be distracted by things like little brothers and sisters, TV, or phones. But this is not a strong argument. Some students prefer to be alone and do not get distracted easily. I believe students should have online classes. They will learn more and work hard. Often, students want to work alone. For example, in group work, usually only one person does the work or we just play instead of working. So, students should learn from home. Also, I think students should have online classes because they might enjoy them more. They won't feel too much stress. Some students might not have money for school food or they might not have friends. Sometimes, students copy from others, which can lead to fights. If students take classes at home, they can avoid these problems. Some people don't think students need online classes. But I strongly believe we should have them."}

I think the best way to learn is the old way, by going to school. The good things about online classes are that they are easy to join, which can help more students show up. Some students miss their buses, get up late, get sick, or are too tired from work to go to school. Online classes could help some students get better grades by fixing these attendance problems. They are also good for students with jobs, who don't have to worry about their work hours or saving energy for the day. As a student, I like studying at home in some ways; these are my reasons for liking online learning. But I also have reasons to not like it. Students who have a hard time learning might need one-on-one help, which is tough to give through a computer. It's simpler for a teacher to teach things face-to-face at school. Also, not every student can focus the same. Studying at home can make you look at your phone, TV, or other gadgets. Plus, some students might not take online classes seriously, and teachers can't fix these problems as well as they could in a regular school. These points make me think that going to school is the best way to learn. Teachers can talk about things more clearly and answer questions better in person. Students can also get what their teachers are saying easier, which helps them learn. This way hasn't caused big problems before, and it has helped many successful people. Missing school isn't a big issue, as serious students try hard to be there and not miss out. Those who care about their future won't risk not graduating and getting a better future, becoming more successful with more chances. In the end, these are the reasons I think that going to school is the best way to learn, not through online classes. These are all my thoughts on why I both like and dislike the idea of online learning, and my own view on what might be better for students, showing my belief that going to school is the best way to get an education."}

They can plan their day, focus, and listen to the online teacher. They also have to do homework, take quizzes, and pass a test for each part of the course. But they can do this when it fits their schedule. They can be more careful with their homework and look up facts that help them do better in their classes. Online teachers are ready to help each student, which is good because they learn together as a class.\n\nThe point of this plan was to help these students do well in school. Students can keep studying with teachers who explain things and make groups to meet other students. This way, each student learns and gets better at talking to others who have the same problems. They feel they are not alone in trying to make this dream come true. Every student can show how much they love learning by trying hard to finish all their work.\n\nThis way is special for students in their last year who have many classes and credits to finish. With online classes, students can finish all they need with the same worth as a regular class at school. This doesn't mean they are less or not learning right. In fact, they are just like other students and learn the same things. Online classes are part of a school.\n\nI think that students who take classes from home online or by video are making a smart choice. This way, students feel that they can reach any goal.

Some schools, like universities, offer classes online or through video calls. You can join these classes from anywhere with a phone or computer. This is good for people who live far away, have jobs, or want to try something new. Online school lets students pick their own time to study. It can also be cheaper than regular school. But you need to be disciplined and take your studies seriously. You don't need to travel because you can learn from home. But there are downsides to online classes.

The second choice seems better, doesn't it? But is it really that good? Going to school isn't just about learning history, math, reading, and writing. It's also about making friends, talking to teachers, and learning to be responsible. Plus, school is free. Online classes cost a lot, are hard to get used to, and it's tough to study at home. This is why online school may not be a good idea.\n\nFirst, online classes can be very expensive, between 150 and 200 dollars. Some students can't pay for these classes. If you want online classes, you might need to work for weeks to afford them, while regular school costs nothing. Also, if you work, it could make school and your job harder. So, is it really worth it?\n\nNext, students get distracted at home. Can't do your homework because your little brother won't stop crying? Think about taking a 90-minute class online at home. Home is for relaxing, free time, and being with family and friends. It's not for school.\n\nFinally, it's tough to adjust to online classes. You're used to being in a classroom. Now you have to deal with a new way of learning. Change is hard. You're alone at home, trying to figure out online classes without help. I'm taking an online class in my last year of high school. It's very hard. I don't know what to do because there's no one to show me. There's just a short video, and then I have to write a long essay without knowing how. Sometimes there's no video at all.\n\nSome people think online classes are better than regular school. They're not right. Here's why: school helps you talk better and grow. Teachers are there to help you. In online classes, you can't tell if you're doing things right. You have to guide yourself. It's not better than regular school. Online classes limit you. At school, you have many more choices.\n\nIn conclusion, getting up at 6 AM is worth it. If you go to online school, you're on your own.

For instance, a smart student might not get their work done because they talk to friends in class. But if it's just the student and the teacher, there are no distractions. If the student is alone in their room, they won't be distracted.\n\nOnline classes are usually small. This is good because the student can talk to the teacher one-on-one. If the student needs help or doesn't get something, the teacher can spend more time with them. When the class is over, you're done. You don't have to wait for others. Online classes mean you study by yourself with your teacher.\n\nThe bad parts include not finishing the course. This happens when students get sidetracked by other things on the internet that aren't about school. They might also not finish their work or the course because it feels different from going to a real school. You can't meet other students or join clubs or sports at school. But, you can join a club or play sports outside of school if you pay.\n\nI think online classes help students more. They can focus because there are no distractions.

However, there is one good thing about online school. Students like online classes because they can turn in work until 11:59 PM. This means they have the whole day to work on assignments. They can also look up answers online. I know this because I took an English class online last summer.\n\nLearning at home doesn't have many good points. It means you will be on your computer a lot. This can hurt your eyes. You might need glasses. The biggest problem with learning at home is that it's a lot of work. It feels like doing twenty times more work than at school.

Next, cell phones can take away students' focus. Instead of doing their work, they might text or listen to music and not finish their work because they are looking at their phones.

It was hard. In 7th grade, my teacher let me use my phone to translate words I didn't know. Other students were upset because I was the only one who could use a phone. The teacher said I needed it to translate. Then the students started to help me learn more English. With their help and the teacher's, my English improved a lot by high school. In some classes, we can use our phones to look up information. But other teachers say phones are a distraction. I agree because phones can take our focus away.

I really think weekends should be three days long. I think we all go to work or school for eight hours every week; adding two hours won't make a big difference for us. I think our schools should make the school day two hours longer.\n\nThe first reason is to make the work place better for thinking and doing well. Work and school need all our focus to meet our goals. So, weekdays should be longer. We will have more time to finish our work. We can spend more time with family and friends. For example, I go to school full time at Wakefield High School. I also work part time. My week is very full. I don't have enough time to study.\n\nThe second reason is to improve our social lives. Life in the United States is usually very busy. We don't have time to be with our neighbors. I think this new plan will help us more. Sometimes, I can't see my family for a week. This is hard for many families. I think making the school day two hours longer is better for us.\n\nHowever, some people think adding two hours is too much. They say working ten hours a day is too hard. This is true, but we get three full weekends to rest. I would rather work longer and have three-day weekends. It saves energy and resources.\n\nIn conclusion, Arlington Public Schools should make the school day two hours longer. You can see that a four-day school week could solve many problems we have now.

In the past, this wasn't true because we didn't know about many things we use today. Spending our things can lead to trips to the countryside, and many people want to fix this by working fewer hours and days to save things. If we bring this idea to our schools, think of the extra time students would have for jobs, homework, study, sports, and more. This could happen if we cut school to four hours and make classes longer. But students might not like it because they are used to going to school for eight hours, five days a week. They know this routine, and changing it to save things might be hard for them. For example, two soccer players have a game in a week. One trains for four days and rests for three, while the other trains for six days and rests for one. The first player has more energy for the game because he trained less. But the second player, who trained more, might play better because he practiced a lot. This could be like a student who has more free time outside of school. We can save things, but there might be downsides. It's better to keep the usual school schedule of five days and eight hours, use less energy and computers, use more books and less internet, and start new ways to save energy in the school. Teachers can try new ways to teach with fewer things and come up with new ideas for working with students. We don't need to cut work or school hours to one day when they can use that time for better things in their lives.

When students fail, they want to know why and fix it for next time. By fixing their mistakes, they become smarter and won't make the same mistake again. In sports, when players fail, it doesn't mean they're bad at the sport. Failing makes them practice more so they can win next time. It pushes them to work harder. You have to work hard to get what you want, especially if others want it too. If you keep working hard, you will eventually get what you want. At work, getting the job you want doesn't always happen right away. You might not get it the first time. Many people might want the same job, so it's tough.

That's why it's better to go to school for five days and six hours a day, to have job chances and great jobs, than not to study and have bad jobs. It's better to study five days a week and six hours a day to get good jobs than not to study and end up with a tough job that doesn't pay well. It would be great if every country had schools and better chances for everyone to read and write. Schools don't need to be like a regular workday."}
{"text_id": "923BD228CDDA", "output_essay": "Hello, thank you for letting me talk about the plan to make the school day two hours longer and have a four-day school week. I think we should not do this because it will mess up the students' daily routine. Adding two hours will make it tough for students to handle other things like taking care of brothers or sisters, working, or playing sports. They will not have enough time for schoolwork. This will stress them out. They might not finish their homework or practice enough. This could make them fail the year. \n\nThe second reason this plan is not good is because of the four-day week. Students often need more time to remember what they learn. With a three-day weekend, they might forget what they studied. Also, many students use weekends to relax or spend time with friends and family. \n\nMy last point is about the parents. They are scared to leave their kids alone for too long. They worry about bad things happening while they are at work, which is usually eight to ten hours. This will stress the parents. The longer school day will also mess up the family's schedule. For example, it will be harder to plan a birthday party. Kids will have to rush home and won't focus on school as much as their social life. This could make them fail. Also, their sleep will be messed up. This will hurt their health and schoolwork. They will do badly in school, and after-school activities will suffer because students are too tired. For all these reasons, I think this plan is not the best for our students, teachers, or parents."}
{"text_id": "38A9AEE19B1D", "output_essay": "Have you ever tried something, failed, and then stopped trying? Former British leader Winston Churchill once said, 'Success is moving from one failure to another without losing hope.' I think he's right. Failing doesn't feel nice, but it can push you to do better and try your hardest. Many sports players, musicians, and actors have failed before; after a bad time, good things often come.\n\nFirst, everything happens for a reason. True, failing isn't nice, but it can push people to improve. For instance, when I was young, my soccer team didn't win the trophy. But we wanted to win the next year, so we practiced every day after school until it got dark. Our hard work paid off, and we won the trophy the next year. I see failing as useful because I learn from what went wrong.\n\nSecond, not everyone wins the first time they try. Many sports players, musicians, and actors didn't succeed at first but made it big later. I failed 11th grade, but I didn't let that stop me from finishing school. I thought about quitting, but I stayed. My teachers helped me pass my classes. Now I'm in my last year, and I'm going to finish no matter what.\n\nThird, I always say that no matter how bad things get, good times will follow. Many people lose hope and stop trying when they fail. They should be patient. Being patient is important for success. Trying hard is also important. You can be patient, but without hard work, things won't go as you want.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe failing is useful. While some people quit, those who use it to keep going will win because they have learned from their mistakes. Failing pushes you to do better and try your hardest. Many sports players, musicians, and actors have failed before. Good times often follow bad times; this is why I think failing is part of getting to success."}

{"text_id": "A7F29F16E2C2", "output_essay": "As a kid, we all learn a lot from the world and people around us. Life is tough, and even when you have problems, you must be brave and tackle them because that's life. I really think that success is about moving from one failure to another without giving up. Successful people have faced failures and learned from their errors. A hopeful person gets rewards for trying hard and staying positive. Successful people often have money because they stay excited and think positively. For example, if you sell things to support your family or pay for school, you'll face hard times. Some days you make money, other days you don't. This might make you wonder if you should try something else. You could be scared of not making any money based on past experiences. You could find a great job or fail, but you won't know unless you try. Failure is a part of life because we learn from it. No one is born knowing it all, and avoiding failure isn't easy because life doesn't come with a guide. Your experiences help you build your future and make smart choices. Another reason a hopeful person who wants to get better will likely be rewarded is because of their hard work and positive spirit. Even if things don't go your way, being positive and having a good attitude can lead to success. Failure isn't always bad; it shows you what went wrong and teaches you. If you keep failing, maybe it's not your time yet. Next time, you'll be ready for anything. Success in life is hard, and as you move forward, it gets tougher. Not everyone thinks the same. Some believe failure only brings sadness, fear, and can destroy your life. I agree that failure can scare you from trying again. We don't want to repeat mistakes, but avoiding failures won't bring success. If you run from your failures, it gets worse because you won't know how to handle the problem next time. If you think failure only causes sadness and ruins lives, it's because you didn't try hard enough and gave up too soon. When seeking success, no matter how often you fail, stay hopeful and try to understand why it happened. Failure makes us stop, think, and be sensible. In conclusion, success is about moving from failure to failure without giving up. To succeed, we all go through failures. Even if it gets worse, it's just life, and we must deal with it and learn. We learn from our mistakes, which makes us more successful. Being enthusiastic helps you stay calm and make smart decisions. So, failure can be tough, but it teaches you to be strong and smart. It's hard to accept failure, but there's always a way out. Many people in this country succeed because they make the best of any situation. Our excitement and never giving up are the keys to success despite failure."}

Should your school do the same by adding 2 extra hours to each school day?\n\nMany companies have changed to a four-day workweek.\n\nSome people think this is good, while others do not. What would happen if schools did this? In this essay, I will discuss the good and bad points of this idea. I will look at school schedules, costs, transportation, and whether a four-day school week is good or bad.\n\nFirst, having less school days can make students come to school more. With fewer days to miss, students might not skip as much. They would also be more eager to learn because they have more time to rest and get ready. Research shows that students came to school 20% more over two years.\n\nWith a four-day week, students get less homework. So, more students can hand in their work on time. Teachers also benefit because they have more time to plan and get ready for the week.\n\nTeachers would also have more free time. They would not have to work on weekends as much. Students could go to school events on their day off.\n\nSaving money is another plus. Schools would use less energy because they are open one less day a week.\n\nI think a four-day school week is better. Students would want to go to school more, and teachers would be less stressed. I support this change and believe many students would agree. A four-day week would make life simpler and school a better place to learn.\n\nIn conclusion, a four-day week is good for students and teachers. They would have more time for other things and do their jobs better. But the best part is they would enjoy school more."}

{"text_id": "6AC5C9BCE8D1", "output_essay": "Winston Churchill once said, \"Success is about moving from one failure to another without losing your excitement.\" Some people think success is only about the good things you do. They believe if you fail, you weren't good enough to get what you wanted. I think that not giving up when you fail is the real way to succeed. This is because you learn from mistakes, get what you want, and become a better person.\n\nOne reason is that when you fail, you learn from your mistakes. If you are smart, you will learn from the wrong choices you made before. We all make mistakes. When we do, we should learn from the problems and experiences we face. Don't be upset if you fail; you will always learn from it. We are human and not perfect. We make choices, and sometimes they are bad, but we always learn from them.\n\nAnother reason is that if you keep trying and don't give up, you will get what you want in life. Some people might be negative and tell you to stop trying, but don't listen to them. Keep fighting for what you want. When you get it, you'll see that failure didn't stop you from staying positive and getting what you wanted. You might face hard times, but if you really want something, don't give up easily.\n\nThe last reason is that you become a better person when you get what you want in a positive way. If you don't let failure beat you, you'll improve every day. You'll show others that quitting and failing are not choices for becoming better and getting what you want. All the good things you do will lead you to success.\n\nAs you can see, failure doesn't stop you from getting what you want. When we understand that quitting is not a choice, we will see the results of our hard work. Then, our world will be better, with many people chasing their dreams and understanding that failure is just a hurdle, not a reason to quit."}

These classes help students who are shy to become more open. Every student and parent should take these classes seriously because the more support students get, the better they do.

I believe these classes are very important for our students today. So, I think these classes should be needed to graduate. Everyone should finish these classes before getting their diploma.\n\nMusic classes make kids calm. Music keeps away all the bad thoughts. With music and drama classes, kids can feel free. In these classes, you can talk about anything. You can share your thoughts and just be free. So, all students should join. It's good to try new things to change.\n\nDrama classes are about acting, so you can act out your sadness. It's the best way. For example, Generic_Name had a bad day. He doesn't talk to anyone. He started going to a drama class. Generic_Name is quiet and keeps to himself. He notices he's not the only new one, but he still stays quiet. He watches others trying to make friends, but he doesn't want to talk. Then the teacher asks everyone to say something about themselves. With everyone encouraging him, Generic_Name finally feels brave and starts talking. So, drama class really helps you to talk and be more open with yourself."}
{"text_id": "79B8B054C586", "output_essay": "Having a four-day weekend might seem good. Getting three days off sounds great. But even good ideas can have bad results. One bad result of this idea is having to work for ten hours at a time. This is longer than the usual 7-8 hours. This can be hard and hurt our minds. Let me tell you why it can hurt our minds and health. First, people can only work so much before they get too tired. If they work too much, they might get very stressed. This could lead to a breakdown or even an anxiety attack. In the worst case, it could lead to death. Second, working so much can make a person's body weak. They might get too little sleep. They would feel sleepy all the time. This could cause problems. They might not focus on their work. They could hurt themselves or others. Also, some people work at night. They might not like this idea. This change will affect every job. It doesn't matter if the job is indoors or outdoors, hard or easy. Third, working too much can make a person feel bad. They might feel angry, stressed, sad, or worried. They won't feel happy. Some people work only seven hours and still feel bad. Think about working ten hours. They won't be happy. You might think, 'What about the three days off? Can't they rest and have fun with their family?' But that doesn't really help. Three days off doesn't make up for working ten hours for four days. When a person feels angry, tired, stressed, and worried, it's hard to feel happy. It's hard to feel normal again. They will just think about going back to work on Monday. The stress will come back. So, it's not a good idea to work only four days and have three days off. It won't be good for the world or work. Now you understand the health problems this plan can cause. Let's stick to working 7-8 hours a day, five days a week, with two days off. This way, people can stay healthy in mind and body."}

Others think that failing makes people less excited. I really think that success is about moving from one failure to another without losing your excitement. Failing always makes you keep going, do your best, and learn from your mistakes.\n\nFirst, failing isn't the worst thing; not trying is. Failing makes you want to keep trying until you reach your goals. For example, I didn't pass my US/VA History test last year with a score of 399, which was very disappointing. But I chose to try again, studied hard, and passed with excitement. Now I'm happy I didn't quit. If I hadn't tried, I would be in that class again. Trying lets you reach all your goals and win.\n\nIn fact, doing your best and working hard are key to success. Everyone who is successful, like business people, doctors, politicians, lawyers, and teachers, got there by working hard. I have a friend who works very hard in business. He doesn't sleep much. He works at night, in the afternoon, and goes to school during the day. He wants to make enough money to put into his business. His business is growing because he works so hard. So, working really hard and doing your best is good and leads to success.\n\nAlso, mistakes show that you are trying. We learn and get better from our mistakes. For instance, a classmate was scared of speaking in public and reading aloud because her English wasn't perfect. She decided to try, and even though she made mistakes, it helped her get better at English. Mistakes are there to teach us, not to keep making the same ones.\n\nTo sum up, success is about not giving up even when you fail. Trying is better than not knowing what could have happened. You can reach all your goals and win if you stay excited. Working really hard and doing your best is good and opens new chances. Don't let fear stop you, and learn from every mistake you make."}

They like to be in a classroom and hear the lessons spoken. Everyone learns in different ways.\n\nOnline classes are like reading books on a computer. You have to learn everything by yourself. Going to school helps you learn more about all your subjects. If you have problems with any subject, you can ask teachers and classmates for help.\n\nLearning from home might change your social life. Meeting other students at school is a good way to make friends. Having a daily routine at school helps you grow up. It teaches you to be on your own and handle your duties. It gets you ready for the future. Even though getting up early is hard and makes you tired, you need to think about the future you want.\n\nSchool gives you chances for many things. Online classes don't offer trips, fun dances, sports, or clubs. If you go to school, you can make memories that you will value later.\n\nLearning from home is not good; you miss out on many chances and fun times. I really don't agree with taking classes at home.

They ask their parents to buy the games for them. At first, they don't know how to play and lose a few times. That's fine. Soon, they learn and start to win at the game. This is true for teens and adults too. When they start a new job, they often fail because they don't know what to do. But with training, they get better and do well at work. Like when I started my job, I didn't know what to do. But my coworkers taught me, and I learned to do my job well. Still, everyone fails sometimes, and that's okay. Not everyone is good at everything right away. They have people to teach them how to succeed. High school, college, the military, and the government are good examples. High school teachers help students do well so they can go to college. Some study what their teachers taught them. Others work in government. But some don't go to college. They might not get jobs and turn to crime. Or they work regular jobs or join the military. Before they start, they get training so they don't make mistakes and fail. Everyone makes mistakes.

It's not the end of everything. Just don't quit. Second, it's better to be excited about what you're doing, even if you fail. It's good to try. Dreams are big, but your excitement is bigger. Doing what you love is worth it. If you fail, keep doing it with joy. You might want to quit if you think you'll fail. But don't let that feeling win. Your dreams and excitement are more important. Don't listen to doubts. They only make you fail. Being excited is more fun than being bored. Try new things and learn. If you fail, try again. You might win the next time. Being excited means you trust yourself and enjoy it more. In the end, don't stop chasing your dreams, even if you've failed a lot. Keep going, no matter if it's easy or hard. It's simple to quit, but you should keep chasing your dreams, even after big failures. Being excited helps you enjoy what you're doing. You might think you'll fail, but don't give up.

There are many reasons for this. \n\nRESPONSIBILITY\n\nWEATHER\n\nPRESSURE\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA\n\nACCESS TO INTERNET\n\nIt should be easier to go to classes from home than to go to school. Students should be more responsible for showing up, but it's easier because it's at home. More students who don't like school might show up, including those who skip because they don't like being there.\n\nBad weather is a big reason. Schools sometimes close because of snow, rain, or very cold weather. It's too risky for buses and for people who drive or walk. The roads are very slippery. People walking can fall and get hurt if they slip. When it rains, it's hard to see the roads, and it's similar with snow; cars can slip.\n\nTaking classes from home, online or by video call, should be simpler than going to school. Students can take classes in bed, just waking up with an alarm. Being on time should be an important responsibility. Doing homework might be good too. If there's a penalty for not logging in, like detention for not going to school, that could work. It's the same idea but easier at home. Parents wouldn't worry as much about whether their kids are at school. They might have more time for other things. Having everything online could make a big difference. Students should be able to join all the time without worrying about being late or missing the bus.\n\nBut not everything is good for students. If everyone agrees to this, what about those who don't have internet at home? It won't help them. Not everyone has internet, and they prefer to go to school for that reason. I don't think schools will give out internet just for home classes.\n\nAnother downside is if the teachers online don't explain well and we have questions, but there's not enough time, we won't understand. When tests come, we might fail. Online classes aren't the same as in-person ones. At school, we can have extra time with teachers to help us understand.\n\nAlso, if students are doing badly, online classes won't tell us. At school, we have counselors and tutoring. Students won't get that at home. It's a big responsibility to learn at home, but some students are too lazy. They'd rather do other things than take classes. There's a lot of technology and social media that distract teens. At school, teachers and security tell us what's right. At home, students will do what they want.\n\nI think the last two years of school should be at home because those students know what they want. Teachers should focus more on the other students to prepare them for online classes.\n\nSchool teachers can decide in meetings which students should take online classes.

They can also look for videos or pictures to help them understand. \n\nStudents sometimes don't do homework because it's boring or they forget. Teachers can fix this by making online tasks or fun websites for homework. If a student misses school, they can use the website to catch up. Many students work after school and are too tired to do homework at night. Teachers can help by putting links to needed information online, making it easier for these students. If students miss school, teachers can put class stuff online. This way, students won't fall behind and can use their phones to get the information. Teachers can make class more fun by using phones for online tasks. Reading can be more fun with online books that let students mark their favorite parts without ruining the book. \n\nStudents often pay more attention when using their phones. Teachers can use this by making class stuff with videos and pictures that students can see on their phones. Social media also grabs teens' attention. Teachers can set up chats on Twitter or Instagram for students to share ideas and class pictures and videos. This is good for quiet students or those who don't like talking in class. They might find it easier to talk online. But, using social media in class can be hard because it can distract students. To handle this, teachers could make an app to watch what students do, help them, and let them share thoughts. \n\nIn the end, students should be able to use their phones in class because they can be great for learning when used right. Schools should think differently. Today, everything is different; technology is everywhere, and we should use it well. With phones used smartly in class, learning can be easier, more fun, and less stressful. This could mean fewer students failing and more passing their classes. Phones can make class more fun and less stressful for students."}

Some people think cell phones in school help with classwork. Others think students misuse these devices during class. I believe cell phones distract students in school and at home. Even though some say students should use their cell phones for school research, in truth, cell phones distract because students use them to play games and watch shows like Netflix and YouTube.\n\nSome people say students should use cellphones in school for learning. They say students need them for missed work or emergencies. I think students misuse their cell phones when they can use them in class.\n\nStudents are losing focus in school because of games. Social media says a game called Fortnite is popular worldwide. Kids are hooked on playing Fortnite and other games. They lose focus when bored. Teachers are upset when they try to teach, but a student is not paying attention because they are gaming on their phones. Students ignore their work and don't do homework because they are busy with games or other fun things. Some kids stay up until 3 AM playing games online. They are too tired in school and fall asleep in class. Many think games like Fortnite grab these students' attention.\n\nWhat's next on the show? What's new online today? Netflix and YouTube are big distractions for some students. They can't wait to see the next part of a show on Netflix or a new video from a YouTuber. Teachers say kids hide to watch stuff during class. They don't pay attention to what's happening around them when watching a show. Parents are upset about bad grades, not knowing their kids play games or watch shows on their phones in class.\n\nIn conclusion, I think cell phones are a problem for students in class and at home. Using cell phones wisely can help teachers and students. There's time for games, shows, and YouTube. Students should finish classwork, listen to teachers, and do homework first after school. Then there will be no problems. Students will do well in school, and no one will fall behind!"}

I think failure is important, and not everyone thinks the same way. Today, leaders are very important to us, especially to young kids. They shouldn't give up when they fail. I believe we should listen to different views, even if we don't always agree with them. Leaders always keep this in mind. Some people are upset about this idea of success because it seems unfair. That's why I don't agree with it. When failure happens a lot, it usually means something isn't working. That's why people are afraid to keep trying. But we should all chase our own dreams. The top leader doesn't always know what's best for everyone. When it comes to failure, we should stay excited about the future. By sticking to this idea, they have turned away from thoughts that used to be accepted more often. If success is about changing and getting better, then we should support each other, no matter our situation, and try not to lose too much."}
{"text_id": "C20B49FBE2AF", "output_essay": "What's the best way to learn? I think kids who study from home have good things going for them because they can do their schoolwork any time during the day. For example, they can hand in work after their job because they have lots of time. A student in online classes has more time to sleep, eat breakfast, and start work when they're ready. They don't need to get up as early as others who go to school. There's less work; you have more time for your tasks, and if you have more online classes, you can finish them since there's plenty of time to do the lessons. It's great if a student doesn't like going to school because they have another way to learn. Also, if you finish your online work, you can take a break until there's more to do. Once you're done with the year's work, you're free for the year. These are the reasons I think online classes help some students. But there are also bad points about online classes. You don't have someone to help when you're stuck with homework. You might be very confused and not know what to do. If your internet goes out, you can't hand in work. Or you might forget to do your online work. You have to finish work in a set time. If you're late, you might fail the online class. Another bad point is that you don't get to talk to other students and teachers face to face. Plus, if there are problems with the website, it's hard to finish your work. These are the bad points of online classes. If I had to choose, I would go to a regular school. You might have website or internet issues, or you might forget the work. But in school, you can talk to the teacher if you're having trouble or need extra help."}
{"text_id": "A5DCC6948E4E", "output_essay": "I was surprised when I read about SpaceX. They found a new way to send rockets to space and back to Earth. SpaceX, a company with no experience in making rockets, began with a simple idea. They wanted to make space travel possible for many people, not just a few. But big projects need a lot of work and commitment. SpaceX faced many issues early on. The biggest issue was how to land a rocket so it could be used again. They failed a lot and lost lots of money. No one thought they could do it. Now, SpaceX is very successful and earns a lot of money by sending satellites to space. Failing is a key part of getting to success. Without failure, no one can learn from their mistakes. Failing helps keep excitement and the drive to finish a project. It is also very important for coming up with new ideas.\n\nEveryone wants to succeed, but many are scared of failing. People think they will lose something if they fail. They don't see that without failing, they can't succeed. Failing is a chance to learn from what went wrong and how to fix it. For instance, I had to build a rocket for my science class. I couldn't figure out how to make it work. I was very worried because the presentation day was soon. I made a test rocket to see what could go wrong. The test rocket was a total failure; it didn't even take off. But I learned from the mistakes I made and fixed them for my final project. On presentation day, my rocket worked well. I succeeded because I learned from the failure.\n\nExcitement is often why we do things. When someone is excited about something, they keep trying, even if they fail. And sometimes, people can't handle failing. They do their best to reach their goal. People who really want something and keep going don't get scared easily. Excitement can make people work harder, and failing is part of that. If someone fails, their excitement helps them keep going until they succeed.\n\nNew things happen every day; a new phone, a new car, this is all about coming up with new ideas. Companies come up with new things to stay ahead. Some fail, but that's not always bad. When they fail, they realize they made a mistake. This helps them make new things or improve and do better than before. For example, a farmer grows only corn in the summer. He sells it to all the stores around. But one day, people don't want as much corn. The farmer struggles and thinks about selling the farm. Then he gets a great idea: why not build chicken houses and sell chickens to big companies? The farm would make more money and be more stable. Keeping on trying new things, even if we fail, is the best way to succeed.\n\nFailing is something we will face a lot in life. The best we can do is learn from it. If we keep failing, we must stay excited about our goal and keep coming up with new ideas. Failing is important because it teaches us lessons we won't forget. It helps us deal with future problems better."}

This is because they want to be great, and they won't stop until they reach their goal.\n\nFirst, wanting to be great and working hard is one key to success. Some people want to be great. This is their main goal in life. But they may not know how hard it can be to make this happen. They will have to face some tough times.\n\nSecond, to be successful, they must never quit. This is a very important way of thinking. It makes them keep trying for their goal. The choice to never quit is often the most important key to success. This is because bad things happen often in real life.\n\nFinally, there are many ways to be successful, and success can happen in different areas. Being successful doesn't just mean having a lot of money. It means making your dreams or ideas come true. If you work hard and still fail, don't stop. You might be doing the right thing, but in a different way. So keep going, and remember that success is about effort and failing many times."}
{"text_id": "05118F820085", "output_essay": "I believe that students won't get much from taking classes at home. It will be harder for them to study or do homework alone. Online classes or video calls are harder than being in a classroom with a real teacher. At home, there are many things that can distract them, like kids, noise, and pets. This makes it hard to focus on studying. So, home isn't a good place for learning. Students have trouble focusing on their work at home. Some students don't like to study. They choose to stay at home because no one will scold them if they skip homework or don't prepare for a test. They can feel bored, tired, or upset if they can't do something and no one is there to help them. This can lead to feeling hopeless or getting headaches. The best way for students to do well is to go to school. There, they can get help from teachers and learn more than at home. They can also do activities like sports or music. These things can help them have a great future."}
{"text_id": "C31019435CBC", "output_essay": "Winston Churchill once said, \"Success is about moving from one failure to another without losing your excitement.\" I think he's right because if you fail and then stop trying, you won't get what you want. You won't succeed. Many people today quit too soon and don't reach their dreams. They're scared they'll fail again. But if you keep going and believe in yourself, you can make it. Nothing is easy. If you want something, you must work hard for it, even if you fail many times. Don't quit too quickly.\n\nIf you dream of being someone important and having a good future, you need to think about how to make your dreams come true. You must look for ways to reach your goals. If things don't go as planned, try again but differently. Believe that you can do it. I've seen many people lose their excitement because they didn't make it on their first try. They didn't want to see their mistakes, which is why they didn't reach their goal. Instead of trying again, they gave up and moved on. In the end, they end up doing something they never thought they would, something they didn't dream of.\n\nPeople who don't quit often succeed because they keep going, no matter the problems. For instance, my sister didn't pass her driving test the first time. She was upset but kept studying and passed the next week. She was very happy. She didn't quit. Sometimes, you just need motivation. When I or someone else motivates me, I feel like I can do what I want. I just have to believe in myself and not lose my excitement.\n\nI think that when we fail, it's a lesson. If something goes wrong, we shouldn't quit just because we failed. It's not the end. We must keep trying and not repeat the same mistake. Life is hard, but that's no reason to quit after one failed try. This country offers many chances to succeed if you work hard. As teenagers, we can choose to succeed or fail, to quit or keep going. No matter the problems, never quit. There's always another way to succeed. Life is like a game. You decide if you want to win or lose. You must find a way to win and not quit. If you lose, try again until you win. When you have a goal, find a way to reach it. Believe in yourself and your ability to do it.\n\nIn conclusion, not giving up, even after many failures, will lead to success. If you keep trying, you will reach your goal. You might try many methods, but eventually, you'll make it. If you failed once, you might not fail again if you learn from your mistakes. People who keep trying are more likely to succeed than those who quit after their first try."}
{"text_id": "CF2D1F83542F", "output_essay": "Do you think students should learn from home? I don't! I believe students shouldn't learn from home because it's not needed. Why? Because most students need to get ready to work hard and go to school. Today, we have lots of technology to help us learn better. We have schools to learn important stuff instead of learning from home. Some women who have babies can learn from home so they don't miss out on school; this is a good choice for them.\n\nFirst, going to school is better than learning from home because students might get lazy. For instance, students at home can eat anytime and study too; they can use the bathroom without asking. But this is bad because we have the energy and ability to go to school and learn more there. Also, we have more trouble when some students don't get it, so they choose to learn from home. They don't have a teacher to help them or give them advice on solving problems. You can't take things seriously, and you have to work alone, not with others.\n\nSecond, some students don't use their chances well. You should be thankful for what school gives you, or you'll keep making mistakes. To improve, you must make smart choices. Every student thinks differently about studying; some waste time on their phones instead of studying. This is bad because they won't do well in the future. Students like to risk their learning because they copy from others instead of doing hard work themselves.\n\nThird, parents must take charge. If they don't fix their kids' bad habits, then the kids won't enjoy school. At school, there are rules to follow. At home, there are no rules, and that's why some students get spoiled. School is for those who really want to learn. Students should always be getting ready because it's the best way to do well in life. If you give your best, it doesn't matter where you are, at school or home. When you want something, you do it well and succeed.\n\nIn conclusion, students shouldn't learn from home; it's a bad idea that can hurt your future. You need to work hard for better chances. Learning from home doesn't help, so you should go to school and rely on yourself. If you want to achieve something, 'Don't be lazy, you can do it, be proud of who you are.'"}

We have new technology that can help us do well today. I believe we should use cellphones in class for learning. Students always have their phones. We should use them for playing games that make learning easier. Most students don't like filling out study guides. They prefer to spend time with friends, family, or on their phones. If learning is like a game on their phone, they will want to do it. Using cellphones for learning is a new way to help students when they are confused. If a student misses class, the teacher can send them the work on their phone or computer. Students miss school and fall behind. But with their phone, they can get what they missed and keep up. Cellphones have gotten better, and students can do all their work on them. Even if they miss class, they won't miss the work. Some people think cellphones in class are bad because they distract students. Some teachers don't like students using phones all the time. They worry students will use social media instead of doing the lesson. If a student is not in class, they might not get the work the teacher sends if there is no signal. Not everyone agrees on using cellphones in class. In the end, I think we should use cellphones in class for learning. They help students understand their work. Teachers can work faster if all students use their phones. This lets them move on faster. I have given examples of why using cellphones in class is a good idea.

Some wonder, \"Should my school add two more hours to the school day to save energy?\" Like businesses that spend time on this, they think schools should too.\n\nI believe that as a student, it's important to save energy and resources because it helps us a lot. Energy is key for us. It gives us light, and we need light to work and go to school. The good things about saving energy are more than the bad things. A bad thing is that workers who spend four hours a week on this might earn less. They work 40 hours a week, so less work means less money. But a good thing is they show they care about saving energy and resources.\n\nIf students have school for four days, they will miss a lot of class time. If they spend two extra hours a day on saving energy, they will learn even less. This is like workers getting less money. But if students only add two hours a week, they will learn more. Students should do this, like some factories, because it's good for us. They can do activities on Saturday mornings. They can make signs with pictures about saving energy. This way, we won't run out of energy. There are many things we can do as students. For example, we can visit homes and talk to people. We can ask them to join us.\n\nWe should tell others how to use less energy. For instance, we should turn off the TV when no one is watching. This saves a bit of energy and money. Also, we shouldn't leave lights on when we're not home. This wastes energy, but people don't realize it. Working together is better because we come up with more ideas and are more creative.\n\nWe all should care about saving energy and resources. When we know it's for our comfort, we'll want to do it. But if we don't, we'll regret it later. We need to do helpful things for our community and the whole world. It's for our good, and we should keep saving what benefits us."}

Every year, cell phones can do more than just make calls and send texts. Now, students can listen to music, watch videos, and play games on them. Some schools want to let students use cell phones for learning, but others don't agree. This raises a question: Should students use cell phones in class? Even though some people say yes, I think they shouldn't because cell phones can distract them and they might chat instead of studying. \n\nSome people say cell phones are good in class. They say students can look up information and handle emergencies with them. \n\nOne reason cell phones should not be in class is that they can distract students. For example, my friend Generic_Name was a good student until he started playing games in class. At first, he played for just five minutes and his teacher didn't mind. But after two months, he became one of the worst students. He couldn't stop playing, even though his teachers and friends tried to help. He only thought about the games. If he hadn't used his phone in class, I believe he could have gone to a top university. I don't understand how cell phones can change someone so much, but I've seen it ruin a life. \n\nAnother reason to not use cell phones in class is that students might chat. Once, during a math test, Generic_Name sent me a photo of his new car. It was so cool that I started chatting with him about it. When I remembered the test, I had only 15 minutes left. I couldn't finish and got an F. Math was usually easy for me, and I could have gotten an A. Later, I made up the points, but I learned my lesson. We should talk about cars after school, not during a test or class. \n\nIn conclusion, even though some people support cell phones in class, I believe they shouldn't be allowed.

It's hard to do well in a class you're forced into. No one should worry about a class they don't like changing their grades. Not all students like music, drama, and art.

Many students around the world can't keep going to school for different reasons. But some still want to keep learning. So, they use what some schools offer, like learning from home. This way, they can join classes from home using the internet or video calls. Think about young people who have kids when they are 17 or 18 years old. Many are in 11th or 12th grade and can't go to school because they are pregnant or have a child. They have to handle being parents and students. Learning from home helps them join classes without leaving the house. Also, older students who have only a few classes left but work full-time might choose to learn online. This is a good choice because it lets them work, make money, and learn from home. They can finish high school, go to college, and keep their jobs. Students like learning from home because it gives them time for other things like watching younger brothers or sisters, playing sports, or doing what they like. Many students want to do these things but can't because they have to be at school. Young parents often feel upset because they can't go to school. This can cause trouble at home and make it hard to finish high school. Being able to learn from home is a big help that schools can give. Also, many 12th graders take online classes. They go to school for just a few classes and then go to work or do other things. This helps them finish school while they work and take care of other duties. Most students like to stay home and do things they enjoy instead of going to school. That's why some pick online classes. This lets them join clubs, get jobs, or just stay home and play video games. In the end, being able to learn from home can protect many futures. It helps students deal with family problems, earn money by working, and keep learning all at the same time.

{"text_id": "881D383DDED7", "output_essay": "Failure: Try Again and Again Until We Succeed\n\nLots of people, like Prime Minister Winston Churchill, think that success is moving from one failure to another without giving up hope. Many well-known scientists and inventors began this way until they made it. I agree with him because failing doesn't stop us; we can learn from what went wrong, keep faith in ourselves, and finally succeed.\n\nFirst, we can learn from our mistakes. If we fail, we should understand our errors. Try hard to improve. Every failure teaches us something. We might feel sad, but next time, we will do better. It's okay to fall many times; just get up and keep moving.\n\nSecond, we must have self-belief. Failure is just a pause on our journey, and it's useful because we learn. We must trust in our actions, and not let anything break our dreams. Think that we can improve and never stop believing in ourselves. The most important thing is to keep our self-belief.\n\nThird, we should keep going until we make it. By working hard and keeping faith in our work, we try to get better and fix our errors. Don't quit, even if it seems all is lost. Nothing can hold us back if we keep trying to improve. Gaining knowledge and achieving success will show that we can do anything, despite many failures.\n\nIn conclusion, success is about moving from failure to failure without losing hope because hope is about trusting in ourselves and our abilities.

There are many examples that show why failing is important, like trying until you get it right, learning from what went wrong, and using what you've learned before.\n\nFirst, if we never failed, we wouldn't know if we did something well. Winston Churchill, a past leader of Britain, once said that doing well means you keep going even when you fail, without getting less excited. He was saying that it's important to keep trying, even when things don't work out. This idea is true and it teaches us that you can fail and still do well in the end.\n\nSecond, failing is part of life, and it happens in everything we do. Without failing, we wouldn't be able to tell if we did something well. Sports would be boring if no one ever failed; there would be no reason to get better, no need to practice and learn from mistakes. Doing well means you keep trying, even after failing, and you don't give up on your goals.\n\nThird, failing helps us learn. When a kid is trying to skateboard or ride a bike, they won't do it right the first time. They'll need to learn from falling down. Kids usually fall when they first try to ride a bike or skateboard. They have to fail before they can do it well.\n\nFailing is part of life. To do well, you have to fail first. This gives you a chance to succeed later. No one is born knowing how to do everything.

It makes me not want to learn, and sometimes I fall asleep. This is a problem because many students can't study at home. They like to study at school. Adding two more hours could help those who like school and those who can't work at home. But, they must also think about teachers who don't want to stay late to help students. They need to think about many things before making the school day longer.\n\nIf they make the day longer, students who don't want to stay should be able to leave. Those who want to stay should stay. A big problem is that students who stay could learn more than those who leave.

If a student is at school for ten hours, they might miss their parents. They might go to work and come home tired. They just want to sleep. They won't have much family time. Education is important, but so is family. Students might be ready for the future, but they won't have enough time with their family. They won't feel family love.\n\nImagine not seeing your child as a parent. How would you feel? What would your relationship with your child be like? Would you want your child to spend more time at school? If not, then it's not good to miss seeing your child and having family time.

It helps students learn, it can waste time, and it can cost a lot; students have to research a lot.\n\nFirst, learning from home with the internet or video calls helps students learn. When students use these methods, they can get more information and ask questions when they don't understand something. For example, many young people are too shy to speak up or ask questions in front of others. Learning online or through video calls makes it easier for them to ask questions and understand their lessons.\n\nHowever, learning from home this way can waste time and be costly. Some students have jobs and can't go to classes. They need to learn online or through video calls to get better grades. For instance, some students support themselves and must work to pay their bills. But, learning online or through video calls can save money because students don't need to drive or take taxis to class, which costs a lot.\n\nFinally, learning online or through video calls makes students do more research. They can look up things they don't know or want to learn more about. For example, if they find a new word or sentence, they can research it. This way, they learn more and gain new skills.\n\nIn conclusion, learning from home using the internet or video calls is good. It saves money and time, and helps students understand and research their subjects. Students who haven't tried learning this way should start now. It's helpful and good for all students."}

Should your school add two more hours to each school day? For some students who work before or after school, this could be helpful. These students often have to work at least 30 hours every two weeks and also attend school. But this change wouldn't be good for everyone, especially those who don't work and only go to school. For me, the good thing is that I can work and study because I leave school early. It's hard, but I manage. A downside is that I don't have much free time, but that's okay. I need to finish school so I can work and help my family back home. Some students leave school early and don't need longer school days. I think all students should be able to leave early if they need to work. Some students are on their own and don't get help from their parents. This makes things harder for them because they have to handle school and work. In the end, everyone should aim to finish school quickly and get a good job for the future. This means completing school and maybe college, while also working to make money. It's not simple, but it's not too hard either. You can do it if you really want to. Life is like a race that you have to finish. Everything costs a lot, but nothing is impossible. If you have a job, keep it and finish school.

This will explain how my school would change and how students might feel if the school day was longer by two hours.\n\nMaking the school day two hours longer would lead to students not wanting to come to school. They already find it hard to stay in class for even an hour. They would lose focus and start to walk around. Some students work after school and need to be at their jobs at a certain time. This is one reason why a longer school day is a bad idea. Students have things to do after school. Learning is key, but so is doing things outside of school. We can't stay in school for more than eight hours; two extra hours would hurt their learning and how often they come to school. Parents would complain about their kids getting home late. Sports and other activities would also finish too late, which is bad for the students.\n\nTeachers would run out of things to teach with two extra hours. They would plan their lessons, but spending more time with students would be too much. They already find it hard to handle them for half an hour. Students would lose the chance to come late or leave early because of the longer day, making them unhappy. We already don't like being in school for eight hours. Two more hours won't make us want to be here more. Students might just walk around or not come at all and leave. This would make the school look bad. It would seem like the staff and security don't care about the students just because the day is longer. Many things in the school would change; it would not be a happy place. Students would likely feel sad, learn less, spend less time in class, and not want to work. If the school day is longer, many bad things could happen. This shows why it's a bad idea to make the school day two hours longer. It could hurt both teachers and students.\n\nShould my school make the school day two hours longer? I think they should not because students would skip school more, and it would harm their learning. The examples show that no, they should not do this; it's not a good idea.

Teachers don't like it when kids use phones as it's rude when they are teaching. But, teachers let kids use phones if they don't have a laptop or are waiting to get one. For example, kids can use phones to play games like Kahoot or Quizizz in class.\n\nReason 2: Cell phones help a lot in school. For example, some classes need to measure and calculate things, but there aren't enough calculators for everyone. So, kids use their phones for math.\n\nFinal reason: English classes use cell phones too. Once, my teacher said we had to make a video about 'Romeo and Juliet.' We used our phones to film our parts, which helped us finish our work. Phones are handy in English, but we can't always use them.\n\nIn conclusion, cell phones are very helpful for learning.

For example, some teams get upset when they lose and then they quit.\n\nThe second reason Churchill's idea tells us to keep trying is that in life, we must always try. It's about staying alive, moving ahead, and trying again. When a team loses, everyone feels sad. For instance, making a mistake is not a failure because everyone makes mistakes; no one is perfect.\n\nLastly, people might call Churchill's people losers, but the team must show them it's not true. Don't listen to what others say. Some people enjoy seeing the team upset. For example, some might say the team played badly and then support the winning team.\n\nIn conclusion, we shouldn't quit. Churchill's idea should remind us that we can do it; we can be strong and not lose hope. Teams need to get better and practice more and ignore what others say because people like to gossip.

He started a small company with his uncle while he was studying, but it did not work out because they did not have enough experience. He tried to understand what went wrong and learn from it. Four years ago, he got over this bad time and, with more knowledge, he became a successful businessman. Success is about moving from one failure to another without losing your excitement.\n\nFor example, when I was in school in Mexico, I had a soccer team. I played for the school for three years, always practicing with my teammates and the coaches. When there was a big event at the state level, my school joined in with another 200 schools. We played 8 games and won them all. My school got to the semifinals, but we lost our first semifinal game. My teammates and I felt sad about losing, but the experience brought us closer, and we ended up winning the trophy. Still, the most important thing was to represent the school well and make it stand out among many others. If you never fail, you can't learn from your mistakes and find success.\n\nAnother example is Raul, a famous singer. In an interview, he said that he wanted to be a doctor before he became a singer. He was a good student, always paying attention in school, and his parents were very happy with him.

Those failures gave them more experience and helped them find different ways to get the success they enjoy today."}
{"text_id": "1F4C4154C034", "output_essay": "I agree with Winston Churchill because you can't be successful without failing. Many people fail many times before they succeed. They keep trying and stay excited. That's what you need to do to succeed. You won't succeed on your first or second try. When people fail at something, like a project or plan, they often ask, 'Oh God, why did you do this to me?' But failing isn't as bad as it seems. An old man once said, 'You learn the most from your failures and mistakes.' I think that's true. When you make a mistake, you shouldn't give up. You should look at what went wrong, try to fix it, and do better next time. That's how you start to succeed, even with small mistakes. There was a man five years ago who was in a bad place in a city called the Lost City. He had no home, family, job, or food. He had lost everything, and his wife had left him. He was so sad he tried to end his life but couldn't. One day, he wondered how to succeed. He saw plastic bottles on the street and thought he could make something to sell. He started collecting bottles, even though people thought he was crazy. He made toys from the bottles with an old knife he found. He made a cow, a horse, and a duck and tried to sell them at a toy store. But the store owner said no and threatened to call the police. The man was sad but didn't give up. He tried to make the toys better. Two weeks later, he tried to sell them at other stores, but they all said no. There was one store left, but he didn't go because he expected another no. The next day, he went, and a businessman wanted to buy his toys. The man was happy and sold them for five dollars each. The businessman asked him to make more toys. The man agreed, and his life changed. He made many toys, and they got better every day. The businessman helped him buy what he needed to make more toys and send them to other cities. The man became rich. But he had to fail and suffer before he succeeded. This man is a good example because he never gave up and worked hard to get what he wanted. He had failures, but that's normal before success. You should never lose your excitement because it's the energy you need. Failures teach us what not to do next time, and that helps us get what we want in life."}

We would have more time to do what we like. We would have more time for our hobbies and learning. But this change could make it hard for some students to do homework.

{"text_id": "E1DDD9115527", "output_essay": "Hello everyone. Today, I will talk about why homeschooling might not be the best choice. Homeschooling can limit a student's growth and skill-building. In a regular classroom, students learn to talk to others, work together, and lead. They solve problems together and understand the importance of teamwork. Homeschooled students might miss out on these skills. This could hurt them later in life. Students often try to be the best in class. They want to get good grades and be faster than others. This competition makes them work harder. But homeschooled students working by themselves might not push themselves as much. They might think they are doing their best when they could do better. For example, a new athlete may feel confident until they see others who are more skilled. This makes them want to improve. Being in a group is great because students can help each other. It's less stressful too. If there's a group project, everyone has a role. They share ideas to make the project better. Group work also saves time. Working alone is harder. The student has to do everything and might miss some mistakes that others could spot. Some students might like to study at home. But being in class and joining in helps them remember what they learn. At home, they might not work as hard and take longer to finish tasks. In a classroom, they have to finish in a set time. In the end, students who go to class will likely do better than those who study at home. This is because they join in activities and learn with others. They learn to solve problems in new ways. Homeschooled students don't get as much practice in talking to others, working in teams, or leading because they have to do things by themselves."}

In many ways, we all fail sometimes. Church members can mess up. If they're in a church band, they shouldn't drink or go to parties outside the church. If they do, that's messing up. A pastor might do something wrong too. But if he keeps going and learns from it, that's good. If someone keeps messing up in relationships, like going on a date and then breaking up because they did something wrong, that's failing. But if they understand their mistake and learn, they'll do better next time. Failing means learning from what went wrong. A student might fail all her classes because she got distracted, like having a boyfriend and a baby. That's failing too. But if she doesn't quit and learns, she can still reach her goals and be successful. Some people believe failing is part of success because it teaches us. Others don't like it because they feel too weak or afraid to fail. In the end, we should learn from our mistakes. Whether we fail at work, school, or church, we shouldn't quit or be afraid.

Some kids who like more alone time might think this is a good idea. Technology that helps us is always getting better, and this could be a way for us to use it well. For instance, if you have to travel or do something important, you can go online and see what you need to do. Another point is that you won't have to bring a big folder; you can just take your laptop. Your laptop helps you stay organized with different programs, and you can keep your notes on it. These days, many people lose papers, which are easy to misplace. Since the laptop needs Wi-Fi, you can go online and look up things you don't understand. The internet has many tools to make your life easier. Also, teachers could give more time to each student. I believe that writing is the best way to show what you know, and teachers would trust students more. They would be more willing to talk with them, and it would be easier to communicate. Sure, talking face to face is very different, but they might not share their thoughts and could be shy, maybe because they don't feel free or because of other kids in the class.

They might think they can find all answers on their phones. If students keep their phones in their bags, they'll have to listen to the teacher. Then, test scores will go up. Parents will be mad if their kids fail. The kids might not be allowed to use their phones anymore. When it's time for tests, students will think about their phones and not remember the study material. Students who study on paper will do better. They might get distracted if they try to use their phones for help.\n\nListening to the teacher is better than looking things up online. If you're having trouble, the teacher can help, but a phone can't. The teacher will make sure everyone gets the lesson. Some online programs are helpful, but you're more likely to pass if the teacher explains things. Learning from a person helps you understand better because the teacher knows the subject.\n\nIn the end, if people argued about who helps more, the teacher or the phone, the teacher would win. Test scores show this. Online resources might give you test answers, but you won't remember them as well. The phone won't go over the test with you, but the teacher will help you with what you don't get. That's why phones shouldn't be used when learning."}

They should use their phones to look up words they don't know. For example, if Generic_Name, who doesn't speak much English, couldn't use his phone, he wouldn't understand some words. Students should be able to look up answers to questions and read books online that the school library doesn't have.\n\nAlso, students should use their phones to talk to each other. They could call or text a friend who is sick or has a family problem and can't come to school. They should be able to text about homework. For example, Generic_Name often forgets his homework. His friends text him in class to remind him. Without phones, how would students talk about homework or school events? Without them, it would be hard to get work done.\n\nIn the end, students should use their phones in class to find information and talk to each other. Teachers might worry that phones will make students play games, use social media, or sleep while listening to music. But not all students will do this. Many know that school is important. Please talk to your school's head about letting students use phones. Phones are not just for fun; they are important for school."}

{"text_id": "BC4212B1546A", "output_essay": "British leader Winston Churchill once said, \"Success is moving from one mistake to another without giving up hope.\" I believe that making mistakes is key in our social lives. People who do well in their work have better times at work and at home, and they also do well in school. First, people face tough times with family or friends. For instance, a family chooses something for their son, but he doesn't like it, and then he makes another mistake. This causes trouble with others or an accident. The son then starts to think about making a smart choice for his future. Mistakes and failures can lead to a good education. In school, many students fail tests or English as a Second Language classes. Some students don't enjoy learning, so they fail. But others find motivation in their failures. Today, we have great leaders, doctors, engineers, and lawyers who have all made mistakes and failed, but they kept their hope to succeed in life. Also, people do better at their jobs. At work, mistakes happen because of risky choices or problems. For example, Barack Obama was a U.S. president. He made risky choices and took action. When he began his campaign, he faced issues and setbacks because of his race or attacks against him. He got past these to become president and to help others. Even though he sometimes failed as president, he later made better choices. Still, some people don't agree with Churchill. They think that people who fail just keep failing and make poor choices that hurt others or the country. But I think making mistakes is important in our social lives; it leads to success at work, more life experience, and doing well in school. In the end, Churchill's idea that \"success is moving from mistake to mistake without giving up hope\" is right because mistakes are a big part of everyone's life. They help us build a better future and make wiser choices. That's why we have outstanding workers and people today."}

I think it's easier when someone teaches you in person. You can understand everything and do well. But not all students can come to school every day. Online classes help those who have to work and make money for themselves. For students who can't spend much time at school, online classes are better. They can learn and watch classes on the internet and can finish school from home. Still, I think students should choose if they want to study online. I believe it's better to go to school and learn face-to-face. When we have problems or questions, they can be explained, and we can understand better. For example, my friend goes to school every day. He does his work and learns a lot because he doesn't have a job. He has time to study and get good grades. He can focus on school, but if he gets a job, he might be too tired for school and might not like it as much. If I could switch to online classes, I wouldn't want to. I don't really like school. I don't go often because I need to make money. That's why I'm not at school much. Also, I find the language hard, but I try to get better every day.

The best part about online classes is that you can do them from home or anywhere else. All you need is a computer or phone with the internet. If the class is on a video call, you need a computer with a camera. That's it. So, I think schools that have online or video call classes can really help students finish school and have a better future. They can also work and support their family at the same time. Adults who didn't finish school can also take online classes. Even if you finished school, you can still study for a career on the internet without going to college.

They have more time to think deeply, instead of making quick decisions. Working at their own speed helps them focus and not worry about unfinished work or tight deadlines.\n\nWhen students are alone, they often think about what's best for them.

{"text_id": "46A763F7D942", "output_essay": "Everyone must work hard to reach their goals, like getting a job or studying for school. But we also need breaks to achieve these goals. I strongly believe that schools should make the school day two hours longer. This can lead to a better life. However, it's not good to make mistakes because we don't have enough free time for ourselves, to feel stressed, to get bad grades, or to miss time with our loved ones. I will also talk about a downside to making the school day longer.\n\nFirst, a longer school day is a good idea because it can help people feel less stressed. Being sick can hurt us in our minds and bodies. For instance, in my home country, my school had a very long schedule, and many students got sick from too much homework and tests. Some got very sad and had health issues like losing weight. Sadly, some gave up because they were too sad and had too many things to do, like keeping a scholarship. This was very hard.\n\nAlso, if students have more free time, we can do better in school. When I was at Tecnologico de Monterrey in Mexico, I had to stay at school for a long time. Sometimes I needed counseling. I often had too much work and forgot everything by the end of the semester. I even lost my scholarship once. So, I think having an extra free day is very helpful for many students. When I came to this country, I had more free time than in Mexico. I found that extra time helps you succeed. My grades improved, and I was on the honor roll all year.\n\nFamily is important, and we need to spend time with them. We should be grateful to our parents because they do so much for us. That's why we need more time with them. Often, I want to play or be with my dad or brothers and sisters, but I have homework or need to study. This year is tough for me because I have to take five SOL tests, an admission test in November in my country, and do my senior project. I've only been in this country for a year. I would like an extra free day to spend with my family and do all my work. My family means everything to me.\n\nOn the other hand, I think having two extra hours at school each day is the same as going to school five days a week. If I go to school for six hours a day for five days, that's thirty hours total. But if I add two hours each day except Friday—because I should get a free day then—I would get thirty-two hours total. Still, I think it's fair to have more school hours if it means I get four free days instead of just three. I will have more time to relax and get better grades. I would rather work a bit more at school and then rest. It will help me relax and spend time with my family.\n\nLastly, my school should make the school day longer because it helps everyone, even adults. Breaks are good for many reasons, and we all deserve free time for our supportive parents. We also deserve free time to do activities that keep us from feeling stressed and staying healthy. We need free time to do well in school, get good grades, and maybe get a scholarship for college. All these things give us energy and help us live better. Having more hours on fewer days in the week is better than being stressed all the time. To end, we are humans, not machines; we need breaks and time for things like family. In the future, we'll see how this improves our lives."}

Some think cell phones are bad because they can distract students. But cell phones are actually good for talking to others and looking up information. Having cell phones in class is a smart move and would help students.\n\nParagraph 1\n\nCell phones are important in schools for learning. Today, cell phones are a big part of our lives. We often use them to talk to people. We can also use them to check and do our homework. Cell phones would help our schools a lot.\n\nParagraph 2\n\nHaving cell phones in class can save the school money. Since many teens have smartphones, the school doesn't need to buy one for everyone. The school could use the saved money for classroom chargers or for clubs and sports teams that need new stuff. Some schools spend money on Chromebooks for students. That was a smart choice.\n\nCounter-argument\n\nPhones in class can distract students and make them less social. They might talk to friends on their phone instead of talking to classmates. If phones replaced Chromebooks, writing essays could be harder. But we can control how phones are used in class. Students can keep them in their bags until they need them. There are also apps for writing essays that can help students do well in school.\n\nConclusion\n\nSome schools in the country are starting to use cell phones to help with learning.

Failing guides us to success. It then pushes us to keep trying. Even though failures are tough, they teach us. We learn from the mistakes we make. Failing shows us what to do next to succeed. We make these mistakes. Failing should push us to keep going. When we fail, it's like people saying, \"You can't do it.\" This makes us want to show them they are wrong. The best success is showing doubters they were wrong about us. Failing is why we should want to succeed. Churchill's words mean that success is about moving from one failure to another without losing your excitement. Failing is a part of the road to success. It teaches and guides us. Failing is the reason and push we need to win."}
{"text_id": "AB2D5694FC11", "output_essay": "Do I agree with Winston Churchill's saying? Yes. Why do I agree? Success isn't just handed to you; you have to work for it. Many well-known people have succeeded, but did they always have it easy? No, they too have faced failure. They began by making plans for their future and how to handle it. Take Ms. Harriet Tubman, for example. She was an African American woman who fought to sit at the front of the bus. Did she win right away? No, she failed and the guards threw her out. But she didn't stop. She kept trying until the day came when African Americans could sit at the front of the bus. They could finally ride safely to home or work. Ms. Tubman wasn't successful at first. She fought against what was unfair to her and her people. She met failure and didn't quit. She worked hard on this fight, and something unforgettable happened that day for her. Failing, working hard, and not quitting are big steps toward success. How does this quote relate to me? One day, I almost gave up on getting a mountain bike I couldn't pay for. I thought about how to get it. Finding a job was hard; the city is busy, and many people want jobs. But I didn't give up. I kept looking and told myself, 'I will get that bike.' I got a job, worked hard, and earned enough to buy the bike I wanted. Now I can get to work on time and go anywhere without paying for rides. Think about this Churchill quote: 'Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.' What does it mean? I think he's saying that there will be challenges on the way to success. Life won't always go as planned. You'll have ups and downs. They come and go fast; you have to keep moving. 'Go with the flow,' my parents and great teachers always say. I remember this when I feel like quitting. Hope keeps us going. We feel it every day. I tell myself my successes are stories I'll tell my family and friends. I can't wait to share my achievements with them. Think about something you really wanted but couldn't have. If you got it, how did you do it? It's great to see what you can learn from failure. Not everything goes your way. Just stay hopeful and believe that what you're working for will be worth it."}

I believe in Churchill's idea that we must fail to learn how to rise to success. You also need to be strong in tough times, see why success matters, and sometimes share your success stories with others. Everyone has problems. You will always face issues, no matter how small, and they can upset you. You might think some people have perfect lives, but if you look at their past, you'll see they started with nothing and worked hard to get to the top. For instance, someone rich, living well, traveling, or owning a business might seem happy. But they likely faced many challenges to get there. Understanding success is key. It comes after many failures. Success and failure are linked. When you achieve something big, it's often after many hard nights and effort toward your goals. Your successes and their rewards come from overcoming many failures and problems. Next, we should show others that success is the answer to failure. When I moved to the U.S., I couldn't speak English, and it was tough starting school. I didn't understand much. But I watched videos and movies in English, paid more attention in class, and practiced with friends and family. There's a saying that success doesn't happen overnight. Hard work and focus are needed to reach your goals. In summary, to succeed, you must experience failure and learn from it. Problems will always try to stop you, but remember how success and failure are connected. By understanding this, we take life more seriously. And by sharing our stories, we can help others see that they can turn their failures into success."}

Imagine it's the end of the school year, and there's a big test you need to pass to go to the next grade. If you didn't learn anything because you were copying from someone else, you might fail. You might not have studied because of distractions like friends, TV, or your phone. But if you go to school, you won't have these problems. Teachers make sure you're not distracted.

But if they don't want to or don't care, it shouldn't be required. These classes should be a break, not a must.\n\nIn conclusion, we should only have to take classes that are necessary.

Other students and teachers won't like this idea. Schools should not make the school day longer by two hours. It could hurt our jobs, make us stressed, and take away our time at home.\n\nFirst, schools should not change the hours because it could hurt our jobs. Many students work; some have more than one job. Also, many students live on their own in this country. Making the school day two hours longer would hurt our jobs. In the afternoon, students who work start at 5:00 pm or 4:00 pm. If school hours change, we won't be able to work. Also, if we can't work, how will we pay for our lives?\n\nThe second reason I think making the school day two hours longer is a bad idea is because students will become very stressed. Also, sitting for ten hours will make us weak. Our minds won't be able to focus in class. Teachers will get tired of helping us. Our minds need a break. Younger students' minds are not as strong as older students'. They can't handle two more hours.\n\nLastly, changing the hours is bad for students because they won't have enough time at home. Teachers and students have things to do at home after school. Like cleaning, looking after brothers or sisters, and teachers looking after their kids. Some want to spend time with family and friends. We have a lot to do at home, like shopping for things we need. Our parents won't agree because we won't spend as much time as we usually do.\n\nIn conclusion, making the school day two hours longer is a bad idea. A four-day school week is enough. This decision could also hurt our grades and homework. Plus, adding two more hours to the school day could cause problems for all schools. We won't be able to work, focus in class, or have important time at home. I think this idea won't help students and teachers."}

It would not be a good idea to change to this four-day model.\n\nI think our school should not make the school day two hours longer. Many students have jobs after school and need time to plan their day well. Making the school day longer would cause more problems. Students would get tired from using their brains too much. It would also be hard to pay attention in class for so long, which could make students bored.\n\nThis four-day model does have some good points. It gives extra time for students who need to take tests again or stay after school. It also means a longer weekend, which sounds nice because students could rest more and do more activities.\n\nBut I don't agree with this model.

Keep trying hard and you will do well in life. Some people think they never mess up. That's not true. When you were a baby, you tried to walk, fell many times, but kept trying until you could do it. We all mess up sometimes and learn not to do it again. We get better. In school, we learn to know things and to avoid bad things. At work, we sometimes choose the wrong thing. We try to improve so we don't mess up again. We don't mind messing up because it helps us learn. The key is to keep trying. We are all human. We do many things, not all of them well.

It seems like a good idea, but it could have different results, some good and some not so good. Think about the students and how much work they have to do every day. They go to school for the usual time, and many might need more time to rest. Why? Because they might not have parents at home to help them. A lot of students' parents can't help them, so they have to work at night. This is very hard. I know because I am one of those students. When I go to school in the morning, it's tough. I have many classes, lots of homework, and other things to do. Often, I don't get enough sleep. After work, I have to do my homework. So, for me, studying two more hours is a bad idea. I know it's just two extra hours and only for four days, but it's also good for many people. Having only four days of school a week sounds amazing. The plus side is we get three days off, three days (Friday, Saturday, and Sunday) to work. But what about students who work? And their parents? Some downsides are that students won't have extra time for their hobbies, and they might not get enough sleep. But, it could be good for everyone, including teachers, if the extra work in school is planned well in those two hours. The school could start activity hours. This plan will save resources because of the water students use: for drinking, for the bathrooms, for washing their hands, and even for the people who cook in the kitchen or cafeteria, who use it to clean. We would save water, food, and other things used in the library. But we have to remember that every idea has its pros and cons. Now, think about it."}

She can only go out when the nurse takes her or if she goes with her family.\n\nFirst, her sickness can easily spread to others. It's not a small health problem; it's risky for people near her. Even her sister has to stay away so she doesn't get sick. Generic_Name stays home so she doesn't give her sickness to others at school. It's very sad to see her deal with this, not being able to do much but wait and hope to get better or learn to live with it forever. When her sickness gets worse, she has to stay home to take care of herself and not feel embarrassed around other people.\n\nGeneric_Name's health got worse in her last year of high school. So, her school and family thought it was best for her to study online for college.\n\nNext, her nurse at home is very important because of her sickness. The nurse helps with medical care, gives emotional support, and even helps with homework because she used to be a teacher. Nurse Generic_Name has been with her for two years, helping and comforting her when times are tough. They like to watch movies and play games together. Nurse Generic_Name is very good at her job and does more than just nursing to help Generic_Name as she grows up with her health problem.\n\nLastly, Generic_Name only leaves her house for very important reasons, with her nurse or family. She might go out for doctor's visits or family trips when there's no school. It's hard for her to decide to go out because her health is not strong and she feels a lot of pain.\n\nHer family makes sure she feels loved and important. They know she is kind and stays out of trouble. They wish she could get better and miss the times before she was sick.\n\nIn conclusion, I think students should be able to take classes from home if they have big health problems. Online classes are sometimes needed, and schools should help these students. No one should go to school and risk making others sick when they are not well. So, it's smart for students to be able to study online if their school says it's okay."}

Some students enjoy learning to play a new instrument, while others like learning to draw, and so on. My view is that such classes should be available as choices. I think this because some might say, 'This class is dull; I don't know why I'm here.' From what I've seen, letting students try these classes for a week or two is good. If a student doesn't like the class, they can switch to a different one. Making these classes choices is better because high school gets easier in the last years.

Some problems students might have are: not focusing as well at home, finding it easy to cheat without a teacher watching, internet problems, choosing when to study but not finishing work, and not getting to hang out with friends at school. \n\nSome students get easily distracted in school. They need a teacher to tell them to work and not get sidetracked. At home, with even more distractions, they will find it harder to focus. They won't have someone to tell them to be quiet or to pay attention. It's good to have someone to remind them of their tasks. \n\nAlso, it's easier for students to cheat when they are at home. Many cheat on tests to get good grades and pass. At home, they can look up answers online. Without someone watching, they can cheat instead of learning. If they keep cheating, they won't learn from their classes. \n\nTechnical problems can happen too, like internet issues during a class or test. Using computers for classes is not always reliable. Tech issues can make students miss lessons or fail tests. The screen might freeze during something important. It's important not to depend too much on tech. \n\nMost students don't like to study or do homework. If they could take classes at home, many would choose not to study because they don't want to. They would rather do other things. Without guidance, they might not understand or finish their work. Many don't do their work because they think it's not useful. They need to know that all subjects are important for future challenges. \n\nGoing to school is also good for making friends and doing things they wouldn't at home. Being around people and talking about different things is special. Some students go to school just to see friends. This makes them happy. It helps them have a social life and feel happier every day. \n\nIn the end, there are more bad points than good ones to taking classes on a computer from home. These problems can hurt a student's chance to study and do work well. This is important for learning more in school."}

Now, I will talk about energy and resources a bit more.\n\nMost energy and resources are key because they power our homes and cars. They can create jobs for people who don't have work and can make life simpler. As energy gets better, we can use natural things like sunlight and wind. These energy types never run out. We can use them in factories, which can save money for all of us, right? The Japanese use natural energy to make fast trains. These trains are the fastest in the world. Many companies work four days a week for ten hours each day. This is good because ten hours a day is plenty. If we use too many resources, they will run out.\n\nIf we overuse resources, they will finish. For example, if we cut all the trees for paper or furniture, and then there are no trees left, what will keep us safe from storms? If some places use too much energy, others may not have enough because it's not shared well. Also, as China's population gets very big, they need resources to build homes and other things. When resources are gone, they can't build more homes. So, some people might have to move to other countries to live.\n\nI think a four-day school week is good.

There are reasons why they might pick these classes on their own.\n\nThe first reason they should choose their own classes is to fill their schedules. After they finish their main classes like math, science, and history, students need other classes. These classes teach them about things they might not know yet. For example, in music, they might learn to play an instrument or sing the right way. An art class could show them how to draw and color in different ways.\n\nThe second reason is that these classes add points to their GPA for their high school diploma. Students should pick their own classes instead of someone else choosing for them. If students don't like a class, they might not go or pay attention. These classes could lead to new musicians, artists, and actors, but we can't be sure. Some classes, like computer information, might help them in their future jobs.\n\nThe third reason students need these classes is for fun and to take a break from hard study.

Picking a class they love is a big win for them. My mom used to say, \"You feel prouder when you do something on your own.\"\n\nAlso, kids like choosing for themselves. It makes them feel free, especially when picking fun classes like art, music, or drama. Students feel strong when they make big choices. They should have the right to pick their classes.

The next day, he said, 'I learned to keep going, and I saw that we can do what we want, even when it's hard.'\n\nSecond, my friend had a lot of problems, but these problems made him stronger and smarter. He learned from his mistakes. For example, he learned how to handle tough times, how to be on his own, and what it feels like to lose. These lessons helped him see the world more clearly.\n\nFinally, my friend didn't care about others. He didn't think about the harm from drugs and wasting his money on them. He felt alone in the world. But after nearly dying and waking up from a coma, he saw all the people who cared for him. He said 'sorry' and cried. At that moment, he changed. He stopped using drugs and saw the value of the people around him.\n\nIn conclusion, failing helps a person succeed, no matter how hard it is. Failure teaches us to be strong for the real world and to value everything that is important, big or small."}
{"text_id": "4E1FF7795A48", "output_essay": "A not so smart man once said, \"Success is moving from one failure to another without losing your excitement.\" People often say that failing is a step towards success, but that's not always true. Sometimes, people fail in their everyday life and never get to succeed. Failure doesn't lead you to success; it only makes people upset and takes away their happy feelings. Also, how can the Prime Minister say that success is about failing over and over but still staying excited? When you fail, you usually lose your excitement first. For instance, some students have been trying to pass this test for a long time; they keep failing. The school board wants students to pass this writing test, but they don't realize that students lose their excitement when they fail again and again. Some might say that failing makes people more driven, and this drive from failing helps them reach their goals. Like when Steve Jobs, the man who made Apple, didn't do well in high school and was forced out of his own company, he didn't let failing stop him. In fact, failing pushed him to start his successful company. But, adults often think that failing is the way to success; the young people today might not agree because they get upset very quickly and don't think like adults. Young people are tough to inspire because when they fail, they believe they can't do it. Still, some people believe that success comes from failing. They say you need a storm to see a rainbow, meaning you must fail to find success. Clearly, failing can block your path to success, depending on how you think. If you are a negative person, failing won't make you positive. But if you're positive, nothing about failing can stop you from being successful. So, success is about staying positive. Prime Minister Winston Churchill must have been very positive to believe that failing leads to success."}

Some people don't agree with Churchill's idea that failing is key to reaching a goal. However, many believe that keeping hope while failing is crucial to success. I think failing is a step toward success. \n\nOne reason is that failing teaches us not to make the same mistakes again. It pushes us to think of new ideas that will help us succeed. When we fail, we learn to make smarter choices. \n\nSticking with our goals despite many failures shows we are dedicated. Staying excited about our goals can make us more likely to succeed. \n\nAnother point is that success wouldn't be complete without failure. Paying attention to what we are doing now can lead to better outcomes. If we want to succeed, our past failures can push us to keep going. Failure is always a part of trying. \n\nWe shouldn't give up hope when working toward our goals. If we quit, we waste all the time we've spent. Failure plays a big role in success. To finish our goals without quitting or losing hope, we need motivation and willpower. The main thing is to keep our hope alive when going after what we want."}
{"text_id": "1EA990257725", "output_essay": "To do well in life, we must learn from our mistakes. This helps us value what we will get in the future. I agree with Churchill's idea. It's often tough to achieve our dreams, but if we really want something, we can get it. Anything is possible. For instance, I once wanted to learn to draw. I wanted to make art from anything. But I almost gave up on this dream for many reasons. I believe failing can lead us to good things. If we don't try, we won't know what's possible. Failing shouldn't scare us. It can teach us things that help us succeed. These are lessons only life can give. For me, failing is a chance to try again with more excitement. When I began to draw or paint, I didn't have the tools to make art. This was hard because my country didn't offer many chances. But I kept trying and ignored the bad. Now, I'm better at drawing and have the tools I wanted. I'll keep improving. It wasn't easy, but it was worth it. I still have much to learn. I'll keep chasing my dream. One day I'll say, 'I FINALLY DID IT.' Another reason I agree with Churchill is that we often don't value what we have until it's gone. Failing can help us succeed by giving us life's lessons. If we mess up, we can't change the past. But we can learn and do better. Failing shows us how hard it is to get something important. This helps us value what we have or what others do for us. It's harder to learn from others than from our own experiences. So, we shouldn't fear trying new things. No one is born knowing everything. Life teaches us. We shouldn't fear making mistakes. Life is about trying new things. It's okay to be imperfect and make mistakes, as long as we learn from them. Years ago, I was scared to leave my country. I didn't think I'd succeed. But I wanted to see my father after 18 years. I was afraid to fail, but I saw it as a great chance. I'm not perfect, but I'm proud of some past choices. I learned from my mistakes and will keep learning. The toughest things are always worth it. I agree with Churchill because you must struggle before you win. Life is the best teacher. Failing is not losing. It's a chance to do better. It's okay to fail before finding success. We just need to get up and try again with excitement."}

It's hard for them to go to practice and then study at home when they don't have enough time to finish their homework and sleep early. This is even harder because school starts early in the morning.\n\nMy second point is that they would feel very tired. Being in school for eight hours is already tiring. If we add two more hours, it would make them even more tired. Students would have to be in school for ten hours, often without being able to go outside.\n\nThe last point is that they would have too many classes each day. Having seven classes is okay, but having more than that or spending more time in each class is not good for the students.\n\nIt's clear that there are many reasons why the school should not make the school day two hours longer.

{"text_id": "9F6FB90D22E4", "output_essay": "I don't think schools should add two more hours to the day. Adding two hours means students who work after school to make money won't be able to do their jobs. For example, if I have a job and school adds hours, I'll have trouble with my work schedule. Also, many students need to help their families at home. Like my uncle, who starts work at three and needs me to look after her kids. It's not just babysitting; some parents need help with housework or their own jobs. Students often don't have a choice because they must do these things, sometimes even in emergencies. Schools might not see this because they think students are just lazy or don't want to study more. But families often need help, whether it's a big deal or not, and we should be able to choose. Sure, we could learn more with extra school hours, but many students are already stressed and don't want to stay longer. It makes us like school less. Plus, with more school hours, when will we do homework? After school, I'm too tired to do anything, and I bet others feel the same. We should also think about how late school ends. It's hard for students who don't have a ride and must take the bus, which doesn't drop them right at home. Some live in unsafe areas, which is risky for them and their parents. If a student gets hurt after getting off the bus, it's partly the school's fault for letting out late. Teachers also have lives and other jobs or family time. They work hard, preparing for different classes and studying every day. If it's hard for students, it must be harder for teachers. Some businesses work four days a week, but school isn't a business. Businesses make money from extra hours, but students don't get paid to stay longer at school. If we have to stay longer, the school should at least provide dinner. Food is important, and if we're there until five, we need to eat. We should also get to choose which classes to spend extra hours in. If we like the subject, it might be okay. But forcing us to take more math or history isn't fair. In short, adding two hours to school is a bad idea. It's hard enough to stay in one place for eight hours, let alone ten. It's unsafe for students to go home so late. Schools aren't businesses and shouldn't act like them. Parents should have a say in this decision, and they probably have even more reasons against longer school days. These are my thoughts and reasons why I disagree with a longer school day."}

Third, students would have more time for their own things, like if they work at home or need to look after a brother or sister or a friend's children. \n\nWhy would there be less trouble? Look at a girl named Generic_Name. Her family moved to Virginia, and she started at Generic_School. On her first day, she learned nothing because the other kids were too noisy. After she went home and talked with her family, they chose online classes for her. This way, she wouldn't have to put up with the noise from other kids. Now, she can study and pay attention without anyone bothering her. \n\nWhen you take online classes, you can work in a quiet place. For example, Generic_Name is nice and hates loud sounds. In his first online classes, he found a quiet room at home. There, he could watch his teacher's lessons without anyone interrupting him. He liked sitting with his laptop, wearing headphones, and learning without distractions. \n\nOnline classes also give you more time to rest and handle your own things. For example, Generic_Name has classes at night at 10:00 PM. He doesn't have to wake up early like other students.

Some people think students don't learn from online classes. But they are wrong. Online classes help students in many ways. First, there's less trouble; you don't waste time with others and just focus on your work. Second, it's quieter, which helps the brain learn.

If a student works there, they can't help their parents on Fridays. They might have to quit school to work. I also don't agree because of sports.

We can show our kids and others how to do better. My cousin's friend got a car at 17. At 19, the car had problems and he wanted to fix it himself. He had a dream of being a mechanic. After months, he couldn't find the problem and felt bad. My cousin reminded him of his dream. He finally fixed the car and now he's the best mechanic in town.

Winston Churchill, a past leader of Britain, once said that success is moving from one failure to another without losing your drive. There are many reasons why people should fail before they reach any goal, dream, or desire. Failure is part of the journey to success. People should fail before they can win. One reason people fail before they win is that no one is perfect at first. Even famous people mess up on their first try. For example, many famous people were not rich before they got famous. They didn't have money for their careers or school, but they used their skills to reach their goals without help from others. Failure isn't a barrier that stops you; it helps you do better the next time. Another reason people fail before they win is that failure makes students, athletes, and adults feel upset when they mess up. So, students will study more, athletes will train harder, and adults will be more careful. For instance, studying hard, being careful, and training well are important to achieve any goal or dream. A third reason is that athletes reach their level because of their effort. Many athletes grew up poor. But they became famous through their skills, hard work, and never giving up. For example, many soccer players grew up without much money, but they didn't let that stop them. They kept training and doing their best. Some people think you can win on your first try without failing. This isn't true. Usually, people reach their goals by doing well after they have practiced or gained experience. If someone does well without failing, it's because they have experience. Everyone messes up the first time they try something. Cristiano Ronaldo is known as one of the best soccer players. But he grew up poor. His dad was a coach, and Ronaldo played for his team. He often made mistakes with kicking, passing, and playing his position. But he didn't give up and kept practicing.

If the teacher sees they are all self-controlled, they can use their phones for music in class. But, if they start to act out, the teacher can stop this. Second, some students need music to focus. They should be able to listen to music when they work alone in class. The teacher should check on them now and then to make sure they are working. Third, if students listen to music, they might talk less and not bother others. Finally, if we treat students like grown-ups, they will be ready for life after school. If we respect them, they should at least listen to music. If teachers and students respect each other, things will run smoother. Respect is important. If everyone shows it, there will be less fighting and trouble at school. In the end, if the school teaches students self-control, they should be able to use their phones in class."}
{"text_id": "CA07DAA86DBD", "output_essay": "Going to school is a big step that some students must take. Many teens don't get help from their parents and must figure out how to finish school on their own. They have to drive for 20-30 minutes to reach school. Some have kids when they are very young and can't finish school because they need to work. Being able to take classes online or through video calls at home would help many students. They wouldn't have to worry about being late or stuck in traffic. Giving students choices is a good idea that will help many of them.\n\nFirst, many students find it hard to arrive at class on time. They drive for 20-30 minutes and look for street parking because the school doesn't have free parking. Often, they miss a lot of the class. Then, they don't know what will be on the next day's quiz. This is why online classes are good for many students. There will be no reasons for failing or not doing homework. Some students like to learn at school because it's easier for them. But, learning from home doesn't work for everyone.\n\nNext, many teens have kids when they are young. This is why some students quit school. My cousin moved to the U.S. at 16 and started school. Two years later, she had a baby and didn't finish school because she made a mistake. She wants to go back to school now, but babysitting costs too much, and she doesn't make a lot of money. Seeing this happen to my cousin showed me that we often can't choose between having kids or finishing school. If the school lets students take classes online or through video calls, it's a big chance for students like my cousin to take some classes and finish school.\n\nIn the end, we can't use excuses for not finishing school because we live far or there's too much traffic, or because we have a child and babysitting costs too much. The school gives us a choice by offering online or video conference classes. This helps many students finish their classes anytime without being late or missing out. While many students like going to school every day because they learn better there, others like online classes. This is because it's tough to go to school or hard to focus with other students around. I think everyone is different and we all learn in our own ways."}

Talking to someone in person is also better than talking through a computer or tablet. \n\nStudents need to learn to finish school and start the job they like. But some students take online classes because they don't want to go to school anymore. I believe it's better to learn by going to school. You can talk to your teacher and she can help you with things you don't understand. Many students find some subjects hard. It's not easy to get help when you're at home on a computer. \n\nTeachers help students every day. They teach and help at the same time. Students who learn online don't get the same help as those who go to school. Students in school can learn more because they can ask questions right away. But online, they can't just ask the teacher. They have to do something different to get help. Teachers can also explain things better than a computer. \n\nTalking to someone face-to-face is better than listening to a voice from a computer. Sometimes, it's hard to understand a computer voice. Online learning needs the internet. If there's no power, you can't use the computer. \n\nThis is why I think learning at school is better than learning online. Some students still learn online because they work and don't have time to go to school. Many students choose online classes because they can pick when to study. This is often because they have jobs and can't go to a regular school."}

We must always believe in ourselves, even when we have dreams. We need to work hard to improve and show everyone our success. Even if you give everything, you can find success. If you fail once, try again; the next try might work. Many people think if you fail once, you will always fail. When I see someone like that, I tell them to keep trying. Sometimes I get tired of trying, but I never stop wanting to learn more. This excitement helps us help others who have lost theirs. I can push them to keep going. I chase my dreams because I want to make my family proud. Seeing my family happy motivates me to always do my best, get good grades, and pass tests. This keeps me excited. It also means you can keep going, no matter what others think of you. Just keep moving and do your best. You can do better than those who doubt you. The best effort is when you work hard for what you want, with the excitement you need to have."}
{"text_id": "8D6DFE5DD236", "output_essay": "The former leader of Britain, Churchill, once said, \"Success is moving from one mistake to another without losing your excitement.\" Is making mistakes a big part of chasing success? Today, we often think making a mistake is the worst thing. But we don't see that mistakes can make us better and teach us how to live well. Churchill asked if making mistakes is a big part of chasing success. Many people think that if they fail at work, school, or sports, it means they're not meant for these things. They feel bad about it. But I believe we learn from our mistakes. They make us better every day. We should see problems as chances to find answers and to push ourselves. We're all different and have our own skills. Making mistakes is part of learning and success. We should keep our excitement even when we fail. If we fall, we must get up and try not to make the same mistake again. I've read stories of people who fell but learned to get back up and reach their goals with excitement. I don't know much about Churchill, but I'm sure he made mistakes too. He's showing us how to get past the bad times with his words. Many businesses want workers with experience. They don't want to train new people. I think bosses should say, \"This job is new for you, and it's okay to make mistakes because we learn and succeed from them.\" This encourages people who need a chance. We must admit we're not perfect. Every mistake is a chance to do better next time. Many stories in books, movies, and shows tell us about people who started with nothing and became successful through hard work. We can make a big change in our lives and in the world. But we must be humble and honest with others. These people knew how to solve problems and chase success. Parents are very important in chasing success. They help us when we're kids. For example, when we lose a soccer game at school, we feel sad. That's when parents should talk to us. They should say, \"Mistakes are part of learning. You lost this time, but you learned something. The other team won because they learned from their past mistakes.\" Friends also support us in different ways. This is how we learn from mistakes, by facing new challenges and getting help when we need it. In short, mistakes are not bad. They show us the way to success, as many have done before. Life is hard, but not impossible. It's full of challenges. To succeed, we sometimes have to fail. We're not alone. Many people want to help us. Excitement is important too. History shows us that many great buildings and discoveries came from mistakes. So don't give up. A big mistake might lead to a big discovery, as it has for others. Churchill's words are wise. They tell us not to quit at the first problem, but to keep going and chase success."}
{"text_id": "7C7B5BCE2DB1", "output_essay": "Have you ever thought about how good you can feel when you fail but still stay excited? Failing is a step toward success. I learned from my mistakes. In my first wrestling match, I made many mistakes and learned from them. I have made lots of mistakes in my life and learned from each one. If I don't fail, I can't learn to keep my excitement. Failing is important for success. I always tried to make as many mistakes as possible in wrestling practice to learn from them. I fail, but I keep my excitement because I know I can do better. Every time I lose a match, I train harder because I believe I can improve. Keeping my excitement when I fail helps me believe in myself. I can succeed by staying excited even when I fail. When I moved to the U.S., I didn't speak any English. It was very hard to go to school without knowing the language, but I never stopped wanting to learn. I worked very hard and learned English because I kept my excitement. Failing makes people want to do better next time. When I lose to another wrestler, I see what I did wrong and try to win next time. I don't lose my excitement; that's how to succeed and learn from mistakes. I fail but stay excited. If you fail and keep your excitement, you learn from your mistakes. But if you fail and lose your excitement, that's the real failure. The way to succeed is to learn from your mistakes. To succeed, you will fail and get back up without losing your excitement. I have never lost my excitement, so I can succeed after failing.

Kids who find a subject hard will get another chance to take it or extra time to get ready for tests. If we make the school day two hours longer, students won't be tired. They will pay better attention. They will learn more about each subject, so they won't have any reason to do badly on final exams. Some kids may not like this new plan, but it's really for their own good. Saving energy and other things is important for everyone. We will also take care of nature and think about students who will come later. Teachers will get more time for themselves or to plan lessons. They might teach better with this extra time. Maybe the quality of teaching will get better because it's like having five days of school in just four days. In the end, everyone should see that this is good for the school and the students.

{"text_id": "774125F2F326", "output_essay": "I believe students should not take classes from home. One reason is that they won't learn as well as they would in a classroom. If they have questions, who will explain things to them? It's much better to be in a classroom. You do your work, and if you're confused, a teacher is there to help. I know someone who tried to learn from home. He couldn't finish his class because he got stuck on some parts. He needed help but couldn't get it. In the end, he failed and wished he had succeeded. Another point is that students learning from home miss out on making friends. They are by themselves, which can make them unsocial. What will they do when they need to work, go to college, or hang out with friends? At least at school, you meet many people. Schools also help you find jobs through teachers and career center staff. Some might argue that home classes are better because they're cheaper and offer the same education. But it's not the same. There are fewer chances to do things, and you don't get to be social. So, students should not take classes from home."}
{"text_id": "389B7B042C94", "output_essay": "I don't agree because I think school should be five days a week. I feel it's not as hard as jobs like building or yard work, which might need only four days of work. A four-day school week wouldn't give students enough time to do their work. Five days of school are better than four, and a shorter week would mean more work for teachers. \n\nFirst, students will have less time to do and turn in their work, which could be a problem. If school is just four days a week, students might not have enough time to do their homework, especially if they have work in every class. This could make their grades worse and cause problems for the school. So, I think the school should not make the days longer. \n\nSecond, a five-day school week is better than a four-day one. The usual schedule gives more time for students to do and turn in their work and keep a schedule they like. With this time, students should not have bad grades. Also, teachers will not have too much work, as they might with a four-day week when student work could build up, making them have more work than normal. \n\nLast, teachers would have more work if the school day were two hours longer. This could make them very tired from teaching all day, with little time to check homework. This extra work could make teachers come to class in a bad mood, which students might not like, and could lead to more problems. This is a downside of a four-day school week. \n\nSo, even though some people like a shorter school week and want a three-day weekend, I think it's a bad idea.

I would tell parents and students to think about online classes. \n\nOnline classes teach more than just Science, Math, or English. They also teach good behavior, skills, and how to live and reach your goals on your own. They help students solve their own problems without their parents' help. With online classes, you can also work to pay for your own things. Online classes prepare you for the job you want. Many jobs need you to work hard and study a lot. You need good grades and credits to finish school. Subjects like Medicine, Engineering, and Architecture take a lot of time. Students study more than four years to get everything they want in life. This takes a lot of effort. Virginia has some of the best schools that offer online classes. \n\nThere have been reports about problems with online classes, like school shootings and food poisoning.

Some people laugh at this fear, but they don't understand that failing teaches you important lessons. You should always keep your eyes on your goal and the good things that come from reaching it. Your attitude matters a lot—if it's positive, things will likely turn out well.\n\nTake the story of a man in Mexico who wanted to be president for 20 or 25 years. He finally did it. His name is Andrés Manuel López Obrador, and he's now the president of Mexico. He always stayed excited and wasn't scared of failing. I believe that failures are just that; they're not the end of everything. Get back up and keep trying. If you don't try, you won't be anything. Life is tough for everyone, not just you.\n\nIf you worry about every failure, you'll be waiting forever for something amazing to happen. Just move on because life is full of problems and failures. It's up to you to decide if these 'failures' get you down. Look at the soccer player Lionel Messi. As a boy, he had health and growth issues, but he didn't let that stop him. He kept playing soccer, and eventually, FC Barcelona helped pay for his treatment. Now, he's one of the greatest soccer players ever.\n\nFailures aren't always bad; sometimes, yes, but to me, they're a way to learn. They show that the path to your goal isn't simple, but I'll make it because I'm excited and positive, and I don't think about failing. You have a choice—work hard, and you'll feel great about what you achieve.\n\nConclusion-\n\nYour success will come from your failures. The joy and learning you get from them are valuable life lessons. It doesn't matter how often you fail; what's important is that you get past them. Stay positive and keep a good attitude. Don't let problems or failures bring you down. Life might hit you hard, but with enthusiasm, you can get whatever you want in life."}

This stress makes it hard for them to pay attention in class. It's better for them to learn at home where it's safe. They can work at their own speed and feel secure.

While some students pick this way to learn, the main aim is to really know the stuff. This is often easier when going to school with teachers who can help with any questions. But what if we don't have a normal school setting? We need to think about a few problems. First, being able to ask questions is key, and not having this is a big issue. For example, without a teacher right there, students might not understand lessons or homework. During a test, not getting help with a tricky question can be tough. Distance learning works for those far from schools, sick, or who need to work and study on their computers. Second, cheating might happen more with distance learning. If students can cheat at school, it's even easier at home. They could use notes, look up answers, call friends, or get help from family. Cheating means getting good marks without really learning. This shows we need more help and someone to answer our questions. Third, schoolwork can be hard, with lots of reading and homework for one class. Students have to learn on their own, finish work, and wait to hear back. This self-study—reading and answering questions—can be hard. Many students don't pass because they don't get enough help or understand the tests. Even though they can ask teachers or use online help, it's not the same as face-to-face help. Finally, many students have to take classes again, losing the time they spent. This shows how important it is to have support and not be cut off from school.

For example, I skip breakfast before school because I'm in a hurry, or else I'll miss my bus. It's normal to see a student running late for the bus, and when I chat with others, they often say they're hungry. So, online classes could really help us. Also, some students want more credits to get a better degree. Online classes would make it easier for them. It could also help students who need to repeat a class to graduate. Friends sometimes tell me they have to take a class again, or they won't finish school. This is one more reason why online teaching is a smart idea. Students might need to go to the hospital, get sick, or handle other things in life. They will miss school, and it can hurt their grades. I think if we had online classes, this wouldn't be a problem because all classes would be recorded. Students could watch the class videos whenever they can. This way, they can keep their grades up without worrying."}
{"text_id": "220342CABE6C", "output_essay": "Students should not have to take music, drama, or art classes. These subjects should not be important in schools because some students do not have time for more classes. Others may not like music and art. Some students might not graduate if they have to take these classes. However, some students think drama and music are important because they are a big part of our world. I think these subjects should be optional. Students should choose their own electives. If they fail, it can hurt their grades. \n\nStudents are busy and do not have time for more required classes. They are tired of their current classes. Some are just passing. Adding more classes can be hard and stressful. When I moved to the United States, the schools were different from Morocco. I had to get used to a new way of learning. It was hard and took time. Schools should not make it harder by adding more classes. \n\nThe fear of not graduating on time worries students. They keep thinking about it because graduating is very important. No one wants to be the only one not graduating. If you fail classes, like a required music or art class, you won't finish high school. You might have to take summer classes or repeat the class. This feels like a waste of time. That's why music, drama, and art should not be required. \n\nSome students do not like music or art and would not choose them as electives. I remember when PE was required. I did not like PE because it made me sweat and thirsty. I stopped participating and failed. I had A's in my other classes, but failing PE kept me off the principal's list. My parents were upset. \n\nSchools should not make art and music required. They add stress with extra classes. Some students think these subjects are not as important as others. People may argue that art and music are important in our world. But they should not be required in school. I am not saying music and art are not important. They just should not be extra requirements for high school. Some students may not graduate because of them. And some do not like these subjects. Others might not finish high school because they failed music."}

Because it's online, they might not care as much or work and study as hard. Some students can't buy computers because they don't have enough money. At school, students often learn new things and solve problems with other students. Online classes might reduce this teamwork, which can make it harder to learn new things and solve problems. Without a teacher there to help, students might not take their lessons seriously. Also, not working in groups could make it harder for them to understand. Going to school helps students learn to be responsible. Not every student can do online classes; not everyone has a computer or Wi-Fi. We have to remember that not everyone can buy this stuff. Lately, more students are taking classes online, but this doesn't help everyone. Some people say online classes are good, but I think they don't work for everyone. We need to think about how not all students can get the technology they need for online learning.

They should also learn about fun things like music, drama, and art. These are free classes at school. They help students relax from the hard work of other classes. Students should have to take one or two classes in music, drama, or art. They might find out what they really like, and these subjects could become very important in their lives.\n\nThese days, students don't pay much attention to music, drama, and art. They only focus on main subjects like Math, English, or Science. People, including students, are not robots. They can imagine and need fun, which they get from the right places. Music, drama, and art are good for relaxing and letting the imagination grow. After hard classes make them tired, the arts can make them love life again and give them energy for other classes. When they go from a tough class to a music class, a gentle song can make them feel better.\n\nIf students only learn Math, English, or Science, they might become engineers, doctors, or nurses. They will make good money and help the country, but their lives might get boring. They would just wake up, eat, work, and deal with machines. That's why music, drama, and art can make life less boring and more fun. After working or studying a lot, going to a concert or an art museum can make them feel better with songs or paintings. This makes them happier.\n\nAlso, the arts are where musicians start. They can make great shows, movies, and art. This is how Beethoven and Mozart started. They made music more exciting and inspired music lovers. Many students are good at Math, English, and Science and pick jobs that are not about fun. They think these jobs are right for them. But they don't really know themselves until they try music, drama, or art. Then they might see that these are what they love, not Math, English, Science, or being doctors, nurses, or engineers. Their imagination needs the arts. Some people studying to be doctors, teachers, or engineers change their minds when they find out they want to teach music or be musicians. There are many stories like this. They show why we have songs and art. They make life more exciting and full of love.\n\nAlso, people use music, drama, and art to speak out against the government or to join groups that don't agree with it. The arts are good when used right to make life better and more fun. But they can be bad when they make people fight.\n\nTo end, students should have to take one or two classes in music, drama, or art.

So, schools should start having a four-day school week. They can do this by making the school day two hours longer. The good things about a four-day school week are saving energy and money, doing better in school, and having more time for homework.\n\nSchools use a lot of energy and resources in a week, more than we use at home. This includes things like electricity and water. The more we use, the more the school has to pay. Having one extra day off can cut down on costs for food, buses, and keeping the school running.\n\nA four-day week doesn't just save energy and money. It also gives teachers and students an extra day to rest each week. With less stress about school, students can relax more at home before coming back to school. This rest is key to helping them do better in school.\n\nBesides saving energy and getting rest, students will have more time for homework. Many students say they don't have enough time at home to finish their homework. If this keeps happening, their grades could suffer. An extra day off gives them a longer weekend. This means they have more time to get ready for tests and study at their own speed.\n\nMoving to a four-day school week can make a big difference. It would be good for the school, the students, and the parents."}

There are three main reasons: students might cheat to pass online classes, some students may find it hard to do homework online, and teachers will have more work. I believe that if students take classes from home, they might cheat just to pass and won't really learn. But some people think it's a good thing because it's easier for students to pass classes. I disagree. Online classes might look easy, but they can be hard for many students. Also, some students might struggle with homework online because their computers could have problems or crash during a class. Others think that buying expensive computers will solve this, but I disagree. Even good computers can break down because of bad parts or other issues we don't know about. Plus, teachers will have to work harder to teach online. They need to find new ways to make sure students get the lessons. They have to learn how to give homework and teach the important stuff. Some people think teachers are good with the internet and that students will understand them better. But that's not always true. Teachers can have problems too. They need to learn many new programs to do their job well and can't be sure students get the lessons. In the end, students shouldn't be allowed to take classes from home. They might cheat, have trouble with homework online, and make teachers work harder. It's better to help students in schools than let them take classes from home."}

This was when bombs were falling on London by the German Nazis. His words were meant to lift the spirits of the people, to tell them to keep going. Britain was not doing well in the war with the Axis Powers, and people were starting to lose hope. Winston Churchill was respected and a strong speaker. He believed that you can find success even after many losses. \n\nI think his words mean that if you keep failing, or if you have failed before, you will find success one day. After the big war, the German Nazis were defeated, and Britain won. This shows that there is always hope for a better future with a good leader, someone you care about, or help from others. People need hope because it helps them believe in themselves. Churchill's words can lift people up if they work together and have good leaders. \n\nI agree with Churchill when he says that failing is a part of getting to success. \n\nI watch a lot of movies where things get really bad at the most exciting part, but then everything gets better and ends well.

Music class takes more time and work. It is hard for some students, and that's why they don't like music class. Drama class lets students understand each other better. Teachers can talk to students well. The school has events on Friday or Saturday nights. I believe students should take this class. It helps us graduate. It is also key to take classes you like to get good grades. Our school doesn't let you fail. If a student switches classes, it's their job to do well. These three classes are good and not too hard. In art, you learn about different colors, animals, and how to make beautiful letters. I know some people think students must take music, drama, and art. But students have different classes they can choose based on what they need. Students should be okay with any class they get. Sometimes, you get the same class every year.

{"text_id": "A8E686531564", "output_essay": "Some schools let students use cell phones in class for learning. But, the schools don't see that many students don't really focus on the work. If students use their phones in class, they won't learn well. Another problem is that students might text friends or cheat instead of doing their work. Also, some students might say they finished the work when they didn't. They lie to the teacher who might believe them. Later, these students may say they don't understand the lessons. This will affect them in some way. My first reason why students shouldn't use their cell phones in class is that they won't study or learn well. If teachers say yes to cell phones, students may not know what to do. They might ignore the work because they are lost. Using phones for school is hard. I know this because it's confusing and tough for me too. At my school, when we can use our phones, many of us don't know how to start. I see my friends learn nothing when they use their phones. They look lost and wait for the teacher to tell them what to do again. Alerts on the phone can make students look at other things and not learn. When we get work on our phones, it's hard to focus because of these alerts. My second reason is that students will not do their work and will do other things on their phones. Many students text friends. For example, if a student texts in class, they can get in trouble and lose their phone. But, if teachers let them use phones, they can text without getting in trouble. I've seen this in my classes. Some students don't do the work and just chat with friends. Also, students might cheat on their work. This could become a bad habit and cause big problems if they get caught cheating later. My last reason why teachers shouldn't let students use phones in class is that students might lie about their work. I often see friends say they're done with work when they're not. This isn't fair to those who really do the work. If a teacher finds out, the student who lied could get in trouble and do badly on tests. Lying might seem small when you're young, but it's a big problem later in life. Some people think that cell phones should be allowed in class. They say students learn more or that teachers can watch what they do. But, teachers can't check a student's phone without breaking their privacy. Students might not learn well if they use their phones. They could play games, look up answers, text, or pretend to work. I've seen this since middle school. Cell phones have changed students. A little change can make a big difference in how a person acts. I think students should not use their phones in class. In the end, I think schools should not let students use cell phones in class for learning. I hope my reasons make some schools think again about their rules. Schools and parents should know the bad things that can happen when students use phones in class. I want students to trust in their skills and make good choices for the future."}

They can finish school at home and learn about things they like, such as art, music, or math. They can also learn job skills like fixing cars, beauty care, or computer work.\n\nHome classes also help students who have big responsibilities, like a student who needs to work to help their family or a student who is pregnant.

But, studying from home lets her keep going and not give up on finishing school.\n\nStudying from home has good and bad points. Some good things are that the student can study in a comfortable place, not get upset, and take classes when they want.

I like to have classes at home with my teacher. But not everyone likes this. Some students want to go to school to see their friends. Others don't want to learn at home. I like it because I don't have to get up at 5 AM. I have enough friends and don't need to walk or take the bus to school. But not everyone feels the same way.\n\nHere are some reasons and results:\n\n* You might be alone.\n* You don't like school.\n* Your parents think about online classes.\n* You're more comfortable at home.\n* You don't like how teachers teach.\n\nThese points tell us why some students choose online classes over school. With your own teacher, you can ask questions many times. In school, you can ask too, but it's different. There are more students and the teacher only has about 1 hour and 30 minutes for each subject. I think that's not enough time to learn. In school, friends and other things can distract you.\n\nWhy do I go to school? Here are my reasons:\n\n* Baseball programs\n* I don't understand how online classes work.\n* My parents can't afford it.\n* I can't speak the language.\n* All my friends are at school.\n\nIn short, school gives us things we need like pens and paper. If you choose school over online classes, you have to take the bus, wake up early, shower in the morning, and you're probably tired at the end of the day. My brother did college online. I asked him how it feels to learn at home and if it's easy. He said he likes it, it's not hard, and he has more time to work.\n\nI think it's easy, but not everyone agrees.\n\nIn conclusion, school teaches you about life and things you'll need later. Online classes just teach you the lessons, and you have to pay for them. School is free and you can play sports like baseball. With online classes, you can understand better and ask any questions. Learning is what matters. At school, you can make friends and learn about different cultures. For example, I'm Dominican and I share my culture with my Salvadorian friends. Online classes don't have a set time. In school, you need to be there by 6:40 AM. School gives you everything you need. I believe it's better to go to school."}

I have some strong reasons why it is good for them. Many people who have done it before say it helps them stay more focused, spend more time with family, sleep more, and work whenever they want during the day.\n\nFirst, a lot of students say they can pay better attention at home than at school. For example, they say there are not as many things to distract them from finishing their work and handing it in, especially when it's something that will help them pass their classes. They can think more clearly about their schoolwork. Also, if they have family members they don't see often, they can spend more time with them.\n\nBecause of this, students who do schoolwork at home pass their classes more often than those who go to school. So, students can work better after sleeping well at night. This means students are more alert and ready to work when they wake up on their own. Lastly, students don't have to hurry to finish their work and hand it in on time.\n\nIn conclusion, do students really do better when they go to school from home? Students do better when they go to school from home. They can pay more attention to their work and have more time with their family. They can sleep enough to do their work well, and they can do their work when they are ready during the day."}

When I was in ninth grade at Generic_School, I had to pick one of these subjects. Now that I'm a junior, I see that even though they were fun, they didn't really help me. They just added to my schedule without being needed. Having to do art, drama, or music every day for a semester can be too much. These classes take the place of more serious study. They cut down on the chances for high school students to try different ways of living.\n\nStudents shouldn't have to take art, music, or drama classes. These subjects should be chosen by the students, not required. Making students take these classes can upset those who want to take other courses to get into a top college. Instead, they are stuck in classes they don't like and think are not important.\n\nForcing students to take classes they don't need means they miss out on learning about jobs they might want to do. High school is for trying new things and studying what you might want to do later. It's not fair and it's bad for those who want to do well to stop them from having these chances.\n\nSome might say these classes help students see the world differently and find what they want to do. But I think these classes actually limit the job choices students have. They stop students from finding the job they really want. Most students would rather learn about main subjects that will help them later, not classes they see as a waste of time.\n\nTo sum up, being forced to take art, drama, or music doesn't help students who want to do their best. Looking at my own time in school, I can say they didn't deliver what they promised. While there might be some good things about these classes, they don't help much with finding out about different jobs. Making students take classes they don't value is not right. It gets in the way of their success. Art, music, and drama are good for some, but they shouldn't be forced on everyone. They should be classes students can choose if they want to."}

I'll talk about the good and bad points of having school for four days a week, but with each day lasting two hours more. This could help our environment by using less resources and energy. Some companies already work only four days a week.\n\nLet's look at the good points first. If we go to school for just four days, we'll have Friday free to do homework, projects, and essays. Students who get extra help or do school stuff can use the extra day to learn more at their own speed. We'd also use less paper and power each day.\n\nBut there are bad points too. If we had to be in class for ten hours, many students might want to leave or not go to class. This means each class would be two hours long. We'd spend too much time looking at screens, which could hurt our eyes.\n\nIf I had to pick between the good and bad points, I'd choose the good ones. It's better to start saving things we use every day. It's a great idea to save so we have enough for the future and don't worry about running out.

Also, students can work and go to school at the same time, and those who get suspended can keep learning online.\n\nFirst, students who are sick wouldn't have to skip school. Often, students get sick and miss classes. But with online classes, they just need to sign in to a website and join their classes. For example, I was sick for two weeks and missed school. But my school let me take classes from home. This was good because I didn't fall behind and finished all my work. I think this is easier for teachers too. When I was sick, my teacher just taught me and gave me homework over a video call. It's also good for students with appointments. They can join a video call or do work online while they're busy with other things.\n\nSecond, students can have a job and go to school at the same time. Some students can only work part-time because of regular school. But they might want a full-time job. With online school, they can work and go to school. For example, they could have a video call during their lunch break or ask their boss for a break. I know someone who did online school. He worked long hours but took a two-hour break to video call his teacher. This also teaches students to be responsible, plan well, and use their time smartly. If students are tired from work, they can relax in bed and do their homework online.\n\nLast, students who get suspended can keep going to school online. This year, I saw about six fights at school. The principal suspended the students, and they missed school. They could keep up with school online or through video calls. Even though it's not the school's job to deal with trouble, it's good for them to offer this. It stops students from missing school. Also, when they come back, they might have more problems. I think the school should let them do online school for a year if they get suspended. This way, they can learn to be better and remember that school is for learning, not fighting. They won't miss school and can still graduate. Parents can watch their kids to make sure they're doing the right things and finishing their work.\n\nIn the end, students would do well with the option to take classes from home. It would be good for all schools to have online classes. This could help all students and make things easier for teachers. While some students might not need it, like those without jobs or who don't get into trouble, others will do well when they're sick or have doctor's visits without missing school. Parents can also see if their kids are doing their homework or listening to the teacher. Some students want a regular job but can't because of school.

But the upside is they would go to school for only four days, not five, and teachers would help them more, so they would learn more with the extra two hours. Some students and teachers like the four-day school week, but others don't. Teachers get tired too and need time to grade work and rest.\n\nSome teachers might not like the longer school day because they have other things to do after school, and it would be too late.

When people say to me, \"Don't give up, try harder next time,\" it helps me get past the problem that made me fail. It makes me want to give my best effort this time. Failure is important because without it, life would be too simple. Failure is a key part of becoming successful because it leads you to where you want to be in life.\n\nFailure is always a big part of success because everyone must experience it to be successful in life. They might have failed a test or something big, but when they face it again, they will work to do better next time. Everyone will face tough times in life. Life with failure is tough sometimes, but it leads you to your goals. Failure shows who you are, because if you fail a lot and get upset, it's because you aren't trying.\n\nTo be successful, you must face failure first. You will know what it feels like to fail, so you can work harder next time. Failure is key to success because otherwise, you would pass everything easily at school. Some students work hard at school and others don't, so they fail and then do better next time and succeed. People often say, \"Failure is the key to success.\" So you face challenges to become successful.\n\nSome might say failure isn't a big part of success because some people are born successful. They never faced a hard time. Without failure, life would be too simple. You wouldn't worry about failing; you would always be successful. Life wouldn't be hard. You wouldn't get far in life without failure.\n\nIn conclusion, failure is a very important part of success. You won't get far in life without it. Success is part of failure too because when you pass, you face more challenges. Going from failure to success is a big part of life because you might lose some hope, but when you succeed, you get more hope in yourself. Going from failure to success is important to us because it teaches us things we have never seen before."}
{"text_id": "64FA1F7F556F", "output_essay": "When we talk about Winston Churchill, the former British Prime Minister, and his words 'success is about moving from one failure to another without losing your excitement,' we are looking at how important failing is to succeed. I think he is right for these reasons: first, it shows that being steady helps us succeed. I also agree because this saying can push someone to make their dreams real. The last reason is that we need to stay excited to solve our problems. How does it show that being steady helps us succeed? Imagine you enjoy something but others are better at it. Will you quit or keep trying to improve? For example, if you play soccer for a great team but the coach won't let you play because you're not good enough, you'll feel bad. If you quit and join a less successful team, you might play but won't get famous. But if you stay and practice, you could become a pro and achieve fame with the first team. When I say this saying can inspire dreams, I mean seeing Churchill's wins and how he got them by not giving up makes you hopeful and eager. You start to believe in yourself and do things to become better. For instance, if I can't drive but want to be a race car driver, I might think I can't do it. But if I read Churchill's words and keep trying, I could learn and become a pro driver. I've also learned that we need to stay excited to beat our problems. Churchill's words teach us that even when we fail or things go wrong, we might feel stuck. But you can get past problems by getting help. Talk to a friend or your parents. For example, if you have school problems and your parents don't know, tell them. Change your attitude and you'll feel better. In the end, I believe Churchill's words help us improve in life. His words make sense for any question or problem we might have."}

We can keep our streets clean and use sunlight for many things you might not know about. For example, you can dry your clothes outside in the sun instead of using a dryer. Surprising, isn't it?\n\nSunlight is very important for people, animals, and all living things.\n\nIf schools choose this four-day week, there will be good and bad points.\n\nOne good point is that students will have more time to learn and teach others to save energy.\n\nAnother good point is that our future will be better. We will have cleaner air that is not so dirty.\n\nOne bad point is that school days will be longer. Some students might not like this because we would rather be at home resting than at school for no pay.\n\nAnother bad point is that some young people like me have jobs after school. A longer school day will mess up our work schedules. Some bosses don't let us take many days off.\n\nI don't agree with the four-day school week because it doesn't work for everyone. For example, I have to work a lot to take care of my brother and sister. I won't have time to stay at school for two extra hours.\n\nI don't agree because I think this should be a choice.

This will help them decide if they should make the school day longer.\n\nMany students and parents will like this idea, but some won't.\n\nIn conclusion, we could all learn ways to save energy and use them on our days off.

If you stop and don't try, you won't make it, and you won't be a great person. But if you keep trying, you will be a great person and do well in life. Also, if you keep trying, people will thank you. You should think good thoughts, not bad ones, to do better in life. \n\nNext, always believe that you can make it in life. Like I said before, if you think good thoughts, everything will be okay. If you are okay, then others will be too because you are doing things right. You can do better because you can do things. Like I said, don't stop believing in yourself and think about yourself and then others. \n\nLast, ask for help from others to do better in life. People can help you because they know what to do, and they can show you the way. They can see if you're doing well or not. Your parents are good at guiding you because they are always with you.

{"text_id": "765E50F8B0D0", "output_essay": "\"SUCCESS IS ABOUT KEEPING YOUR SPIRIT UP EVEN WHEN YOU FAIL\"\n\nDear staff, judges, guests, and everyone. I am honored to talk about the idea that success is about not giving up, even when you fail. I don't agree with this idea. Success means reaching your own goals. It can be about getting rich, being liked, being important, or being lucky. To succeed, you must give things up and wait. This makes it hard to keep going toward your goals. Here are my reasons for not agreeing that success comes from failing many times.\n\nFirst, it can waste money and effort. To succeed, you often need to spend money. For example, to become a doctor, you pay for college. If you fail your classes, you pay more until you pass your medical exams. That money could be used for other important things in your life. You also need to work hard and do well.\n\nAlso, failing over and over can make you feel bad about yourself. Many people feel embarrassed when they see others doing well. They also get sad when they keep failing. For instance, if a student keeps failing geometry and can't graduate, he feels bad when his friends pass and finish school. This also means wasting time in school.\n\nLastly, I don't agree because failing too much might make you lose hope in your future goals. When you lose hope, you might do desperate things to succeed. For example, someone might do something terrible, like hurting his own mother, to reach his goals.\n\nIn short, dear staff, guests, and everyone, I don't agree with the former Prime Minister's idea that 'success is about keeping your spirit up even when you fail.'\""}

They are to work hard for those four days at the company. All the workers are ready to begin work on the business projects.\n\nThe school has a similar plan. It makes the school day two hours longer so students can learn more. With the extra time, the school can make each class a bit longer. Now, school ends two hours later than it used to.\n\nThe good thing is that some workers want to work eight hours over two days, while others want to work ten hours over three days. This is because of different needs, money issues, personal choices, and long trips to work. They can start early, but everyone likes the idea of working three days for ten hours. This way, they have an extra day to do what they like. For the school, the students get to learn more. They can do all the work the teacher gives them. This makes sure no one cheats. This is good because teachers don't always have time to explain everything. Now, with two extra hours, they can explain more, so students will learn more.\n\nThe bad side for the workers is that some want to work fewer hours over fewer days. Some can't start early, and others have to take care of their kids. So, for some workers, this is hard because they have other things to do. Work matters, but other things like emergencies are more important.\n\nFor the school, a four-day week might be good for some students who like to study. But most students don't like school, and they like it even less with the longer days. Parents like this because they want their kids to learn well.\n\nIf workers want to keep their jobs, they have to work as told. It's not about what they want; it's about what the boss wants. The same goes for students at school. They must follow the rules. Some workers need the money, and some bosses have demands.\n\nIf the school adds two hours, there are bad points. Students might fall behind if they don't come or skip classes. Some parents might get upset and move their kids to a different school. It's just two hours, but classes might not be as good. Grades could drop. It's like making a bad deal with our workers in the education business. All the schools could get worse fast because of these big problems."}

I feel that no one is sure to succeed in life. Even if someone has lots of good ideas and wants to be Prime Minister, a big job, they might not make it. Staying positive and not thinking about bad things is key, especially when some may not want you to do well. One way to succeed is to have better ideas and avoid bad thoughts.

Changing the school system can be good and bad for students. But I really don't agree with a four-day school week. Students might forget what they learned, get used to it, and then have trouble later. We don't need to make school days longer to save energy and have more breaks. Students don't have too many things to do, and I think a four-day week could cause problems in how they learn. \n\nFirst, students will forget what they learned if they go to school less. For example, with a four-day week, they might feel too relaxed to review what they learned and then forget it all. To remember, a student needs to keep reviewing. The more you review, the more you'll remember. Also, a four-day week isn't enough for students to learn well. Young people can learn quickly because they're not stressed. They should use this chance at school. They need to practice and learn new things to improve and be good students. \n\nAnother problem is how this could hurt them later if they get used to a four-day week. For example, a four-day week is a bad habit because college won't be like that. Before college, students need to build their skills. They have a lot to learn. With fewer school days, they might miss out on learning. College is harder than school. It will be tough for them if they're used to a four-day week. They'll have to work harder, or they'll struggle. \n\nNot everyone agrees with me. Some think a four-day week is good for students. They'll have time for fun after studying and homework. Plus, everyone needs breaks to relax their brain. I agree that breaks are important to avoid getting sick. But too many breaks aren't good. Even if a four-day week has some good points, it also has bad points for students who want to learn a lot with their teachers' help. \n\nIn conclusion, I really don't agree with a four-day school week. It will stop students from learning well. They won't be able to use their skills and knowledge fully. This could mean our country won't have great leaders or strong competition among students later.

You can do this by being punctual and listening to your teacher.\n\nI do believe you have to fail to succeed. Nothing in life is free; you have to work for it. You earn success by believing in yourself and not giving up. Take Captain America. He joined the army and was teased for being weak. But he didn't stop. He followed his dream to save people. He became the best soldier, and those who teased him respected him. That's great. To believe in yourself and do the hard things when others doubt you is not easy. Captain America had to fail before he succeeded.\n\nI think Churchill's words about failing to succeed and keeping your excitement only matter if you care a lot about your goal. I've given up on things when they didn't work out because I wasn't that excited about them. For instance, I love soccer but am too shy to play in front of others. But I love money, so I work hard for it. I find ways to make it and keep it. The difference is, I'm excited about money, not so much about soccer. You can't succeed if you don't stay excited until the end.\n\nPeople often don't succeed because they quit after the first failure. They doubt themselves and think they won't make it. But they are wrong. Everything happens for a reason. Churchill's words help people understand success and failure. They teach us to never quit and to stay excited.\n\nIn conclusion, you need to fail to succeed. It's tough to keep going after each failure, but that's how you reach your goals. And you must stay excited to keep moving forward."}

What would kids do after school if there was no power because we were trying to use less energy? I think we should use the last 2 hours for kids who stay after school for sports and other activities. They need light because it gets dark early in the winter. I also think that giving businesses only ten hours of power to save energy is not fair. Some people work different hours. It would not be right for some to work in the dark and others in the light. We live in modern times. We could probably find a better way to save energy. But if this rule is for 4 days, it could change many things for people at work and at home. Like, would we have power at home, or is it just for businesses? This could really impact people's everyday lives and jobs."}

She lost her parents when she was just a baby, and my family has looked after her since then. She didn't have friends other than us. She really wanted to make new friends. She was sure of herself and had a great way of being. On her birthday, I wanted to surprise her by bringing her to meet my friends. I hoped they would like each other. But she passed away in her room suddenly, and no one knows why. I don't think it's good for kids to only go to school online because they miss out on a lot. It's tough to get what the teacher is saying when you're not there in person; online school isn't the same as being in a real school.\n\nFirst, kids miss things like dances, events, or other school stuff. My cousin would dress me up for school events. I wanted to do something special for her too, but I never had the chance. I didn't cry at her funeral, but I did alone in my room. She didn't like to see me cry and would tell me to 'Be strong.' I remember her words all the time. I just wish she hadn't been sick. She would've met my friends, gone to school with me, and had fun. She was my best friend and meant the world to me. I will always miss her.\n\nSecond, it's hard to get what the teacher is saying when you're not there. If I miss a class, I can't understand it later without help. When I write by hand, I learn better than when I type. Writing by hand keeps me focused and helps me study quicker. Typing doesn't help me remember things. Still, online school is good for some kids. It lets them start the day later and is good for those who are sick or scared to go outside. They learn at home or on the internet.\n\nLastly, online school isn't like a real school. In a real school, you can hang out with friends, work together, study in groups, ask questions, and talk. I love doing that every day. On special days, we can dress up at school. You can't do these fun things in online school. You can't make real friends there. It's like being alone in a library. Real school is more fun than online school.\n\nIn conclusion, I can't think of only learning online. It would make me lazy, confused, and bored. I don't want a life like that or to end up bored like my cousin. She wanted to go to my school and have a good time. She was fun, made everyone laugh, and was never grossed out. Kids miss out on a lot, it's hard to learn from teachers when you're not there, and online school isn't like real school. To really learn, have fun, and be with friends, the best place is a real school."}
{"text_id": "17FDD3D6538B", "output_essay": "To save energy and money, some companies now work only four days a week, with each day lasting ten hours. Many people think schools should do the same by making the school day two hours longer and having classes only four days a week. However, some people don't like the idea of a four-day school week. I strongly believe my school should do this because it would be good for the students. It would cause less stress, better attendance, and save money. \n\nFirst, a four-day school week with longer days would make students and teachers less stressed. For instance, we had a four-day week on Veterans Day. Everyone was happy and ready to learn because of the extra day off. Students had more time to finish homework and rest. Teachers had time to mark tests, plan lessons, and be with their families. A four-day school week helps students and teachers be ready for school. \n\nAlso, having longer school days for a four-day week would mean students come to school more. I have missed a lot of school because of dentist appointments. I even got an E in government class because I missed so many Mondays. If we had an extra day off, we could use it for appointments. Many high school students work on weekends. An extra day off would let them do homework and rest so they can come to school on time. \n\nAn extra day off helps students come to school more, which means more students finish school. \n\nSome people think a four-day week is too hard for students. But having a day off saves the school money. The school would spend less on food, buses, and cleaning. The money saved could be used for things the school needs, like smart boards. It could also help students who can't afford lunch every day. So, this idea would help the school's budget. \n\nIn the end, schools should try the new schedule. Making the school day two hours longer for a four-day week will be good for everyone. It will reduce stress, improve attendance, and help the school's budget."}

At some schools, students are unhappy, and others are too busy to go to school every day. At home, students can work without other students bothering them.

At home, they feel safe. Some students have to work and live by themselves. They can't go to school in the morning because they need to make money. They might have bills to pay. Online classes help these people face tough situations and aim for a better future. I believe some students need to be alone to concentrate. In school, other students can be distracting. When students need to focus, especially during tests, online classes can be helpful. This can help them pass their classes and finish school. To sum up, online classes help people a lot. They help people reach their goals, finish school, and get a good job. Online classes are great for people who want to finish school but can't because they don't feel safe or are too busy with work."}

It might also lead to health problems later on. Some people say it's the same amount of work, just with a day off. But this doesn't mean they save energy or resources. They still do the same work, and it's not a good plan because they need to think about the students. It could also make students upset, working ten hours a day, four days a week. The good part is you get a free day to do other things, like homework. There are many ways to save energy and resources that help companies make more money. But workers at these companies work very hard. At school, some students have jobs after class, and staying at school two extra hours could hurt their work. They often work four or five hours and leave early to do homework. If they leave school later, they might be too tired for work and homework. Their minds could get tired too. Not all parents can buy everything their kids need. We use energy at school, especially for homework because of technology. Things are tough, but we don't need to study or work ten hours a day. Resources like money, energy, and food are important. Studying two extra hours could hurt both students and teachers. In the end, having an extra day off is nice, but it's hard to study more than usual. Still, there's always something good in your work.

The boss of 'SaleHouses' thinks it's a good idea to work two extra hours because the workers like it. Since they started doing this, the company works better, gets more customers, and makes more money. He says schools should do the same, because, \"I think schools can get better grades.\" This could really help students learn and understand their lessons more. It's also good for students who work on weekends. They can do their homework on Friday and then work without stress on Saturday and Sunday. First, having school for two more hours is good because students can learn and understand their lessons more. For example, students in the English 11 class at Generic_School are getting better grades now that they have two extra hours. They are more into English 11 and understand it better. So, they get good grades and the school's average grade goes up. This helps students focus and helps schools get better grades. Second, more school hours are good for students who work on weekends. Like my friend Generic_Name, who is 17 and works at 'Brickhouse.' He likes his schedule because the extra school hours mean he has more time. He does his homework on Fridays. So, Generic_Name has enough time for everything and likes the two extra hours at school. It lets him finish his homework on Friday and work without worry on the weekend. This helps students who work on weekends have enough time for homework. But, some people don't like the idea of two more hours. They say students might sleep in class because it's too long, and it's hard for teachers who travel far. They also worry more students might quit school. They don't agree with adding hours. But they are wrong. More hours would help students and schools. Students would learn and understand better, and it would help those who work on weekends. In the end, there are good and bad things about having school for two more hours. Some say it's bad because students could sleep in class, it's hard for teachers who live far away, and more students might quit. But others think it's a great idea because it helps students learn and understand more, helps those who work on weekends, and makes the school's grades better."}

The work can be split up, so everyone can do what they are good at. On the other hand, working alone can be hard if I run into something I don't get, because I would have to solve it by myself.\n\nWorking with others can help more. If we get mixed up while talking or doing something, we can ask our teammates for help. By working together, we can learn things we didn't know before. When we talk in our group, we can understand how others see things. This makes our own understanding wider because each person sees things in their own way. Working in a group can save time because we share the tasks and use our strong points. This makes us work better and finish the work the right way. Also, there's less fighting because everyone can pick what they like to do.\n\nI like working with others more than working alone, as it might take longer to do it by myself. When you're alone and don't get something, you need someone to explain and help you. For example, I had to do a science project by myself. While working at home, I ran into a problem I couldn't figure out. I looked for answers but wasn't sure if they were right, so I had to stop and ask my science teacher the next day. This way was not efficient, as it took more time than if I had been in a group, where I could have gotten help right away.\n\nOne time, I had a group project for my Business class. There were three of us, and we worked together at my friend's house. We talked about the whole project, how to present it, and what to include.

He said, \"Success is moving from one failure to another without losing your excitement.\" To me, this means to keep my eyes on the future, never give up, and always stay excited about what I love to do. Why should you stop being excited just because you made a mistake or two? Have you thought about what you could achieve if you never gave up? Imagine if the person who discovered electricity had quit? Or if your parents had split up 18 years ago because they gave up? You wouldn't be here today.\n\nDon't be afraid to fail as you work towards your future. You can learn a lot from each mistake. Try to do better every day and don't give up. Keep your excitement, be yourself, and remember that there are no limits for you. No one else can say you can't do something because they aren't you. You have to keep trying. There's no easy path to your future because nothing in life is easy. You have to work hard for what you want.\n\nFor those who don't give up, the world is very different from 100 years ago. If you want to be an artist, be one. If you want to sing, sing. If you want something, stay focused. Many people might say you can't do it. They might say you're not good enough. But you have to try again. You know yourself, where you come from, the value of hard work, and that you have dreams.\n\nYou have to get past many things, starting with yourself. Just be you and don't try to be someone else. If you want something, fight for it. To feel proud, you must be proud of yourself first. Finding a job isn't hard; what's hard is giving up and not wanting to try again. Someone once said, \"I don't understand 'no' because it means I don't get what I want.\" This is like what Churchill said: Giving up is easy. Saying, \"I don't want to try again\" is easy.

Now, he's one of the richest men and was the president of the United States. First, we love to hear about successful people. We like to know why they succeeded. Often, it's their failures that are the most interesting. I grew up with athletes in my family. They inspired me. If my older brother ran faster than me, I would practice to be faster next time. That's what's great about success stories: how people reached their success. Second, you might not like failing, but if you want to succeed, you must go through failures. Failing doesn't mean you stop trying. It means you are learning. You understand more about your goal. So, the next time you try, you'll do better. That's one step closer to your goal. Winston Churchill, the British Prime Minister, lost a big war. People didn't like him. But he learned from his mistake. When Adolf Hitler tried to take over his country, Churchill planned D-Day. It stopped one of the worst dictators ever. Then, people liked him again. Fourth, I moved to this country when I was seven. I couldn't speak English and it was tough. School and kind people motivated me. I tried hard every day. I failed a lot, but I never stopped. I knew speaking English would make my mom and my supporters proud. I failed many times. But when I finally did it, I realized failing was the best part. It drove me to succeed. I learned more than English. I learned to never quit. Finally, in life, you'll face challenges to reach your goals. Failure will be a big part of your journey. But when you overcome failure, you learn what it means to fail and to keep going.

For example, if a student texts when they should listen to the teacher, the teacher can take the phone for a while. If schools let students use cell phones, they will feel trusted. They will like this. If teachers are kind, understanding, and fair, students will use technology the right way. In the end, people who don't want cell phones in school worry about the problems they can cause. But we must remember that we live in a world full of technology.

Students everywhere are already tired from long school days. If we add an hour and a half, it would be too much. You wouldn't have enough time to do your homework. Also, you'd have less time for housework that you need to do. So, more school time would just make students even more tired. Next, I'll talk about stress. Students are already stressed by their parents, schoolwork, and other things. More school time would add to that stress. Students have to do schoolwork and homework. They also have to do chores at home. All this would make them even more stressed. So, more school time would just add to the stress. Last, I'll talk about grades. Students, especially in high school, struggle to keep their grades up. More school time would make them tired and stressed. This would make it hard for them to do well in school. It would be hard to keep up with all the work from teachers. So, more school time would make grades worse.

People from rich families might want to do well like their parents did. They aim for their goals because they were taught well. But some rich people don't try to do great things because they weren't taught to lead. They just live as well as they can. Some people with good jobs, knowledge, and schooling don't want to do big things. They just want to live comfortably and have money.

Waiting until the last minute leads to bad grades, late work, and not passing or learning. Some students have jobs or other things to do, so they rush their schoolwork without learning. Students at home might have trouble paying attention if it's noisy or if brothers or sisters bother them. Online, you're on your own unless you cheat, which is wrong.\n\nI have many reasons why students should go to school for classes. One reason is that teachers can explain things many times and in different ways until you get it. Online, you often get just one example, which isn't enough for some students. But in school, it's better. Another reason is that teachers give homework or projects. This helps you practice and get ready for tests, so you learn. Also, if you go to all your classes and do homework or projects, you can work with other students. This lets you share ideas, meet people, and talk about what you're learning.\n\nSo, going to school for all classes is better because you learn more and meet more people.

{"text_id": "5AE6F3EAEDFE", "output_essay": "\"'Success is about moving from one failure to another without losing your excitement'\"\n\nIf we fall and learn from it, we won't do it again, or we'll do it better next time. Sometimes, we give up because we didn't succeed, but we need to try many times to get it right. I agree with Churchill's idea for a few reasons. One is: If I want to succeed, I must fail first, fall, and get up without losing my joy for what I did and know if it was good or bad.\n\nTo start, in this world, things don't happen fast because I must work hard for anything I want. This doesn't mean it will be easy. I must fail to do my best. For example, many think that famous people got rich easily, but they had hard times too; they had good and bad times. If you trip over a stone, pick it up and throw it away, so you don't trip again. It will hurt more the next time. This is like trying to succeed; we see the problem, but we don't remove it.\n\nAlso, getting up after a fall without losing joy for what I did and knowing if it was good or bad is key. If I love my job, I'll put my heart into it. If it fails, I'll try again without getting upset. For instance, some pick a job or career for the money, thinking they'll live well, but they're unhappy because they don't enjoy their work. They only want the paycheck. These people always fail and don't learn. But if I want something, to make sure it goes well, I must put my passion into my work to make it happen, to always do a great job with a smile.\n\nIn conclusion, Churchill's idea is one of the best and truest we should think about. This quote gives us an important message. Like I said, get rid of the stone so you don't trip or get hurt. Life is about learning from mistakes; if you don't learn, it's probably because you're not paying attention. Be happy if you fail; just try again if you love it and work hard to make it better."}

Some people think that success doesn't come from failing a lot without quitting. But in truth, success does come from failing many times without stopping. This is because people who failed a lot before but didn't stop trying ended up doing really well later. Also, failing a lot teaches you to try harder next time to get better at what you were failing at.\n\nSome people think that success doesn't come from failing a lot without quitting. They think success starts by doing things well from the beginning and getting better at them. They also think that success comes from improving without failing, to be the best in life.\n\nBut really, success comes from failing a lot without quitting. My uncle Generic_Name is an example. He came to the United States at 31. He wanted a car. My mom said he needed a driver's license first. He studied for the test for three months. When he felt ready, he went to the DMV but failed. He tried again weeks later and failed again. He was sad. I told him not to be sad because he had another chance. After failing twice, he was worried about failing a third time and having to pay for classes. My mom encouraged him not to quit. She told him to study the questions he got wrong and try to do better. He got motivated, studied all day, and passed the test with a perfect score the next day. He was very happy. After that, a friend offered him a job driving trucks, but he needed a commercial license. He studied for this test but failed three times. He was disappointed. I told him not to give up. Months later, he took classes and passed the test. Now he has his own truck driving company. If he hadn't failed those tests, he might not have learned that failing doesn't stop you from being successful.\n\nSuccess also comes from failing a lot without quitting because it gives you experience. I'm an example. When I first went to school in the US, it was hard because I didn't understand the language. I failed tests and quizzes. It was tough because I didn't understand the questions. But one day, I told myself not to lose hope or quit. I started translating things into my language. This helped me learn. Even when I failed again, I got better because I looked at what I did wrong. If I had quit, I wouldn't be writing this essay. Now, I've learned a lot and my teachers say I've improved. Failing a lot doesn't mean you can't succeed.\n\nIn conclusion, I think success is about failing and not giving up. Failing teaches you to learn from mistakes and do better.

{"text_id": "D5EE6230B88E", "output_essay": "Some people think going to school in person is the worst way to learn. Learning online or through video calls can help students because it is easier for them to join classes. Even though there are good things about going to school, learning from home means students don't have to deal with bullies, being late because they don't have to travel, and not having food at school.\n\nGetting up early for school every day can be hard. Students have to shower, brush their teeth, some girls put on makeup, and then get their bags ready. Often, they feel too tired to get up, which can make them miss the bus. Then, they might have to stay home, wait for someone to drive them, or walk. Most students don't sleep enough, which makes it hard for them to pay attention in class. Being hungry can also make it harder to focus. When learning online, students can pick the best time for them and stay home, so they don't have to worry about how they look.\n\nLearning online means no classmates are around, which can be good. Without classmates, students can focus better because there's no noise or other things to disturb them. They can't be bullied, teased, or judged if they're not in a real classroom. Bullying can make some students feel very sad at school, whether it's about their clothes, looks, smell, or what they did before. This can make them not want to go to school. So, in online classes, students work by themselves, which can help them focus more on their studies.\n\nWhat's good about going to school in person? At school, students can talk to others and make friends. They can get extra help from teachers or friends. Since the student is not at home, parents can save money because the electricity bill will be less. Going to school lets students join sports or clubs that may help them decide what job they want, instead of staying at home all the time.\n\nIn the end, online classes can be good for students. It is the best way to learn for those who want to be safe from bullies, have no distractions from other students, always have food to help them stay focused, and be able to choose when to have classes."}

Almost all people use it, including students who have grown up with gadgets like cell phones. These devices are always with us. They let us quickly look up information or talk to anyone in the world. Some schools even allow cell phones in class. But cell phones have good and bad points. First, students at school are usually smart. They have always used technology and like to use it at school. There are two types of students. Some are learning English as a second language. Others are regular students. Second, cell phones help those learning English. They can use them as dictionaries to understand words and sentences their teachers say. They can also use them for other tasks. Regular students can use them to find information for their classes. Third, there are downsides to using cell phones. Doctors say they can hurt your eyes and heart. They can also make you lose focus in class. If you use your phone to get answers for homework or tests, you're not learning. I'm a student learning English. I use my phone to look up words my teachers use. It helps me. But I've seen that using a phone in class can be bad if you can't control yourself. It can distract you and others. In the end, cell phones can be helpful in class, but it depends on how you use them. You shouldn't use them during tests. And if your teacher says it's okay to use your phone, then you can. But using them too much can be bad for your health. So, it's important to not use them all the time."}

But I have learned that the number of tries doesn't matter. What matters is to succeed in the end. For instance, since I started my classes here, I have passed them all. But I have friends who didn't pass their classes. When they took the classes again, they did better than me the next time. I took an Earth Science class last year, and it was tough. I didn't do well on many quizzes. But my teacher let me take them again, and I passed. I found out that quizzes help students get ready for the SOLs. They helped me a lot.

An expert can tell them if they are doing something right or wrong. They can also give tips about the idea.\n\nAnother reason to get help is that an expert can point them in the right direction. People can trust them for support and focus on their choice. It would be simpler for them to trust their feelings and discuss it with someone who can confirm they are making a good choice.\n\nLastly, an expert can share what they learned from their own big life choices. People can hear these stories and think about if they want to keep going with their plan. Learning from someone else's errors can also help them in life.\n\nIn conclusion, I think getting advice from experts on big life choices is good for people who trust their own feelings and thoughts.

They offer benefits that will be useful soon. I think that students would get the most out of online courses for a few reasons. First, online learning can be like regular school work but more fun and interesting. Courses often check your level with tests at the start. This helps make the learning just right for you. Some students might like learning with a teacher on video, thinking they will learn more this way. But online courses have different ways to learn, like games, that can help you understand better.\n\nOnline courses test your knowledge at the beginning with these tests. This way, they make sure the lessons are right for you. They also tell you what you need to work on, which is good for future tests.\n\nSome people think that learning with a teacher on video is better. They say a live teacher can explain things better and make learning more personal. But online courses also have videos and can give you the same benefits without needing to talk to someone live.\n\nIn the end, I still think that students would really benefit from online courses. They make learning interactive and fun. The tests at the start help make the learning fit your level. Even if some people are unsure because they haven't tried it, they might find online courses easy and fun if they try. This is why I think online learning is good and will be helpful soon."}

Many people in the United States are poor and can't pay for these classes. They need to work and study hard to reach their goals. Going to school is better than studying from home. Students will fall behind if they take online classes. A friend of mine, Generic_Name, was pregnant and studied from home. She couldn't join the classes every day because she had to care for her baby and do house chores. She missed many classes and had to start over. She decided to go back to school instead of continuing online. Some people think online classes are good because they can work and make money.

Online classes won't help students learn. They don't take them seriously and might fail. Online classes are too expensive for some. They will fall behind because of housework and will have to work much harder to reach their goals. They can't reach their goals without going to classes. That's why I think they should go to school.

In high school, they can't leave their phones at home. Some schools don't let kids use phones in class, while others do. They let them use phones to learn. Phones in class can be good. Kids can look up facts fast and keep them on their phones. They also feel more free and in charge of their learning. As kids grow, they may not listen to their parents. They think they're grown up and know what's best. They might go to school just to see friends and not care about learning. If they can't use their phones, they might start trouble. Over time, they could become bad students. But if they feel free, they'll pay more attention to their work. In the US, high school starts at 7:20 am and ends at 2:10 pm. Kids have the afternoon for homework and fun. They feel free and not too stressed. In Asia, school is from 7:00 am to 11:30 am, then from 1:00 pm to 5:00 pm. That's a long day with lots of classes. Kids everywhere have homework. If they feel free at school, they'll do it well. When people are happy with their daily tasks, they do their best. Bad students aren't always bad at studying. They might not want to improve because they're bored. If teachers watch, they'll see these students often group together because they don't care. But if schools let them use phones for learning, these kids might do better. They'll learn when to use their phones right. If class isn't boring, they'll enjoy it more. If there's a prize for using phones well in class, these kids might win. They can find information fast and save it on their phones. Later, they can review it and find studying easier. Schools still need rules for phone use. Phones are for learning, not for fun all the time. This helps kids know when it's okay to use them. Without rules, phones could be bad for learning. Kids might play games or text instead. So, rules help kids use phones in a good way. In the end, letting kids use phones in class can be very helpful if schools have good rules."}

We wouldn't have to deal with mean friends either. \n\nUsing video calls for school would make getting ready easier. Students would just brush their teeth and log in to talk to their teacher. There would be less noise and no other kids to distract us. Learning would be easier because the teacher could pay attention to just one student. This way, students would learn better. It would also be safer, with all the scary things happening at schools these days. \n\nWe wouldn't have to worry about getting sick from school food. It's often not good. We'd be happier eating at home. We could save money by not buying school lunch. \n\nOnline classes could help stop bullying. No one could pick on you in a one-on-one video call. Parents wouldn't have to worry about their kids being around bad influences. Kids would only meet other kids outside. This could help us get ready for adult life. \n\nIf we start online classes, we could save a lot of money. We could use that money for important things.

Not everyone has the same chances in life. But this way, many students who find it hard to go to school can still aim to have a job one day.\n\nI think this matter is mainly about how we learn. Online students can pay more attention, focus better, and not get sidetracked by classmates. They often remember what they learn better and know more. Many finish school faster than others. They also have more time for other things. They can play sports, learn music, study new languages, or work. These things get them ready for grown-up life. If they want to help others, they can volunteer. Some can't do this because it's during school. Online classes give them time to do it.\n\nSingle moms are important to consider. They've had hard times that affect their future. Online classes help because they need to hire someone to watch their child. They also need to work. This way, their life can be more flexible. Some kids quit school because their parents work a lot. They need to earn money, find jobs, look after brothers or sisters, or do housework.\n\nNowadays, we often forget about good values. Online classes help keep your values safe. In regular school, you might meet people who change how you think and act. This can lead to bad choices for your future. Online classes are safer.

If we have to study for ten hours, it will be hard, but they should pay us well. We can't learn everything in two hours. We have seven classes in one day. How can we learn it all in two hours? Then we have tests. Everyone will fail because we need to study a lot to get good jobs. We need to go to college, but not everyone can. Some students don't have the money or the right papers to go to a good college and follow their dreams. I want to be a police officer, but I don't have the papers. It's hard for us to get good jobs. We can only finish high school and look for other work. For example, if I get a job that pays seven dollars an hour and I have to pay for rent, bills, and help my family, it's very hard. Many Spanish people work two or three jobs because we have many bills, and going to school in our countries wasn't easy. Like my mom, she only finished 3rd grade.

But if school is only two hours, it's better to work instead. In two hours, you can't learn enough. If they make us go for two hours, how much will they pay teachers? It doesn't make sense. How many classes can you have in two hours? One? But we need our diplomas. Without them, it's harder to get jobs or go to college. They need to think hard about only having two hours of school.

Some can't go to college and study more. With only two classes, colleges will say we don't meet the requirements. They might make a special college for students who only study two hours. They don't know enough about math or other subjects. Maybe they'll make it easy to go to college or give us the credits we need. But to get a good job, they'll ask if you have a diploma. If I say no, they won't hire me. Then it's too late. I won't have a job or a diploma. It's good and bad. We like money, but we also want our diplomas. This is my last year, and I want my diploma to become a police officer. If I only go to school for two hours, I'll be far from my dream.

This is because students might take photos or videos of others and use them to make fun or bully them. \n\nAnother reason to let students use phones in class is for those who don't speak English well. They might need translation apps. But sometimes, students use their phones to translate bad words and share them. Some students text friends instead of paying attention in class. Others watch videos or play games on their phones. \n\nI think phones can be a problem because students might text people outside of school and say things about other students. This could cause trouble. Phones can also make students lazy because they might want to use their phones instead of doing their work. \n\nIn the end, I agree that phones can help in class, but we need to limit and watch how they are used to stop problems."}
{"text_id": "42D8CB22DADA", "output_essay": "People get better options from those who know more. The first good thing is that people learn from their wrong choices. For example, a man learned not to trust every bank. He then chose a bank that did not cheat him or charge him too much. Also, people get more ideas. One person decided to save his money better. He kept all the money he got from shopping and working. In the end, he had enough to pay his taxes and his rent. Lastly, people make smarter choices in life. For instance, someone decided to stay away from bad people. This led him to be friends with good people he could trust. But, getting advice from someone who knows a lot is not always good. It can cause misunderstandings and bad choices. Still, people often understand things better and choose smarter when they listen to those who know more."}
{"text_id": "4176E05183E0", "output_essay": "What are the good things about students taking classes from home?\n\nI think students will find more options online. This means they will be less stressed and get more help from teachers. They will also pay better attention to their work and not get as easily sidetracked. Plus, everyone is talking about online learning, and since kids already use phones in school, it might be time to try something new.\n\nMy first point is that kids who learn slowly and are in big classes often struggle. They get distracted and don't finish their work. Instead, they talk to friends. Also, when many kids need the teacher's help, she can only help one at a time. So, some kids don't get the help they need. And the noise in the classroom can bother kids who are trying to work, making them upset.\n\nConsider a girl who was doing well in school with lots of friends. Suddenly, her grades fall, she loses her friends, and she doesn't want to try anymore. She starts to dislike school because of these problems. This is another reason.\n\nMy third point is about online videos. These videos help students with work they didn't finish. They can learn at their own pace from the videos. In a regular class, students can fall behind because the teacher moves on to new topics quickly. That's why some kids can't keep up and don't finish their work.\n\nMy final point is that some kids skip school because they think it's not important. They might be having a hard time at school and don't want to be there when things go wrong. They might feel unsafe at school. So, learning from home online is a better choice.\n\nThese are the reasons kids should take classes online at home. It's safer, meets their needs, helps them keep up with the class, and gives more one-on-one time with teachers. It also gives them more time and keeps them away from trouble. So, taking classes online is a good thing."}

They can help their parents with different jobs, do volunteer work, and take part in many other things. They might also work to save money for college, buy things they want, or hang out with friends. They could buy their own food, clothes, and shoes. They might pay for their own phone or even live on their own.

{"text_id": "8B1F8FCC9E56", "output_essay": "Working by yourself shows what you can do on your own. Being in a group can cause mix-ups and not-so-good work. Some people like being alone because they get more done without others around. There are three reasons why working by yourself is better than in a group. The first reason is that you can do more things by yourself. The second reason is that you can work at your own speed without others rushing you. The last reason is that you don't have to worry about someone else doing a bad job on their part of the work.\n\nFirst, working alone is good because you can do more. You don't have to listen to endless talk about different things. Friends might be playing games or texting, which can leave work undone. When you depend on yourself, you finish your work. But in a group, some may not want to help. Groups can make some people lazy, and one person might end up doing everything. Being alone is better because you don't have to wait for others and it has more benefits. It shows what you can do by yourself, not like the limits of working in a group.\n\nSecond, working at your own speed means no one is making you rush. Working in a group can make you go too fast, and the work might not be as good. Rushing can make the results bad, especially when you need a good grade. Working slowly and carefully can lead to better work. It's important to check your work for small mistakes. Also, you can work in the way that's best for you.\n\nLast, you don't have to worry about how well others are doing. Group work is hard when you're worried about how well others are doing their part. There's the stress of making sure tasks are done right, planning who does what, and giving out jobs. If you do your part and others don't, and you get a bad grade, it can be upsetting. A big plus of working alone is not having to deal with others not doing their part.\n\nIn conclusion, working alone is better because you can get things done well and work how you want to. You don't have to worry about a group's mistakes affecting your grade. While working with others has good points because of teamwork, working alone is often better."}

Books have so many different stories! Also, reading isn't just fun, it's also great for learning. It can teach you how to do something or help you understand something better. There are even books that teach you new words and what they mean, like a dictionary. Lastly, when I had nothing to do, reading was always fun for me! I learned about lots of things like basketball and history. I didn't know much about history at first, but by reading, I learned about many wars and old kingdoms.

I'm a student too, and I know how it feels. Going to school for almost a year without a long break is not fun. Long breaks give students good chances to do things like spend time with family, travel, and keep their minds active at home. \n\nOne good thing about long breaks is you get to spend time with your family. When you're with your family, you learn new things. For example, families often cook new foods and teach the kids how to make them. That's a way of learning. Learning at home can really help you later in life. \n\nAnother reason long breaks are good is that they let people travel if they can. When you travel, you see and learn about new things. You find things that interest you and that you might want to become. That's also learning. So, I think we should have long breaks. After 10 months of school, we need two months to rest our minds. Even when we're not in school, we're learning. There's so much in the world we haven't seen. When you visit a place, you always learn something new."}

Sometimes we don't want to change, but every day we face new things and challenges. Most grown-ups spend their days at work, trying to find new ways to please their customers. Because of this, companies have started working longer hours but only for four days a week. The school board is curious about this idea. They wonder, 'Would this work in schools? Could it make things better? Would it be good for us?'\n\nI think it's a bad idea to use the business way of doing things in schools. The only good thing about having a day off, like Friday, is that teens can do what they want. They can work, hang out with friends, or stay home. But this won't help them in the long run. Students will become lazier and care less about school. This could lead them to make bad choices because they might think they can skip school more.\n\nAlso, there are problems with after-school clubs and sports. The biggest issue could be homework. The two extra hours each day will make students tired. If they stay up until midnight to finish homework or projects, it will hurt them. As a high school student, I know it's hard. For many teens, it can lead to bad grades, stress, and even sadness. This stress is not needed because there's less time to turn in work. Most high school students sleep 7 hours, but they should sleep 9 to 10 hours. Parents will also worry if their kids are not in school. They will stress about paying for someone to watch them. Students might not pay attention in class or to their projects because of the four-day week.\n\nSo, having school for four days with longer hours each day doesn't make sense. It doesn't fit with how families live, and it will be hard for them to get used to the new schedule. Students who can't drive will cause problems for parents who need to take them to activities and school events.\n\nIn the end, it's not a good idea to add two more hours to the school day. It won't help. In fact, it will use more energy because we still need time for after-school activities. The day off could be used for extra practice or meetings. Some people, like students, might like the idea of a day off. But it's not as good as they think. It will cause a lot of trouble for families, schools, and students. They won't have time to do other things, like work to help their parents with money or buy school clothes. The best thing to do is to keep school hours the same and find new ways to save energy and resources at work.\n\nMade by: Generic_Name"}

You will mess up sometimes; but if you are kind, honest, and strong, you won't harm the world or upset it much. We earn our living by what we get, but we create our lives by what we give. I've heard many reasons why people stop chasing their dreams, like 'it wasn't meant to be,' or 'it wasn't fun anymore,' or 'life is about being famous.' We find all the reasons to not keep our promises with proof to back it up, but is this how we want to live? We don't want to be wrong and will quit a goal instead of risking looking silly. What we think about success can help or block us. These thoughts may be hidden, meaning we don't know we have them and we look for proof to keep trying to win. We will probably fail at some point when we go after our goals. We will probably want to quit. We will probably feel upset and stressed, etc. And let's be clear about what success is: it's moving from one failure to another. It's about getting better in parts of life; it's not just about money, fame, or being known worldwide. You have to be careful with the mistakes you make. For example, I often fail but never give up because you should always keep the excitement to get what you want. Some mistakes might become successes later. The mistakes I make now help me do well in high school or college. One mistake I make is waiting for important things for too long. Sometimes I want to quit waiting, but I think if I can't wait, then I'll never win. Some people say if you fail once, you'll always be down.

A normal school has lots of students, and teachers can't help everyone. But learning from home is good for students who don't like being around many people. At home, there are no distractions, they can learn more words, and pick when they want to study. \n\nFirst, schools are often loud and other students can make it hard to learn. At home, we can pay attention better because it's quiet and we can follow what we need to do. Sometimes, teachers have to stop teaching because a student is using their phone or talking, which is not fair to those who want to learn. It's better to study at home in peace. \n\nAlso, if you live far from the city, you can learn better because you don't have to travel to the city. People in the city might not know as much as those in the countryside. In the city, you hear bad language, and students might start using it too. But at home, you won't hear these words. This bad language comes from schools too, because some students copy what they hear from new music artists. They think it's cool, but it's not good for students. \n\nLastly, I like being at home. I help my mom, clean, and sleep a lot. Sometimes I'm lazy and just want to sleep more. With online classes, we can start whenever we want, even if we haven't showered. If we're tired, we can take a break. In a normal school, we have to get up early and might miss the bus, making us late. At home, we're never late and don't worry about missing class. \n\nIn the end, more schools should let us study online. It's safer, in case of a school shooting, we won't be there. There are many good reasons to learn from home, like learning more, choosing different classes, and focusing on our work. \n\nStudents will like these programs because they can study on their own time and pay attention without noise from other students."}

Teachers will become very stressed. Students will get upset because they won't have any breaks or time to think. They also won't be able to enjoy other activities.\n\nAnother reason I believe they shouldn't extend the school day is that it will end too late. For younger kids, it might be fine. But for older kids, they won't get home until 6:30 or 7:00. If they have sports, they will get home even later. They will have no time left for other things.\n\nThe final reason is that it will ruin everyone's schedules. For instance, if students have a dentist appointment or a birthday party, they will miss it because they are still in school. Teachers might have another meeting or need to take care of their own children. But they will be too busy teaching to do these things.\n\nSo, I think the school board should not add an hour and a half to the school day.

This way of learning isn't effective, and the teacher can't always be there to help them with their work. Students might cheat and then they wouldn't learn what the teacher is trying to teach. Teachers can't always help everyone because they are busy with other students. This might make some students not want to join the class at all.\n\nStudents need to learn about education and society. Without this, life after school could be tough. They might not understand people or might not like the teacher's online methods. They don't really know their teacher or if what they're learning is right. If you're confused, another teacher can help you in school. In my country, school feels like a second home and teachers are like second parents.\n\nI had an online class once, and it was hard to get help when I needed it. Everyone talked over each other, and I couldn't hear the teacher well. I didn't learn much. I learn better in a classroom with the teacher and other students there.\n\nOften, many students would miss the online classes. The video calls were less stressful with fewer students, and you could learn better. When students skip school, it's usually because they don't like the teacher's methods. This is a big problem. Some teachers notice when you skip, and they might not want to help you if you're often absent. But students need to learn. In school, a counselor can switch you to a different teacher. In college, you don't have this choice.\n\nI think going to school is better because it teaches you responsibility. You learn to respect others and improve yourself. You can figure out what you want to do after school, like becoming a reporter. School has programs to help you learn more about your interests.\n\nIn school, you make your own choices for the future.

Schools are there to help you learn for your future.\n\nIn conclusion, I don't think online classes are a good idea. Students won't get much from them.

Being at school is much better for you. \n\nAt home, you might try to work but end up getting distracted. If you forget about your work, it might be too late to finish it. For example, if a teacher gives a quiz, a student at home might cheat. Then, when there's a test, the student might fail because they don't know the answers. That's why it's better to be at school where the teacher can watch you. \n\nIf a teacher finds a student cheating, the student will learn not to do it again. If the student needs help, they should ask the teacher. Having classmates around is good too. They can help you if you don't understand something. But if you're taking an online class, the teacher can't show you your mistakes in person. The teacher at school can also motivate you to do better. \n\nWhat if some students don't have internet at home? They can't join online classes. Their families might be poor and can't pay for the internet. This can stress the family if they already struggle to pay for rent and food. Teachers wouldn't want their students to worry about money. I have a friend who had to work to help pay for the internet at home. We don't want students to fail because they don't have money. We want them to do well. That's why online classes aren't as good as being at school with your teacher and friends. \n\nIn the end, online classes at home aren't as good as being at school. Students should only learn from home if they are sick and can't come to school. Or if they want to finish school early and have talked to their counselor. Some students might not like getting up early, but it's good for them. It teaches them to be ready for a job where they have to wake up early, just like for school."}

I believe schools should have a four-day school week and make the school day two hours longer. This way, students can learn more and finish their work every day. Plus, teachers and students would get more family time on the weekends.\n\nStudents could learn more and get their work done every day if we had two extra hours. For instance, think about being in a computer class. Your teacher tells you to type something and then will show you how to save it. But if you're only halfway done and it's time to leave, you won't learn how to save your work. If the school day were longer, you could finish typing and learn how to save before shutting down the computer. This means that with a longer school day, students can complete their work and learn more.\n\nTeachers and students would get more family time on the weekends. Right now, we have a five-day school week with only Saturday and Sunday off. But if we had a four-day week, we'd get an extra day off. We'd have Friday, Saturday, and Sunday free. We could go to the beach, the park, or travel to other places without worrying about having just two days off. This shows that a four-day school week would be good for students and teachers.\n\nSome students think that a four-day school week with longer days wouldn't help them. But they're mistaken. Having a four-day week and longer school days would give them an extra day with their families, more time each day to finish school work, and they'd learn more.\n\nI hope schools will switch to a four-day school week and make the days two hours longer in the future. Then, we can get our work done on time, teachers can teach us more, and we can enjoy more time with our families."}

Another good thing is that students can tell their friends about the jobs they learned about. This helps friends who don't have the same chances at their schools.\n\nFirst, to choose a career, you need to like it. Students can think about what they really love to do.

Going to these businesses is very good for students to start thinking about their future jobs.\n\nSecond, when students visit businesses to learn about a job they like, they might change their minds. They might like a different job more after learning about it. Having many choices can make students think again about their first job choice. Or, they might still like their first choice and want to learn more about it.\n\nLastly, not every school has the same chances for students. But students who do have these chances can share what they learn with others. This can give other students the same help. They don't have to worry about their future after high school.

Parents will need to find someone to watch their kids on the day off.\n\nSecond, the teachers and students will both be exhausted. For example, the teacher won't have enough time to check tests and homework. Also, the students will be so tired that they won't listen in class or they might cause trouble. They might fall asleep or be grumpy. They won't have enough time to study and might fail tests. They will also have less time for homework and sleep.\n\nThird, students who play sports or have other hobbies will have less time for them. For instance, students will need to stay at practice and won't get to be with their families as much. Also, they'll have less time to hang out with friends or do homework because they have to go to games. It's the same for students who play music; they always have to be at concerts. This is very stressful and means more work for the students.\n\nFourth, being in school more means less family time. For example, parents will see their kids less. They will also need someone to watch their kids on the day off. If they can't find anyone, one parent might have to stay home and miss work. They will earn less money because of this. They will also spend more on food and use more electricity.\n\nSome people like the idea because they want a three-day weekend.\n\nIn conclusion, the school should not change because parents won't get to spend more time with their kids. Also, the teacher and students will be very tired. The students won't have time for sports or clubs after school. They might sleep in class, not listen, or cause trouble. Parents will need to find someone to watch their kids on the day off. If they can't, they'll have to miss work. They will earn less money.\n\nFinally, I hope the school keeps things as they are. It will cause problems if they change."}

I want to return to the D.R. because of its culture, places, and food.\n\nThe culture in the D.R. is very showy but nice. People there love to celebrate holidays with lots of excitement. They dress up, paint themselves, and decorate their homes. Our schools even have special events. We have dances for each holiday! Our classes also focus on these celebrations. Everyone loves the holidays there; we all enjoy doing something special. It's great to see how much people care about our culture.\n\nThere are many different places to see in the D.R. Each one is unique. Take the malls, for example. Each one has its own theme. The hotels are also unique. Some have non-stop parties with music, bars, and food. Others are quiet places to relax. Not to forget the historical sites, like Altos de Chavón and the Cave of Wonders. These places are both alike and different. One is a mysterious cave, and the other is a city made of stone that stands for freedom. Every place in the D.R. has its own charm.\n\nHowever, some people don't like the D.R. because not everyone is friendly and some places are not nice. But the food is so good, it makes up for the bad parts. Like any place, the D.R. has its own food. But we have so many kinds! We have about five different soups, each made in its own way. And we cook different dishes every day. One day I eat one thing, the next day something totally different. The food in the D.R. is incredible.\n\nThe culture, sights, and food show why I want to go back to the D.R. I love how we show our love for our country, the unique places, and our cooking. I wouldn't trade it for anything. If you visit the D.R., I suggest you go to Generic_City."}
{"text_id": "65D84CCF2E74", "output_essay": "Is thinking up new things more important than knowing facts? I agree with the scientist Albert Einstein. When you use your imagination, you are more open to different ideas. Imagination lets you think more broadly. When you have knowledge, you already understand what is going on. I believe Albert Einstein became a great scientist because he used his imagination. Imagine having an open mind. With an open mind, you can think about anything. Nothing can hold you back. Knowledge can limit your thoughts because you stick to what you know is true. For example, if I wanted to build a car using only what I know, I would build a boring, old car. But I want to build an amazing car, something no one has seen before. I need to use my imagination to create something new and exciting. Something that can inspire others to think up new things too. Imagination and knowledge are not the same. Imagination has something special about it. As a kid, I have lots of imagination. That's why we kids can come up with many answers when adults ask us questions. We don't know much, so we make things up. This is why some adults think kids are cool. We don't just rely on what we know."}
{"text_id": "1A8A994EBFDA", "output_essay": "Students' Courses and Career Choices\n\nThese days, people often argue about whether it's smart for students to pick classes that match their future jobs. I believe students should choose classes in school that will help them get ready for a certain job.\n\nFirst, students who pick classes linked to their job will have a lot of time to get ready for their future work. There's a well-known saying: 'Practice makes perfect.' High school students can study for three years. That's a long time to get better bit by bit. With enough practice, students will learn a lot about their job. It's smart for students to set career goals and work hard to achieve them.\n\nSecond, students who choose classes about their job will learn a lot in their subjects. This is good because it helps them start learning job-related knowledge. Also, students can learn what they want, and this will make them want to study more. They may feel it will help them later on. Plus, it makes them stronger candidates when they apply to college because their high school classes are similar to college classes.\n\nThird, it helps students grow as people. They can understand society better and feel more responsible while learning about their job. With this in mind, when students work at a company, they will act well and use what they learned in their projects. This is also good for the country's money situation; skilled people will help society grow.\n\nHowever, some think that picking classes based on a job can limit students' future dreams and hobbies. But choosing job-related classes has many good points. For example, students can get better at acting like professionals, countries need skilled people for the economy, and colleges like students who are good at their main subject. Since students might change their minds, I suggest that parents and teachers give good advice before picking classes. It will help students understand themselves. Also, with this help, students should think hard about their future because it might shape who they become.\n\nIn short, picking classes that are about a job is good for students' futures. It's like a guiding light that shows students a safe way to go."}
{"text_id": "6FEF08E3FC60", "output_essay": "Former British leader Winston Churchill once said, \"Success is about moving from one failure to another without losing your excitement.\" I agree with Churchill's idea that failing is a big part of trying to succeed. I think these words are very powerful and mean a lot to people who keep trying and don't stop. Over time, we see that this idea is really true. Famous people who are remembered today made mistakes and were often turned down. But they all did one thing the same: they worked hard to reach their dreams, no matter what got in their way. Look at The Beatles, one of the greatest bands ever. They were turned away and told they wouldn't make it in music, but they didn't stop trying and reached their dream. Now they are famous in music history. We should also remember that failing doesn't mean it's the end. If we think about it the right way, our mistakes help us learn. Strong and smart people understand that things aren't easy. We have to do our best to get what we want. The last things we should lose are hope and excitement. If we keep those, it doesn't matter how many times we fall, we will get back up and try again until we succeed. Also, if you want to succeed, you need to stay away from things that can make you fail. You'll know you're on the right track when everything feels tough. The things we want most are usually the hardest to get. To sum up, we should never stop trying. Whenever we want something, we must keep fighting for it. Looking at good examples around us helps us see that if we keep hope and excitement, we'll get what we want. I don't know any strong and successful person who had it easy. Remember Churchill's words, and you'll go far."}
{"text_id": "45487C53673C", "output_essay": "Liking what you do and succeeding means to keep going. Winston Churchill, a past leader of Britain, once said, \"Success is moving from one failure to another without losing your excitement.\" Failing is important when you want to succeed because it makes you feel strong inside. It stops you from giving up on your dreams. One reason why failing is important is that it makes you feel strong. For example, a student named Generic_Name wants to finish his last school year in less than seven months. He has not done it yet, even after many tries. But he keeps trying because he feels strong inside. This strength helps him stay positive about his past failures. It is a key skill for reaching your goals. Another reason is that failing stops you from giving up on your dreams. Take Generic_Name, a Cuban girl who wants to be a nurse in a big hospital in Virginia, USA. She doesn't speak English, but she won't stop trying. The hospital boss won't hire her because of the language. But she values her nursing dream more than what others say. She keeps trying. No one can stop her. Her failures make her look past what others think. This shows that failing is a key skill for success. Some people think that failing is not a good way to keep chasing your dreams. For example, if you want to live in Mexico but you're in Cuba, you might not be able to go because of Cuba's travel rules. But failing is still important. It gives you a strong feeling and stops you from giving up before you succeed. Even if others disagree, it's important to see that failing helps you reach your goals. In summary, failing is important for success because it makes you feel strong and stops you from giving up. When you feel strong, you stay positive and keep going, no matter how many times you fail. The word \"giving up\" doesn't fit someone who always thinks beyond what others say, even if the dream seems impossible. Some people don't think chasing success is the best way to succeed. But failing is a great way to achieve your dreams without losing excitement."}

I think it would be good if our school let us stay in class for two more hours. This would show us how important our education is. It would also help us save energy and resources. Having longer classes would be great for students like me. We would learn to put more time into our studies and use our time well. Education teaches us a lot quickly. If we had more time, we could learn even more. Not having enough time can be bad, especially in school. For instance, we might not have enough time to make something good. We students need time to grow. It would help if our school gave us more time to learn everything well. Students like me need enough time to get better by learning more.

Students use their gadgets to do their work and join classes from home through the internet or video calls. Is it good for students to go to class from home? They might not listen well to the teacher if they are with their friends in class. But some people think it's good for students to learn from home because they might pay better attention. It also lowers the number of deaths at schools. \n\nLetting students learn from home on the internet is a big chance for those who can't go to school because they are sick. For example, students who can't move well or should not go outside can join in on video calls and do their work from home. They would be safe and happy to be included. Also, it can cut down on bullying and suicides at school. For instance, a student once killed himself because others called him fat, which is very mean. Schools should be places where kids learn a lot. Teachers need to teach kids how bad bullying is. Kids sometimes hurt themselves because of mean words. This could lead to big problems later, like crimes or school shootings. They might fight with others and get angry. These things can make them upset with society. One day, they might bring a gun to school to get back at people, which would make schools look bad. \n\nSome students find it hard to pay attention in class. Learning from home on the internet or through video calls can help them focus without friends around to distract them. For example, some kids like to joke around when it's quiet. They get everyone's attention, and then no one can concentrate. Some want to play games or cheat on tests with their friends. Getting distracted in class can make them fail because they won't understand their work. Focusing will help students pay better attention and understand more. Being at home can make them feel more at ease. For example, some are too shy to ask questions in class. With the internet or video calls, they can ask questions by emailing the teacher and take part in class. \n\nAlso, going to school is important for all students. But now, they can go to school through the internet or video calls. This is very useful for helping them focus. It can also reduce school shootings and suicides from bullying. This way, students can learn in a safe place."}

I think it's too bad for teenagers who have parents to pay for everything. These teenagers have all the time to go to school and learn quickly. But for those who don't have this chance, it's not good. For teenagers living in the United States, going to school is hard because some came here to work. They are old enough for school but have to work to help their families back home. I think it's amazing that some schools let them learn from home through the internet or video calls. Education is important because it helps you get better jobs. Without education, it's harder to succeed. So, they should take this chance to learn and improve their job options. Life is strange because some who can go to school don't want to. I've met guys who have everything but hate school. They choose to smoke or drink instead.

I will get my diploma and then, God willing, work towards my future. In conclusion, we should take any chance we get because opportunities come only once. The chance some schools offer to learn from home is good. If students are sick and can't go to school, they can still keep up with their classes from home.

Online classes are good because students can finish faster than in normal school. This gives them more time for things like sports, reading, or just relaxing. Schools have two types of online classes: one-on-one and group. One-on-one classes are good because the teacher can pay more attention to one student. This helps the student understand better. It's also good for shy students who are more comfortable talking without other students around. Group classes are like normal school classes but online. Students can't really miss a day because they can choose when to have class. Sometimes, you can pick your teacher if the school lets you. Some online schools use video calls. Video calls are good because you can see the teacher and classmates. It's easier to learn when you can see what's happening. Students can talk to each other and help out if someone doesn't understand. Teachers try to make classes fun so students don't get bored. If there's time left, students can do homework together during the video call. They can ask questions and get help right away. Some students can't go to a regular school. They might be sick and need to stay home. Or their parents might have jobs that make the family move a lot. Some students stay home because they were bullied.

I agree with Churchill when he said, \"Success is about moving from one failure to another without losing your excitement.\" Trying again and again makes you stronger. You learn from your mistakes. And failing a lot helps you love your success. These are some reasons why I agree with Churchill. \n\nFirst, some people think failing many times makes you weak. But they don't see how strong you are for keeping on until you win. Easy tasks are for those who don't trust themselves. We might stop after we fail. But we won't know if we could have won if we don't keep trying. I have a friend who gets mad when things don't work out. I've learned that staying positive makes things easier. \n\nSecond, you learn from failing. Think about being 60 with grandkids. Which question would you like more: 'How did you become successful?' or 'Why didn't you try to be successful?' You'd like the first one more. We learn a lot from failing and trying again. You will tell them how tough it is to win. We also learn because we don't make the same mistakes again. It won't make you perfect, but you'll get better. \n\nFinally, failing makes you love your success more. Success is hard, so you value what you get. It also makes you a better person. It teaches you to be careful, to help others, and to respect people. I remember my brother used to spend a lot on clothes and other things. Now he fixes computers and makes more money. But he spends less because he knows how hard it was to get there. He takes care of what he has. \n\nIn summary, Churchill was right. We should keep trying until we win.

I believe students should take these classes because they can help keep them out of gangs, fight off sadness, and give them something to do after school. If teachers talk to them and get them to join these classes, they will get a lot of help. Their minds will work better and they will be busy.\n\nFirst, being in a gang is very risky, and right now, many students want to join gangs. If students take part in music, drama, or art, they can stop thinking about gangs. Often, students join gangs because they don't have support at home. But if they get into music, drama, or art, they can turn into better people and students than if they hung out with bad crowds. Also, it's more fun and easy for students to get into these classes.\n\nSecond, students who take these classes are less likely to feel very sad. Many students feel sad because they have nothing fun to do. Some hurt themselves because they feel worthless. Music lets students share their feelings and thoughts. Many singers get famous by singing about their feelings, and others connect with their words. I remember a girl who was very sad. She wrote about her feelings and now she's famous.\n\nThird, students will have activities after school if they take music, drama, or art. Often, students just go home and use social media or play games. They should be learning new things in these classes instead. Also, if students don't have homework or if their parents are at work, they can spend time in these classes.\n\nIn conclusion, I think students must take music, drama, or art classes. They will avoid harmful actions and might grow into better individuals or even become artists. Some might argue that these classes are a waste of time or not needed for graduation. They might also say students should focus on their main classes and homework."}

It felt like doing homework all the time. Even though the work was explained well, it was still better to have a teacher nearby. Many students have failed classes because it's hard to focus and learn at home. My old friend Generic_Name said that in 2010, he took classes from home. He got good grades but didn't really learn anything. He just looked up answers online and sent them to his teacher. He didn't get much from learning at home.\n\nI don't see any good in students learning from home. I couldn't do it because I have to look after my younger brother and two sisters after school. My parents work late, so I'm the only one who can take care of them. This means I wouldn't have time for my schoolwork at home. A guy at Generic_School said that their home learning program wasn't helping students. He wrote that many students complained about not learning on their own. They preferred being at school with teachers and having more time to work. Some teachers might not like this way of learning either. Generic_Name said learning at home is hard. She suggested going to school to pass classes and really learn.\n\nSome students think learning from home is good for them. My cousin Generic_Name, who doesn't work or have siblings, finds it easy to focus and learn alone because she's smart and has the time. But not everyone can do this. Another student from Generic_School who graduated in 2015 said it was tough to learn from home. He also thinks it's better to go to school. My teacher told me it's much better to go to school.

It also makes us think about the good and bad points of going to school for only four days each week. These days, saving energy and resources is something businesses do a lot because these resources are running out fast. But these businesses are also worried about the harm that could happen if they don't act. Many have started working only four days a week, but for ten hours each day. Schools are now looking at this new way of working too. Are they going to use the same four-day plan? But what if having less time to learn hurts the students? Most schools teach for five days a week, about eight hours each day. But now, to save energy and resources, they are thinking about four-day weeks and making each day two hours longer. I think it's a good idea to save the world's resources and energy. But I don't agree with cutting two hours of learning time. We need more time to study to reach our goals. With two hours less, we're just wasting time at school. For example, a student usually needs eight hours over five days to look at four assignments each day. That means they spend an hour and a half on each one to remember anything. Two hours less is not enough time to study. When we think again about saving resources and energy, we know it's important for our lives. We need to learn how to protect them. But there are other ways to do this without making the school day two hours shorter. For example, businesses or groups that care about the environment could make a special day for the Earth. They could do things like clean rivers, pick up trash, plant trees, and turn off factories that make smoke. Also, schools could use renewable energy, like solar panels on the roof, to save resources. I think this is the best way to do it without changing school or work schedules. Countries in the Arctic do this. They save resources and have work schedules that are easy to handle. That's why these countries are nice places to live and visit. Like I said before, schools don't need to make the school day two hours longer. It's not just about avoiding trouble. It's about keeping students from leaving home early and wasting time playing games or hanging out with bad friends. They should be in class learning and finding out new things to build their future. Working on tablets at home is not as good as learning in school. Many students don't use a tablet for work because they are either lazy or they don't get the topic and need a teacher. This wouldn't work with two hours less of learning time. That's why I don't like this plan to save energy and resources. We can find other ways, like I said before. In my simple conclusion, schools should stay the same because it's where students get ready for their future. It's also one of the few safe places for them. Making the school day two hours longer would be a waste of time and not give enough time to teach the students. While energy and resources are important for the world, there are other ways to handle them without changing how long businesses, factories, and schools can work and study. I believe we can make a difference with renewable resources without changing schools. Let the students spend more time in school, not wasting the rest of the day doing nothing."}

Doing something fun can help kids with their schoolwork. It lets them rest their minds from all the hard work. It helps them pay attention in class when their teachers are teaching. \n\nDear Manager, please let my classmates and me visit your amusement park. It will help us pay attention better in class. We work hard in school and don't get many breaks. Going to your amusement park would really help us. It's also a good way for us to make friends and be more active. \n\nIf my school can go, it will make us want to go to school and learn. It will give our teachers a break too. Our teachers work hard to help us do our best. They teach us new things every day and make learning easy. They take their time and help us succeed so we can get good grades. \n\nThis trip will be a great experience for all the kids at my school. It will be a memory we'll always remember, and it can help us when we grow up. It will be a great story to share and show us that people care. We really need this trip to your amusement park. It would make me very happy if you could make this happen. Thank you for considering this."}

If we change the schedule and add two hours each day, we will save energy. This will help the environment. We will save a whole day's worth of energy. If this can help, why not try it?\n\nSaving energy and resources is always good. We should make the school day two hours longer. The energy we save will help not just us, but others too. But, this change might be good and bad for students.\n\nA four-day week could be good for students. Some students want only four days of school, even if they stay longer each day. They will get an extra day to have fun and rest. They can also spend more time with teachers. Longer classes mean they can understand more, finish their work, and have less homework.\n\nBut, this change could be bad too. Students with jobs, like me, will struggle to get to work on time. A four-day week will mess up our plans. It could also hurt how well students learn. They are used to the normal schedule. Two extra hours and one less day might make their grades drop and make it hard to finish work.\n\nA four-day school week can save a lot of energy. Think about saving one day each week. It might seem small, but over a month or a year, it adds up. We can use the saved time to help our community and protect our resources. Wasting energy can harm other important resources, like water.\n\nIn the end, I think not only my school but others can try this too. More companies and people can help with this. If more of us work together, we can save more energy and resources. It's our job to start changing things. This change will help everyone. Just one day can make a big difference."}
{"text_id": "7DD8FECF76A5", "output_essay": "When I found out that young students have to pick a career, I began to worry a bit. I think it's good for young students to choose a career before they start high school. This lets them slowly figure out which careers they want, what skills they have for the job, and what they need to know about the career they want. Planning ahead is helpful because students should try to pick a career before they get to high school. For instance, if I want a job after high school, I need to apply and know everything the job asks for. It's true that students have skills because they know what jobs they can do well. When I worked at Five Below, I was great at restocking shelves and keeping things tidy. So, my skill is being organized. It's key for students to know their job application well. They have to tell their future boss about any health issues or other personal details. They also need to know when to get to work, how to dress, and safety rules. For example, office workers need to wear clean and grown-up clothes. The downside is that they might worry too much about their career in high school, forget to get ready for it, and rush their job application at the last minute. I believe students should look up their career online and sign up for it. They should set an alarm to remind them to prepare for their job. They should also complete the application before it's due. It's clear that it's fine for students to pick a career early. It gives them time to understand their skills and learn about their future careers. This thought is making me less worried now. And having young students commit to a career is a very exciting idea."}
{"text_id": "B64FDEC7099B", "output_essay": "I think schools should not make the school day 30 minutes longer. I feel this way because kids who don't like school will like it even less. They might not like school because of homework or just because they don't enjoy it. Some kids have things to do after school, like walking their dog or doing housework. If my school day were longer, I would miss out on playing games, hanging out with friends, playing outside, and resting. I wouldn't have as much time with my family. I like to go out to eat with them or travel to new places. A longer school day could make students tired and hungry, and it would get dark early. You wouldn't have time to do much because you'd need to sleep early to be ready for the next long day. This could mean more homework and staying up late to finish it, making you tired the next day. This would happen all year. Adding a class because of the extra 30 minutes isn't good either. Some students might sleep in class if they're used to napping after school. They might not do their work and then have to do it at home, getting even more tired. Or they might talk and not pay attention in class because they don't have time to play or chat after school. It's hard to focus when you're tired, hungry, or when others are talking. In my view, school days should stay the same length."}
{"text_id": "AA36E5B34D9E", "output_essay": "To begin, community parks, national parks, and state parks are really fun for outdoor activities. Kids often stay inside with electronics and don't spend good time with friends or family. But parks give kids a great time with family and keep them away from their devices. These parks are special because some make you want to go outside to play. National parks, for example, show you different things, take you outside, and sometimes give you a tour to learn new things. Community parks are also nice because they teach you about where you live and other interesting things you might not know. Still, some people don't like going to parks. They find them dull because they don't go out much and don't have time to have fun and make memories. Parks are good for making memories with family and friends. You can do many things in these great parks. You can learn, hang out with friends, make memories, and walk your dog with your family. Parks make you spend more time outside and less time on your phone. If you're stressed, parks help you relax. In the end, all these parks want to give you the best time ever. They want you to leave with new memories. People enjoy them because they learn new things and spend time with friends and family. They are a better way to talk with friends or a good place to meet new people."}
{"text_id": "4A775DDDF0B1", "output_essay": "About 10% of schools in the United States make students choose a career when they are very young. Students should not have to pick a career so early. They need more time to think about what job they want. They won't feel rushed to choose quickly. In their classes, they can learn what they really like to do. If a student picks a job they know nothing about, they probably won't enjoy it.\n\nStudents should not pick a career early because they need time to look at all their choices. For example, if a student likes math, they should be able to learn about different math jobs. They should have time to think about what job is best for them. They can try different classes and learn about many jobs. They might find new things they like.\n\nAnother reason students should not hurry to choose a career is that it can stress them out. For example, a student who has to pick a job might feel too much pressure and be unsure. If we don't rush them, they can think about their ideas during high school. Some students don't know what job they want. If they have time, they might find jobs that interest them.\n\nThe last reason not to make students choose a career early is that they have school work to do. For example, if a student picks a sports career, it might be hard to focus on school and sports at the same time. It's better for students to focus on one thing at a time. Choosing a career can be hard when they are trying to do well in school.\n\nSome people think choosing a career early is good for students later on. But I don't think so. Students can learn more about jobs in high school if they have time to think and look around without pressure. They also need to focus on school, which can help them get better grades. This can help them find a job they like. This way, students will be more sure about their job choice and it will be good for them in the future."}

They could get distracted by their parents or play with a younger sibling. Being in an online class means staying inside a lot, which is bad for your health. Kids might not make friends because they aren't going to school. They also miss out on daily activities and new experiences. Going to school teaches kids more than just lessons. First, learning from home can be hard because it's noisy and kids can't focus. Parents might ask for help with things, and brothers or sisters can be a distraction. It's also tough to hear or listen to the teacher if the internet is bad. Teachers find it hard to teach through videos. Second, kids won't get to play outside or have fun with friends because they're at home. They won't talk to many people and might not be as healthy. They won't learn as much as they could. Talking to the teacher can be hard if they can't hear each other well. Third, staying inside to study can make a kid unhealthy. They won't learn to be on time or drive safely because they don't go to a real school. They also miss out on learning respect and other important things. Going to school could even help them start relationships. Kids get better at being friendly and social by going to school. Not going to school can make you lonely and keep you from spending time with friends. Sometimes you can't understand the teacher or learn on your own. That's why it's better to learn with other kids at school. Home classes have fewer good points, and school has more. School is fun, and you can talk to teachers face to face. Overall, school gives you more chances to learn new things. You hang out with friends more, and teachers can help you better. Online learning can hurt your health. Most people prefer going to school. It's more helpful for learning. Kids get better skills at school."}
{"text_id": "C3A77797BBC5", "output_essay": "Some schools let students use their cell phones in class for learning. But I think this is wrong. Cell phones can make you less smart, cause mental issues, and start fights with other students and teachers because of things seen on social media. Videos on the internet can change how students act. They might copy what they see in these videos, which is bad for their learning. Cell phones should not be in class. They distract students a lot. When students use phones, they can't focus on the lesson. For example, if a student listens to music and the teacher talks at the same time, the student can't listen to both. It's like two people talking to you at once. Also, using phones in class lowers your grades, wastes time, and stops you from understanding instructions. So, you don't know what to do when it's time for classwork or homework. You also miss out on learning new things. For example, a student named Generic_Name was texting in a finance class. The teacher gave an hour for a project, but he didn't know because he was busy texting. He got a zero for not turning in the project. So, using a phone in class really affects your learning. Most students have phones, but not all use them in class. Students who care about school don't use their phones during class. They know they should focus on their work. But some students waste time on their phones because they don't care about school. This makes them lose interest. In the end, using cell phones in class is bad. Maybe we should change the rules and teach students what they should aim for. It's best to not allow phones, or maybe just let students use them for twenty minutes before class ends. That could be a good rule. I strongly believe that using cell phones in class makes you less smart and stops your mind from learning well."}

I think these classes are a good way to learn new things and to get better at something different. But, students don't have time because they want to finish school quickly. I found out that this is why students should not have to take a music, drama, or art class. Students need all the time they can get for their other main classes. For example, they need more time for math, which is one of the toughest classes, or for history or biology. Students often get bad grades in these classes and they need to pay attention. Also, nine out of ten teachers say that students are not doing well in these classes. Music, drama, or art classes are just things that distract students. They stop them from focusing on what they really need to do to finish school with good grades. Students who have to take a music, drama, or art class often do poorly in other classes. They think these classes are the most important, which is not true for students taking math, biology, or history. Parents want their kids to do well in classes that matter for college. They want them ready for these big goals. The time needed for these subjects is lost on classes that should just be extra choices. A drama, music, or art class should be an extra choice. This changes what students want to do. By making these classes extra choices, students can take them after they are done with all other classes. It's a good idea to leave the extra classes as a prize for students who did really well. We should not force students to take them. Students want to pick what they like, but they don't always pick what they need. If we make these classes extra choices, the students will have more time for all other classes. Forcing students to take a drama, music, or art class can mess up their schooling. In the end, some people think students should have to take a music, drama, or art class. But they haven't thought about all the ways this can hurt students. Some might say students need these classes. But teachers and other parents agree with me. We should make them extra choices.

{"text_id": "BD30C1CC1004", "output_essay": "I agree with what Churchill said about how failing is important when you want to succeed. He said, \"Success is moving from one failure to another without losing your excitement,\" and that's very true. If people don't fail and try again, they won't feel the joy of success or be proud of themselves. Here are three reasons why I agree with Churchill: because people need to work hard, be patient, and believe in themselves.\n\nFirst, to succeed, everyone must work hard and keep trying. Don't stop trying, because without trying, there is no success. You have to try once, twice, or more until you reach your goals and succeed in the future. Also, don't let failure make you unhappy. When people try again, they reach their goals. Failing leads to success.\n\nSecond, to succeed, everyone must be patient. You need patience because you might face many problems in life. But with patience, you will reach your dreams and be successful. Don't worry about what others say; use their negative words to keep you going. Never give up and stay patient, even with big problems.\n\nThird, to succeed, everyone must believe in themselves. Believing in yourself means doing what you think is right. It's the most important thing to have. Also, with hope and self-belief, you will make your dreams come true. Hope helps you believe in yourself, and this belief makes your goals stronger.\n\nIn conclusion, I agree with Churchill about how failing is important to succeed. Here's why: because people need to work hard, be patient, and believe in themselves. I'm sure that when people try again, they won't lose their excitement and they will reach their goals. Make sure no one gives up easily; keep trying."}

Keeping busy can make our minds feel less stressed because it gives us fun things to do. Also, being busy can help us meet our goals.

If you work in a busy place with customers and you don't do your job, you might get fired fast. This is something bosses often look at. Plus, people usually like to get help from someone who is busy over someone who is lazy and doesn't want to do anything. But, being busy can have some bad points too. Maybe you don't need to be busy to reach your goals. For instance, if you want to make money, you don't have to work hard physically to make some these days.

We should have a summer break, but not too many days off. I think it's a bad idea to have a lot of days off because the less we go to school, the less we learn. This is harder when you're young and just want to have fun and not think about school. Many students dislike school for reasons like getting up early, having homework, or not enjoying their classes or teachers. This makes them not want to come to school. But we need to keep going because you need a high school diploma to go to college or get a job. Without it, you'll have problems later. If a student misses a lot of school, when they return, they might not want to come back. They might see it as a waste of time and prefer to have fun. But if they want a good job in the future, like being a doctor or lawyer, they need to graduate. If students have too many days off, they'll have trouble learning when they return. They won't be used to thinking. For example, if you're in 11th grade and take 3 or 4 months off, you might forget what you learned and find it harder to think because you haven't been using your brain. Young people need to learn as much as they can because they learn quicker than older people. They can't think the same or use their brain as well when they get older.

Some may say that doing nothing leads to more success, but being busy often leads to more achievements. Still, some people don't agree because they think doing nothing has its uses. Doing nothing doesn't mean being lazy. It means taking time to think and find better ways to reach goals. Also, people who like this idea say it avoids some dangers of taking action. They prefer to be careful and stop for a while instead of facing dangers right away. But this idea isn't strong. Thomas Jefferson once said, 'It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing.' When people keep doing things, they come up with new and better ideas. This helps them find ways to their goals faster. The idea that doing nothing is better isn't strong. There's a saying, 'Starting is halfway to accomplishment.' Another one says, 'It is better to regret doing something than to regret doing nothing.' These sayings mean that taking action is important. I feel this is true when I think about trying new things. Like others, I'm scared of the risks with new tasks. This fear often stops me and doesn't help me reach my goals. Now, I know it's better to face my fears and try new things.

This is because too many requirements can make fewer students graduate. In many high schools, you need over 24 credits for a better diploma. It's already tough to get all these credits. Extra classes can make students spend time on art or music after school. This can mean less time for jobs and worse grades. Also, these classes can cost a lot. Things like art supplies and costumes add up. So, making students take more classes doesn't help. It can make graduation rates drop. Students have enough homework already. Plus, some classes are very costly. These classes often need you to pay for things. For example, a photography class might need a $200 camera. Not everyone can pay for these things. Another problem is the credit requirements. Some say art classes give kids confidence. But if kids have to take these classes, they might feel bad about themselves. They might not like the class or it's just not for them. They could also be unhappy about how they use their time. Making a student take classes they don't need to graduate doesn't work. It's old-fashioned. Our society focuses on specializing in what we're good at. If school is too hard, a normal student might quit. This includes classes and the activities after school.

We, as students, usually try to find the easiest way to get answers without thinking about what could go wrong. I know someone who often gets caught cheating on tests or homework.

Some countries in Asia don't let students bring phones to class or school, and they do very well. \n\nCell phones beep or flash when we get a text, and that makes us want to look.

Again, teachers should take our phones at the start of class to help us focus. \n\nLastly, students use their phones for other things in class.

Keep your head up and don't worry about them. Let them worry about you. You can just relax.\n\nHelping people from other countries by showing them around, helping them learn a new language, and getting settled is a way to be a good influence. When they are settled, they will remember your help and want to help others too. Helping someone pay for their food when they forget their money makes them happy and thankful.\n\nSeeing someone you helped be happy is one of the best feelings. So, being a role model is good, but you have to do more than that. People will respect you if you do more. They will be happy and want the best for you.\n\nYoung people will see your kindness and want to be like that. They will start helping others, which is great. They are young and should set good goals. As a person, you should always try to be good because people are watching and talking. But you can show them your best side and that you can do things yourself.\n\nIn the end, it's best to do more than just be a role model. People will use what you taught them."}

Because if people use their time well and stay busy, they will finish a lot more than if they do nothing. Being busy takes time, but it is worth it because of the good results we want. It is better to be busy and reach our goals. Staying on track and busy helps in many ways. It can stop bad feelings and keep people from making mistakes. The outcomes from being busy are much better than from being lazy. They make us feel good about our hard work. Doing nothing can cause us to miss out on many good things in life. People often don't see this. But in a short time, doing nothing can really harm your life. Thomas Jefferson said it best: 'It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing.' This means it's amazing how much we can do quickly. Sometimes doing nothing is okay when we want to rest. Doing nothing can mean different things. It can be a waste of time or a chance to rest and then be active again. I have made mistakes by thinking I had nothing to do. But there is always something to improve ourselves or other things. I learned that no matter how good or bad we are at something, we can always get better by being busy. That's why I think Thomas Jefferson was right to say this."}

If we get too much information every day, we will start to forget things. We all need a break sometimes. Many businesses would start to lose workers. A lot of students wouldn't be able to get job experience. They would be too busy with school and wouldn't have time to make their own money. This means places like water parks, cruise ships, and beaches would make less money because not as many people would visit them. People would also lose touch with family who live far away because they couldn't go see them. The way we enjoy winter would change too. No one could go outside to play, have barbecues, or go to water parks because it would be too cold. How could athletes practice their sports if they had to go to school every day? But we already have a week off in spring, so that's okay. And in fall, we shouldn't change anything because school is just starting.

We get up early and when we get home, we do homework and then sleep. This is bad for our health. I don't agree with more school time because I don't want to be unhealthy or miss seeing my parents.

Also, people should trust their own gut and thoughts, not copy others. But not everyone thinks this way. Some say we should ask for advice from those who know more when it comes to big life choices. They believe this leads to better choices. For example, without expert advice, people might not do as well in life. Still, some think it's better to get advice, but they are mistaken; we should listen to our own thoughts. When you trust your own thoughts and gut, you don't need others to help you. For example, those who trust themselves are more likely to do well. We should stick to our own thoughts because they are often the best for us. Not everyone always makes the best choice or has the best thought. But if it's your own, you should go with it. Don't always follow others because they aren't always right or the best. Someone who always copies others and doesn't believe in themselves might not do well. Like a student who cheats and gets caught, they face trouble.

To encourage people to do better, someone must show them how by being a good example. People need examples because they are always learning. They need a model to follow to improve. Also, when someone acts as a good example, others see the positive changes and want to do the same. Examples are important in life. \n\nLooking at a good example is what really gets people to do useful things. Take technology, for example. It has pushed the new generation to make better products that change our lives. One invention leads to another. The telegram, for example, inspired the telephone. The person who made the telephone used the telegram as a model. This chain of examples keeps growing and will greatly shape the future. \n\nTo feel driven and improve, people need a good example. I watch many motivational videos on YouTube. These videos always use examples. The examples in the videos helped me stop putting things off and get my work done. Examples are helpful in many ways. They inspire and teach us not to repeat others' mistakes. This helps us avoid the same errors and do things better, which opens up our view of the world. \n\nSome might say they don't need examples to be influenced. They think they can manage on their own. But this isn't true. We all need something to guide us, whether it's research or just setting up furniture. We need examples. Others might think different things can influence them. But nothing works as well as examples. Motivation is good, but not as powerful as examples. \n\nIn short, examples are key because they help us reach our goals quicker by cutting down on research time.

To reach your dreams, you must work hard. If you don't, things won't go well for you. There was a skilled young player named Manco. But he was lazy. He didn't practice and partied too much. Now, he's unfit and no team wants him because he's not disciplined. You also need to stop being lazy because it can hurt you in other areas, like school. I once had a test but didn't study the day before. I played games and wasted time. When the test came, I was afraid because I wasn't ready. I failed and felt sorry for my actions. Now, I always study for tests and quizzes. Hard work pays off, as shown by Cristiano Ronaldo. He wasn't the best at first, but he kept practicing. Today, he's a top player with many wins and fans. He proves that hard work leads to success. Being lazy can also harm others. Imagine you're cleaning at McDonald's and don't clean a slightly dirty bathroom because you're lazy. Later, a customer gets sick, and the place shuts down. Everyone loses their jobs. Your laziness affected many people. We achieve more when we keep busy. Hard workers succeed. Laziness can impact others. You must work hard to become what you want in life. That's why I agree with Thomas Jefferson's words: 'Determine never to be idle...

First, if you're good at the violin, you can play any song you like. Second, there are special things to do just for violin players. Third, it lets violin and other string players try to get into an all-county event in 8th grade. My first reason is that skilled violin players can choose any song to play. To play a hard song, they must practice a lot. If they can't play it well, they won't get to play it at the concert. Also, violin players are given a rank. They have tests every month or two to see which rank they get for concerts. My second reason is the special activities for violin players. We visit schools to play music for the kids. In 8th grade, each group is graded. If we all do well, our school wins a ribbon. At the end of the year, we go to a park, perform, have fun, and ride roller coasters. My last reason is the chance to play at the all-county event. If you play well, you can go further in the competition. This includes other string instruments like the cello, bass, and viola. The best players win different prizes each year. This is why middle schoolers should play the violin. Good players can play any song based on their rank.

When a store shares a photo of a model wearing their clothes, it makes people want to visit the store and buy the clothes.

If you don't, you could end up in a bad situation because you did what someone else thought was right, not what you wanted.\n\nReason two:\n\nIt's always good to listen to people who know more.

{"text_id": "933951E2A198", "output_essay": "These days, how much students believe in themselves is very important when we talk about learning. Believing in themselves helps students feel sure of themselves and learn better. There are two main ideas about how to help students believe in themselves while they learn. The first idea is to always say nice things about a student's work, even if it's not right, to make them feel good. The second idea is to focus on what the student does well. Some people prefer the second idea because it involves hard work, following rules, and keeping at it, which leads to doing well in school. Let's think about it like this: 'Generic_Name is a young student. Every day, he goes home and right away does his homework, gets ready for the next day, and studies for any upcoming tests. Years later, Generic_Name is doing great in high school and has even heard from colleges that want him. This has made him feel very good about himself.' In Generic_Name's story, we see that his hard work has opened doors for him and made him feel good about himself. The idea of making students feel good by always praising them has its problems. This way of doing things can lead to issues. Here's another story: 'Generic_Name, another young student, is just okay in school. His parents didn't set up a schedule for him, so he made his own. He has more freedom than other kids. He comes home, watches TV, eats, and only does some homework before bed. As he grows up, Generic_Name doesn't feel too sure about himself. He doesn't get the best grades and hasn't thought about college much. He doesn't feel great about himself because he's not sure what will happen next.' In this story, Generic_Name had too much freedom when he was young, and young kids aren't ready to make big choices about their learning and future. To sum up, we looked at two ways to help students believe in themselves. It seems that helping them through what they achieve might be better than just praising them. With praise, we expect a young kid to handle his learning and fun time, but a young kid isn't ready for that. This can make him feel less sure of himself, especially if he sees other kids doing better. But, if we help kids believe in themselves through what they achieve, they might have more chances and feel stronger about themselves."}

But be careful, as some people might teach wrong things, especially to kids. Many learn from teachers at school. Students work hard to learn more so they can pass tests. \n\nFinding new hobbies is good. When I have time, I play video games, draw, or play soccer. You can stay after school to help teachers or your community. When you're home, offer to help your parents clean or with anything else. You can also work to help pay for things at home. \n\nTo end, this is why I agree with Einstein's idea that imagination is more important than knowing things. I believe in this and it has shown me how the world works. It helps me think about my future and encourages me to help others who need it."}

Doing better depends on reaching goals. We do more when we keep busy because it makes us active, eager, and helps us do better. \n\nActive people are more dedicated to their work. Being active helps people stop bad habits. For example, those who exercise every day are active. This shows that people can choose better activities than doing nothing. They do things to get and stay healthy. It is important to be active. \n\nEveryone needs the desire to improve every day. Wanting to do better pushes people to improve themselves. For example, athletes work hard to get better and meet their goals. This shows that athletes need this drive to succeed. Everyone else needs it to get better. Wanting to do better leads to more dedication and success. \n\nPeople are making better progress. Doing better depends on meeting goals. For example, when business owners do better, they succeed more. This shows that business owners need to keep improving to succeed. People should see how much they can do to do better. Doing better is key for those who want to be the best at what they love. \n\nSome might say that doing nothing is good too because it means less stress, more rest, and alone time. But, we do more when we keep busy because it makes us active, gives us drive, and helps us do better. It makes people stop bad habits and feel eager to improve every day so they can do better.

Many people do, but some don't. Those who agree think that learning new skills helps you reach your goals. But it takes time to reach these goals. They also think that learning new things helps you understand better. I agree with Emerson because learning new things opens your mind, so you can teach others. Learning new skills is good because it helps us understand better. If you understand, it's easier to do anything. We had to learn and understand everything we do. Like in sports, you learn and practice new skills to improve. I play a sport and had to learn and practice to get better. Learning new ways is good for the brain and makes tasks easier. We learn so we can teach others new ideas. Teaching others also helps us learn. When we teach, it helps them work better and see things in new ways. We learn and teach new things every day. Many like to teach but not learn. Teaching can give you more confidence and energy to learn from others. Teachers show students new ways to solve problems. Sometimes students teach other students or even teachers. Learning more than what you know is good. Others may look up to you for advice. We can help each other learn and make the world better. Emerson thought learning makes us grow in our feelings and thoughts. Many agree with him, and some don't. Learning is important. By learning, we can teach others. Some sports are easy, others are hard. But we must learn and practice in every sport. As Emerson said, without learning, we won't get better. That's why I agree with Emerson."}

I think older students can help younger ones because they might already know the things that the younger students are learning now. Younger students can also help older students with their homework, even if they haven't learned the topic yet. They can still help figure out problems. In the end, I believe there are many ways for older and younger students to help each other during the program. In the end, when older and younger students work together, one good thing is that older students can help younger ones with schoolwork or homework. This works because the older students often know the subjects that the younger students are just starting to learn. Another way they can help each other is when an older student needs to study for a test. Younger students can help by asking them questions. Also, both groups can share tips and tricks to help each other with any hard things that come up, no matter if they are younger or older."}

Now, almost everyone knows a lot because of technology. It has also brought new and fun ways to teach in schools. Technology keeps getting better and more helpful. It makes our lives much simpler than they used to be. Anyone can use technology, no matter how old they are. For example, an old man who can't leave his home can order food, clothes, or anything else online while lying in bed. He doesn't have to struggle unless he wants to go outside. His life is simpler now, right? These days, people can use or fix almost anything by looking it up online. If a family has no money and their daughter's computer breaks, stopping her from doing her homework due tomorrow, someone can find a how-to video online. They just need to follow the steps, and they can fix the computer for free. Teachers also have an easier time now. They can make learning fun so students don't get bored. For example, they use Kahoot for games that help students review. Teachers can grade tests quickly with multiple-choice questions and a Scantron. This is much faster than grading by hand. They can also show a movie that covers everything in a lesson. What a fun way to teach! Since technology is easy to use, helps people learn and fix things for free, and makes teaching and learning better, I think it has had a good effect on us. I believe everyone would agree with me."}
{"text_id": "5922BC57820F", "output_essay": "I don't think it's a good idea for schools to make the school day two hours longer and have classes only four days a week. My school shouldn't do this for several reasons. First, it won't help save energy if we only come to school for four days. Also, if we have to stay two extra hours, some students with part-time jobs might get fired for being late. Lastly, some students have babies to take care of, and a longer school day could cause problems for them. These are my reasons for not wanting my school to make this change.\n\nThe first reason my school shouldn't extend the school day is that it won't save energy. We will still be in school for the same number of hours each week. For example, we're at school for seven hours a day. If we stay two more hours, that's ten hours a day. But since it's only four days a week, the total hours don't change. So, staying longer at school doesn't save energy.\n\nAnother reason is that many students work after school. If school ends later, they might lose their jobs. Without a job, they can't pay for things like bills, rent, or food. They might stop coming to school to find a day job to pay for these things. So, making school longer could cause students to quit school because they need to work.\n\nThe last reason is that some students have babies. They need to pick up their babies from daycare on time. If they're late, they have to pay more. They need the money for their babies and can't afford to be late to work. After picking up their babies, they go to work to earn money. This helps them take care of their babies and do well in school. A longer school day would make this harder for them.\n\nIn conclusion, making the school day longer to save a little energy is not worth it. It could hurt students by making them lose their jobs. They would need to work during the day to make money. This could make them quit school to handle their money problems. They would also lose all their hard work in school. So, I think schools shouldn't make this change."}

{"text_id": "61E17107BCDD", "output_essay": "Students should not have to pick a career when they are young. Some students are told to decide on a career early on. Not every teenager knows what they want to do, especially when they are young. Many teens change their minds about their future job. Lots of students are not sure about their career choice. This can make students feel mixed up. Kids often change their minds about their jobs. My sister works as a dental assistant. She regrets it a lot. She wishes she could work with kids and be a teacher. Young teens feel pushed by schools to pick classes linked to a certain job. Schools think students should decide quickly when they are young. This is not right. Kids feel so pushed that they pick a career without thinking. My friend Generic_Name often says she feels forced to pick a career. At my school, we have special classes for different jobs. I did not know what to pick. Teachers pressured us to choose. I picked a medical class and I don't like it. I wish I had chosen a class about working with kids. I still think picking a medical class was a bad idea. I plan to pick different classes this year. This is why schools should not hurry kids into picking a career when they are young. Teens are busy with school, work, and other things. They should not be rushed to decide on a career. They should not have to worry about this when they are young. Some teens are not ready for this big decision. My friend Generic_Name is just trying to get good grades and work his job.

{"text_id": "01B1CFD8215F", "output_essay": "Everyone in the world is different.\n\nThey have their own likes and dislikes. I believe that as independent people, we should make our own choices about big life issues. This means we won't rely on others. This is good because we understand ourselves best, we will learn when we make mistakes, and we won't blame others if we listen to ourselves.\n\nFirst, we know ourselves more than anyone else. For example, we deal with many problems every day. Sometimes we handle them well, sometimes not. But we often act like everything is okay so we don't upset others. So, people don't see our true selves or what we hide. That's why I think we should make our own big life choices. We know what we like and what fits our personality, but others don't.\n\nSecond, when we make choices and they go wrong, we learn. For instance, I'm in eleventh grade and thinking about what to do after high school. I talked to older students and family for advice to help me decide. Many said college for four years is fun. You talk to teachers, live in dorms, and meet people from different backgrounds. College teaches you about different people and beliefs. So, I thought about going to college for four years instead of two years at a community college and then two more at a university. But I don't have enough money or a scholarship.\n\nThen I realized that what works for others might not work for me. My diploma won't show if I went to community college first. So, I changed my mind and learned that I should do what suits my situation. Copying others won't help my future. Believe in yourself and do what's right.\n\nLast, if you listen to yourself, you won't blame others. Let's say I followed my friend's advice to move out after turning eighteen. She thinks I should because I'm an adult with a job. She knows I rely on my family, and we want to stay together. But she almost convinced me to leave. I thought about how leaving could hurt my parents. What if my kids do the same to me one day? So, I didn't listen to her and followed my heart. In the end, I didn't blame anyone.\n\nIn short, making your own choices is key because you know yourself, you learn from mistakes, and you avoid blaming others. Being independent is vital because others' choices can mess up your life. So, be someone who knows what to do, never regrets, and learns from every decision."}
{"text_id": "9A10C597B6BC", "output_essay": "I believe Albert Einstein is correct. Without imagination, the world would be dull and learning or doing things wouldn't be fun. We need the imagination and creativity that some people bring to make learning exciting and enjoyable. Some people think that if you have knowledge, you will have imagination. But really, you can't have knowledge without imagination. Learning new things without imagination or creativity could be dull and make you lose interest fast.\n\nTo begin, if you lose interest in something you wanted to do, it might change how you feel about doing other things because you lack imagination. For instance, you wanted to build a birdhouse but had no ideas or imagination on how to start. You went outside to look for birdhouses for ideas. After hours, you saw no birdhouses. Then you looked at your neighborhood and the houses, and you got an idea for a birdhouse! You decided to use popsicle sticks to build it. When the birdhouse was done, you had the knowledge and ideas to learn something new.\n\nIn fact, coming up with your own ideas can really open up your imagination. The more you use your imagination, the more you learn. The more you learn, the smarter and more independent you become. Some people think that the more you know, the more imagination you will have. I don't agree. Like Albert Einstein said, 'Imagination is more important than knowledge.'\n\nIn conclusion, not having ideas or imagination can leave you not knowing how to do something. People don't realize how important imagination is. They think it's only for kids and not useful in the real world. Imagination can help in business, bring people together, in learning, and in creating new games. If you don't want to lose interest in something you've been wanting to do, keep trying and look for inspiration."}
{"text_id": "83165FE95044", "output_essay": "British leader Winston Churchill once said, 'Success is about moving from one failure to another without losing your excitement.' I totally agree with him because without failure, we wouldn't have great people. They didn't give up when they failed. Instead, they kept trying until they got it right. I believe failing is important in our lives because it helps us succeed. If we didn't fail, we would just stop trying. One reason why success is about failing and trying again is when you get homework and don't get it. You try and fail at first, but you keep trying and learning. Then you understand how to do it. You feel good because you did it. For example, the guy who made Facebook started it in college. He probably made mistakes at first, but he didn't stop until it worked. Facebook became very popular because it was new. Another reason is when you like someone and want them to like you back. You can't give up if they don't like you right away. You have to keep trying. Eventually, they might like you. Then you can both fall in love. I had this happen to me. I liked a girl who was hard to impress. She took hours to reply to my texts. But I didn't stop trying, and now she replies fast. We talk a lot. The last reason is when you make something new and it doesn't work at first. You keep improving it until it works well. Then companies might want to buy it. You feel great because it could change things. The Wright brothers, who built the airplane, had this happen. They had problems at first but kept fixing them. Finally, they made a plane that could fly. In conclusion, success is about failing and not giving up. Failures make us who we are. Success isn't easy. It means doing things over, even if you fail. With excitement, you can do anything. Like going to school in your last year for just a few classes you need to graduate. Failing is key to success because great things can come after failures."}

{"text_id": "5EB62BB9EA76", "output_essay": "The Power of Imagination\n\nBy:\n\nGeneric_Name\n\nAlbert Einstein, a famous scientist, once said, \"Imagination is more important than knowledge.\" Some people might question how imagination can be more important than knowledge. But it's true. Imagination helps people think of new ideas that can lead to great things. Scientists create new things by first thinking of something that doesn't exist yet. Our ability to imagine has many benefits.\n\nThe word \"idea\" means we have new thoughts because of our imagination. To turn these thoughts into reality, we need to study and learn more. For example, if we think of making something for eagles, we need to learn about them. So, we study eagles. Now we know more about eagles than before. I also believe that every new thing we make starts with our imagination. I made a toy from a juice can for my cousin, and it began with an idea in my head. If we want to make something, we must use what we know and work hard to make it happen. This makes us learn even more. Like when scientists want to make a medicine, they remember what they know and look for more information to make the medicine. In all these examples, we use our knowledge because we first imagined something.\n\nWhen we imagine, we are thinking of a new idea. By thinking, we can make new things that help us and the person who made them. It helps us because we can use the new thing, and the person who made it can make money. To make new things, people need to think clearly about what they want and make a plan. Here, imagination is key to having the right ideas. To make new things, we also need to be original, which means thinking of something no one else has. I wanted to make a unique ring for my mom, so I thought about how to do it, and it turned out just as I wanted. Our knowledge grows a lot because we can imagine.\n\nWe learn more when we imagine because we look for ways to make our ideas real. For instance, if I want to make a toy for my dog, I need to find out what my dog likes and how to make the toy. I learn about my dog's breed and use what I know to make the toy. If I didn't think of making a toy and just bought one, I wouldn't learn anything new. Imagination is not only good for people who make things but also for a police officer. Imagine a police officer named Generic_Name is working on a murder case. The officer must think about what could have happened and look into it. If the first guess is wrong, the officer must think of something else to get closer to catching the killer. Imagination is very helpful in all these situations.\n\nPeople all over the world use their imagination every day, even if they call it different names like creativity or guessing. They still use it, and it's more than just knowledge. Knowledge is just a part of imagination because we use it to make our dreams come true. So, people should realize that imagination is more important than knowledge and believe they can make their dreams real. I think everyone has the power to imagine and can use it to make or find something new. I'm already thinking of my next invention, and I hope you are too after reading about how important imagination is."}

If you play sports, you get better at it and it improves you as a person.\n\nEvery year, high school students pick a goal to reach, and they work hard to get there. For example, 'My goal is to finish high school.' It doesn't matter if you're grown up or a student; anyone can have a goal and try to reach it. Like, 'Michael Jordan became the best at basketball because he had a goal and he reached it.' Setting a goal is simple; think of what you want and write it down. Some people don't reach their goals, so do what you need to do. The tough part is reaching the goal, and many people don't make it.\n\nDid you know that sports can help you reach your goals? Athletes set goals and work to meet them. For example, 'LeBron James said he would take his team to win the championship, and they did. In 2016, the Cleveland Cavaliers won the NBA title, and LeBron James met his goal. Tom Brady wanted to win his 6th Super Bowl; he played in the Super Bowl and won again! An athlete who wins a lot gets paid well and is called MVP, or Most Valuable Player.\n\nWhen you reach a goal, you become a better person and feel like you can do anything. Like, 'I had a job interview and I got the job.' Everyone liked me and I did well. You can do anything, but you should do things that make others happy. Make every moment matter and don't quit too fast. If you make someone happy, you are a better person. Some people don't care about life, others, or family, and I don't like that.\n\nIn the end, I think the more we do and get done, the better. If you have a goal, reach it. We can do things in many ways. It also shows you are dependable. So, I think we can do things we couldn't do before. Believe in yourself."}

But it might be boring because you've already used and practiced it a lot. Moving on to new things is better. This way, you can keep improving in different and new creative ways."}

Older students are ready to help the younger ones with their schoolwork. If a younger student is having a hard time, a teacher can ask an older student to come and help. This can be good because older students usually know more than the younger ones. Younger students might not always need help because they are doing fine. But if they are having a little trouble, they can ask an older student for help when they really need it.\n\nOlder students also get something from this program. It lets them help others who need it. They can make the younger students' work better while being there to support them. If an older student is not busy, they can go see the younger student to help. But they need to get the 'okay' from both their teacher and the younger student's teacher first. Putting older students with younger ones is a great idea for schools. It helps both the younger and older students when they work together."}
{"text_id": "42031E46ADA3", "output_essay": "Success means reaching your goals. It comes to those who work hard and try their best. To succeed, you must always take action. If you don't do anything, you won't reach your goals. Some think doing nothing can help reach goals, but I think being active is better. Being active teaches you new things, stops you from wasting time, and helps you see your mistakes. \n\nFirst, taking action teaches you new things. To do more, you need to learn. For instance, if a student skips school, they won't learn and may fail tests or homework. When you don't know a word, you should ask someone or look it up. If you don't like trying new things, it's hard to learn. Keep trying until you know it all. \n\nNext, being active stops you from wasting time. Someone who does nothing may not reach their goals. An active person thinks better and faster. They don't waste time on things that block their goals. They spend time learning and doing more. It's better to always try than to never try. \n\nAlso, being active helps you see your mistakes. When you're always busy, you notice what went wrong. If you mess up, you'll try a different way next time. Like when you get a test question wrong, taking the test again means you've learned and will look for the right answer. Life is about making mistakes and learning from them. You can't learn it all without messing up. \n\nIn conclusion, people reach more goals by always trying and doing things. Being active helps you see mistakes, learn, and not waste time. When you do more, you get closer to success. Success often brings happiness and peace. Being active is key. Life is too short to just wait."}

Even if students think they know what they want to do, looking at different jobs is good. They might realize the job they thought about isn't the best for them. They could become interested in other areas like building design or studying sea life. Our school wants to go and learn about the jobs we like. We have questions we've wanted to ask for a long time to see if these jobs are right for us.\n\nMy school is very good at science. We have won three awards for being the best at it. The students and I want to learn more about biology. Going to a place that is all about science and biology would be perfect for us. It could help our community. We would be thankful to learn from experts who have spent a lot of time on science. Some people might regret choosing their job. But it's always good to talk to experts so they can answer our questions. This trip will help me and others decide on the best job for us. Getting your dream job can be scary because it often means more school after high school. Going to college is hard and costs a lot. But it's worth it.\n\nI also love science. I haven't studied it for long, but biology is my favorite subject and what I like to talk about. Going on this trip would help me a lot if I want to be a biologist. Biologists there would tell me to keep going and not give up. I have never done badly on a biology test and I always stay late to learn more. I want to go to a college that is known for biology and studying animals.\n\nMany people get to go to these places but don't use their time well. They miss out on things that could help them later. I don't want to miss out on such an important chance. I want to do well, change the world, and be known in my school as the best at biology. This could get me a science diploma and a scholarship for college.\n\nIn the end, this trip could change my life and others'. We can't miss this chance to ask the questions we've had for so long.

If a student hasn't finished their work, they can go to the homework club after school to do it. They can find a tutor for subjects they find hard.

{"text_id": "242632EC61DF", "output_essay": "Today, some people like to work by themselves, and some like to work with others. Working with others has good points like finishing hard tasks, coming up with ideas, sharing the work, getting better at talking to people, and getting ready to do well. Some might like to work alone because they like being by themselves or for other reasons. But it doesn't have the same good points as working with others. Working as a team feels good and is very useful. If people like to help each other, why not work together? I find it very useful to have a team to help me. If I don't know something, they are there to help. If I make a mistake, they help me learn. By helping each other, we can do what we need to do. It's good to help each other in any way we can. Working in groups often gets hard tasks done better than one person working alone. As a team, we come up with more good ideas. People working alone might not find as much good information as a group. Working alone isn't as good, especially when there's no one to ask and all you have is the internet, which I don't trust as much as my team. Working with others helps me do more and do better. I am more active when I talk to my team and ask for their thoughts. Working alone, I wouldn't do as much as when I work with others. Working in groups also lets us do better. We all want to fix mistakes and learn, so we end up doing well. Working as a team also means less work for each person and more gets done. Working in a group is better because it brings new ideas. Sharing thoughts is important. Talking to others helps us know what to do and what not to do. As a team, we finish tasks quicker. We get facts from different views, which is a key to success. Working alone might not be as good. Research shows that people working alone have more work. There aren't many good things to use except the internet, which isn't as good as a team. They have more to do and more to worry about. In the end, I think working in groups is good because it means less work and we finish tasks quicker. Working together lets us get feedback from the group, which makes our work better. It also brings in different ideas. If we act like a team, we feel more motivated and get better at talking to each other. Even if students don't always agree, working as a group is better than working alone."}
{"text_id": "47DCB7763FF9", "output_essay": "Schools that work with companies give students a chance to try out jobs and find out if they like the work. What do they want to do later in life? Schools should work with companies because it helps students know what is best for them, like what they like doing, gives them chances to see the world, and helps them talk better with others.\n\nOne reason this is good for students is that they can find out what they like. If students can do internships, they can work with many different people. Working with people from other places teaches them to work together and deal with different situations. They can follow their interests and learn from the experience. Many students don't know what jobs they want in the future. An internship can help them decide. Often, they can't try out what they really like. Some students pick classes just because their friends do, even if they are not interested. This can lead to them leaving the class later when they realize it's not for them. This also makes extra work for school counselors who have to change the students' schedules, which can be hard. But an internship can make it clear what they like, stopping future problems.\n\nThe next reason is that students get many chances to see the world. It's not common for students to learn about the world by seeing it themselves. Many students want to do this, but not all can. Learning about other cultures and making new friends is very helpful. When they see the world, they might learn new languages, which can make it easier to get a job. In the United States, companies often look for students who can speak many languages because it helps the company work better. Students who speak more than one language usually find it easier to talk to others and feel they can reach their goals.\n\nThe last reason is that internships help students talk better. Often, students know a lot but are too shy to speak. They might feel unsure of themselves. Doing internships can make them more sure of themselves. By working and talking with others in an internship, they will get over their shyness and become more sure through practice.\n\nTalking well is very important in life; without it, students might not understand what's going on around them, which can hurt their learning. Having good talking skills is important both in school and outside. Talking well helps share ideas and makes students feel okay to speak up. As they talk more, they'll feel more sure and worry less about what others think.\n\nSome say that internships might not fit all students because they have other things to do like sports or jobs after school. But if schools make deals with different companies, it could give students a great chance to try out their interests, see the world, and become more sure and better at talking. This experience can show students they can reach their goals.\n\nIn the end, working with companies can make students more sure when making choices and help them stop being shy. It can also help them figure out what they want in life. These deals give students the chance to learn new things and languages, which would be hard without an internship. I think students should be able to do these internships to help them grow and get better."}

This makes sure the devices turn off at a set time. I think people see technology as good because it helps them work hard, stay active, and not use their phone all day long.\n\nBut when people don't pick one side, they might think about the other.

{"text_id": "EEF3247D69D0", "output_essay": "Some schools suggest learning from home as an option for students to take classes online or have meetings from home. I don't agree because students learn more at school, make friends better, and get to know the world better. Here's why I disagree.\n\nMy first reason is that students can learn more at school. My mom always said it's better to learn in the right place because you see others who want to learn too. When she was in high school, her teachers helped her in classes she found hard. Her friends worked hard for good grades. She never did homework at home because it was too easy to get lazy and take breaks. \"You can't compare a temple with a science lab; they are very different. At school, you have to focus on learning, but at home, we relax after working hard,\" my mom said.\n\nMy second reason is that students make friends better at school. I've found that we meet other students in class. For example, I'm too shy to ask a teacher questions, so I ask another student who understands. Meeting new people at school is good because you can connect with them and teachers. This helps us be ready for anything, like when we apply for jobs.\n\nI also disagree because students will learn about the world better. As I said, making friends gives us confidence. School is the real way to prepare us for the world. My teacher, Mr. Generic_Name, told us it's important to work hard; he never gave up on his goals. After high school, college was hard for him because it was new, but he kept trying. He used what school taught him, like being open and talking well with others. Mr. Generic_Name also thinks life is full of challenges and we should face them, not hide at home.\n\nSome students might say learning from home is better because they don't feel safe or they had an accident. They might not like school or feel scared of bullies. I think students should talk to their parents or a trusted teacher to solve these problems and feel safe. Even if they don't like making friends and prefer home, they should know that school can help them feel they're not alone and it's good to talk.\n\nFinally, learning from home can be helpful. It's not bad, but learning in a school with others is the best way to understand everything. If a student has an accident and can't go to school for a while, it's okay to learn from home. But when they're better, it's good to go back to school for teacher support."}

It lets you call someone if you're sick, reminds you about soccer practice, and tells you when you have an appointment. Shopping on the phone is quick. We can go to Amazon to buy what we need.

It's amazing how much we can do if we are always busy.' I think being busy all the time helps us finish almost everything. This is because we are always working on something, even small tasks. You might think sitting down is doing nothing. But it's not true. You are resting or waiting. Think about your day. You wake up, shower, go to school, take tests, and eat lunch.

In the past, when technology wasn't so advanced, you would see children playing outside. They would use jump ropes, play basketball, or just walk or ride bikes. When I was young, I loved to go outside and play with my friends. It didn't matter if it was cold or very hot; I was always eager to play. Meeting and talking to people is good for both kids and adults. For instance, when a parent takes their child to a playground, they both get to meet and make new friends. But now, it's rare to see kids playing outside. Many kids stay indoors playing video games like Fortnite or watching TV all day. This isn't a good way to make friends or enjoy life. Some people think playing video games is social because you talk to other players. But it's not the best way to make real friends. Another problem is social media. You see people on Instagram, Snapchat, Facebook, Twitter, and more everywhere. I use them too. But these apps often push people apart. They can be fun, but they can also be harmful. You can share photos from trips or meals. But these apps make it too easy to judge others without really knowing them. You only see their online profiles, which isn't a true way to learn about someone. Talking to someone in person is much better than using phones or tablets. It helps you get to know them more deeply.

{"text_id": "150E8EE114A4", "output_essay": "Think about a shorter summer break for students; they wouldn't have time to unwind from all the stress of the school year. Some say that students forget a lot over the summer. But cutting the summer break is not a good idea. Students need time off to relax from the hard work and stress of school. Summer also brings fun things to do and chances to travel because of the good weather. Students work hard all year to get good grades. A break helps them come back with more energy. Serious students study, do homework, get extra help after school, and get better grades. But they also get more stressed and tired. For example, some students work jobs in the afternoon. They go straight to work from school without a break. These students are very tired. They need summer breaks. If we make summer shorter, students will feel rushed and more stressed. Also, we want students to remember what they learn. But no one can remember everything. People like to travel in the summer when the weather is good. They can't do this in winter or fall when flights might get canceled. Going to new places or just doing fun things at home helps people relax. They feel they've earned their break. Near the end of the school year, school gets tough with final exams. Students stress out but look forward to vacations. What if they only get three weeks off? They will be stressed because it's too short. They won't have time to go abroad or do fun things. They might remember what they learned, but they'll feel too much pressure. In the end, summer break should stay long. Students need to rest and free their minds from the year's stress and pressure. Plus, people like to travel in the summer with good weather. If summer is too short, there's no time for travel or fun."}
{"text_id": "8D87BB07D992", "output_essay": "Introduction Paragraph\n\nIt's good to get advice from others because making choices alone often doesn't work out well. People who get advice feel sure of themselves and know what to do. Some people choose on their own because they think it's best. But this isn't always right for everyone. It's important to hear what others think and ask what's best for you. Many have been in tough spots and can't decide for themselves. They know how to help or fix problems.\n\n1 Paragraph\n\nIt's smart to ask for opinions. Say you're unsure about your future job. You could talk to a school counselor or your parents for advice on a better job or path. After that, you'll know what to do and be sure about your choice. Deciding alone isn't always smart because you might make a mistake. If you're stuck, ask anyone. It could be a stranger, not just parents or teachers. Some don't ask for advice because they don't want to share their problems or are shy. Just be brave when you talk to someone. Getting help usually has a good effect.\n\n2 Paragraph\n\nPeople who decide alone might end up okay or not. Many teens choose without asking their parents or anyone, and it often goes wrong. They don't worry until they see the bad results. You should talk it over with your parents or someone else. Teens lack experience. Parents are often the best to talk to. You can get advice from anyone, but you trust your parents the most.\n\n3 Paragraph\n\nMaking choices can be tough or easy. A bad choice can hurt others. For example, in a group project, if one person does poorly, it can ruin it for everyone. We should make choices that help us and others. If you're new at a job, wait for the manager's instructions. If you wander and don't know what you're doing, it's bad for you. So, we should talk things over with others. Older people have been stuck without choices before. We can ask them for advice.\n\nConclusion\n\nAsking for advice is smart. Making choices alone can turn out good or bad. Always be brave when discussing choices. Everyone can make their own choices, but getting advice is always helpful."}

They might start to sleep in class, not pay attention, forget what they learned, and lose focus. This can make students stressed. If they forget a lesson, the teacher will have to teach it again.

I don't think making the school day longer is a good idea because students need more time to hang out, be with family, and most of all, rest.\n\nFirst, talking to others is a very important skill. Everyone, especially students, needs some time to hang out. This is true not just in school, but outside of school too. Doctors and experts always say talking to others is good for you. But, if school lasts longer every day, students won't have time for this.\n\nAlso, we all need a lot of time with our families to talk about what we think or to share ideas. Some kids also go to clubs after school, which takes up more of their time. If school is longer, they won't have much time left to be with their families. A survey in 2017 said that students who spend more time with their families are happier, do better, and are healthier in their minds.\n\nLast, and most important, students need to rest so they can work well. But, if they have to wake up at 6:00 AM and stay at school an extra one and a half hours, they won't have enough time to rest or do other things they need to do. So, 'rest' would just be a word, not something they can really do.\n\nTo sum up, adding an hour and a half to the school day every day is not a good idea. Students need to talk to others, which is a skill they need for life. They also need enough time with their families to be happier, do better, and be mentally healthy. And to work well in their minds and bodies, they need to rest more. In the end, making the school day longer won't help students.\""}

They can see what job they want to do. Some people think choosing a job in high school is too soon. But high school is there to get you ready for college. You take classes you must pass to finish high school. Why not take classes that give you a peek at the job you want? Kids often dream of being astronauts, doctors, or teachers. But they don't know what it involves until college. That's not right. Why wait to find out if a job suits them? High school should be the start. Why put it off when the future is now? Many college students switch their major because they weren't ready for the classes. We can stop this. Let students take classes in high school that will help them later. This way, they can see if they like the job they're thinking about. You're less likely to make a mistake in college if you know what's coming. High schools make you take classes to graduate. But not everyone wants to take art just because it's needed. It's better to sit in a class that matters to you. You learn things you will use later. If students could pick a job class in high school, they wouldn't have to take classes they don't like. Students who don't know what job they want can try different things. This helps them see what jobs are out there. For example, a student unsure about being a political scientist or a nurse could try one class in each. This helps them choose the right job. Starting a job path in high school is good, even if you're not sure what you want to do later. It lets students learn about different jobs.

They believe that students need to feel sure of themselves to learn. But I don't agree. I believe that praising poor work actually hurts learning because it lowers what we expect. I think real confidence comes from doing well. Four years ago, when I first came to the US, I hardly spoke English. I remember something from my 8th grade Biology class. We had a test, and I got a 44 because my English wasn't good. I was very sad about my score. Then the teacher told us to pass our tests to a boy in the middle of the room. He laughed when he saw my test and showed it to his friends. I was shocked and hurt. I thought the teacher would help me do better next time, but he was angry at me. I cried and ran to the bathroom. After that, I worked hard to get better at English and to get good test scores. I didn't want anyone to make fun of me again. Thinking about that time still makes me cry. It reminds me of a movie about a black woman in an office with white people. They made her do bad jobs because she was black. One day, she got a chance to show her skills and didn't tell anyone. She did a great job and got promoted. Then, people respected her and saw her as a good leader. I'm a Chinese student in another country, and I hear mean things about Chinese people. They say we eat weird things and should all be smart. Once, someone told my parents, who don't speak English well, to leave the country. I told that person that my parents work hard and try to learn English. I asked for respect for our culture. China used to be poor, but now it's doing better and earning respect.

{"text_id": "1F596143D558", "output_essay": "Did you know that when older students help younger ones, the younger kids can learn a lot? They can learn from the older students' past mistakes and get smarter. That's why I think it's good for older and younger students to be in a program together. Older students can get credit for community service, they can share new things, and the program needs their help. First, older students can get community service hours by helping the younger ones. They spend time helping them join in the program. This makes it easier for the younger kids to understand what they're learning. Also, the younger students might learn something new that the older ones didn't know. Or they might learn in a new way and can show the older students. Plus, the older students can help the younger ones set goals for the future. Another reason I agree is that older students can teach the younger ones what they haven't learned yet. They can talk about the mistakes they made so the younger ones can avoid them. This way, the younger students won't make the same mistakes. Older students can also give advice. If the younger ones have problems or feel sad or angry, they can talk about it. Some young students who are often alone at home might struggle with homework or making friends. The older kids can give them advice and help them with their problems. Finally, when there's a program, teachers often need extra help. There might be too many kids or they're just too busy. Teachers might not have time to mark papers, give tests, or meet with parents. So, they don't fall behind, older students can help. They can be good role models and show the younger ones what's best for them. This way, they won't worry too much and can be happy. Younger students will have friends, and teachers will be glad to have the help. In conclusion, older and younger students working together is good. They can share ideas and make a big difference. Students should choose who they want to work with. But most kids do better with older and younger students together. I agree that they should be in a program together.

When they pick for themselves, they must be sure it's what they want. They shouldn't let others change their minds. To succeed, they must stick to their choices, even if others try to make them quit.\n\nProof: For example, choosing for yourself can be hard. You must think about how your choice will help you. If it doesn't help, it's a bad choice. Then you'll need to fix it. Next time, be more careful and choose again. Think about how it will help you and don't repeat mistakes. If you don't choose for yourself, you won't learn how tough it is to decide alone.\n\nExplanation: Say you want two things but can't have both. You must pick one. Some may say one is better. But it should be your choice. If you pick what you don't like, it's not really your choice. You might have picked it because someone said it was better. But if you don't like it, it's not good. And if you always listen to others, you won't learn to choose for yourself.\n\nConnection: Choosing for yourself is good. You can do what you want. If you make a mistake, try to fix it.\n\nConclusion: Choosing alone is hard, but it's good. It teaches you about life's difficulties and how to make more choices on your own."}

If you mess up, you can just start over. Working alone is hard, but I think that's great. It makes you feel confident and stand by your words.

You get help from others. You can meet new friends and learn from them. Groups can also help you change your mind or decide things quicker. For example, if your group is finding four ways to better the economy in the U.S.A., each person can pick one way. This makes the job easy.\n\nStill, I think working alone is better. It has more pluses than group work. You do things your way with your ideas. In a group, you must agree or argue. This can be stressful. You might also have to do extra work if someone is lazy.

It's already tiring, and many kids are fed up. They have to get up early and sit down for at least five hours. It's hard for many kids to sit that long. They are all tired when they get to school. Next, kids often have plans after school. If we make the school day longer, it could mess up their free time. Many parents are strict. They set a time for their kids to be home. More school time means less time for fun. Also, if they have to do things with their family, a longer school day gets in the way. Finally, we spend a lot of time in school as it is. People say you're at school most of the day. They're right. We get there at 8:00 am and don't leave until 3:15 pm. Kids don't like the current school hours. So why make it longer? Many will just keep complaining about it. In conclusion, many kids think school is dull, we have enough hours already, and they have their own stuff to do after school. That's why I think they shouldn't add an hour and a half to the school day."}

But it's also a bad idea because when you're young, you don't know what you want to do. You might want to do so many things that you can't pick one. Is it good for students to choose a career when they're young? No, because we either don't know or we have too many options. For example, one day I want to be a flight attendant. I'm happy for a few days. Then I want to be a car mechanic. We just don't know what to pick when we're young. Some people say it's good to plan for what you like and find the right job. They say it helps you think about your future, like where you'll live. It might prepare you for adult life and keep you from bad thoughts. In some places, students have to pick a career before high school. This puts a lot of pressure on them. It's like they're being told, 'Do this first, then that.' This can stress kids out. They have to think too much and don't know what job to get ready for. I think we should give students more time. Let them finish middle school without stress. Let them choose what they want without pressure. Choosing a career young is good and bad. It's good to start thinking, but you might change your mind a lot. We shouldn't make students pick a career when they're young. They have their whole lives to think about it. Too much thinking before school can cause problems. In the end, adults should let young students take their time to choose a career. They shouldn't rush. Let them live their lives so they can plan and pick what they really want to do."}
{"text_id": "AC5079BBCB91", "output_essay": "Dear Manager,\n\nMany schools work with companies to help students learn by doing. I think it's good to work with a different company because students can meet new people and learn more to get ready for their future.\n\nMy first reason is that students can learn more about what they like by working with these companies. If they enjoy it, they can keep going there. If they find a company they like, they can see how it works. If it's a good fit, they can stay. If they want to learn something, they can keep visiting until they decide to join the company.\n\nMy second reason is that students can find out how to get a job more easily with these partnerships. This gives them more time to study and do other activities, like playing soccer. They can also spend time with friends after school and help each other. I think many students want to know more about these partnerships to understand how they work.\n\nMy third reason is that students will have better chances for their future. They will learn how to work in teams, which will help them when they start working. You can meet people who have worked there for a long time and learn from their stories.\n\nIn conclusion, schools should have partnerships for students who want to learn about companies. I want my school to have a company partner so I can learn, get ready for my future, and get experience. This will help me find a job more easily with the company I choose. Because I will have experience with them, I hope they will hire me.\n\nSincerely,\n[Your Name]"}

They use it to look up information for work, school, cooking, and other things. It is useful when you really need it. Having technology is important for getting in touch with family, friends, and workmates. Nowadays, it is good to have technology to search for things easily. You don't have to worry about going to the library and looking for things by hand. You can find what you need on Google. But sometimes, people use technology for different things. Sometimes, people get upset, mad, mixed up, and worried when they use the internet. You have to be careful with what you say and show to others when using technology. Some people do bad things with it when they shouldn't. People use technology for fun. But if you're not careful, you can hurt yourself or others. I think technology helps me a lot. I use it for homework, projects, cooking, and to learn new things. I learn a lot and have fun too. It can be both good and bad. It's good to have it in case someone tries to steal from you.

{"text_id": "36E2681A6C2F", "output_essay": "A writer named Ralph Waldo Emerson once said, \"If you don't try to do more than what you can already do, you won't grow.\" I agree with this because if you only know how to do one thing, you won't learn anything new. Fixing cars and solving math problems show this idea well. As a young kid, I loved cars and wanted to know how they work. In high school, I got the chance to study cars at a special school. We started with brakes. I learned how to fix them and all about them. I got so good at it that I could work alone. But I need to learn more than brakes. I need to know about engines and electricity too. If I only did brakes, I wouldn't learn about other car parts and I wouldn't become a better mechanic. In high school, we started with algebra. At first, I wasn't good at it, but I got better. After mastering algebra, I moved on to geometry. If I had only done algebra, I wouldn't have learned geometry. Some people might not agree because some are successful doing just one thing. But I think you should always learn more. Learning new things gives you more chances in life and teaches you important lessons. If you stop learning and only do what you're good at, you'll only know how to do that one thing. That's why I believe it's important to keep learning. If you don't, you'll miss out on chances and won't have as broad of a view as someone who does learn."}

Everything we know today might have started as imagination. There is more imagination in the world than knowledge. Einstein's own ideas and theories came from his imagination. Now, his imagination has helped scientists understand his theories. It has become knowledge. \n\nOne time, scientists did a test with kids and grown-ups. They gave them spaghetti, paper, a bag, and a straw. The test was to see who could build the tallest stack without it falling. You might think grown-ups would win, but they didn't! Kids built taller stacks because they imagined better than the grown-ups. Even though grown-ups know more, imagination was stronger in this test. This really happened in the United States. \n\nI used to think knowledge was more important. But this test showed me that imagination is better for solving tough problems. \n\nThis doesn't mean knowledge isn't important. What you learn in school is knowledge. Things like buildings, cars, and computers all start in your imagination. There are so many imaginative people that I can't count them all. Imagination is about thinking and growing ideas, not just what you know. \n\nI agree with Einstein when he said, \"Imagination is more important than knowledge.\" The test with kids and grown-ups proves that imagination wins over knowledge. \n\nImagination can grow, but knowledge is limited. All the knowledge we have was once just an idea that grew into something big. Imagination is important at work too. Take Nike, for example. They prefer people with great imagination. If you can imagine well, you can create unique shoes."}

Students who have jobs can take online classes whenever they want. Technology also makes our lives better in other ways. It lets us do tasks alone.

{"text_id": "0F1285CEAE53", "output_essay": "Everyone knows that some people are good at what they do. But sometimes, these people are not sure about their skills. There are talented people all around, and they know what they can and can't do. Having experience is a good reason for a person to keep going. Ralph Emerson, a well-known writer, said something that makes you think about getting better. You get better because you learn from your work. I think it's true that if you don't try to do more than what you're already good at, you won't improve. A person doesn't get better by doing things they already know because they have the experience, don't need to do it again, and don't realize they've done it before. \n\nFirst, a person with experience can move up in their work. They can look for a better job because they've worked hard and learned a lot. There's no point in doing the same thing again. Thinking you can't do something can hold you back. You might keep trying even if you're already good at it. With experience, you can teach others and keep learning new things. For example, if a student needs help in science and you got an 'A' in that class, you can help by teaching what you know. \n\nAlso, if you've already done something well, you don't need to do it again. People don't get better by repeating the same tasks. Not believing in yourself is a big problem. You need to trust your skills to see great results. Experience is just a step to keep moving and not get stuck. Doing things you're good at can be boring. If you learn something new in class, you can go on to the next thing. There's no need to go over it again if you're not learning more. A student who gets a B+ but wants an A might try the test again. But this isn't always good because a B+ is a very good grade. \n\nLastly, a person might not notice when they've finished a task. If they don't see when they've reached their goal, they won't get what they want. Being aware of what you're doing is very important. Knowing how much you've learned can help you improve. Like nature, things keep growing and so should people. Doing what you're good at doesn't help you grow. In short, you do your work, learn, finish, and move on. A student who likes to do things well has a project about DNA. They can write an essay or make a PowerPoint. The student does both. But in the end, they get a 'D' because they did more than needed. \n\nIn conclusion, if you keep doing what you're already good at, you won't get better. You need to be positive and know what you've learned. You should keep going like nature does and work hard. Knowing when to move on is one reason why you might not be getting better. Getting better is part of life. Don't limit yourself."}

But what if things don't work out as they hoped? I think that these people should ask for help from experts and leaders when dealing with big issues in life.\n\nFirst, it can give them a chance to hear advice from someone else. Let's say a person who depends on themselves has a choice or idea. They could talk to an expert or a leader. This person could listen and give their thoughts on it. They might even offer better ideas. This could stop them from choosing poorly.\n\nThis brings me to my second point: what if a person decides something alone and doesn't ask others about it? They might end up hurt or in a tough spot. If they had talked to someone, like a leader, before deciding, they could avoid trouble or getting hurt.\n\nMy last point is that asking for help or advice can make you better at trusting and talking to others. Often, people who depend on themselves don't trust much. They think their choices and ideas are perfect. They believe they don't need anyone's advice. When someone tries to share their views, they don't want to listen.\n\nHowever, I think people who depend on themselves should ask for guidance. It helps to get advice, stops them from choosing poorly, and teaches them to trust. Even though making your own choices can make you more independent, it's still good to ask for advice. Talking to someone else and hearing their opinion is helpful."}

They share ideas and learn from those who know more. Group members help those who need it.\n\nBeing in a team helps you be more responsible. Usually, students try their best to learn. Working together is a chance to be responsible. If you're not responsible, you can learn from those who are. This way, you become responsible and show others you can handle work.\n\nWorking alone is good too. It shows you your level and helps you get better. But in groups, you learn more from others. So, learning in groups is better.\n\nI like to work in groups because it helps me learn more. It's a chance for us to know each other.

We are between 14 and 19 years old, and we change our thoughts on many things. This includes sports, friends, video games, and clothes. We can be very sure we want something, but when we try it, we might find we don't like it at all.\n\nMany times, the job we've wanted isn't the one we get after finishing school. 87% of students who graduate from college or high school don't get a job in their field of study.

Working in a group has more good points because students share ideas and talk to each other.\n\nFirst, students share ideas to help the group. Sharing ideas is key because it helps the team finish their work. Also, some students might have helpful thoughts about the project. This can help the team make choices. Working in a group lets students use many ideas from everyone. Each student brings their own thoughts to the group. It's good to have a team to work with and help each other. They can enjoy working with others. Plus, you get help from the group when you work with them.\n\nSecond, students need to talk more in a group. Talking with the group is very important. For example, if someone doesn't understand, you can explain it to them. Also, students can work faster and do better on their project. As a group, classmates need to talk to each other. If students are confused, they can ask the group for help. Good communication in the group is important. When students talk well, they can work well together. They have more time to talk about their work and they do better work.\n\nThird, some students think working alone is better. They can work in a quiet place. They also have to focus more to finish their project on time. For example, they have to think about their own ideas. But when students work alone, it's hard to come up with ideas. Only one person has to think about how to do the work. They don't have someone to talk to and ask for help. Students who work alone have to depend on themselves and think hard about the work.\n\nIn conclusion, I think working in a group is better. There are more good points to working in a group because students can share ideas and need to talk to each other. That's why it's important to share ideas and get help from working together. Students have to work together and share ideas."}
{"text_id": "75D9A995F00C", "output_essay": "Some people think that students should pick a job path before starting high school and should choose classes that will lead them to that job. But is it really a good idea for young students to decide on a job so early? It's not a good idea for high school students to take classes just to prepare for a certain job. This doesn't let them find out what else they are good at and it can be very stressful. In high school, students are too young to make such a big choice. They should be taking fun classes and finding out what they like. Students need to find out what they enjoy, who they want to become, and what they want to learn. If students have to pick a job before high school, they might miss out on finding these things. Some college freshmen don't know what they want to learn yet. Choosing what to study in the future is hard and is one of the biggest choices in a student's life. If they are not ready, they might choose wrong and regret it later. When students start high school, they should take classes that they really like. It's true that taking classes to help them finish school is important. These classes get them ready for the future and help them pick the right job. But it's even more important to take classes they love. They might find what they want to learn by taking a class they enjoy. For example, a student might find out he loves dancing in a dance class and decide that's what he wants to study. Choosing a job before high school can be stressful because it's a big decision. They can't just pick a job if they are not sure. Students need time to pick the right job. They should be very careful when they make this choice. In the end, students should not decide on a job when they are young because it's stressful and they are not ready to make such a big decision.

If you work too much, you could get too tired, and that's bad for your health. Many times, working too much can stress you out or cause headaches. This is why I don't think they should start a homework club after school.\n\nKids need time to relax after a full day at school. Without enough free time, kids can become upset and mad. For example, some students might fall asleep in class because they like to nap after school. If they had to stay later, they couldn't nap. Also, they might not want to go to school because of all the work. They would have to spend too many hours in school doing things like exams and classwork.\n\nMany students also have jobs after school. A homework club could make it hard for them to work. Not every student has a lot of free time; some want to make money. But they can't if there's an after-school club. For instance, if you work at 3:00 pm and school ends at 2:30, you can't work if the club lasts an hour and a half.\n\nAnother reason is that both teachers and students are tired after a day of school. They shouldn't have to stay longer; they need time to rest and not think about school. Teachers can get stressed by students not behaving. For example, if students don't listen, teachers might want to leave early. Students can also feel stressed by teachers who yell, which can cause headaches. So, both students and teachers need more time to rest.\n\nIn conclusion, they should not start an after-school homework club. Students and teachers have other things to do outside of school. Too much school can lead to stress and headaches because of all the homework. Also, many students have jobs and can't stay late. They have other activities they won't be able to do if they have to go to clubs. Remember, students and teachers deserve their free time. So, do you agree with me?"}

Sometimes, you may face a tough job, but you must do it to finish it. When you finish a task, you will feel good. \n\nOne reason I believe we must keep busy to finish tasks is that we have to start working on them. We can't sit around and be lazy. Being lazy and doing nothing won't help us succeed. If you don't try, you might think you're not good at anything. If you want to finish something, you must work on it. If you don't, it may seem like you're giving up. Quitting too soon could spoil everything. You might regret not doing more in your life or not trying harder. \n\nAnother reason to stay busy is that even if a task is tough, you must do it to finish it. When a task is hard, you might fail a few times. That's okay. You can try again. Eventually, you will finish it and feel proud. Believing you can do hard things makes you want to try new things. Finishing a task makes you feel good about yourself. \n\nThe last reason to keep busy is that finishing a task makes you happy. You feel joy after working hard on something and completing it. When you finish something, you feel happy, excited, and proud. You might even cry with joy. These feelings make you want to do more tasks to feel that joy again. People prefer to be happy rather than sad. Doing and finishing tasks can make you happier. \n\nSome people think it's better to do nothing. But if you want to achieve something big, you must work hard. You must live your life actively, not just wait for things to happen. Being active is also good for your health.

You want to try it again to make it harder. For example, I play soccer and I can curve the ball when I shoot. One day, I saw a video of people playing soccer and shooting differently. I wanted to try it. After practicing for a few hours, I started to shoot the ball right and saw it move differently. Finally, the ball flew fast through the air, and I had done it. I felt proud and now I can shoot in two different ways.\n\nMy second reason is about trying to finish something you started but didn't complete. Maybe you wanted to do something else and stopped. In soccer practice, my coach asked us to do planks for a minute. I was scared I couldn't do it. So, I cheated and didn't do planks. But one day, I decided I needed to do them to get stronger. At the next practice, I tried to do the planks. At first, I was bad at it, but after a while, I could hold a plank for a minute. I had done something good for myself.\n\nMy third reason is about going back to a challenge you quit and trying again. My coach made us run 16 laps. We all complained because it was a lot. Our coach said he would cut the laps if we did well. We tried and did 10 laps but then gave up. The coach was mad and made us do more exercises. The next day, we decided to practice more on our own. After working hard, we ran the 16 laps. At the next practice, our coach was surprised we did all 16 laps without stopping and was proud.\n\nMy last reason is about doing something new. This time, it's not about soccer. I wanted to change how I look, be more confident, and look good. I went shopping and bought new clothes and jewelry. At home, I put together many new outfits. The next day at school, I wore one of my new outfits and got a lot of nice comments, which surprised me.\n\nIn conclusion, everyone should have done something they're proud of.

I get why some students find school tough and hard to follow. It's sometimes hard to remember things, but that's part of learning. Remembering helps with tests, the future, and the jobs they want to have.\n\nStudents helping each other is good for making friends. Some students are shy and don't like talking to people they don't know. Helping out is also good for talking about problems in class. Older students know what the younger ones are learning. They can help the younger ones with things they find hard. They will feel more at ease and able to talk without being shy.\n\nStudents can learn from each other by working together. For instance, an older student might have forgotten what a younger student is learning now. The younger student can show how to solve a problem. They can remind each other of things they've forgotten or don't know. This is why they can learn from each other. Working as a team can help solve problems.\n\nThere are good things that come from this. The younger student gets help, and the older student gets extra credit. This looks good for them.

They help each other be better and know how to support each other to do well later on."}

But often, one or two people do most of the work while others just watch. Working alone is better for me. It lets me see what I can do on my own. I like to push myself and see what I can achieve. But many people are scared to work alone. They prefer being in a group. They don't want to see what they can do by themselves. They don't try to work alone. That's why they like groups. Nowadays, many kids would rather work with others than by themselves. I enjoy working alone. I have all the time I need. If I make a mistake, I am the only one responsible. In a group, if someone makes a mistake, everyone is affected. There can be arguments about who is at fault. I believe working alone is better and more useful. It shows what a student can really do. Group work is fine sometimes. But for me, working alone is best."}
{"text_id": "77D8D85C6451", "output_essay": "The question is if it's good for students to pick a career when they are young. Many high school students don't know what career they want. They are still unsure about their future job. There shouldn't be a set age to choose a career. This is because people think differently and don't always know what they want in life. Starting a career early is good because you can finish faster. But not everyone agrees with this. Some people think choosing a career early is good because young people can focus for longer. A young brain can remember more than an older one. Older people have more worries. Young people have fewer worries. I think young people should choose a career early. If you do, you won't have to think about college later. You can earn money from your job. Then you can decide what to do after your job is done. I don't agree with people who say starting a job early is bad. Young people can finish tasks fast because they want to get them done. After job training, you don't need to go back to school. Some people work after high school instead of college. They get used to making money and don't go back to school for a career. In the end, it's better to start working when you're young. If you want to do something, you will do it no matter how hard it is. Starting work young helps you stand out. With a job, your future will be better. You will do well in life. No one can put you down for not going to college."}

This has been good for everyone. Technology can have some bad sides. But it helps and improves our lives more than it harms. It links people across the world in seconds. It is quick, simple, and useful. People with disabilities can now move and share their thoughts easily. Teenagers might spend too much time on their gadgets and ignore the world around them. But for young people, technology is very helpful. They can find what they need for school with one click. Being able to look up your study topic and get all your materials from home can make your work better. You might not like technology, but you must agree it has pushed us forward. It has helped us achieve so much. Technology has shaped the world we live in. We should be thankful for that."}

For instance, when you work with others, you might not do as well because everyone thinks differently. They also have different talents like writing or drawing. When I first came to America, I didn't understand my art teacher. A friend helped me, and I finished my art project on time. Working alone is also good because you know what you are doing. You can share your own thoughts and learn new things. We must choose what we want to do later on. I think working alone is simpler. I can focus better and work hard every day to reach my goals. Some people say working with others is simpler. But I think working alone is more helpful. You will feel better because you are trying to improve. You decide what you want to do later on. In short, doing work alone is better. You try your hardest. The most important thing is that we control our future and can do great things."}

Technology lets people do many things fast and without talking to others. But technology is also bad for people's lives because they aren't enjoying them. People do everything from home and don't make friends. For example, you can work from home and not meet people. You don't talk about your life or feelings. If you're sad and need someone to talk to, you might be alone because you don't have friends. Keeping your feelings inside can make you depressed and sick because you don't talk about how you feel. Using technology to avoid people is not good; it makes life harder. People who use technology a lot don't spend time with their families. I have a brother who plays video games in his room all the time. We can be home all weekend and not see each other. I hardly see him, and it's not good. I want to spend time with him, talk about school, and share my life. But I can't, all because of technology that keeps families apart. It's sad to see people on their phones instead of talking to each other in real life. Technology lets you shop, play games, and read online without talking to people. But it's more fun to hang out with friends and do these things together. For example, shopping online on a Saturday morning is boring, sad, and stressful. Life has many fun things. You just need to live without technology sometimes. It's better to go outside and shop by yourself or with a friend. You can breathe fresh air and enjoy life with people who love you. Technology is making people have less contact with each other. It's bad for families, feelings, and how people see the world. Everyone should enjoy their life and have fun with people who care about them. Families should spend time together without technology. Kids should have fun with friends at school. We can't let technology control our lives. Let's start talking to people around us!"}

Without them, things could get out of hand. It's okay to need or ask for help. Some need it more than others. That's why schools have counselors. If you can't talk to a parent, you can talk to them. Or if you need legal help, you can get a lawyer. We need help all the time, even with small things. It's not smart to let people do whatever they want. They might think they don't need help or advice. But just following your own ideas isn't the best way. We can't predict what some people might think of doing. People should make their own choices. But getting advice can help. Sometimes you really need help from someone like your mom, a police officer, or a lawyer. It's hard to ask for help with big decisions. But if we just followed our ideas and instincts, the world would be very different. It might be worse. Some people don't care about their actions or who they hurt. If we all just did what we felt like, the world would be chaotic. We can't just follow our feelings. That could cause trouble. We should ask for help when we need it. Even asking for advice can help a lot. We are told what to do for a reason. We need help and rules. There are many people we can talk to. Asking for help is good. It can change how we think about small and big things. Some people think they don't need help or advice. But they might need it the most. For example, in a TV show, a girl took her life. She didn't ask for help. She seemed happy, but she wasn't. Not everyone thinks the same way. Getting help from a professional can give us answers we can't find ourselves. It's important to know we can't just do anything we want. There are consequences. Imagine if everyone did whatever they wanted without rules. What if a friend got hurt because they were too proud to ask for help? I wouldn't want to see that. In conclusion, I support getting help from experts. People should talk to someone about their problems, big or small. Those who don't want help are choosing to struggle alone. They live in their own world. I ask for advice every day. It helps me feel sure about my choices. I hope others do the same. Asking for advice is good. There are people ready to help. Many need to know it's okay to ask for help. People should stop being stubborn. They should put themselves first."}

How can you feel better about yourself? Some think that saying nice things about a student's work helps them feel better about themselves. Others think that doing well is the best way to feel good about yourself. Does feeling good about yourself come from praise, or from doing well? Doing well is the real way to build self-esteem because it pushes students to aim higher and work harder. \n\nDoing well is the top way to feel good about yourself because it makes students aim higher. Even a small win can make someone feel confident. When they finish something successfully, they feel better about themselves. They will want to aim higher by taking on harder tasks. This keeps their self-esteem up and they expect to do even better. Aiming higher is the first step to feeling good about yourself. For example, getting good grades makes students see how important it is and they will want to get even better grades next time. \n\nThere is no better way to push a student than by showing them what they have done well. Seeing their own good results makes students want to do their best. Their self-esteem pushes them to do better than before. Students will keep trying and aim to beat their last score. For example, a student taking a test will think about their last score and try to do better. No matter how small the win was, even if they failed before, their self-esteem will push them to not fail again and to do better. \n\nSome might say that saying nice things about a student's work is the way to build self-esteem. But, too much praise can make learning worse by making things too easy. It can also trick students into not trying hard. Doing well is the most important thing for feeling good about yourself. It is also a good way to push people to do better. The best way for students to aim high and do well is through their own wins. It doesn't matter if the win is big or small, as long as they learn from it."}

Some think it's good to pick a job early, but it's not. Choosing a job too early is bad because young people focus too much on the future and miss what's happening now. It can also harm your health, and kids often change their minds.\n\nI see many kids and teens thinking about the future so much that they miss out on life. It's better to enjoy life when you're young than when you're old. Young people should play outside with toys, not stress about jobs. Also, some can't spend time with their families because they're busy with job choices.\n\nExperts say worrying about jobs and the future can hurt your health. Thinking about the future too much can cause headaches. You might have too many forms to fill out or too much homework and not sleep enough. For instance, I'm in 11th grade and sometimes my eyes hurt from looking at a computer too long because of college forms.\n\nWe often change our minds as we grow. Kids might like one thing, but feel different when they're older. When I was young, I wanted to be a secretary. Now, I want to be an accountant.

{"text_id": "4BB857FA140D", "output_essay": "Technology has made our lives better. It lets us do things without needing to talk to other people. Technology is a big part of our lives. One reason it is so important is that it helps us look for things we need to know. For example, if something happens somewhere we care about, we can find out what it is. Also, technology makes it easy to talk to family and friends, no matter if they are far or near. Another point is that technology helps us do many things. We can look up information for schoolwork, learn new languages, or learn how to fix things like bikes, computers, or phones. Technology is key because without it, we couldn't get important news. We wouldn't know the weather or learn about the past. It helps us understand our world better.\n\nTechnology has good points, but it also has bad ones. It is important, but we must use it the right way. While it can help a lot, using it too much, like sending too many texts, is bad. It can also take our attention away. For example, some students might use their phones in class and not listen to the teacher. Technology can be good or bad. It depends on how we use it. It's not the technology's fault if we do bad things. It's because we don't use it correctly. If we use technology well, it can help us succeed. It gives us chances to do great things. We just need to use it for good and not bad."}

It's amazing how much we can do if we keep busy.' But I don't agree with him because when you do nothing, you have a lot more time to plan things or solve problems in detail. You also have time to be with your family and create memories. You won't have to miss another birthday, dance show, football match, or school play. You can do all these things by doing nothing.\n\nYou can plan a problem or a big event with a lot of attention to detail. This is one main reason I don't agree with Thomas Jefferson. Let's say your daughter is getting married in seven months. You would want time to get ready for it, right? You'll have time to plan the wedding and also be there to walk her down the aisle and hear her say 'I do.' Being busy can help pay for the wedding without trouble. But you'll manage that because you had time to deal with that issue.\n\nBeing with your family is important for a happy life. This is another reason I don't agree with Thomas Jefferson. The best gift is a child. From when you find out to when the baby comes, you'll have time to get ready. You'll have time to build a crib, decorate the room, and more. By not always being busy, you have time to watch your child grow. You can teach them to fish or swim, to read and write, and to be nice. You'll make these special memories because you have time. You're not always busy with work or other stuff. You have time for the people you love.\n\nSo, I don't agree with Thomas Jefferson about always being busy. Even though he has a strong point, he's not totally right. You don't have to be always busy to do something big; you can do big things when you're not always busy. That's why I don't agree with Thomas Jefferson and think you don't have to be always busy to do something big in life."}

Cleaning up trash from the beach can also change how people think. The Earth used to be a clean and peaceful place. Seeing it dirty now can make you want to clean it up and bring back that peace. Other things can change people's minds even more than what you do yourself. Sad dog ads make me want to help them find a loving home. Not many people adopt from shelters, but they should. It saves lives and makes the animals feel loved. Animals can change how we feel, not just other people. Seeing homeless people can make you sad, especially if you don't help. Giving even a little can mean a lot to them. It can encourage them to improve their lives. They might see you as someone who helped them stand up again. The fresh air at the beach can feel wonderful. It can also make you want to keep the beach clean. This helps fight global warming. Many things hurt the Earth, but if we all work together, we can fix these problems.

The next generation might be even lazier because of more technology. If we used less technology, we would talk to each other more and be less lazy. Social media is bad for kids. It causes fights and drama. It's not safe for kids and teens. It makes them feel sad and can lead to more suicides. Kids on social media compare themselves to others and make bad friends. They are too young for social media. Students are getting worse grades. Some cheat on quizzes with good grades but fail tests. They use apps for math homework but don't learn.

{"text_id": "9616D1663C9A", "output_essay": "Technology includes new tools that scientists make. Today, scientists have made great new tools like phones, planes, and phone apps that help a lot. It's amazing how these tools help people. For example, if someone needs to talk to another person, they just use their phone to call, even if they are far away. But technology also has bad sides. It makes people too self-reliant. They do things alone without talking to others, which makes them less friendly.\n\nFirst, using technology too much can hurt how much people talk to each other. I think this because some people sit in front of computers, TVs, or phones and play games for hours or even whole days. This is bad because it's not healthy. They stay in their rooms all day and do nothing else. They don't exercise and don't know what's going on around them. They stay alone in their rooms. So, their bodies get weak, and they might get sick. Playing games too much is bad for their health and can hurt their eyes from looking at screens too long. So, we can say technology is bad for people's health and bodies. Also, some kids start to think real life is like a game. They act like they are in a game, which can lead to doing things that are against the law. So, technology can hurt people's health, bodies, and minds.\n\nAlso, using technology too much can hurt people's relationships. It can make big problems in families or with friends. In many families, technology distracts parents. They don't pay attention to their kids or help them when needed. For example, a kid might ask his dad for help with homework, but the dad, who is watching TV, might say, 'I'm tired, ask your mom.' The kid asks his mom, who is on social media, and she says the same thing. The kid just wants to learn to add numbers. His parents had time but chose TV and social media over helping him. This happens a lot. So, the kid might grow up thinking his parents won't help him. This can make the relationship with his parents hard because of technology.\n\nSome people say technology makes life better by making things easier. Now, buying things is easy. You use your phone, go to a store's website, and order what you need. Then, you wait for it to come to your house. This saves time and is safer. But I don't agree. We can do all these things without technology. It's not needed for some things, like buying food online or having fun. People rely on technology too much for fun, solving problems, and learning. This can make them less social over time, which is bad. Good relationships, like with friends or at work, are important. Friends make you happy, and work friends can help your career. So, I don't think technology making us talk less to people is good.\n\nIn the end, technology has made big improvements like better communication and helping in medicine and safety. But it also has bad parts, like kids getting addicted to games. They waste time in their rooms instead of living life. It takes away time that parents should spend with their kids and hurts their relationships. We don't really need technology that much. We can do anything without it. For all these reasons, I think technology making us talk less to people has a bad effect on our lives."}

It will make my mom and family proud. It wasn't easy. I had tough times but I kept going. Being active is important to me.

{"text_id": "8C54215E9E81", "output_essay": "In our world, many people have dreams and things they want to do. A lot of people want to achieve their dreams, but they don't want to work for it. They just sit there, thinking about what they want and how it could change their lives. They hope things will happen on their own, but the truth is you must work hard for what you want. You must always take action. This is how people achieve their dreams. To do this, people must keep a strong and positive way of thinking and believe in themselves. Even when it's tough, they can't give up on their dreams.\n\nFirst, to make dreams come true, people must always be active. For instance, if someone wants to be a doctor, they need to study, go to college, get a degree, and work at least a part-time job to pay for their daily needs. It might be tough because they may not get enough sleep. They have to study and work late into the night, but they keep going because they know what they want. They are not just dreaming about the future; they are working hard to build a strong future.\n\nSecond, to achieve dreams, people need a strong and positive way of thinking. For example, even when things are tough, they don't stop because they think positively and believe things will get better. In the end, they will see the results of their hard work and feel it was worth it. This is the kind of attitude needed to achieve dreams.\n\nFinally, believing in yourself is very important. Imagine people working hard to achieve their dreams but not believing in themselves. This is a problem because to achieve dreams, they must believe they can do anything they want in life. People who believe and think positively can find more chances in life. By believing and working hard, they are more likely to do more in life. This mix of positive thinking and belief is a strong tool that helps you keep going and not stop. It helps you achieve more and more.\n\nIn conclusion, when people work hard and keep doing things while believing in their dreams, they have a better chance of achieving their goals than those who don't believe and don't work for it. They just hope that one day they will achieve their dreams. There are many dreams to make real in the world. People need to work hard to make them happen. Some choose to stay still and keep things as they are because they think it's okay to take it easy. But when people really want something, they work for it. They try their best to get what they want. That's how they achieve their goals in life. The more people do, the more they achieve."}
{"text_id": "5CEB6F00D0EB", "output_essay": "Ralph Waldo Emerson once said, 'Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow.' I agree with this because it means you will start to trust and respect yourself more. It also means you will learn a lot, and it will help you later on.\n\nThe first reason is that you will trust and respect yourself more. Every day, you learn about what you like. When you try new things and do well, you will want to keep trying new things. You will remember your past successes and believe that you can finish new tasks.\n\nAnother reason is that you will get more life experiences. No matter what happens, big or small, you learn and get experience. Experience comes from living in the moment and seeing what you are doing. Even if you fail at something new, you still learn from it.\n\nThe last reason is that it helps you in the future. As you get older, you learn more. Imagine you get a new job that pays well but requires you to do something you've never done before. Would you quit, or would you keep trying until you get it right? I would keep trying. With all the experience I would have, I would trust myself to get through it.\n\nThis quote is important to me because I've been in a similar situation. In my JROTC class, I was good at marching. But to join the drill team, I had to get even better. I worked hard, went to practices, learned more, and grew. By the end of the year, I was one of the team's leaders because of my hard work and self-trust.\n\nIn conclusion, I agree with Emerson's quote. It means you will trust and respect yourself more, learn a lot, and help yourself in the future. That's why I agree with his words."}

But the things people put online can be mean and hurt others. Some people don't see it as a big deal, but it is. Technology can be bad for us because strangers on the internet might ask for your private details. They can also say mean things without knowing you at all.\n\nEveryone uses technology these days, including kids. Parents think it's good for keeping kids busy. But young children don't really understand what they're doing. They often watch videos on YouTube, where they might see things they shouldn't. Teenagers face risks too. Have you ever been online and strangers start messaging you? They might want to know where you live, if you want to meet, or they could try to steal from you by asking for your bank details. Some people don't think about the risks and share their details carelessly. This can put them in danger without them realizing it.\n\nSocial media is very popular everywhere. Snapchat, Instagram, and Twitter are used by teens and adults. These apps let you chat with friends and share photos, which is fun. But they can be dangerous too. You might wonder why. On Snapchat, someone might ask for private photos and then save them. Teens might trust the person, but suddenly, their photos are on a fake Instagram account. People then post mean comments and call them names like 'hoe,' 'slut,' and 'whore.' Some might think it's a joke, but it can really hurt the other person. It might make them not want to live anymore. This is called cyberbullying and it's very serious.\n\nTechnology can also be good for us. It lets us meet new people, finish work quickly, and learn things online. Today, everything involves technology. People say they can't live without their phones. Having a phone to talk to friends is great. But parents worry when their kids get too hooked on their phones, iPads, or laptops. Teens often keep secrets from their parents. Technology can affect us in bad ways. It can make people feel so sad that they think about suicide or hurting themselves. It can make them lose confidence. There are mean people out there who don't realize the pain they cause.\n\nTechnology has changed our lives a lot, and not always for the better. People get bullied online and at school because of what's on the internet. We need to stop this. It's getting out of hand. We should make the internet safer. People should feel secure when using technology. Technology has hurt many people, and we need to make it stop."}

For example, you can see monkeys swinging from tree to tree every day. Other animals show off their skills to the people who visit. Also, snakes and other animals are good at hiding because they blend in with their surroundings. Each animal's color helps it hide from danger and catch food. But spiders are different.

I believe the school board should not make the school day longer because kids are busy with other things after school. Here are some reasons why they should not make the school day longer. Kids may need to look after their brothers or sisters after school. Their parents might be at work when they get home. If school ends later, their parents could be late to work because there is no one to watch the kids. Some kids might have jobs or need to help their parents. Many kids have just one parent who needs help with money. Some kids need to help their family. Many kids have to study or do homework after school. They often have tests the next day and need time to study. Many are behind on homework. They need time to finish and sort their homework. Kids are very tired and want to rest after school. They are tired of learning and want to sleep to clear their minds. Some kids tutor younger children after school. They might help them with homework or studying. They want to help, but if school is longer, they won't have time. Many kids play sports and have practice after school. Their coach wants them to be on time because they have a lot to do. Coaches are strict about being on time. Kids don't want to be kicked off the team because school is longer. Some kids go to church after school. Many are Catholic or Christian and need to go to help or pray. Their parents are strict about being on time for church. If school is longer, their parents will be upset. Some kids do community service after school. They need it to pass a class or for something else important. They don't want to be late because they want to finish it. Some kids' parents might be sick. They might be the only one who can take care of them. What if something bad happens to their parents while they are in school longer? We should not take that risk. Many kids might need to travel far after school to see family. They want to leave school before there is traffic. If school is longer, they will be late and hit traffic. Another reason is kids are sleepy. They might fall asleep in class, which distracts others. Kids want to go home and sleep because they wake up early for school. They don't like leaving school late. Many kids have to pick up their siblings at the bus stop. If they are not on time, the bus driver will take their siblings back to school. They might not be able to get them from school. If they are late, their parents will be angry at them and the school board. It's not their fault; it's because the school day was made longer. Many kids have appointments after school. They don't want to be late and have to reschedule. In conclusion, kids have many things to do after school. They need to help their families, and they don't want to be late or miss anything important."}
{"text_id": "7B4DFF22E623", "output_essay": "I think that working with others is better than working alone. When I work with other students, I get new ideas. I finish my work fast, and if I can't finish, then my group helps me. I share my ideas with them, and they share theirs with me. We talk about what is right and what is wrong. We split the work so we can finish faster. Everyone does their tasks fast; if someone doesn't know something, we help them. We learn from each other by sharing ideas.\n\nWhen students work together, they learn more than when they work by themselves. A student alone can't share his ideas with others. If he has a big project, he might not finish in time because there's no one to help him. But in a group, students split the work, which helps them finish faster. In a group, if a student is stuck, he can ask for help. Students talk to each other in a group. Talking helps people learn a language more easily. When I came to the United States, I couldn't speak English. I started talking with other students in school to learn. If I didn't know a word, I would ask my teacher or friends. Working in a group, students can learn languages from each other. It's harder to learn a new language alone because it takes longer without talking.\n\nSome students don't like group work because they don't want to talk or are shy. But group work is better. In a group, students help each other to finish work fast. They can finish on time. Group work makes talking with others easier. Students can make friends by helping each other."}

Technology also makes it easier when you go to the library with your family or friends. You don't have to look through all the shelves for a book.

Technology is useful in many ways. For example, if you go shopping and forget your wallet, you can pay with your phone. This shows how technology helps us. It's not just for work but also for students learning. When kids reach a certain age, they can use computers or phones for school work. If they miss a day, they can go online to keep up with the class. Kids also have more fun playing games with Wi-Fi and using devices to play with others online. Another plus is finding dates online.

Let's be honest, no one really likes homework, but we have to do it. For instance, I really dislike homework. It's my least favorite thing. But I do like the idea of a homework club. I hope my school starts one. It would be a good way for students and teachers to get to know each other. They can also share how they feel. Students can get help with tough subjects, teachers can be proud of good grades, and parents can be happy too. It's good for everyone. I fully support this idea. Also, kids should be able to bring their own snacks. The club could meet every other day. Homework is important for school. If you don't do it, it can cause problems. I think teachers are nicer now than before. They work hard to help students do well. They want us to pass, go to college, and get good jobs. Teachers are ready to help, but you have to try.

Research shows that people who only count on themselves don't do as well as those who get advice from experts. Some people think it's best to trust yourself and your gut feelings for big decisions. But famous people, teachers, and parents show that's not always the best way. Famous people like actors and singers often get tips from more experienced people about their work. PROPER_NAME is one example. She works hard and has tough times every day. Her dad is her hero and her boss. He was a successful singer and knows a lot about what PROPER_NAME faces. That's why she goes to him for help. Now, she is someone everyone looks up to. Teachers around us also say that getting advice from those who know more helps us learn better. My English teacher, Generic_Name, said we should learn from each other and ask for advice from people who know what they're doing. Teachers understand life well because they were once students too. They learned from other teachers who had lots of experience. Parents can also help us when we don't know something. I once asked my mom for advice about whether I should quit a class. She told me about when she was young and had to make a similar choice. She made a list of good and bad points to help her decide. She also said not to quit just because I felt hopeless. Her advice and story really helped me. It's good to get advice from experts because they know more than we do. In the future, we should all be more willing to ask for help.

I think schools should not make the day longer because it would change students' lives a lot. Making the school day longer would cut down on the time they have with family and friends, leave them with less time for homework and studying, and it would cause stress. \n\nMaking the school day longer would cut down on the time students can spend with their family and friends. Imagine you have plans with a friend tonight, but your friend's school doesn't have the extra hour and a half. You wouldn't have much time together. A family member is visiting, but he can only stay for an hour after school usually ends. You didn't know your school made the day longer, so you missed seeing them. A longer school day can really affect a student's social life; they won't have as much time with friends and family. Also, the student wouldn't have enough time for homework. \n\nA longer school day would also cut into the time they have for homework and studying. They would have to figure out how to fit in time with family and friends and doing homework. If not, they might fail and have to repeat the year. You need to study for a test, but you also have math homework. There wouldn't be enough time for both. It would be hard to study and do homework with a longer school day by one hour and thirty minutes. It would also cause stress. \n\nIt would be stressful because you would have more classes, which means more work. If school was longer by one hour and thirty minutes, you would have to take two more classes. More classes mean more work and tests, and this could stress students out. They get more projects, which take a lot of time. More classes also mean students need more school supplies, and some parents can't afford them. \n\nSo, I think it's not a good idea to add one hour and thirty minutes to the school day. It would cut down on the time students have with family and friends because of the extra school time, they have less time for homework and studying because they need to balance social life and school, and it's stressful because they have more classes."}

Also, if we want to do or make something, we should stay positive and never give up.\n\nOne reason I want to reach my goals is to stay away from being lazy. But if we want to be someone, we have to work hard to make our dreams come true and not get lazy. For example, I have a cousin who couldn't pay for college because his parents didn't have the money. But this didn't stop him; he got a job and was able to keep studying. By staying busy, he made his dreams come true. He is now in his last year of college, and his parents are very proud of him. People who believe in their dreams can really be someone.\n\nAnother reason I believe is that when we go after what we want, we must be positive and keep going. On the other hand, people who are lazy often don't think positively, and they give up on their dreams. For instance, in my home country, I knew a girl who was always lazy. During school, she didn't take part in anything, even though I told her to. A year later, she wanted to do something big in life. With my help, she started college and is now working towards her dreams, leaving her lazy ways behind. Her parents are very happy with her new positive way of thinking and her will to keep going. I truly think that people who are positive and don't quit can reach their goals.\n\nIn the end, some might think that being lazy can help you become a better person.

They believe that being active might be their way to success. If everyone makes plans, they could reach their goals. But some people prefer to take shortcuts, which can become a habit. With this lazy approach, they won't get much done in life. \n\nSome people think taking shortcuts is a good way to get things done. But facts show that this isn't always true. Long ago, before technology, people had to do work by hand and quickly. By working hard, we can achieve and learn more. Today, many people use technology to make work easier. This habit is common; children and adults use technology to finish work or just copy and paste. Technology helps us in many ways, but it can also make us lazy. If we all have the strength and energy to do something, then we can do more. We can gain confidence and complete more tasks. Jefferson was right: if we work more, we can do more. It all depends on how we use our time well."}

They can see different kinds of companies like businesses, marketing, or factories. Students who like what the company does will find this very helpful. Our school works with your company. I would be very happy to learn more about what you do. Many students might want to visit your company. But I am a great choice because I do well in school, I like the jobs you have, and I want to write about it to help other students want to visit too.\n\nFirst, I am a great choice because I do well in school. Doing well in school matters when picking students for special chances like this. A student who doesn't do well might not care much or might not try hard. If you pick a student who does well, they will be more interested in your jobs. They will work hard in school and maybe go to a good college. Later, they could work for you. Picking someone who did well in school is good for your company. It makes you look good. If you pick me, you won't regret it because I care about my work and I am interested.\n\nSecond, I am a great choice because I am interested in what your company does. It's important to pick someone who likes the jobs you offer. If they don't care, they shouldn't apply. Some students don't know what they want to do. They apply without thinking. If a boss picks someone who isn't interested, it's a bad choice. That person won't pay attention or learn much. It's better to pick someone who really wants to learn. I am that person. I will pay attention to everything and learn a lot.\n\nThird, I am a great choice because I want to write about visiting your company. This will make other students want to visit too. I will write about all the good things. Good things make people interested. For example, a student writes about his reading club to get others to join. He talks about the fun they will have and uses pictures and colors to make it exciting. I want to do the same with my visit. If I write about it, more students will want to come. This means you might get more good students interested in your jobs. In the future, they could be great workers for you. This will make your company look good. So, picking me is a good idea because I will share my visit to get more students to come.\n\nIn conclusion, I am a great choice to visit your company. I do well in school, I really like what your company does, and I want to write about my visit. This will help get more good students to come in the future.\n\nSincerely,\n\nGeneric_Name"}
{"text_id": "680239A1F605", "output_essay": "How does the program help both older and younger kids? Let's talk about what it does for the students. It helps the younger kids with their schoolwork and improves their grades. It also helps the older kids get to know the younger ones better. First, the program helps younger kids with their schoolwork. They are getting low grades. If they fail, they might have to repeat the year or go to summer school. For instance, I had to go to summer school because I failed 4th grade. Next, the program helps them get better grades. This way, they won't fail and have to go to summer school. If they get A's or B's, they can move on to the next grade. I did my work and got good grades, so I moved up a grade. Lastly, the program helps older kids understand the younger ones. They learn what the younger kids like to do when they're bored. Some older kids find younger kids funny, and some don't. I learned about younger kids, and it helped me understand my little brother. In conclusion, I talked about how a program helps older and younger kids. I gave three reasons: it helps with schoolwork, it raises grades, and it helps older kids understand younger ones. I hope older kids can help the younger ones with schoolwork. They could also help them get smarter, study together, play games like tag or hide and seek, take them to fun places, or just hang out. This way, they can show them what being older is like, including homework, fun activities, and what their school is like."}
{"text_id": "AB16956A4C54", "output_essay": "Should schools add an extra hour and a half? I think they shouldn't because it makes kids more stressed. They have to learn more, and it confuses them. Many kids are already stressed from learning too much. Adding more school time means students get less free time and less time for homework. Kids need to play after school to relax and forget about school for a while. Then they do their homework. But with longer school days, they can't relax. They get upset because they have too much homework and too much to learn for tests. Often, kids don't do their homework until night because they want to play. This isn't good, but they need fun so they don't get overwhelmed by too much work without a break. Teachers also have less time for their own tasks if school hours are longer. They might not finish their work because they're at school too long or they're too busy teaching. They forget their own tasks after school. Kids and teachers need time with friends and family. Without it, people might think they don't want to spend time together. Longer hours mean kids and teachers won't have time to play or be with family after work. High school and middle school students can do their work and have fun because they start and finish school early. But with longer hours, they might stay up late working when they should be sleeping. They need to study a lot for tests. If they fail, they might have to retake them or get a bad grade. Without extra school time, they have more time to work, study, and relax before bed. Younger kids can do their work if they wake up early. But if school ends later, they'll be too tired and stressed to do anything else. They'll get bad grades and reports for not finishing homework on time. I believe schools shouldn't make the day longer. It stresses kids and fills their minds with too much. They should have time to be with family and do what they want without stress. Also, students won't enjoy school if it's too long and they can't play. Lastly, kids and adults will lose family time."}
{"text_id": "A57FA17E3B26", "output_essay": "To me, imagination means doing something new. I believe, like Albert Einstein, that imagination is more important than knowledge. With imagination, you can achieve anything in life. It can take you to new places and change your life. \n\nFirst, if you imagine, you can do anything, like getting a car. Imagine you and your parents are broke, and you start working. You need to drive to work, but you don't have a car or money for a ride. If you dream of having a car, you might get one because you believed it would happen. The same goes for buying a house. If you're saving for a house that costs 1,500 dollars and you only have 1,000 dollars, just dream of the price dropping. Your dream might come true with a big sale, and you can buy the house. This also works for school tests. If you've been failing math but you dream of passing a big test, and you work hard, you might just pass. \n\nSecond, imagination can lead you to great places. It can help you play better basketball, get good grades, join the team, and find teammates who pass you the ball. It can even help you get into a good college. If you're failing and think you won't make it, just dream of better grades. Your dream can turn those F's into A's and B's, and you might get into the college you and your mom hope for. Dreaming bigger might even lead you to become a Hall of Famer. \n\nLastly, imagination can change your life. It can help you make history. For example, if you want to beat someone's top score at school, just dream of winning. Your dream might help you get the highest score and set a record. It can also change how people feel about someone. If you think your best friend has been mean, imagine them being nice because they never really showed they were a true friend. \n\nIn conclusion, I stand with Albert Einstein. With imagination, you can do anything in life. It can take you to new places and change your life. Imagination is important to me because it changed my life."}

There's a saying that time doesn't stop for anyone and being idle leads to laziness. The lazier you get, the poorer you get. It takes a strong and brave person to beat challenges. To be determined means to stay focused, brave, independent, and ready to face anything. My mom taught me, 'You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink.' I thought about it and realized that my success is up to me. I must work hard to be who I should be in the future. Hard work is key for success for everyone. I like the quote, 'It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing.' I agree because everyone has a reason to be here. Even if you are lazy, you can still learn something. But sometimes, being busy doesn't mean we'll get more done. I think we shouldn't just look to get things from what we do. We should give more than we take. Life can work in strange ways. It's full of good and bad. Sometimes, it takes time for the right things to happen. You might do great things and expect great results, but see nothing. It hurts, right? Yes, but often our good actions help us when we're stuck and least expect it. In my country, we say good things come to those who wait. Our generation wants quick money and quick success. They forget that things aren't always perfect. But the older people knew the value of hard work and focus. I want our young people to remember that life is about determination and hard work.

Also, if you know things but can't use them, imagination is a useful tool. Plus, thinking up things, whether they are real or not, is usually more fun than just knowing things.\n\nIf a person is sick and wants to make something but can't, they need to use their imagination. This is good for kids, and for young and old people who are sick and can't do what they want. If you are sad because you want to make something to help others but can't because you don't have imagination, then thinking up things can make you feel better.\n\nKnowing things is good, but if you can't use what you know, you have to imagine to fill the gap. This is how you can make something; without imagination, we are nothing. Imagination makes you feel good about yourself and makes you want to dream more.\n\nWhen you think of things that aren't real, it's fun and makes you feel better about yourself, which makes you want to think up even more things.

{"text_id": "6850D8C2ADCB", "output_essay": "Some people think it's good to praise a student's work to make them feel better about themselves, even if it's not their best. They say that students need to feel sure of themselves to learn. But others believe that saying good things about poor work can hurt learning because it makes standards lower. They think that real self-esteem comes from doing well. For some students, learning is hard, or they don't want to try very hard. Still, some teachers like to say nice things to students, which might not always help. If teachers praise too much, students might keep doing things the same way and not get better. They might also start to think too highly of themselves, believing their work is better than others'. This could make the achievements of those who work hard without praise seem less important. If teachers praise without thinking, students might not change their ways or get better at their work or skills. For example, a teacher might say, \"Hey Generic_Name, your work looks very good; I like that stick figure painting. Keep it up.\" It's nice to give compliments, but if teachers say everything is great just to keep students from feeling bad, then the student might think all they do is perfect and not try to do better. This is not what most teachers want. Second, students can become too proud, which might make others feel not good enough. For example, a student might say, \"Yo Generic_Name, I got a seventy-one percent, and you got seventy percent on your math quiz.\" This kind of talk might not always be true, but it can happen. Younger kids might believe a teacher's praise even if it's not true. For older kids, like in middle school, this could lead to fights. In high school, too much praise from teachers might stop them from trying to get better. Last, it's good when students reach goals by themselves. A student might think, \"I am done, and it looks good, but I can make it better.\" When students work hard and finish something, they feel proud. Doing a task on their own, without too much praise for okay work, helps students see what they can do better. In the end, while some think praising a student's work can make them feel good about themselves, others say it comes from doing things well. Too much praise, especially if it's not true, may not help in the end. It could make the person or others feel bad. Some students might become too proud from too much praise, while others feel better working on their own, without being told their work is \"good.\" This way, students can also learn how to make their work and skills better."}

This is the time when you learn about being an adult. In high school, teachers and counselors ask you what job you want to have. I think it's important for students to start thinking about this early. Some people say that thinking about jobs when you're young is bad. They say it's stressful, confusing, and puts too much pressure on students. They think students need more time to decide on a job. But I think it's good for students to start early. They can set goals, look into what they need for the job they want, and visit colleges to learn more. \n\nI think students should set goals. They can work hard to get good grades. They can make smart choices in school, like where to sit. They can also aim to study a lot. Studying can lead to great grades and passing tests. This means they can move on to the next grade. Setting goals is key because it pushes you to finish them. \n\nI believe that starting to look at jobs early gives the student and their family time to find out what's needed for that job. Families can ask the student's counselor about the grades needed for the job. With their family's help, students can look at colleges to see which one is right for their job. Parents can plan how to pay for the student's education. This way, the student might have the money they need when it's time. Knowing what's needed is important so you're not rushed at the last minute. \n\nI also think visiting colleges is a good way to learn about them. On these visits, you can see what the campus is like and feel the atmosphere. You can find out what the college offers, what classes are strong, and what classes are not so good. You can see if the classes will help your job. You can also learn about the costs of college. You can find out about travel costs, food costs each month or week, how much books cost, and living on campus. \n\nI believe it's great for students to aim for their future job when they're young. They can make a list of things to do, research with their family, and visit colleges. Making a list of things to do for their job is helpful. Researching gives you important information. Visiting colleges is also useful. As you can see, making early choices about a job is good. You know what you're working toward. And students can learn to start planning for their job."}

Being in a group makes it easier to hand in work for grading, which helps the teacher. Students can learn more about a topic. They also get to meet and share ideas about their classwork.\n\nStudents can mix their ideas to finish a job. Each student might see the topic differently. Working together usually means they finish their work quicker. They can combine their efforts on homework or projects. If students work in groups, their grades might go up or down. It's important for a teacher to choose the right students for each group. Friends might just play instead of working. It's better to pair students who don't talk to each other often.\n\nAs a high school student, I see that we don't like working alone. We prefer groups because we feel we can do things quicker. Sometimes, one student does all the work, and the others just copy. This is a problem. If I were a teacher, I wouldn't want to give a grade that a student didn't earn. I would want everyone in the group to work hard. Working as a team is great for coming up with ideas.\n\nIf I were a teacher, I'd like my students to do group work often. It helps them talk and work with others, and it can improve their grades. It's a good way to keep them awake and off their phones. If a student doesn't get something, their group can explain it. This helps them understand better. Teachers want all students to get good grades and pass. This helps them later in life.\n\nStudents should like group work because they can get help if they're confused. Studies say that students understand better when another student explains it. I agree because I learn better when my friends explain things simply. Many students could really benefit from this. Some know more about a topic than others.\n\nI think teachers should remember that students need to talk more, not use their phones. They should talk to classmates and ask questions. This would make everyone happy. Teachers would get work to grade sooner. There would be more talking in class and better communication with the teacher.

With a longer school day, we can finish everything in one place. Schools can let students start clubs for fun and to make friends. They could have a food club or a music club. Teachers will be happy to see students doing their work and helping each other. Students could start a book club, a dance club, or have contests. They could also have free time. They could play instruments, learn more about music, and have fun. They could play sports like soccer, basketball, or tag. If they finish their work, they could watch movies as a reward. There could be a computer room for pixel art. Schools could plan more field trips. At the end of the day, students could eat snacks and watch a short video. They could have art time to paint, draw, and decorate the school. They could start a club to do experiments and see what they create. Students could vote on movies and food choices. They could tell stories and watch history and science videos to learn. A longer school day means more fun with friends and projects. Students can get better grades and show their parents their schoolwork. They can tell their parents about their progress and what help they need. Parents will know homework is done. Students will be proud of their work. At school, kids will do what they need to. Teachers will see that students are focused. Students will be ready and do their work well. They will be prepared for the next year. When students take tests, they will show they have learned. Teachers will be impressed. With a longer school day, students can choose many clubs and classes. It will make a big difference. We need to make the school day longer for all this to happen. It will help students for years to come. They could even go to a top school or work for NASA. We need to try making the school day longer to see the benefits. If we don't, we might miss the chance to help them succeed. We want them to be smart and teach others one day.

It's great to have days off for these reasons. These days off can be the best or just a day to relax. On these days, you can buy something you've always wanted or visit family far away that you haven't seen in ten years. Maybe you haven't seen your kids for two years because you were in the military.\n\nNow, imagine having no breaks at work, no sick days, just work every single day. That wouldn't be fun, right? Your kids might ask why you work so much without having fun. What will you say? Also, think about where your money goes: bills, food, and not for fun.\n\nLastly, think about retirement. Imagine being 75 and still working because you don't get enough money from the government. You work just to eat and live, which is crazy. When I'm old, I want to live with my kids, help with their kids, and just relax with my wife. The world is crazy, but that's why I think we should take it easy and not work every day until we die."}
{"text_id": "3E985C0CA51A", "output_essay": "People often say that working together is the key to success. Is it better to work alone or in a group? Which brings more rewards? Working in a group is better because you talk more, learn from others, and can make new friends. \n\nTalking with others can help get more work done. When you chat in a group, more ideas come out. Not all ideas will be great, but it's good to have many to choose from. For instance, when my group talked about World War I, everyone had something to add. \n\nAlso, you learn new things in a group. You might hear something interesting from someone. You'll spend time talking and sharing new facts with your team. You may not always agree, but you'll think about it. Like the time my classmates and I talked about Romeo and Juliet, my friend Generic_Name had a smart idea about why it's a famous love story, with details I hadn't thought of. \n\nBeing with people also lets you make new friends. In a group, you talk about more than just work. You share what you like and don't like, your hobbies, and funny stories. For example, I met my friend PROPER_NAME on a project. After we finished, we got to know each other and laughed together. It may not be as easy as working alone, but you get to talk to others and make friends. \n\nIn the end, being in a group is better. You can talk more, learn new things, and meet friends. I've explained why it's much better than working alone. Being with others and part of a team is more fun than being by yourself. Plus, the work is less stressful when you have others to help."}

Self-reliance means making choices based on what you believe is best, often for yourself. It has many good effects on your life. It can make you feel better about yourself, help you learn from mistakes, and make you happier when you follow your heart.\n\nIt's important to be self-reliant because it lets you have your own views. It makes you feel good, smart, and able to be trusted. When you choose for yourself, it shows you are grown-up and your confidence grows. You are happier when this happens.\n\nWe make choices every day, like at the store, when driving, or at a restaurant. Often, choices are tough. We might fail, like buying the wrong item, taking a wrong turn, or picking the wrong dish. But failing is okay. We learn more from our mistakes. We get more knowledge when we rely on ourselves. If others tell us what to do, we don't learn as much.\n\nDoing what you love is good for you. For example, when picking a career, you should choose what you enjoy and will make you happy. You need to trust yourself to make these choices. Then you go to college and study what you think is best.\n\nIt's true that getting advice from experts can help you make better choices. Having an expert to guide you is helpful. They can offer advice and help with daily choices. A mentor can stop you from making bad choices that could hurt your life. Talking to a teacher is also good because it can ease your stress.\n\nSelf-reliance is believing in yourself and your choices. We use it every day as we face more decisions. I think everyone should make their own choices and trust themselves. When you use your own ideas, you feel more content and are likely to be happier. Self-reliance has many benefits. It's our choice to use it or not."}

It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing.\" He means that it's good to always be busy instead of doing nothing. He also says we shouldn't be looked down on for doing nothing. Some people think doing nothing is okay sometimes. But we do more when we keep ourselves busy. Being busy not only fills our time but also makes us feel good and proud of ourselves.\n\nI think people like to be busy because it makes them feel useful. For example, my little sister hates doing nothing, like just watching TV or resting. She does the laundry after her homework. She has a lot of homework because she is in all AP classes. She does her homework until 11 PM. If she has no homework, she helps my baby sister with hers. I sometimes wish I were as busy as she is. I asked her once how she does so much. She said, \"I love being busy; it's just who I am.\" I look up to her for that. It seems to make her feel important.\n\nMy second point is that being busy makes people feel important and proud. When I finish something, like a project or a drawing, I feel proud and valuable. It feels good to be done with it. When I finish something, I show it to my family or friends. I enjoy the pride I feel from my work. But it's not just about finishing. It's also about doing it right. If I don't, I might have to fix it. That can take away from the pride I feel. Doing well isn't just about school. Helping others outside of school can also make you feel good. It helps them and makes them feel better too.\n\nSome people say doing nothing can be good. They say it can make your memory better if you sleep enough. I agree because I remember things better after I sleep well. When I don't sleep well, I don't remember things as well.\n\nIn conclusion, even though there might be some good things about doing nothing, we do more when we keep busy. This is because being busy not only fills our time but also makes us feel important and proud. That's why I think we do more when we are always doing something."}

They might have to take care of their younger brothers or sisters or go to other activities, like swimming. Students also need to feed their pets, do housework, help their grandparents, or be in different places at the same time. If we added one and a half hours to the school day, it would mess up these plans. What subjects would be taught during this extra time? How would students use the extra hour and a half? \n\nAlso, some students have to look after their younger brothers or sisters. They might need to cook meals at home or go to the doctor every day for health problems. If a student's parent is sick, they might have to take care of them, or they might need to help with things like buying food. More school hours would change when school ends, which could confuse parents who come to get their kids. It could also cut down on the little time students have with their families, which is usually only after school and on weekends. \n\nIn short, making the school day an hour and a half longer is not a good idea. It could mess up what teachers have planned. Teachers have to make food, look after their kids, and get ready for the next day's classes. They might need to go to meetings, find substitute teachers, or do other jobs. If we make the school day longer, teachers with doctor's appointments would have a harder time, and we might need more substitute teachers.

I laugh and have a good time. Shopping online is better. In stores, people fight over things because they want the same stuff. Online, there's more to buy at the same price. Technology makes work better. It lets me finish tasks quickly. Before I knew about computers, math homework took me hours. I'm not good at math. But with a computer, I can do homework in 10-15 minutes. I watch videos that teach me how to do it. Technology can make life better if you use it right. It makes me hopeful for the future.

This is because sometimes we need to understand things that we haven't tried to explain yet. There are things that I can't explain about how the class works. The students know what they have learned about the subject so far. First, I think that if a person hasn't learned something, they can't teach it. This is because some people can't learn everything they need to know. Every school has goals that students must work hard to achieve. In soccer class, students must get better to improve their skills. Second, at work, every employee needs to learn their job well, even if they are new. The company helps them learn so they can do their work. Not everyone learns at the same speed, but some people need to learn more than just the basics. Third, I believe that some people can do better than others. They understand more about what has been done. Everyone needs to learn well to do their jobs well. Some people get praise from the company because they do a great job with what they have learned. The company is very good at making food, clothes, and other things. In conclusion, everyone needs to learn, but there are things that can't be made. And at work, people can learn to do their jobs well.

Others think that working alone is better and that teachers should not make students work in groups.

Another good thing about working in a group is you can meet new people and make new friends. When you work with people you don't know, you might meet a very special friend or even the person you have been looking for. Another reason teachers should let students work in groups is because of different ideas. As a teacher, you want your students to work together and share. It's smart to have them work in groups so they can learn about each other and help someone who needs it. But, some people say that working alone is better because students might just play and not pay attention to their work.

In my essay, I will discuss how being busy can lead to getting a lot done. I will cover three main ideas. The first is working in a group. The second is how being an athlete can help you achieve more. The third is if being busy all the time means we get more done. Let's start with working in a group. In a group, you can get more done. This is because you have others to help you. Everyone is working. You can give each person a different job. This makes the work go faster. If someone does not understand, others can help. Groups work well because everyone does their part. This helps you get more done. But, you can also get more done as athletes. Athletes are always active. They aim to be the best. Sometimes it is tough because people may criticize them. So, they work hard to achieve more. If they don't work hard, they might not reach their goals. For example, college football players want to go to the NFL. They work hard for this. They ask for advice to get better. Being an athlete means you are always trying to do more. But, can we get more done by always being busy? Yes, because when you work hard, you can make things happen. For instance, you might get a job you always wanted. If you try your best, you can do whatever you want. But, you can't always get more done by being busy. Sometimes you might give up or be too tired. So, what do you think: do we get more done if we are always busy, or is there a reason to do nothing sometimes? In my essay, I talked about how being busy can help us get a lot done.

{"text_id": "C562DFE32C64", "output_essay": "Ralph Waldo Emerson was right when he said, \"If you don't try to do more than what you can already do, you won't grow.\" It's very important for everyone to try new things. This helps us grow, want new experiences, feel good about ourselves, and learn from life. Every time we try something new, we gain experience. This is key because learning from what happens can help us in the future. We might face the same things again, or we can help others with what we've learned. This idea is central to life. When we try, we learn from what happens. We often need to make choices, and it can be tough. But the best way to make a good choice is to keep trying. If you choose, you learn for the future. So, it's important to always try. If you mess up, you learn and grow from it. If people don't try, they might feel bad later. But not giving up and trying again is the best way to feel good. Even if it's tough, remember, we have no limits. Keep trying, no matter how many times. In the future, this could be the best thing you did.

{"text_id": "D3B7CFC1E4B8", "output_essay": "Why do some people think it's good to praise students' work to make them feel better about themselves, even if the work isn't their best? Some think that praise can boost self-esteem, while others say that praising poor work can hurt learning by making standards too low. Praising can help in ways like making students more sure of themselves and helping them think of new ideas.\n\nFirst, when people say nice things about your work, it makes you feel sure you can do anything. This makes you want to try harder because of the good things they said. Even if you didn't try your best, it's okay. You will want to do better to get more praise and show you've improved. Imagine doing a science project and thinking you didn't give enough information. You worry about not being liked or getting a bad grade. But when others start to like your project and say good things, you feel better and more sure of yourself. So for the next project, you work harder to not worry and to impress your classmates. When you feel sure, your work gets better and you don't feel so bad about it.\n\nAlso, when people cheer for you and say good things, it makes you feel good. You don't want to disappoint them, so you start to think of new, big ideas. You don't want bad feedback or to feel not smart enough. That's why it's good to praise work. It lets people come up with ideas. Remember when you had a new idea at a meeting? You shared it and people liked it, so they praised you. This made you feel good and think of even more ideas. Even if it wasn't your best idea, you still have a chance to make it better.\n\nBut not everyone agrees. Some say that if you don't tell the truth about someone's work, they won't learn to fix their mistakes. They think that if you say great job when it's not, people will think they don't need to try harder next time. They might work less because they got only good feedback and don't know what to improve. But if you point out the bad parts, they might feel bad and doubt themselves. Some might even stop trying because they think they can't do better. So when you work, think positive so you don't stress.\n\nThe real question is, why do some think it's bad to praise work that isn't the best? When people tell you that you did great, it makes you feel good, gives you the confidence to do anything, and shows you're smart and determined. The more praise you get, the more ideas you have to make your work better. Even those who want honesty would like praise on their work, even if it's not the best."}

But others say it's bad because giving out personal information to buy things can lead to theft. People who see technology as bad worry about information theft.

I think students should have their holidays in winter for three reasons. First, winter already has short breaks like Thanksgiving, which is 2-3 days, and Christmas, which is two weeks. Some students stay on vacation until January 6 for a family dinner. When they return, they have lots of work and are behind. There are also holidays like Presidents' Day. Second, winter weather causes many schools to close. It's cold and can be unsafe. There's a lot of snow, making driving risky, and it gets very cold, which can be harmful. Rain can freeze the roads, leading to accidents and even deaths. Third, it's tough for students to get back to work after breaks or school closures. They might not want to do anything. Teachers rush us because tests are coming, and we haven't learned everything. This rush makes students stressed. In conclusion, winter is the best time for a long break.

So, don't be lazy all the time. Think about your future, your health, and what you can do. So stand up and stay busy."}

Usually, only our parents know what's best for us, more than anyone else. So, not everyone is okay with talking to a stranger. But, talking to a counselor isn't always bad or good. We need them at times to share our feelings so they can help us choose well and fix our problems. Take Dezy Champion, an Ivorian singer, as an example. He left school because he wanted to sing. His dad kicked him out for wanting to sing, but he still trusted his gut. What if he had listened to his dad and stayed in school? Think about how different his life would be. Or if he had seen a counselor, they probably would have told him to stay in school and be something he didn't want to be. Always trust your gut and make your own choices, or ask a counselor or someone for help in deciding. Don't let others decide for you; it might mess up your life if you listen to them."}

Plus, there are after-school activities and clubs. With an extra hour, we wouldn't be able to attend them. School is important, but too much time there isn't good. We need time to sleep. You might wonder why sleep matters here. If we stay at school longer, kids won't have enough time to get home, do homework, eat dinner, ride bikes, or do other things. Also, if they make the school day longer, then summer and other breaks would need to be longer too. I think school should be shorter, not longer."}

If we make a bad choice, we understand that the trouble and the results are our own. People should make their own choices because by trusting ourselves, we can learn a lot about life.

{"text_id": "4A5FFF41E5E7", "output_essay": "There are many fun learning things to do in a play. The best and most fun thing is singing. Singing can make you feel more alive and happy. Sometimes singing helps you feel less stressed, and it can also give you new thoughts or suggestions.\n\nFirst, singing can make you feel more alive and happy because it makes you think of good times with someone. Singing is very powerful and can bring out strong feelings. For example, people cry when they hear a sad song because it makes them think of someone they miss or love. Singing can make you feel better and make your day better.\n\nThe second reason is that singing helps you feel less stressed because it helps you relax and stay calm. You can show your feelings or thoughts by singing. It also helps you think better when you are working hard.\n\nLastly, singing gives you new thoughts or suggestions. If you are not sure about a choice and someone tells you 'choose that,' listening to songs can help you think better and work faster. It can give you new and different thoughts.\n\nIn conclusion, singing is a fun learning activity that everyone can like. Anyone can do it and enjoy it. There are many fun learning things to do in a play, not just singing."}

For example, we can help poor people who don't have a home, can't buy food, or can't afford clothes. We can encourage others to help make these changes too. If one person can do it, others can as well. Many young people spend a lot of time on their phones or other gadgets. This makes them focus more on social media than on activities like sports or hanging out with friends. Studies show that using your phone too much is unhealthy. So, parents should limit their kids' phone time and suggest other activities. We can also lead by example by being loyal, responsible, and confident. This makes a good impression and can lead others in many ways. For instance, being loyal to your parents and showing them you can make your own choices. Or being on time for work shows you're responsible, which can encourage others to be punctual too. And if you believe in yourself, you can motivate others to believe in themselves too. All these actions can lead people to help others, make wise decisions, and have self-confidence."}

Research shows that 60% of schools in our area have seen worse SOL scores because students aren't getting enough sleep. \n\nKids can get tired quickly. If you make the school day one and a half hours longer, they'll have to get up earlier. Right now, we have eight hours of school and 11 hours to sleep. If you add one and a half hours, we would start school at 6 am. Many students won't like this. They won't feel rested and will be in a bad mood all day.

I believe that if older students could teach younger ones, they would learn how to run a class with little kids. This would give the high school students a chance to practice teaching. They would feel more at ease when they teach. It would also help older students remember how to teach; younger students would learn from them, and I think the older students would enjoy teaching the younger ones.\n\nI think older students would get good practice by watching a class and taking notes on what the teacher does. After watching, they could try teaching with the teacher's help. This way, when they become teachers, they won't be scared. It also gives teachers more time to make new lessons. The older student can learn how to plan lessons too, so they'll be ready to make their own in the future.\n\nI also think that helping in a class with younger students would show them what to teach. I know that when you're young and learn something, it sticks with you for a long time. So, if they start teaching early, they'll remember how to do it for years. They won't worry about planning lessons when they're older. They can start teaching without problems.\n\nI think that if an older student helps in a school with younger kids, it would help the little ones learn. They could find out why the older students want to teach and why they like working with kids. This would make the younger kids excited to come to school every day. They would have more fun because they're with people who are still in school. They would understand their lessons better too.\n\nHaving high school students teach would make school more fun for the little kids. Older students know what it's like to be in elementary and middle school. They know it can be hard and dull. If they teach, it won't be so boring. They would teach in a fun way. This would make the younger kids want to learn more.\n\nIn conclusion, I think this program would help many high school students follow their dreams. Both older and younger kids would like working together. The class would be easier for the teacher to manage. The students wouldn't dread going to school and working all day. So, I think it's a good idea to have a program that lets high school students help the younger ones."}

This can make them skip school. Not going to school can hurt their future. Still, some students enjoy school, even though it can be tough for them to attend. But why is it tough? Research tells us that 95% of students in FCPS skip school for reasons like these. Others just don't enjoy school or have problems with it. Some students find it hard to go to school, or they quit. But why do they quit? Here are some reasons: They get a job and stop caring about school. They don't enjoy some classes or people at school. They think a job is more important than school. These are why some students stop going to school or quit. But should students take classes from home online? I think it might help some students. But I don't believe it's the best idea for all. Why not? Technology is growing everywhere, and it's changing how students learn. But it can also distract them. For example, if a student is learning online at home and gets a message, they might want to reply. This can make them lose focus on their lesson. Learning this way can be good for some but not for others. There can be other distractions at home too. So, I don't think schools should only offer online learning. For instance, I can't concentrate on a lesson if my phone rings or lights up. I'm sure this is why schools shouldn't just teach online. It's not the best way to learn. In conclusion, students should try to go to school, even if it's hard to focus. We might not like everyone there, but that's not a reason to quit. Why? Because we all have a memory and need to use it well. I always say, 'I don't quit. If I fall seven times, I get up eight.' It's a tough journey, but we shouldn't give up. Teachers are there to help us. My main rule is, 'Don't give up.' We also have God to help us keep going. Schools, teachers, and students need to remember that home learning can be helpful.

Because they are enjoyable, exciting, and teach us things.\n\nFirst, sports are enjoyable because they take your mind off bad things that stress you out. When you play, you feel happy. Everyone needs fun in their life to not get bored. For instance, when you practice with your team, you have a good time. If you know someone who is bored, talk to them. Share a story to show them how to have fun.\n\nNext, sports are exciting because they make you feel good. Like when you play soccer and your team is winning, you feel great. Talk to others to have more fun. Make friends to share your life with. Enjoy yourself by doing things you like and by helping others when they need it. Remember to always try to be happy, not just for you but for others too.\n\nLastly, sports teach us things. When you play on a team, you learn to talk to others, think of ideas, and work together. For example, in a game, if you have the ball and don't know who to pass it to, you need to talk to your teammates. This is how you work as a team. Try hard and enjoy doing things well. Learning is key because it helps you in the future, like being polite to your coach or teammates.\n\nSports help you relax when you need it.

Students often have other things to do after school or they just hate the idea of staying longer. \n\nStudents are busy in the afternoon. They might go to sports practice or have to go to the hospital for an emergency. They usually have enough time in class to finish their work. If they are quick, they can finish early.

They think that students need to feel sure of themselves to learn. But some say that this kind of praise for poor work actually hurts learning because it makes standards lower. They say that real confidence comes from doing well. Confidence grows from praise because people need to believe in themselves to reach their goals, and it can make them brave enough to try new things.\n\nFirst, confidence grows from praise because people need to believe in themselves to reach their goals. Students keep trying, no matter how many problems they face. 'How do they keep going?' you might wonder. It's because they believe in themselves. This belief lets them face tough times without giving up, and many have done just that. Take 'Naruto' from a comic and TV show. Naruto, a ninja who wanted to be the leader, always believed in himself when he was young. He went to school to learn ninja skills and plans. He failed one test three times but didn't stop trying. A teacher told him to take a secret book with special ninja skills to practice. Naruto worked hard and faced danger, but he didn't give up. He learned a powerful skill and earned his ninja headband. Despite feeling sad and alone, he met his rival Sasuke, another ninja with his own tough goal. Naruto was jealous and worked hard every day. Sasuke noticed Naruto was getting better and felt threatened. Sasuke left to get stronger, and Naruto tried to bring him back but couldn't. In the end, Naruto became the leader, and Sasuke came back home. This story shows that believing in yourself can help you deal with competition, problems, and failures.\n\nAlso, confidence grows from praise because it makes you feel okay with trying hard things. Students get nervous about tests and don't want to fail. They study and try to remember what they need to know to get the answers right. But when they see a hard question, they get scared. They realize they need to believe in themselves. For example, a test is coming in two weeks, and it's important for their grade. Students study their math and just need to trust themselves. On test day, they're ready. They start the test with one hour to go. One student gets stuck but then remembers a rule that helps him. This shows how believing in yourself can make hard things less scary.\n\nHowever, some don't like the idea of confidence and praise. They think praising bad work makes learning worse by making it too easy, and that doing well is the real way to feel confident. They believe that you can't do well without confidence.\n\nIn the end, confidence comes from praise because people need to believe in themselves to reach their goals, and it can make them ready to face hard things."}

Doing nothing doesn't help at all. Why stay inside doing nothing when you can go outside, have fun, play games with your family, do sports with friends, and enjoy being outside? Second reason: imagine you have a family and you are very lazy. You don't want to work or help at home. Do you think your wife will stay with someone like that? No, she will probably want someone who works hard. And think about your kids. Will they look up to you or depend on you if you just sit all day and don't work? Imagine your kids have a career day at school and they can't talk about what you do because you don't work. So, being lazy is not good when you have a family with kids."}

Why do I feel this way? It's because you are the one who has to live with the results, not the people you asked for help. You don't need others to tell you how to live your life. It's yours after all.\n\nI have a few reasons why I believe it's better to make your own choices. If you ask others for help and it doesn't work out, you will blame them. But if you listen to your own feelings, you will learn from your mistakes. You will grow on your own. You are the one who should choose how to live your life.\n\nMaking mistakes is part of life. When one chance goes away, another one comes. We were all born alone, so we should make our choices alone. It's not bad to ask for advice. But it might not always help. It's better to trust your own feelings. Even if things go wrong, you will get back up and not regret it. Don't be scared to take chances and make mistakes. Things will probably turn out well.\n\nIt's better to trust your own ideas and feelings than someone else's. Everyone is different. We all have our own thoughts and views.

You should always try new things that make you uncomfortable, and you can learn anything if you decide to. Use what worked for you before to learn something new. Always believe that you can learn it and do it any time.\n\nFirst, I always try new and uncomfortable things to learn something. I went skydiving to learn how to play the clarinet better. It took time to learn the clarinet, but riding roller coasters and playing other instruments helped me a lot. Trying new things helped me a lot. I learned how to play the clarinet well after doing all those new things. I became a good player after facing those fears, and even though I was very scared, it helped me grow.\n\nAlso, use what has worked for you before to reach your goal. If you try those things, they can help; if you quit, you'll never win. Keep trying until you can do it. Try even scarier things than what you want to learn. I did everything I could to learn. Once you decide to do it, you'll do it and be better than others.\n\nLastly, my grandfather always said, \"Sweetie, believe in what you want to learn and believe in yourself because, sweetie, you can do anything you want!\" I always told myself, Generic_Name, you can do it; you're not a failure, and you won't quit. Learning something shouldn't be your only focus, but you can do it on your own. You can be the best at that one thing. I tried very hard to learn my goal, and I did it and became the best clarinet player ever.\n\nIn conclusion, I think you should try things that are harder than what you want to learn. You won't get better or win if you don't decide to. Doing all those scary things helped me a lot, and I think others should try them too. And remember, without belief in yourself, you'll never reach the things you want to learn. Never quit and always do your best to win and be the best. Don't give up and learn whatever you want to learn."}

Being able to picture something in your mind is powerful. It is also powerful to become the person you want to be. Imagination lets you feel and see things in your mind without anyone stopping you. You can even picture yourself with someone you like, and no one can stop you. Everyone has dreams. Imagination can make your dreams bigger. It can also make your knowledge bigger. Seeing yourself where you want to be is powerful. If you get angry easily, imagination can help you. But remember, not everyone can imagine well, and not everyone knows a lot. Imagination is very important. Sometimes I picture myself as a police officer making a lot of money. When I do this, I feel good about myself. But I also know that to get what I want, I must use my knowledge and deal with what others know. Then I can achieve my dream. But you need imagination first to create your dreams. Then you need good knowledge to make them real. It may sound silly, but loving yourself and picturing yourself doing what you want is a great feeling. I am a girl who gets angry easily, but I have learned to control it. Before, I would break things like my phone or TV when my mom yelled at me. My mom told my favorite teacher about this. My teacher told me to picture myself as a single mom working hard to take care of my child. Since then, I haven't broken anything else. You might wonder how imagination has helped me grow. One day, I was daydreaming about asking my crush out. I fell asleep and dreamed about us together. The next day, I told my friends, and they encouraged me to ask him out. He said yes, and we had lunch together. My imagination made this happen. Now, I love to imagine everything. If a friend tells me a story, I picture it in my mind. Being able to imagine is the greatest knowledge. I enjoy imagining so much that I am happy to write this essay. I think people who get angry easily, or who don't feel good about themselves, should try what I do. And those who love to dream probably already picture their future."}

They need this time to relax and see friends. If the winter break was longer, it would be too cold to enjoy time outside with family. School should not go on all year without breaks. \n\nStudents need rest from school. If they had to go to school every day, all year, they would be too tired. They have a lot of homework, quizzes, and tests. They also have to prepare for big exams like the SOL or midterms. Some students stay up very late to finish homework or study. This is not healthy. Your brain needs to rest sometimes. Not sleeping enough can make it hard to think at school. \n\nMany students join clubs after school. For example, football players practice every day after school until it is dark. On Fridays, they get ready for their game, which many students watch. Sports clubs often mean students stay late after school. This makes it hard for them to do all their homework. A school year without a long break would be tough for these students. \n\nIn conclusion, students would not like school all year. They need breaks. Most would rather have a longer summer break than a longer winter break. People usually want to be with family in the winter and with friends in the summer. Spring break should also be longer so everyone can enjoy that time. Students need their rest, and an all-year school would not allow for that."}

It feels great when you influence others by being yourself and doing the right things, supporting them.\n\nYou can touch the lives of many by being a good example in the community. If you do kind acts, help people, and put their needs before your own, you show that you can make a difference. You just need to try. This is very true if kids or teenagers see what you do. They might want to be like you when they grow up, or even start now. For instance, Arnold S., the bodybuilder, had a big impact on me as a kid. I admired his work and his talks. I wanted to be like him.\n\nYou can affect others in many ways, whether you're an athlete, chef, business person, or just someone who does nice things and looks after others. But you must act well to have an impact. If you looked up to someone as a child and you become like them, you can deeply affect others too.\n\nThis is very true for parents. They should act well so their kids will copy them. I believe that what you do, your kids will likely do too. They might even choose your job. Being a good parent can teach your kids to be positive and kind. You can show others how to raise their kids too.\n\nIt's very important to be a good influence, not a bad one. There are bad influences out there. Someone who uses drugs, drinks, or smokes can affect people, especially teens. I'm sure all these bad examples can sway teens the most. For example, my dad stopped smoking 8 years ago. He saw many teens smoking in my country. He didn't want me to smoke or think it was okay because he did it.\n\nHaving a good influence on someone is wonderful. You can be anyone and do good things; you will likely affect someone. This advice is key for parents. We'll all be parents someday, and the sooner we learn this, the better for our kids and us.\n\nThe world will become better when we show the power of kindness and our actions."}

We need to help kids understand their choices and be smart about them. If not, they might miss out on other chances they had.\n\nWe don't think about it much, but we should learn more while we can. Knowing what our future jobs need can help us decide if they're right for us. If not, then find a job you love. It's okay to change your mind and try something new.\n\nSee if you can learn or try out a job. Movies and TV shows might not show the truth. Talk to someone in the job you like and learn from them. You might see what the work is really like, who you'll work with, and what you'll do. Then you can decide if that job is good for you.\n\nIf things don't go as planned, having a backup can help. If you're scared of failing or not getting what you want, have a second or third choice. That way, you can try other jobs you like. Planning helps, but only if you're ready for it. If not, you might end up in a job you can't handle.\n\nWe're all busy and might not know what we want to do. It takes time to decide, sometimes longer than we think.

For example, bullying happens a lot online, to kids and adults of all ages. The internet should not be used for bad things. However, technology can help those who left school and want to return. It can help people who move to the United States and need to learn English. I believe technology has good effects on our lives; it lets us do many things without leaving home. We know technology can be used in many ways; we just need to use it right.\n\nWe also use technology to fill out work forms or to look for jobs online. Many places ask you to apply online because it's easier than on paper. I went to a restaurant named The Blackwall Hitch to find a job, and they told me to apply online. But sometimes you still need to fill out some forms. At school, to join the cheerleading team or try out for soccer, you must sign up online. Some teachers give us homework online, and we study on our phones. For some students, this is hard, but for others, like me, it's easy. I like to study on my phone because I can take practice tests and feel ready for the real test. I find it hard to remember things when I study from paper. But some people prefer paper because they get distracted by messages on their phones and can't focus with music playing.\n\nAlso, some people like to read on their phones, computers, or tablets instead of books. Many prefer their devices because they are lighter and have all the information they need. Some stay home to read instead of going to the library because they can get books online. My cousin reads on her tablet because she often forgets to return library books and doesn't want to pay if she loses them. Older people might find it hard to read online because they are used to going to the library and reading newspapers. But we can teach them to use new technology. I help my grandma read online.\n\nMoreover, taking online classes is an option for those who left school and want to return but need to work. Some students didn't know they needed a class until their last year and their schedule is full. They can take the class online instead of coming back next year for just one class. My friend, Generic_Name, didn't get the right classes since 9th grade. Now, in 12th grade, she needs one more class to graduate. Her counselor let her take it online. Others leave school to work, maybe because they have a baby. Years later, they realize they need to go back to school for a better job. I have a friend who left school because she was pregnant. She needs to work to support her baby but also wants to go back to school. She found out she could take classes online before work.\n\nIn short, technology has made many good things better for us. It helps with work forms, homework, and studying online. It's good for people who don't like carrying books and prefer devices. It helps those who left school and want to return but must work, by letting them study online. Technology is great, but it can be bad, like with bullying. It helps us in many ways; we just need to use it wisely and be responsible online."}

Working with others can lead to arguments and confusion. But I think it's better than working alone. \n\nWhen you work with others, you get many ideas. Sometimes you might be stuck, and you need help. Your friends can push you to work or make you feel better with new ideas. You might not think of something on your own. That's when you need others. The more people you have, the more ideas you get. \n\nIn a group, you see things from different points of view. It could be wrong or right. For example, in a project about ethics, we were six people from different places. Some said stealing is okay, others said it's not. It depends on the situation. If your family is hungry, you might steal food for them. But others said stealing is always bad. They learned this from their family or religion. The Ten Commandments say not to steal. Different views in a group can help you a lot. \n\nWorking alone can be good sometimes. But groups can end up fighting or not liking each other. Alone, you don't have to worry about others saying you're wrong, only your teacher. It's less stressful than hearing many answers at once. You can share your own ideas without being judged.

Once, my Spanish teacher gave us a lot of work. My friends and I split it up. We finished fast, while others were still on the first page. At home, my mom takes a long time to cook. If I'm not busy, I help her. We finish cooking sooner. \n\nIn a group, you always learn something new from someone. Last year, we had to talk about a classmate in front of everyone.

To get people to like this idea, I need to get the school board to agree. I think it's a good thing for everyone. The board needs to plan this for the school. We need people's help to do this. The school board is a good thing. They make sure everything is done right. Teachers from other countries help the school board. This is great for the board.

Being independent means you can solve problems, think of new solutions, and always try to be positive and better. Some people say you should decide for yourself or get advice from experts if you're unsure about life. The most important thing is love from family, friends, and God. Live like you have forever, but pray like it's your last day. Be happy and do your best. Be unique and make a difference. For many, the best thought is to 'work to live, not live to work' because time with loved ones is important. Things are not as important as love. Make your own choices, but think first.

This means they will have less homework and can have fun or rest after school. Also, teachers will get more time to teach their students what they need to learn. This will help students understand their work better. For instance, I often feel there is not enough time during class. With many students, the teacher can't always help me learn.

Schools work with companies to let students try out jobs through internships. This helps them see if they like that kind of work. A boss has to choose you to visit their company. I want to visit some companies to pick my future job, get more experience, and learn about the workplace.\n\nOne good thing about visiting companies is to pick my future job. Students should pick a job before finishing school so they don't waste time later. My teachers say we need to have a goal in school. If we know our goal, we can start working towards it. My uncle didn't know what job he wanted after high school. He lost a year trying to figure it out. I want to visit your company to start on my path. I heard about McDeens, a company that shut down because their workers left and no one else wanted those jobs. Students are your future workers. Let us visit and see if we like the job.\n\nAnother reason to visit your company is to get more experience. Companies want workers who know what they're doing. At my job, a student with no skills didn't get hired. No company wants someone without experience. My parents say all jobs need it. Without experience, a student won't find work later. We don't want students to finish school and have no job. If that happens, fewer people will want to go to school. Let us visit companies to learn and get experience. This will help us get better jobs later. If we want our country to stay strong, students need to learn. Then we can work for big companies. Let us learn at your company to keep America great.\n\nThe third reason to visit is to learn how to act at work. New students at my job don't know what to do. If we visit your company, we'll learn the right way to behave. Then, we won't get fired for acting wrong. All jobs want workers who are positive and act like they're part of a family. We need to visit companies to learn this.\n\nIn conclusion, bosses should let students visit their companies. This helps us learn about jobs we're interested in, show we can be positive at work, and learn more about the job. Every company wants their country to be the best."}

You will keep getting better and become excellent in every way. It's also fun to face challenges. \n\nFirst, you can be good at anything if you try hard. Be ready, try your best, and put yourself first. Be careful and confident. It always helps. Don't let others think you can't be good at things you're already good at. Be in charge of your plans. Try to be good at it in a new way; if you've done it once, you can do it again. \n\nSecond, you will grow no matter what happens. If you don't succeed, it just makes you a better person. So, Emerson's words are just one idea. Everyone has their own path. For instance, 'Generic_Name' and 'Generic_Name' did well on a math test. They passed but wanted to try again. They failed because they didn't study afterward. They failed because they didn't study, not because they can't be good at it again. \n\nThird, it's good to make smart choices. Doing more than what you're good at doesn't always mean you'll grow. You'll grow no matter what. It just helps you do better and be good at it in other ways. That's why you should never quit, no matter what a famous writer says. \n\nThat's why I don't agree with Ralph Waldo Emerson. Even if you haven't been good at something, you will be in the future.

Ralph Waldo Emerson once said, 'Unless you try to do something beyond what you have mastered, you will never grow.' Staying in your comfort zone can be limiting; you might miss out on learning new skills. Not trying new things can make life dull. You might not fully enjoy what life has to offer. To enjoy life more, try new things and make it more exciting. If you're already good at something, why try something else? Trying new things might not always lead to success. It could end in failure. But trying again and learning new things takes time and effort. It's worth it, though. Get out of your comfort zone and learn new skills. In high school, I only did what I was good at. This made my life hard because I didn't try new things. Then someone told me to stop being afraid and try something new. I listened, and it was the best decision I ever made. I tried new things, met new people, and learned new skills. I broke free from my old limits. Michael Jordan, a great basketball player, was once afraid to play because he thought he wasn't good enough. But his mom encouraged him to try out for the team. He did, and now he's famous for his basketball skills. Are you bored with life? Try new things and make it more exciting. I used to avoid new experiences. But then I realized my life was dull. I decided to change and try new things. I started playing soccer. I wasn't good at first, but with practice, I improved and joined the team. Soccer helped me grow as a person. Barack Obama, a former US president, said that doing the same old things won't help you grow. 'How will you know what you're capable of if you don't try new things?' he asked. He advised us to try new things and find what we've been missing. To get more from life and grow, try new things. I used to be boring because I didn't try new things. I thought it was a waste of time and effort. But I was wrong. I decided to grow and find new things to do. This helped me find my place in life. It wasn't easy, but it was worth it. My best friend never tried new things. He was afraid of change, like many people. But I convinced him to try. He faced failure at first, but with practice, he got better. Eventually, he succeeded and was happy with his choice. Trying new things can be scary. You might fail. But not trying is just an excuse. It's not a waste of time or effort. It's a chance to learn and grow. Even if you're good at something, you should still try new things. Otherwise, you'll never grow. You might discover new opportunities. In conclusion, make life easier for yourself. Break out of your comfort zone and learn new skills. Don't let life be dull. Try new things and grow. Find a better version of yourself. Many people have tried new things and succeeded. They're proud of themselves, and you will be too."}
{"text_id": "71E7AE98D33A", "output_essay": "Asking students to choose a career before they start high school is a bad idea and can lead to failure. I don't agree with this because of their age, how they grow, and what influences them. Age: Studies show that high school students are just starting to mature. Experts say these students often make poor choices because their brains are not fully grown. They are still kids and can't make big life choices or plan for their future. For example, when I was young, I wanted to work for my favorite cereal brand. But as I got older, I changed my mind because I was growing up. Growth: Students' brains are still growing. As they get older, their ideas and dreams change. They start to see the world differently and think more realistically. They might not want the same career they thought they did when they were younger. But if they have to pick a career before high school, they might be stuck with a choice they no longer like. For instance, a kid named Generic_Name wanted to work for a cereal company. But as he got older, he liked carpentry more. Now he can't be a carpenter because he already picked the cereal company, and the school says he has to stick with it. Influence: There's a saying that if you grow up in the sky, you learn to fly. Kids copy what they see around them. If they live where everyone wants to be a doctor, they might want to be doctors too. When I was young, all my friends and I rode bikes. We wanted to be bike pros. But as we got older, we found other interests. Telling young students to pick a career is like telling a small toad to become a frog right away. It can't happen because the toad needs to grow first. Students also need time to grow and find out what they really want to do. Research shows that only 3 out of 10 students know what career they want before high school. The rest are still unsure. So, I think it's wrong for society to expect students to choose a career by the time they reach high school."}

{"text_id": "9D9292F7D513", "output_essay": "Education is important for success. It requires hard work, love for what you do, and a goal to chase. But with every goal, you need a break—a break to relax and recharge. Schools have been around for years, and many rules have changed to help students and society. But one thing that hasn't changed is the length of summer breaks and how happy they make students. Students should have longer summer breaks. This gives them time to rest their minds, do activities outside of school, and spend more time with family and friends. Doctors say that our brains need rest. Without it, we can get stressed, sad, and can't focus well. When school starts each year, students look forward to summer. But as studies get tougher with new technology, some people think we should have shorter summers and more breaks during other seasons. I think this could make students lose focus and limit their thinking. People work hard for their dreams, but too much work can be harmful. Long summer breaks let students do what they love and get better at their hobbies. Kids also need to learn about social and religious things, and summer breaks give them time for this. Many schools have summer classes for extra credits. These classes need two months. So, long summer breaks are good for students to do well in school. Everyone has duties, like jobs or school, and there's little time for family. But relationships need time. Schools keep kids busy, but now it's too much. Students can't even have dinner with their families. This can lead to problems like bad family relationships and no fun. Long summer breaks can help plan family trips and give time to talk and bond. Teachers say that students who spend time with their families are more involved and open-minded. Too much of anything, even school, can make us dislike it. Education helps us fit into a society that values learning and thinking. But we also need to stay healthy and spend time with our families. I think the school board should keep the long summer breaks as they are. They help many people and let students do their best in life and enjoy other activities. A long summer break each year lets students plan more things, have quality family time, and focus on their studies too."}

This way, you will get something done. Sometimes, you might not get anything back from what you do. For example, you might feel happy just by doing a good deed, even if you don't get a reward at the end of the day. \n\nThomas Jefferson worked hard. That's why people remember what he did for them. What if you do nothing? Take Edward Jenner, the man who found the cowpox vaccine. He mixed cowpox with human cowpox and saved many lives. Even small actions count as achievements. Doing nothing is only okay when you can't do anything at all. But it's always best to try your hardest. People don't respect those who do nothing. \n\nI think if you ask someone who writes quotes if the quote is from their own life, they would say yes. Thomas wrote his quote because he had to choose between being busy or doing nothing. He chose to be busy. \n\nHe even wrote a quote about it.

If you do something and succeed, you'll regret the times you did nothing. \n\nI believe you need achievements for a future. Work hard now and you won't have regrets later.

Thomas didn't like doing nothing because he used to do nothing. Then he saw it didn't work for him. \n\nYou can encourage others to be busy too. It's like a chain reaction. Think about Thomas Jefferson's words and you'll change. It's always better to be doing something. I would start from the beginning and look for a good job. You can't get a job by sitting around. Many people live at home with no job or education. School is there so kids can learn to work when they grow up. Even if you have a disability, you need to achieve something. Kids and teens should go to school and learn. \n\nIn the end, many kids do nothing because of personal problems or their situation. They need to start working, even if it's just homework.

{"text_id": "2EA88D8BFE85", "output_essay": "Let's be clear, can you reach a goal without working for it? Most people believe you get what you work for. For example, if we work hard for our goals, we will gain experience, grow up, and learn how reaching goals can make us more successful in life. \n\nI know most people just want to take it easy and do nothing. That's fine, but if you do nothing all the time, you won't gain experiences that could help you later. But if you do things, big or small, you could learn things that help you when life gets tough. For example, I learned first aid last year, and one day I saw a car crash. I helped the injured person because of what I learned. What if I didn't know first aid then? This taught me that small actions can make a big difference. \n\nBy doing simple things, you grow up. Most people say if you do a lot, your brain grows and you understand better than those who do nothing. For example, compare two people to see who handles simple problems better. The one who is always busy will handle problems better. I believe that the more you do, the more you grow up. \n\nThird, being busy helps us succeed in life. It's true that the busier you are, the more you learn, and the smarter you get. If you're not busy, you won't learn as much as someone who is. You'll find things hard if you haven't learned or done much. But busy people will find things easier and won't struggle. So, I suggest you keep busy with things that will make you proud when you finish them. \n\nIn conclusion, doing nothing can be nice because you relax and do what you want. But it's not as good as being busy, which leads to success, growing up, and gaining experience. These three things can change your life. Doing nothing won't help you achieve anything big, unlike someone who is always busy, learning, and improving their life."}
{"text_id": "2BEFF32D3886", "output_essay": "Have you ever been bored or sad with nothing to do? Have you thought about going to a park? I think it's good to play outside for these reasons. You can hang out with family and friends and have fun, take a break from hard work and relax, and keep from getting bored by enjoying life. You can be outside instead of playing on your phone, tablet, or computer at home.\n\nMy first reason is that you can hang out with family and friends. Many times when I'm sad, my friends invite me to play basketball at the park, and I feel better. We shoot hoops and have fun. We play two on two, or if more friends join, we play five on five. After playing, I forget why I was sad and leave happy. Next time, I'll ask my friends to go out, and I know they'll say yes because they like to hang out. When my family visits and my cousin and I get bored of video games or movies, we ask to go outside. We go to the park, play basketball, and swing. We have so much fun that we don't notice the time. Once, we stayed out for 6 hours and came home around 8 or 9 PM.\n\nMy second reason is you get a break from work and time to relax. How often do you come home from school tired from work? I've come home stressed many times. Then, I go play basketball at the park to relax and forget the stress. I shoot hoops, practice, take it easy, and have fun. After that, I go home feeling better. Taking that break helps me a lot. Now, I go to school in a good mood, work hard, and then relax again.\n\nMy last reason is to enjoy life when you're bored. On a Friday after school, if I've finished my homework and it's still sunny, I don't want to be on my phone or computer. I go outside to play and enjoy life. I play soccer or basketball with others. I used to be on my phone a lot. Then, I learned about basketball at school. I wasn't good, but I practiced instead of using my phone. Now, I'm picked first when we play at school. People ask how I got so good, and I say I practiced instead of being on my phone. Now, I get texts to play basketball or soccer at the park. We don't use our phones there, except for music. We're not bored outside, and we have a good time.\n\nAs you can see, these are reasons why I think going outside and having fun is a good idea. You can hang out with loved ones, take a break from work, and relax. Instead of being bored at home on your phone or computer, you can enjoy life outside. So, if you're ever bored and you and your friends have nothing to do, don't waste time on your phones or playing video games. Go outside and have some fun."}
{"text_id": "9812A74D74C4", "output_essay": "Students say that picking a career early is good. Many have a dream job in mind and are ready to think about their future work. By age fifteen or more, they start to grow up as they take on more duties. Students from sixteen to eighteen can work part-time and deal with adult-like tasks. As America's future, it is good for students to start planning for a career and pick classes that will help them get the job they want.\n\nFirst, students should pick classes that help them reach their job goals. For example, some want to be in the military and must take certain classes to join. Generic_Name wanted to be in the Air Force, so he made sure to take the class he needed to be eligible. If he hadn't taken this class, he couldn't have joined the Air Force. So, it's smart to choose a career early.\n\nSecond, students should know what job they want before starting high school. Middle schools show them different jobs they could do. For example, Generic_Name went to Generic_School and learned about many jobs. When she went to Generic_High School, she picked JROTC to learn about the military or to prepare to join. Now she knows about different military jobs. It's good to know about many jobs.\n\nStudents are America's future, and they should pick a career and classes that help them get the job they want. Young students look up to firefighters, soldiers, and doctors. Most students close to finishing school have chosen a career. For example, those who want to be police officers do better when they have a clear job goal. Thinking about a job early is not bad; it shows they want to follow their dreams.\n\nSome places expect students to know what job they want when they start high school. They have done experiments, learned about space, and heard about jobs from teachers. But, many students feel they can't follow a career. Some worry about bad grades or not having enough drive. So, it's important for students to pick a career path and believe they can reach their goals."}
{"text_id": "956FB6386B52", "output_essay": "Many students think it's good to work alone, but I believe working in a group is better for most. These days, jobs need people who can work as a team. They want to make things that can do well against others, and this needs teamwork. In life, we often have to work with others. Being in a group helps you grow your own skills, make friends, and work faster. \n\nBeing in a group is a great way to get better at things. When people work together, they make the best work. Everyone is good at something different. In a group, you can pick what you're good at. You can work on what you like and learn from others at the same time. \n\nWhen more people join, you might find someone who likes what you like. This is how you make friends. It's hard to make friends if you don't talk to them. Group work lets you talk and get to know others. They can help you in class or with other things. I made friends in after-school activities too. We only spent a few hours together, but we became close. \n\nA group can finish work faster. Think about a Broadway show. It's not just about the actors. Many people work to make it happen. No one can do it alone. Even a small costume needs many people. One person could do it, but it would take much longer. With a good group, you get more ideas and help. \n\nTeamwork doesn't always make everything perfect, but it helps a lot. Teamwork is needed in life. Learn from your team and get better with each project. Don't let a small fight stop you from working in a group. It's worth trying. You might make good friends. Plus, when everyone works on a problem, it gets solved faster."}
{"text_id": "A3A0C0D9CE51", "output_essay": "After reading about Albert Schweitzer's view that being a role model is the only way to influence others, I strongly agree. Some people learn by watching others. For instance, I got an A on my test and then my little brother worked hard to get an A too. This shows what Albert Schweitzer meant when he said, 'Example is not the main thing in influencing others; it is the only thing.' I also think that you don't need to try to be a role model to influence someone. Sometimes, just doing your best or doing something good can inspire others without you knowing. When I got an A, I wasn't thinking about my brother. I just wanted to do well and get an A. Also, I think being a good role model makes others want to be like you. I believe being a positive influence can lead to success, which makes you happy. Being a positive influence shows you are mature because you make smart choices. It makes others want to be your friend because they see you are making good choices and it helps them do well in life. A good influence can make people respect you. For example, Oprah has a big impact on women. She was the first African American woman to become a millionaire, which made people respect her. Another example is Frederick Douglass. He had a big impact on African Americans in the late 1800s. He was one of the first to read and write and to have an important job. As I said, I strongly agree with Albert Schweitzer. This is an important topic because being a good role model is the best way to influence others. In the end, I hope to be a good role model for myself or my kids. I want to be a great influence like Oprah, Frederick Douglass, and others."}

First, students will do better if they stay to learn more after school. Second, they will work on subjects they find hard. Third, they will get their homework done on time. \n\nMy first point is that students will do better by learning new things after school. They will get to know more. This is good because they will spend more time on schoolwork. It's better for them to study than to do things that don't help them in life. \n\nMy second point is that students will work on hard subjects. They will understand these subjects better over time. They will also use their time well, just like they should in school. \n\nMy third point is that students will get their homework done on time. They will do it at school, not at home. This means they won't worry about homework at home. They will have more free time at home. Teachers will be there to help them, too. \n\nIn conclusion, schools should have a homework club after school. It helps students finish homework early. It gives them more time to practice. It helps them use their time better."}

We need more people who are ready to shape the future, not those who delay. Jefferson also mentioned how amazing it is what we can do if we keep busy. Picture a world where everyone is active. Imagine finding a way to stop aging, ending hunger in poor countries, and discovering if we're alone in space. But let's focus on what has happened and what's happening now. Our society has made progress. We used to build with our hands, but now we use machines. Henry Ford, who started his own car company, wanted to make a difference. He worked hard to reach his goals. We need more people like him and Jefferson. We need kids to grow up to be leaders and innovators. We should push them to be active because they are our future. I want to share my own motivation. I aim to prove wrong those who doubted me. I want to show that race doesn't limit success. Just like Martin Luther King Jr. showed determination in improving America, race doesn't define us. Over time, many tried to change the world but failed because they quit. Determined people are special because they don't stop; they have a reason to make a difference. I want to change how people think. I want to motivate everyone to be active and not delay their goals. It's tough to stay focused, but anyone can do it. It might take a long time to get there. But when you achieve what you've worked for, it feels amazing. Like Jefferson said, never be lazy and keep doing. We've done a lot, but there's more to do.

For those who trust themselves, choosing for themselves is important.\n\nMany people are scared to show who they are because they worry others will judge them. All over the world, there are many kinds of people who hide who they are. This is because they don't feel enough support to do well. I think it's important for people to trust in their ability to rely on themselves.\n\nAt times, we will be judged for who we are, even for how we speak or walk. Many people who don't love themselves try to copy others just to fit in. For instance, many Latinos in the United States might feel judged by those who don't trust in themselves.

They might have brothers or sisters who bother them and don't let them work, or they might not feel like doing homework at home. Also, students might not want to work at home because no one is there to encourage them.\n\nAnother reason I think an after-school homework club is a great idea is that some students are having a hard time in certain subjects and don't understand the material. They can get extra help after school from teachers or other students. I believe students learn better when someone is there to guide them. It's also good because students can be around others who want to do well, and that can inspire them to work hard!\n\nFinally, I think it can be a fun idea because students can talk to each other after they finish their work.

{"text_id": "0E06044E2717", "output_essay": "Many times, some people don't want to do their work, even though they know they should work every day to be successful. Most of them push themselves to succeed. But there are some who don't do what they must. This could be about school, a job, or chores at home. I think life would be easier for those who often skip their work if they just got up and tried to do tasks instead of being lazy. First, think of a person who knows and can do a lot but doesn't act and is not responsible. Next, think of someone not as smart but who works hard. Can the hard worker be more successful than the smart but lazy person? Yes, because success isn't just about being smart. It's about handling responsibility and doing what you should do. Also, working every day and in a smart way helps people do more. This is the real key. A sad person is a good example for this topic. Depression is a serious problem that can change how you live. It makes you feel very tired, hopeless, and not want to do anything, like getting out of bed or doing things you usually like. It can also cause sleep and eating problems. These issues can lead to failure and more stress. A sad person might look lazy, but they often can't help feeling so tired. Their sadness makes them not act, and it becomes a cycle. So, sad people often don't do what they need to, even if they want to. When they're stuck in this cycle, they don't see that they're failing. I understand this because I've been sad too. Can someone get things done without doing them often? Yes, but it won't be the same. For instance, a student needs to do homework and classwork on time to get good grades. If the student didn't study or do homework for a year, it wouldn't be as good as studying every day. He might still graduate, but he would miss out on a lot. Who wouldn't want to go to a better college or get a better job? So, people should try to do what they can to reach their goals first. It's okay to fail after trying your best. In my view, one of the most important things is to do things step by step. This shows how you can get better little by little. For example, saving coins every day can add up to a lot of money. Step by step, you could learn a new language in a year by practicing every day. There are many examples like this, but people need to understand how important it is to do something every day. Some people can't even do that. In the end, people might get somewhere by not acting; however, it doesn't mean they should ignore how much more they could do by being active."}

Life is like a soccer game; we need to score to win. Teachers correct us to help us improve and learn. We shouldn't be upset when teachers correct us. They are getting us ready for the future.\n\nWorking alone is good for students. They can focus, learn, and work without getting distracted or talking to friends.\n\nBut, when students work in groups, they might not learn well. They often play, listen to music, chat, text, and let one person do all the work.\n\nIf students in a group take their work seriously, they can decide who will find information, who will make pictures, and who will talk to the class.\n\nWorking alone is better because we can focus and don't need to depend on others. If a group doesn't work, everyone could fail. It's safer to do your own work. During a test, you can't ask your group for answers. Working alone helps us avoid distractions like chatting, texting, and playing. It also prepares us for college, where we'll work on our own. Teachers will trust us more.\n\nWorking alone helps us be independent. We choose what to write and draw. We can also help others, which helps us learn more. At the end of the school year, high school students take a big test called an SOL. You can't do it in a group. If you don't study, you might fail. You must study hard and take the SOL alone. If you fail, the teacher can help you do better. Study hard, and you could get a great diploma and represent your school in other places.\n\nWorking in a group can be bad for learning. People just sit, talk, text, eat, and play. They let one person do everything. This isn't fair. We need to be independent. If we always work in groups, we might fail tests. If someone from the state comes to check on us, they look at each student alone, not in groups. If we don't study, we might fail tests. In groups, people often don't take work seriously and act childish. That's why teachers don't let us sit with friends. We talk too much and distract others. We should act responsibly. Other kids want the chances we have. They can't get them because they're poor or their schools aren't as good. But they wish for a career. We should listen to our teachers. They might let us work in groups if we behave.\n\nEven in a group, if we're organized and serious, we can divide the work. One can research, another can draw and write neatly, and another can present to the class. But if someone doesn't do their part, they should get a zero. We must behave to convince the teacher to let us work together. Many heads can be better than one, but we must do our part and study what the teacher assigns.\n\nIn conclusion, working alone is better for our future. We learn and prepare for things like a career or college. We must be independent and do our work. We can't always depend on a group. What if we lose them? We'd be lost because we're used to others doing our work. We need to be ready for the future. Then, we can teach our children because we know the subjects. Studying alone can make you a great and respected person in school or other places."}
{"text_id": "3867639DFCE4", "output_essay": "Has someone ever made you feel good about yourself by saying well done for your work or that you deserve your success? It's always nice to know you've done well or even great at something. Success helps build self-esteem because it rewards your hard work, makes you want to do more, and keeps you feeling sure of yourself. These points show how success can lead to better self-esteem.\n\nSome people think that success is the key to self-esteem, but saying nice things to someone is also a powerful way to make them feel good about themselves. Compliments can start building confidence early on, encourage people to keep trying, and make them feel happy. Even if someone didn't do as well as hoped, they shouldn't be ignored. A little confidence might be just what they need to improve or to keep giving their best. If no one thanks you or seems to care about your work, you might lose interest and stop doing it. Starting to compliment someone when they are young can prepare them for life. Studies show that 82% of kids who got compliments in elementary school grew up to be successful in their jobs. Everyone needs a little help, and compliments are that help to do better and keep enjoying what you do. So, compliments might be what you need before you start succeeding.\n\nAfter a big success, your wish to do more is what drives you to achieve even more. Many articles say that this wish to do more comes from success and helps build self-esteem. Other research shows that about 78% of kids who want to succeed are more driven than those who don't. Thinking that you will do well in a task can motivate you to try harder and do better than others. This thought alone can give you the push that many people today don't have. The drive to do more can help you in all parts of life, like work, family, or hobbies. If you plan ahead, you won't feel rushed or stressed.\n\nSome people see success as a reward for their hard work, which helps them feel better about themselves. Working hard and then finding out you did great is one of the best things you can hear. When you give your time and effort, it usually means it's important, so you try your best. Studies found that up to 97% of people who worked hard and stayed focused were happy with their success and felt better about themselves. Sometimes, all you need is to be told you did well and that it was all thanks to you. If this keeps happening, your self-esteem will get much better as you keep doing well. Everyone likes to be rewarded or recognized for their hard work.\n\nBeing sure of yourself is important for self-esteem. Being confident during a project is essential, and it's one of the reasons you do well and succeed. Middle school students were asked if they thought they would do well on their tests. The survey showed that 3 out of 5 students believed they would pass this year. They stayed positive and when the test results came, about 85% of those confident students passed. Sometimes, believing in yourself is all you need, even if no one else is there to help. If you tell yourself you can do it, that's the support you need. Confidence in your studies and the time you put in will help you succeed.\n\nIn conclusion, it's always nice to hear that you've done well or great at something. Success builds self-esteem because it rewards your hard work, makes you want to do more, and keeps you feeling sure of yourself. These points show how success can lead to better self-esteem. We can help people with low self-esteem by taking a few seconds to say well done and that they did great."}

These videos can hurt others because people watch them for fun without thinking about the person in the video. Nowadays, most people don't look for books in libraries because they can find any book online. This is bad for the brain because it doesn't get new information.

But when we have energy, we can do many things or even big tasks. Doing nothing will not help you reach your goals. It will only stop you and is useless; it won't get you to where you want to go. For example, if you want to keep studying, you need to do many things to make it happen. If you don't try hard, you won't succeed. Finishing what you plan to do is useful; it helps you a lot. For instance, if you finish school and get your GED, you will have many job choices because you have your GED. It is also good to do more because you learn new skills, like changing a tire. Then, if you need to change a tire one day, you will know how. We do more when we are busy than when we are not, which doesn't help you become who you want to be. Why is it good to always be doing something? First, you learn more, and you don't waste your time on useless things. The only use for doing nothing might be for sleep because you don't do anything while you sleep. The last reason why finishing tasks is good and doing nothing is bad is that finishing a work task helps you understand how you did it. When you do it again, you will know more about it.

Our bodies and minds get worn out. We can't handle everyday stress well. Being busy non-stop can be bad. It can make you miss out on time with family and friends. It can stop you from being happy. I believe that if you're always thinking about tasks, you can get tired. Even small mistakes can feel huge. You would feel stressed all the time. Taking breaks is good for your mind. It helps you feel more awake when you work again. It's good to stop thinking about work sometimes. Doing too much of anything is not good. So, I think it's better to rest and relax instead of working all the time."}
{"text_id": "A3F93157DBFA", "output_essay": "These days, people can buy, play, or look at many things online. Some people think technology has made their lives better, and it's true, it makes things easier for us. We can buy things without having to argue or get into trouble. Sometimes, when we shop in person, someone might steal our things or, in the worst cases, try to take our money and hurt us. \n\nSome people feel that technology is bad because it can lead to problems. They have a point because some use the internet to do wrong things, like talking to kids and making them do bad things. Also, people who spend a lot of time on the computer often don't like being around others. \n\nI've had bad experiences with rude salespeople. When I was 14 and new to the United States, a store worker was mean to me because I couldn't speak English well. It made me feel like I didn't belong, sad, and I cried. My mom wanted to argue, but I told her we should leave. Now, we shop online because it's easier. We're busy and it's cold outside, so we order things to be delivered. This way, I don't have to take my baby and my mom doesn't have to take my sister and brother out in the cold. \n\nAnother reason technology is good is that it's safer. A year ago, my cousin was buying a computer and got attacked. He was leaving the store when two people with knives demanded his computer. They stabbed him, and he died. He was only 17. The police couldn't find the attackers. This shows why I think online shopping is safer. We don't want more people to get hurt or die. \n\nIn conclusion, technology is good for us because it's risky to go out. I know the internet is new to some, and new things can be scary. The internet has good and bad sides. We can choose to learn and use technology well or stick to old ways. I believe technology will keep growing, and we should use it wisely and responsibly."}

They can help build a better world. Being a boss is tough. You have to be in charge of all the workers in the company. Everyone needs help and chances, like students do. Jobs and chances to help in business are important to start and grow. But it's hard. I want to be a boss at my job. That's why I work hard. Being in charge of a company is a big job. Big companies start with people who went to college. You must study and work hard every day. Take your job seriously. To lead workers, you need to make them work as a team. This is easier. If you work well, you can become a boss and learn more. You can grow a big business and meet many people. Some are nice, others may be rich. But you must work hard and be kind. Let others build and do their best in the world. You can help others, become a boss, and start a business with them. Create chances."}

This kind of situation makes you think harder about life and grow up. For example, everyone must stop and think about parts of life at some time. To learn more, you need to go through something that starts this learning. To end this beginning part, I will talk about how trying new things can be very good for you.\n\nGetting what you want in life is never easy because not everything is meant to be easy. You have to get past some hard things to get what we call growing up and being happy. Sadly, growing up is the best part of life. But when you grow up, you understand life better and how it works for everyone."}
{"text_id": "6AFE8F926910", "output_essay": "Do you get happy when your teacher says you can work with your friends or smart kids in class? I know I do. I always have a good day at school when I can work with my friends or smart kids. I don't feel like I'm having a bad day, even if we have a big assignment or project. Working in a group is good because it lets us share ideas and talk to each other.\n\nOne reason group work is good is because it lets us share ideas. For example, when we do an assignment or project together, we tell each other our ideas. This makes it easier to finish without problems. In my first year of high school, my English teacher gave us a group project about a book we read. There were four of us, and we met every day after school to talk about the book. We all said what we thought, and one person wrote it all down. This made our work easy and not confusing. This shows that group work helps us finish tasks easily and with less stress.\n\nAnother reason group work is good is because it helps us talk to each other. Some kids find it hard to talk to others in class. They might think the other kids are mean. But when they work in groups for projects or classwork, they have to talk. You can't finish a project without talking to your group. So, group work can help kids talk more to each other.\n\nSome might say working alone is better because it keeps you focused. When you work alone, you only think about your work. You don't worry about who is working or not, and that can make you finish faster. But when you work with others, you have less work. In a group, you share ideas, and everyone does a part. You do less work than if you were alone.\n\nIn the end, working in a group is better because it lets us share thoughts and talk to each other. If we work together on a project or classwork, we can finish it easily. We share thoughts and talk, which helps a lot. Group work can make school a good place, and we don't worry about big assignments or projects. We like working in groups and should be able to do it more."}
{"text_id": "9D5052A74EAE", "output_essay": "I don't agree because with shorter school days, there's less time to learn. During normal school days, you can learn something new all the time. But I do think it's good to have some short days for special events, like Teacher's Day, so teachers can do their work. Long days are good because you have more time in class to learn, do tests, and finish work. Short days might seem fun, but they can waste time. You may want to have fun, but short days are made to let you go home early. On long days, you have all your classes, so if you like one, you can stay until it ends. On short days, you're only in class for about 20 minutes, which isn't enough to learn a lot. Long days help you do a lot, while short days can make kids want to leave and not use their energy well. This can lead to trouble. Long days use up your energy with things like writing. They also let you talk and work with others. This helps you learn and become better, which is more useful than what you get from short days. Short days can feel too quick. Teachers might even have tests on new stuff. They're not too bad if you're tired, because you get a break to finish work. Both long and short days are the same in one way: if you finish early, you might get more work or time to do work you missed. Why would you want short days all the time? They don't make up for the work you didn't do, which then is late. Long days give you plenty of time to take notes, join in class, and do homework before the next class. They don't waste your time, but short days just let you leave for other things. Short days should only happen when there's a really good reason for the day to be short."}

But some people need advice and ask for help from experts.\n\nI think being able to depend on yourself is important. To grow as a person, you need to learn to make good choices on your own. Solving problems by yourself can lead to great things. It makes you feel very sure of yourself, like you can get past any hard time. It shows how strong you are and that you can deal with more than you think.\n\nYou might talk to an expert about big life choices, but they don't really know you or your life. An expert might easily convince you to change your mind with just their opinion. Often, people already know the answer to their problems but want to be sure they are right. So they ask experts. But an expert doesn't really know what's best for you; you do.\n\nMany people with depression think they need an expert to help them. They want someone to talk to and to feel better. But why spend money to talk to a stranger? It's good to share your feelings when you need to. But when you need advice, it's better to talk to family and friends. They know you and what's good for you.\n\nI believe that depending on yourself is the best thing. You should make your own choices. You shouldn't pay someone else to decide for you.

A good thing about technology is it saves time and money. But sometimes, these chances are only for some people, not everyone. On the bad side, older people might not like or know how to use new technology. They need help with it. These days, many places choose technology over hiring people. But technology is hard to use if you don't understand it. Sadly, some people finish school and think they will get a job right away. But they can't find work because machines do all the work. This means there are fewer jobs for people.\n\nIn conclusion, technology has good and bad points.

Others disagree, do not want more people coming in, and think it causes unfair treatment and racial issues.\n\nNext, in religion, people have different beliefs about God. Many countries, like Iran, have fights with other countries or with their own people. This happens when people disagree with the country's religion.\n\nLastly, in communities, there are issues with laws that some people don't agree with.

These changes are good and bad, but we can't really stop them because we rely so much on technology. \n\nTechnology controls our daily lives, and we use our phones and computers to do many things. Imagine it's 2009, and I'm hungry but don't want to leave my house. I would have to get up and go to a fast-food place. But now, I can order food on my phone using an app called \"Uber Eats,\" and get it delivered quickly. This means we don't meet people as often, which can be good and bad. I will talk about this more. \n\nNot seeing people often can cause problems. One bad thing is that we might become less social. We get used to being alone and focus on our devices. We might also lose our social skills and become lazy because we depend on technology. But there are good things too. For example, we can learn to do things on our own without help from friends or family. \n\nIn the end, not meeting people can be good, but usually, it's not. To avoid this, we should go out sometimes to places like libraries, fairs, or malls to see and talk to others. Technology will probably become even more important, and many jobs will be done online.

This quote tells us that being active helps us get more done than if we do nothing. Thomas Jefferson is correct; to get a job that needs a college degree, you must work hard. If you don't work towards it, you probably won't succeed. This is true for sports as well.\n\nSports show us why being busy is better than doing nothing. There are many sports, but you might want to be a pro in one. Let's look at football. To be a pro football player, you need to be very committed. You must get good grades and be good at playing. This takes a lot of your time. If you play a sport in high school, your day might look like this: wake up, go to school for seven hours, then practice for three hours. By then, it's dark outside. You also have to give up hanging out with friends, which doesn't help you reach your dreams. In sports, you must work hard to become a pro.\n\nAnother reason why Thomas Jefferson's words are true is because of school. School takes time and focus to pass. It's key to getting a great job and doing well in the future. Just like Jefferson said, we can do so much if we're always busy. If you listen to your teacher, do your homework, and finish your classwork, you will probably pass. If you don't do these things and just waste time, you won't.

People often get sidetracked by new tech like video games, computers, and phones. Technology is probably the best thing someone has made for all kinds of activities to keep people busy. We often need technology to finish tasks or if there is an urgent situation happening. People don't really need technology for most things, but they choose to use it for everything they do.\n\nMaking friends and starting relationships often happens with the help of technology, like social media or sharing phone numbers. People always have some kind of tech to connect with each other. The reason we don't meet in person as much is because we rely on technology to talk to others, especially family or stores that sell us food and items. Meeting in person is good for us because it helps us know our family better, or we might need to call when someone dies or for other important reasons.\n\nPolice and other jobs often use technology to talk to people who need help or to call people for job interviews. Parents give their kids tech as they grow up for keeping in touch or for school. People in offices use phones or computers to talk to clients or customers who need help with questions or issues. Schools also use tech to talk to parents if there's a problem or if they have questions, and they can even have meetings over the phone.\n\nBanks and businesses really need technology to stay in touch with people who track devices or money. Technology has made it positive for people who were strangers to get to know each other. Talking to others has made life exciting because they can work and talk to family who live far away. People are very distracted by social media because they talk to others or read magazines to learn what's happening in the world.\n\nIn conclusion, people often think they need technology to be happy. Technology makes many things possible, and it's very helpful for many reasons in today's world. I can say that technology has been useful for me because of my schoolwork and keeping in touch with my parents."}

Choosing a career early is good because young students can learn a lot and get ready for their future early on.\n\nWhen students pick a career early, they can learn faster. For example, when I came to the USA, I didn't speak English. Two years later, my younger sister came. She started speaking English in two months. That showed me that young students learn faster.\n\nAlso, if students choose a career early, they start getting ready for their future when they are young. They will pay more attention to their school work and are less likely to quit school. They know quitting is bad because they will miss the chance to learn. As they get older, they might wish they could be young again to learn more. They will see how tough life can be.\n\nSome people say you need to be older to choose a career. But they are wrong. Older people have more responsibilities. Young students can just focus on school because their parents look after them. There is proof that choosing a career when you are young is easier than when you get older.\n\nIn conclusion, it is definitely good for students to choose a career when they are young. They will learn a lot and get ready for the future. This way, when they are older, they won't regret not learning when they could. They will understand they had a chance but didn't take it seriously.

For instance, when you go to a new country, you must talk in different languages. You can't just use tech to talk to them. Tech can be good or bad, depending on how you use it. It can help send emails quickly, make calls, chat, and shop online. But it can also fill your head with too many games, too much phone time, and less talking to people. The biggest way tech changes us is in how we talk. Many people don't speak to each other because they're busy with tech. They stay home and spend hours on their phones. We need to talk more, not just use phones. Tech is getting bigger every day. In ten years, people might not talk to each other at all. They'll just use phones or other tech. The second big change from tech is with kids. When a kid cries, parents often give them a phone or some tech to quiet them. This isn't good. Their brains will learn to want a phone every time they're upset. Parents let their kids use phones even during meals. It seems okay now, but later on, it won't be. They won't know how to talk to people without tech. In the end, I think tech is good. It's fine to use it, but not always, and not just to talk. Don't let your kids use tech all the time.

Not seeing people much because of technology is actually good for us. Technology is saving our lives. It has made life simpler, quicker, and smoother these days.\n\nIn hospitals, technology is doing great things. A pregnant woman can find out if she's having a boy or girl, see what the baby looks like, and listen to its heartbeat. This is all thanks to ultrasound machines. Three years ago, my mother was very sick and weak. We rushed her to the hospital. The sound of the ambulance was scary because I thought she might die. But the doctors used a machine to give her oxygen and she got better. I wondered if they could have made that machine without technology. My mom's recovery shows how technology is good for us, especially in hospitals.\n\nFor teachers, technology makes work quicker and simpler. They use programs like Microsoft PowerPoint and Word, and even grade our work with \"Grade Cam.\" Without technology, imagine a teacher with over a hundred students. Many teachers have families they want to spend time with. But technology lets them do that by saving time when grading. We also learn with computers at school. Last week, my teacher gave us big notes for our SOL test. I thought, \"Would we like to write all this by hand?\" I didn't think so. But printers at school made it much easier. So, technology makes learning better and fun.\n\nThings like phones, iPads, and computers help us a lot. Today was my brother's birthday. Birthdays are important, and we try not to miss them. I sent him a message to wish him well. Without technology, this wouldn't have been quick. Talking to family and friends makes us happy and keeps us from feeling sad or worried. We shop online, read, and play games on our gadgets. I like playing games on my computer to relax. This shows technology is good for us every day.\n\nIn the end, I think we should support the people who make new technology because it helps us in many ways. It's good for us in hospitals, in school, and keeps us close to loved ones. Technology is making our lives better. I believe it will keep making things easier for us in the future.

{"text_id": "726D0B7A1677", "output_essay": "In many places, people choose a job path when they start high school. This is a bad idea for several reasons, which I will explain. I believe you don't have to decide on a job in your first year of high school. This essay will show why it's better to choose at the end of high school, or in your junior year. Deciding on a job at the end of high school helps you grow and become respected.\n\nFirst, you might not know what job you want when you start high school. For example, kids coming from middle school to high school are young and unsure; they need time to learn about different jobs. You should wait until your senior year to make a job plan. This is important today. It gives you a clear goal and shows you where you want to be in the future. If you start high school without knowing your strengths, weaknesses, and skills, a job plan can help you figure these out. These points show why it's important to wait and make a job plan.\n\nAlso, high school offers many classes for different jobs. Consider classes like business marketing, engineering, and art. Students often change their minds about their job choice in high school. It's fine to change your mind because high school is for trying out different jobs. So, it's never too late to switch your focus in high school, and internships can help you choose. Internships are very useful. They help with making decisions and learning about your future.\n\nAnother point is that first-year students don't need to choose a job right away; it's a process. Look at NBA player James Brook. He didn't know what he wanted after high school. As a freshman, he had no idea. But in his junior year, he started to take basketball seriously. Now, he has a successful career. This shows you don't have to decide on a job as a freshman.\n\nAfter looking at all this, I think choosing a job too early is bad. There are good reasons to think about your job in your senior or junior year. Don't stress about choosing a job as a freshman; it's not the right time. I know that deciding on a job at the end of high school helps you grow and become honorable. This will be useful when it's time to look for jobs."}

These schools offer special classes to help students prepare for the job they want after high school. I see good and bad points in this idea.

They might feel upset if they're not ready by graduation. They also can't make new plans, which can cause trouble. This happened to me, but I worked hard and made it through. Students shouldn't feel they must pick a job as soon as they start high school. Here's why: Some students change their minds. They might want one job at first and then choose a different one after high school. This happened to me too. But it's not a big problem and can be fixed. Students should always have a second plan, just in case. Sometimes, knowing what job you want can be good. For example, a student might be sure they want to be a plumber. They can tell their counselor and take a plumbing class. This class will teach them a lot. When they start working in plumbing, they'll know things that can help them make money and teach others. In the end, it's good for students to know what job they want when they start high school. But it's also okay to think about it later. I found it's best not to have a fixed job in mind. This can stress students out. They might not plan for other options. And they might struggle if the job they chose doesn't work out. Having a second plan is very important in high school. And sometimes, the job you want might not happen, and that's okay."}
{"text_id": "88C9B6EB6495", "output_essay": "Ralph Waldo Emerson once said, 'Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow.' I believe he means that you need to take on new challenges to grow. You need to try new things that will help you in the future. These things will teach you and help you become important in life. But if you don't change and try new things, you won't be as successful as others. It's a powerful idea because it tells you to do things you're not used to. It's true. To reach your goals, you must work hard. You must always do your best to achieve your goals. I agree with Ralph Waldo Emerson. He's right about how to be successful. To be successful, you must focus on it. Some people wait for success to come to them. But that won't happen. You are the one who can make yourself successful."}
{"text_id": "256C70D2B3EC", "output_essay": "I agree with the idea that if you don't try new things, you will stay where you are. Trying new things can mean learning and getting smarter. When you try new things, you might not be scared to try even more. Trying things you're not good at yet can help you go further. I really think it can make you smarter, more confident, and help you do things you thought you couldn't do before. \n\nWhen you try things you haven't learned fully, you can learn and get better. For example, if you join a soccer team, you learn how to play and get better at it. Or if you join an art class, you learn about art and practice it. This shows how smart you can become. \n\nIf you keep trying new things, you can become less scared. It's like giving a talk in class; if you just do it, you won't be scared after. This can make you and others more confident. It helps you do what you want and decide if you want to push yourself further, which brings me to my next point. \n\nTrying new things can help you reach big goals you couldn't before. When you learn and become more confident, you can use these to achieve your dreams. Like if you want to be a pilot, you need to learn about flying. But it's not just about learning; it's about using what you learn and your confidence to reach your goal. Your past experiences can help you get there faster and understand better. \n\nThis idea is very true, so I believe that not doing new things means you won't improve. I think you can learn, become more confident, and reach new goals. If people keep trying new things, they can become smarter. In the end, if you do things you don't know yet, you can make a better future for yourself. Always look for new challenges to make life better for you."}
{"text_id": "353A36AE4FB3", "output_essay": "Have you ever thought that using your imagination is more important than having a lot of knowledge? I think this is true because using your imagination can calm people down, comfort them, and give them confidence.\n\nFirst, using your imagination can calm you down when you are mad. When people get mad, they think about being alone in a place they love. Have you ever pictured yourself in a place you love, all by yourself, listening to music? This can also help you relax. For example, a girl who gets mad easily was asked by a doctor, 'Why do you get mad so quickly?' She said, 'I have many problems at school.' The doctor told her, 'Think about sitting with your favorite actors, or taking a photo with him.' She said, 'Thanks, doctor, you helped me relax.' This is a true story that my friend saw. Imagination is like a dream, and I call it magic.\n\nNext, imagination helps people believe in themselves. I saw a movie about a boy who always felt down and was alone. He would dream about being an engineer, the most famous one. Then, he worked hard to really become an engineer. He didn't believe in himself at first, but dreaming about it helped him start to. Day by day, he believed more and became an engineer. Imagination is key to helping people believe in themselves and be happy.\n\nThird, imagination gives people confidence. When people are in a new place and feel unsure, they think about being in their favorite place, talking to friends. This makes them feel sure of themselves and relaxed. Also, imagining things makes people happy, even if those things aren't real. Have you ever felt unsure of yourself? What did you do to feel sure? Imagination helps a lot in everyday life.\n\nIn the end, using your imagination is the best way to relax and be happy when you're sad. Clearly, using your imagination is more important than having a lot of knowledge. And it is magic."}

Doing the same thing well over and over will give you the same results. For example, at school or at home, if you do an experiment and try it again at home with a small change, the result will be the same. You may think that a new way will make a difference, but it doesn't. As you grow, you face new things, and these things are different. For example, you will feel and act differently with people. But some people act the same because they are not growing up enough. People change at different times, and some grow up faster than others. Some people won't like what I'm saying; they may even hate it, but it's true. For example, some won't like it, and some will agree with me. Many people have their own ideas.

It has made it easier to borrow books, shop, and play games without talking to someone. Many people don't like talking to others in public and prefer to use their gadgets. This could be seen as the bad part of technology or its downside. \n\nUsing technology doesn't always cut down on talking to people. It can actually help people connect through social media, texts, or phone calls. These are ways people talk to each other using technology. But, technology can also be bad for people. If someone uses technology too much, they can rely on it too much. When someone relies on something, they always need it. This can make them feel they can't live without it. A lot of people, especially teens, are hooked on their phones. They always need to use their gadgets. Social media is one example. Most teens use it a lot, and it's a big part of their day. This shows that the bad part of technology is using it too much. \n\nWhile technology can be bad for people, it can also be good if used the right way.

They say students forget things over the break. But I don't agree. In the summer, students can spend a lot of time with family and friends. They can also go to fun places like Disneyland or the Eiffel Tower in France. Plus, students who didn't do well in school can go to summer school. This helps them pass their classes and earn the credits they need to graduate.\n\nMy mom always says, 'Family is everything.' Without family, you've lost a lot. Summer lets students be with their families more. For example, I get up at 5:30 am for school and don't get home until 3:00 pm. Often, my parents aren't there when I get back. We don't have much time together. So I think the summer holiday should be longer. It's the best time for students to be with their families.\n\nSummer is also a time to see new places. Going to tourist spots can teach you about different people and cultures. Last summer, my family and I went on a cruise. It was the best time of my life. We were away for almost three weeks, and I was very happy about the trip.\n\nSome students fail their classes or tests during the school year. But in summer school, they can try again.

When you trust your gut or your own thoughts, things will turn out better than you expect. When making a choice, you should pick the right one. If you make a bad choice, you might end up doing something you don't enjoy and have to stick with it. If you ask your parents or a friend for advice, they might help you choose. In this country, at 18, you're not a child anymore and can make your own choices. If I depend on myself, I'll get good things if I stay positive. I will look for advice because I think I'll need it to succeed in life. I often ask my parents for basic things like food or money. I don't want to be like those who always depend on others. I think you need advice from others, but you also need to rely on yourself. When I talk about my advisers, I mean I want to show my parents I can do things on my own and make my own choices as I become an adult. I don't like it when people always depend on their parents. If someone doesn't know what to choose, I can't make the choice for them. They have to do it on their own. I can help, but I won't tell them what to do. They can also ask their parents for help. When I was young, my parents made choices for me. But now that I'm almost an adult, they can't. You can seek advice if you want. Some people prefer to decide on their own, and that's okay. You can also get advice and help from your parents. In the end, I think I'll do both to improve my life. I'll tell my future kids about the good things in my life, not the bad. Maybe she'll want to make her own choices when she's older, not when she's young. She might also want advice from her parents or friends, which is important. She won't be like kids who try to decide everything at 10 or 9 years old. For example, when a kid tells their parents they'll go to college at 18 and move out, I'd think twice. Making that choice means you have to work to pay bills and rent. Others might choose to stay with their parents longer. But it's my choice, and no one can tell me otherwise because I'm living my life, not my parents'. My future daughter will be respectful because I'll teach her not to impose her choices on others.

What's good about long and short breaks? A long break lets students work, make money, hang out with friends, and be with family. This is good because you can't do these things much during school. A short break means you don't forget what you learned. I believe a long break is better. Students get to relax more. If teachers worry about forgetting, they can give a little review work. This keeps the mind sharp but still lets students enjoy the beach and other activities. For example, I work, buy things, and spend time with people I care about during my break. Schools should pay attention to this. Students are busy all day and can't do what they want. A long break is fair. Some students need to retake classes in the summer. They only get a few weeks, which isn't enough. I get stressed with grades and schoolwork. On vacation, I can relax and sleep more. It's good to have a long break.

Dear Manager, I think all students should try different jobs. This helps us choose our future job, learn from different work, and helps our country grow. First, students have dream jobs. It's important to find out what they want to do later. For example, a high school student wants to finish school, go to college, and get a job. But they might not know what job is right for them. Trying different jobs can help them choose and feel less stressed. I've seen friends at school get stressed thinking about their future jobs. If we could try different jobs, it would help us worry less. Also, having job experience is important. In the United States, you need experience to get a job. If we as students could get this experience, we could find the right career and be ready for the future. Once, a friend who finished Medical School wanted to work as a surgeon. But the hospital wanted someone with Art skills, which she didn't have. She couldn't get the job because it was too late to learn. Next, helping our country grow is up to us. Dear Manager, if we get to try different jobs, we can help our country. Most students will love their jobs if they find the right one. They'll work better and inspire others. For example, a student who wanted to be a designer worked hard, made great clothes, and made people happy. He became very famous because he found the right job for him. Some managers don't think it's important for students to work with their companies. I don't agree. It helps us find future jobs, get experience, and helps our country.

Also, the long 2-3 month summer break we have now is our time to relax without any work. Plus, if students need to remember what they learned, they can go to summer school. Some people don't think school stresses students out, but it does. Too much homework and high teacher expectations can overwhelm many students. If school was all year, this stress would get worse. Summer is usually when students and teachers rest and learn in different ways. Year-round school would mean more stress, even with extra breaks. Short breaks in summer, a long winter break, and a week off in spring would make it hard for teachers to plan lessons. It would be tough for everyone. That's why a long summer break is better, so we can all rest and get ready for the next school year. Another point is that summer is perfect for travel and fun without thinking about school. Year-round school would stop people from having this chance because of homework and school work. But with a long summer break, this wouldn't be a problem. Teachers wouldn't need to plan for absent students, and students wouldn't stress about catching up. A school year with short breaks and one long break is better for our mental and physical health. In summary, school all year would mean more stress and less free time. Even if students might forget some things, they could go to summer school or do summer work. So, I don't like the idea of year-round school. I'd rather have a 2-3 month summer break."}
{"text_id": "1AB7CF99612C", "output_essay": "I don't agree with the school board's idea to make the school day 30 minutes longer. I don't agree because I think the time we have for school now is enough. We have plenty of time to learn in all our classes. I also think that kids should have time after school to do homework and other school tasks. After that, they can play outside with friends and family. They can also work on school projects at home. Adding 30 minutes to the school day could have some good points. It could give students more time to finish their work, tests, notes, and projects. They could also get more help from the teacher. But students can stay later at school if they need help from the teacher. They can also finish any classwork or tests they didn't get to during the day. So, I think the length of the school day should stay the same. Please don't make the school day longer."}

Technology has grown worldwide over time. In the 1920s, Alexander Graham Bell invented a way for long-distance talking. These were rotary phones. They were not portable. They had to stay in the house and be plugged in. A big help from technology is getting directions. GPS guides us to where we need to go. It works with a satellite. It tells you if you are on the right path. You can also see the area from above with satellite view. You can see buildings, streets, shops, and even cars if you look closely. This is useful for jobs like the police when they need to find where someone lives. Parents can also check on their kids if they go out without asking. Technology also helps us with machines. Machines do what we tell them to. For example, Alexa is a smart helper made in 2017. It answers questions you ask. Machines also help make our clothes. Eli Whitney made the Cotton Gin in the 1800s. It made a lot of cloth to keep us warm and comfy. Phones are very popular. Everyone uses them. Alexander Graham Bell became famous for creating them. They changed a lot over a hundred years. In the past, people didn't have our technology. They rode horses and followed signs to find towns. Without technology, everything would be much slower."}
{"text_id": "734C4733E263", "output_essay": "Everyone should choose for themselves. Choosing for yourself makes you stronger. It teaches you from your mistakes or successes. The more choices you make, the wiser you will be later on. Self-reliance means following your own heart and thoughts. We all need to trust ourselves to do what we want and choose for ourselves.\n\nAs people start to choose, they grow stronger. A little child can't choose because their brain isn't ready. But as the child grows and walks, their brain grows too. Letting the child make simple choices is the best way to help their brain grow. When the child becomes a teenager, they will understand that choices have results, good or bad.\n\nParents help their kids grow by letting them make choices. This teaches them to be responsible. In the future, this is very helpful. Parents think it's good for their kids to learn responsibility by making choices. For example, when teenagers can date, parents often don't watch them closely. They want their kids to see if their choice is good or bad. Teens need to learn from both good and bad choices. If a teen makes a bad choice, they will learn not to do it again. Making choices has been shown to make your brain smarter and grow in new ways.\n\nPeople usually become wiser based on their choices. In the United States, teens can get a permit to drive. Many high school students choose this. Parents give them a car. It's the teen's choice to take friends along, but they know the rules about not having too many people in the car. If a teen takes another student and gets caught by the police, they get in trouble. But then the teen learns from the mistake. They will make better choices next time. This is how they learn to be wiser and more responsible.\n\nChoosing for yourself makes you stronger. It helps you learn from past choices, good or bad. The more you choose, the stronger and wiser you will get. Some people don't agree, but it's true that choices make you stronger. People think that if a choice was bad for one person, it will be bad for everyone. But we all have the right to make our own choices, good or bad. It's about understanding."}
{"text_id": "3F12BC08B53F", "output_essay": "I want to talk about if students should know what job they want before they start high school. I think it's not a good idea because they should wait and think more. For example, if they can't decide between two jobs after high school, waiting helps them choose. They are also too young to choose a career now.\n\nI also believe it might make them worried. Students should just focus on finishing high school unless they already know what job they want. It would be better for students to finish their first two years of high school before they think about their job. This way, they can do well in their classes.\n\nBut, it might not be a bad idea to plan early. You can start learning about it early too.\n\nIn the end, I think they need more time to get ready for the job they want later. Starting high school with a set job in mind can change as time goes by. Most young people won't know what job they want right after middle school."}

I believe not talking to people is good. I think we should not talk if we don't need to. My family and I used to shop for food every Saturday. Now we don't. My mom orders food online, and they deliver it to our door. I like to order things because I don't have to leave home. I also have more time on weekends. Life is easier with technology. I think we don't need to talk to others to live. My brother is 13. He plays games, orders food, gets books, and buys clothes online. He hardly ever leaves his room. I do the same things. But technology can also be bad. We don't leave the house much, so we have become lazy. I look at screens almost all day. It hurt my eyes, and now my brother and I need glasses. I'm also not good at speaking to groups because I don't talk to people much. Technology helps us do lots without talking to others. I hope you liked my thoughts on this."}
{"text_id": "1A69B2FC1200", "output_essay": "I don't agree with this because I believe we should always try to reach our goals. After we meet one goal, we shouldn't just stop; we should go after another one. This is because we always want more, so we should set new goals. Take someone who wants to finish high school and then go to college. They must first get into college. To meet our goals, we must work hard. \n\nEmerson is also right that some people don't want to move on after meeting their goals. They prefer to stay with what they have done. I think they don't want new goals because they only want to think about the goal they met. For example, to be a teacher, a person must study a lot. Every goal needs a lot of work. Some people work their whole lives to meet one goal. If we can't meet a goal, we shouldn't quit. We should keep trying. If we stop trying, we won't get anything done. A goal isn't just about getting something; it's about the hard work to get there. \n\nShould people stop after they meet their goals? \n\nI don't agree because we always have more goals. If we finish one, we'll want to start on the next. People shouldn't quit. They should keep trying until they get there. Life has many goals. We should decide what we want and work to get it. \n\nIf we work hard, we can get what we want. We must always work hard for our goals. Even though Emerson has a point, some people don't want to do more. They only want to think about one goal and not try other things. But I don't agree. I think people should try new things. If they can't meet a goal, they should pick an easier one. Whatever we do is a goal. So, we shouldn't quit. If we can't meet a goal, we should try something else. With hard work, we can meet our goals. That's what I think: people shouldn't stop after one goal. They should try more because we have many options to reach our goals. But everyone is different. Some might not want to go after more goals, and that's their choice. I believe we should go after other goals too."}

Some good things are that it makes work easier and quicker. But some bad things are that people can get hooked on technology like phones, computers, and games. Cutting down on technology can help people talk to each other more instead of always texting or being on their phones. It helps people meet and talk about what's going on. Technology affects us a lot, but it's helpful in many ways. Still, people need to be smart about using it. Many students in college or high school get too caught up in their phones. They lose focus on their studies because they're always on their phones. In schools, things like iPads or MacBooks are really helpful. They make work go by fast and are easier than writing by hand. We can watch videos for school to learn, and some like it when teachers give us games to play online or with the class. But having too much technology can be bad. Students might go to other websites they shouldn't. If we use less technology, I think the way we talk to each other would change. It might be a good change. Technology helps us travel, like using GPS instead of a map. It's easier to find places. But some people text while driving and get hurt. It's good to limit how much we use electronics. It's also good to notice what's around you and go outside instead of staying in and using technology. Too much screen time can give you headaches. And some people get tired of it after a while. Electronics and technology are making the world faster, better, and smarter. They help us make new things. Technology is changing the world, and it's everywhere now. Here's what I think about using less technology: people should cut back and discover more."}
{"text_id": "195DDC774453", "output_essay": "WORKING AS A GROUP OR ALONE\n\nWhich is better: working in a group or working by yourself? Both ways are useful and have good points. But working alone can make it easier to focus without interruptions, it doesn't offer as many good points. I think that working in a group is better because you can share ideas, make friends, and get better at things you're not good at.\n\nFirst, being in a group lets you share ideas. For a student, it's more useful to work with others than alone. You get to hear different thoughts and make the best choices. Students need to talk about problems and figure out how to solve them. There's a saying, 'Two heads are better than one.' This means that one person might be wrong, but with another's view, you can make the right choice. For example, imagine a student has to finish a worksheet by a certain time, but doesn't know the answers. The student can join a group to work out the answers.\n\nNext, being in a group helps you make friends. Many students are too shy to ask questions in class. Group work can help them. Making friends means joining in on all kinds of activities in class or school. Some students are scared to talk in front of everyone, so working in a group is the best choice for them. In a group, they meet new people and work together as a team, which leads to hard work and togetherness. For instance, a student might be scared of the teacher or other students but not their friends. They can ask their friends tough questions and talk about it.\n\nLast, working in a group helps you get better at things you're not good at. Everyone has things they're not good at. Some of these can be improved by working with others. There might be a question that's really hard and you can't solve it alone. The best way is to talk about it with the group and see what everyone thinks. Dealing with hard questions means getting lots of views and working together.\n\nIn summary, I'll say that working in a group is better than working alone because it helps you learn new things, make friends, and get better at your weak points. It also makes learning easier and clearer for students."}

This has happened to me. For instance, I had chores to do. I needed to fold my clothes and clean my room. I finished these tasks quickly. If we want something but do nothing, how will we get it? We must act to achieve our goals. Some people think being idle has its uses. For example, I had to clean my room. I felt lazy and didn't clean it. My brother saw the mess and cleaned it for me. This made me look bad, but my room was clean, and I didn't have to clean it myself. If you need to do something, do it. If you don't, maybe someone else will. We might be busy with our duties, but we can accomplish a lot if we set our minds to it. For example, you want a car. To get that car, you need to work hard. Sometimes, you might not need to do anything to get what you want. Someone might come along and give you what you've always wanted. Just do something to get something in return."}
{"text_id": "8E38DC6AE950", "output_essay": "The impact of technology on people's lives\n\nWe have been using technology for some time, and I think it has changed our lives a lot. Technology has helped us do many big things, like making new tools that help people in different ways. Thinking about this, I feel technology has changed our lives for the better. But, if we don't use technology the right way, it can hurt us. Let's forget the bad parts for now and talk about the good things technology does for us.\n\nThings like cell phones, computers, cars, and TVs are types of technology. With cell phones, you can text, call, and do much more. Cell phones make it much easier to talk to each other than in the past. Before cell phones, people sent letters or news by telegrams, but it was slow. Then cell phones came and made talking to each other fast.\n\nComputers are very useful. You can look up things on a computer that you can't find in books, do school or work tasks, and keep information safe. Computers have programs that help students learn about different topics. They also let you play games online and talk to other players. So, computers are a key tool that helps us learn a lot.\n\nTVs, made by people, have many good uses, even though most use them to watch movies or shows. TVs have shows that teach kids and news shows that tell you what's happening in other places. I think news shows are watched a lot because they tell people about many things, like sports and big events. Other shows teach about history and important topics.\n\nCars, bikes, and planes are also technology. They help us move from one place to another fast. They are important because they let us travel to other states or countries, to see family or get a better education. Without them, going far would be hard and tiring.\n\nTechnology has also made new technologies. Today, high-tech tools are in almost every country and in homes, schools, and places to eat. They keep people safe from bad events, fires, or theft and are used to make fast food. They also help make roads safer by reducing crashes and giving signals. Technology has made hard jobs easier. In schools, smart boards and computers are used a lot. The new tools being made are even more high-tech, leading to robots. Many people are buying these robots that can do jobs like humans.\n\nBefore technology, people did many things by hand, like writing and cooking. People were also scared of losing important written stuff because it was hard to get back without computers or printers. Now that we have such high-tech tools, we should use them to do things that help us and make our society and world better.\n\nAfter thinking about what I've written, I've learned a lot and see that people have done many good things for society and the world. In my opinion, technology is the best thing people have made for us, as it makes our lives easier in many ways. So yes, technology has had a good effect on our lives."}

But now, things are different. We have cures for almost every sickness because of technology. Scientists have found many things that save lives all over the world. Second, technology keeps getting better every year and makes new things. For example, it helps people stay in touch across the world. In the past, if you had family in another country, you could only write a letter or visit them. But now, you can video call, email, or text them easily. If you want to shop or get food, you can order it online, and it comes to you. This is a quicker way. You don't waste time going to the store, waiting for food, or standing in line. It's just great. In the end, I believe life is easier now with technology. It speeds things up and helps us find out things we didn't know before. It also brings you closer to loved ones and lets you know what's happening in the world every day."}

That makes me feel bad because they copied my error.\n\nOften, people tell me my smile makes them want to try hard things: learning a new language, going to a new country, and accepting simple thoughts. I agree because when my friend is upset, she asks to see my smile. I smile, and she says it makes her want to keep going and try new things.\n\nBeing someone who changes others is tough because you have a lot of responsibility. No one is perfect; we all mess up sometimes. People admit they make mistakes but plan to fix them because life is hard. I'm from Generic_City and have lived in the United States for two years.

{"text_id": "2402C99EB8C6", "output_essay": "I agree with this statement because imagination is very important in life. It lets us think of new things or inventions. It is useful to everyone; it lets you picture things you've never seen before. With imagination, you can make anything you think of. For example, if you wanted to build a rocket powered by beans, that's your imagination at work. Some people dream about getting a college degree or being a company boss. We always dream up new or good things we want to happen. When someone gives a talk on an important subject, they hope it will go well and people will like it. We sometimes even dream of being the best person in the world.\n\nImagination isn't just about being happy. We can dream of good or bad things. It's important and special. If someone can't imagine, we can help them dream of fun things they'd like to do. It can be hard to dream, but that's when we're not thinking of something special. Imagination gives us creativity, which is also important. I sometimes dream of finishing college and having a good job. When I make something, it's because I dreamed it up. Without imagination, we wouldn't have electronics, clothes, shoes, or anything else we have now.\n\nAs kids, we have a lot of imagination, but it changes as we grow up. We start to dream differently and make things that surprise people. I think imagination is very important. Have you ever thought about how long it took someone to solve the first math problem? Now, math problems are easier, but think about solving the hardest math problem ever. It would take me years; how long would it take you? Imagination is everywhere. Every time you see something new, you dream up many things about it. Now that you've read this, what's the best dream you've ever had?\n\nWhen you dream, you can feel like you're in your dream, seeing everything happen. Dreams can become goals. It may sound strange, but it's true. Some people dream of a good job, and it comes true when they're older. When you show your dreams to others, you show your creativity and feelings. Colors can show how you feel. Thinking is part of dreaming. You dream first, then think about it. Dreams make you unique. Everyone's dreams are different. Some people don't realize how hard teachers work to learn things. It can be tough to learn, but if you keep thinking it's tough, you won't learn. Always believe you can do it.\n\nKnowing that imagination is good for you is important. It helps you think of important things to say. It makes you think harder and get more ideas. Imagination is like always having an idea in your mind. You get many ideas from dreaming of important things to share. People like to share their dreams, which is good. Sharing makes your imagination grow and you become more creative. I like to dream because it makes me more creative and excited to make new things. When you dream about something, you get excited and try to make it real.\n\nScientist Albert Einstein said imagination is important, and he was right. He had a lot of imagination and made amazing inventions. He was smart and could solve tough math problems. His dreams made him famous. Think about his hard work. Could you work that hard on your own inventions? Life has many challenges, but if we dream we can succeed, we should dream and be creative to share ideas with others. We thank Albert Einstein for what he taught us.\n\nRemember, imagination is always with us. We just need an idea to start dreaming. When people hear your dream ideas, they get creative too. It shows them what can become real. Without imagination, it would be hard to think of important things. When someone needs help thinking, share your ideas so they can start dreaming. That's why imagination is so important."}

It is good because it gets students ready for their future jobs. They can also finish their training early. First, if students pick a job in high school, they will learn a lot before college. For example, a student named Generic_Name from Generic_School said his high school classes helped him with his future job. He felt lucky because his classes pointed him to his career. He did better in college than others because he was ready. So, it is smart to start getting students ready for jobs early. Second, if students focus on a job in high school, they can finish their training quickly. For example, Generic_Name, who is good at literature, got her master's degree in two years. She got a Literature Certificate in high school after four years of study. This certificate let her finish her master's degree fast in college. In short, choosing high schools that help students with their careers is the best. But, some people think it is bad because fifteen-year-olds are not ready to choose their future. For instance, Generic_Name chose to be an art teacher for kids but changed his mind later. It was too late to change his career. Still, high school classes for a career are good. Most students will have two important certificates or degrees after high school. In the end, high schools that help students with careers are great.

They don't get as tired or feel like giving up on their usual tasks. \n\nHard workers often find they need rest because they get tired quickly. Take my friend, Generic_Name, for example. He's a good student and always does his homework. He works hard to get good grades. But when he doesn't get something, he asks for help. By the end of the year, he's exhausted. His hard work made him a good student, but he lost his friends because he didn't spend time with them. I also tried to do too much in my first year of high school. I joined many clubs, played sports, and tried to keep up with everyone. But it wore me out. I stopped playing sports and left the yearbook club to rest and have fun with friends. I learned that being busy all the time isn't good. \n\nPeople also quit their dreams and pick things they don't like, then they stop doing them. Students who want to be rich pick majors they don't enjoy. Many change their majors in college. They want jobs that pay well, so they pick tough subjects. Like Generic_Name's sister, who wanted to be a lawyer even though she didn't like law. She tried it in college but switched to teaching math because she likes it. She said law was too much work and she almost gave up. I had a similar experience with basketball. I wasn't great but made the team. It wasn't fun, and I felt like quitting. I'm glad I was on the team, though. Working non-stop can make you faster and better. But if it's not fun, you might not reach your goal. \n\nSome think you do more if you're always busy. It's amazing what you can do if you don't stop. Working hard can make you better. But too much work without breaks can tire you out and make you quit. Sometimes doing nothing is better. You don't stress about goals or work hard every day. Working all the time is bad. It makes you tired and want to stop. Being happy and having fun with friends is better. Don't overwork. There's more to life waiting for you to explore."}

They choose their high school classes to help them get ready for that job. They love to learn because they care about their future job. For example, young students might find something they enjoy doing or someone might show them. They often keep doing what they love. They know it's their passion and they keep getting better at it. At school, they can take classes to learn more about their chosen job. Schools offer programs for students interested in certain jobs. For example, some students want to be nurses. Many schools have nursing classes. These classes teach them how to care for patients and about the human body and sicknesses. Students get more excited about their job when they learn in these special classes. Students who know what job they want don't care about other things. They only think about that job and work hard to get it. They believe they can succeed just like others have. Students who stay focused on their chosen job will reach their goals. It's smart to know what job you want after high school."}

My reasons are that we can meet our goals quicker, our bodies will learn to work hard, and it will stop us from being lazy. My first reason is that we can meet our goals quicker. In our world, everyone has goals. If a person is not busy working towards their goal, they won't reach it quickly. How can they expect to achieve their goal without hard work? Another reason is that our bodies will learn to handle hard work. Scientists say that the more we do something, the better our bodies can handle it. If we keep working hard, our bodies will get used to it. Some people think that doing something all the time leads to stress. But they are wrong. If we can eat, talk, and walk without stress, then regular work won't stress us out. My last reason is that we won't become lazy. Many people who don't do much say they are too busy or tired. But often, they are just lazy. Being lazy is bad. It stops you from doing things that could improve your future. In conclusion, I really think that staying active helps us do more. It helps our bodies get used to hard work, lets us reach our goals quicker, and stops us from being lazy. Ask yourself: have you ever finished something without being active and working for it?"}

{"text_id": "23058E7FEBF8", "output_essay": "Should people choose for themselves, or should they ask experts before choosing? Many people choose based on how they feel. Life has many challenges, and there are mean people everywhere. If people were kind to each other, the world would be a better place. But people can be cruel. They often hope for others to fail, not succeed. There are about seven billion people in the world. People are all around, but many feel lonely and sad because they are scared of each other. It's hard to trust friends now. Even though people might need help from experts when times are tough, choosing for themselves is better for their lives. Choosing for themselves helps people feel good about themselves, learn how to make choices, and be on their own. \n\nFirst, people who choose for themselves feel better about themselves than those who depend on others. People should make choices that affect their lives. As a student, I asked my counselor for help with a family problem about my dad. I had trouble with my father and hoped my counselor would help. I told her my problems, but her solution made things worse. She made too much of it and didn't give simple advice. I wanted to fix the problem without causing more trouble. My counselor told the school leaders and principal. Later, she lost interest and wanted to drop the matter. Her solution was worse than my original problem. She might think she fixed it, but she didn't, and I felt worthless. I felt alone and my self-esteem was very low because my school and my dad let me down. I wouldn't tell any student to get advice from their counselor on personal issues. They might end up feeling like I do. Feeling good about yourself is key to doing well in school and life. We teenagers lose our self-esteem quickly, which can lead to sadness. Making our own choices helps us be sure of ourselves and take responsibility for what we say and do. \n\nSecond, to get better at making choices, we need to start young. Parents should let their kids make choices, like picking classes, after-school activities, and food. As they grow, they'll get better at making choices for the real world. People should think about what's right and wrong when choosing. People often promise things when happy and give up when sad. It seems hard, but it's important to not let feelings control our choices. If we control our emotions, we can make better choices. We make mistakes when we let feelings decide for us. Taking a moment to think before we choose can help us pick the best option for our lives. \n\nThird, choosing for ourselves helps us feel independent. Relying on others can be risky and lead to regret. Being independent is valuable. That's why people in the past fought for our country's freedom. They knew being free and not controlled by others was important. Choosing for ourselves lets us guide our lives. It makes us sure of ourselves and helps us make a difference in our community. Being independent makes us happy. Many women don't get to choose for themselves; their parents or husbands do. In some places, women can't do much. Everyone should have the freedom to be themselves and make their own choices without bad results. \n\nWhile choosing for ourselves is usually better, asking experts can also be good. Experts who listen and guide us can be useful. They use science and logic, but not all problems can be solved that way. Getting expert help might seem safer and easier, but it can make us less sure of ourselves. Talking to others about choices can feel good, but it can also lead to trouble, like having ideas stolen. Asking others for help might make sure we're doing the right thing, but it can also make us less able to handle problems. Overall, choosing for ourselves is better for getting ready for the real world and for not blaming others for our mistakes. \n\nIn conclusion, choosing for ourselves is better than letting experts choose for us. People are not always nice; they can be bad. Trusting others is hard. People like to see others fail. Telling secrets is dangerous. People betray each other. Keep your plans to yourself. Try to make your own choices to be independent, get better at choosing, and feel good about yourself."}
{"text_id": "90E603794946", "output_essay": "I think that we get more done when we are always busy. The more you do, the more you get. Staying busy helps us stay ahead and fit. People who work hard every day make more money. This is because when you work longer and do your job well, you get paid more. But if you sit around and do nothing, you won't make any money. Let me give you an example. Imagine you and a friend are building a shed. You work very hard for weeks and finish a big shed. Your friend only spends two days and ends up with a half-finished shed. \n\nBeing busy also helps you stay ahead with projects. If you have a project due next Friday, many people wait until the last minute. Their work is often bad or rushed. But if you start on Monday and finish by Tuesday night, you've done a good job. Plus, you don't have to worry about it for the rest of the week. If your job involves a lot of paperwork, doing more now means less to do later. If you work two extra hours in the evening, you'll have less to worry about the next day. \n\nStaying active also keeps you fit. For example, if you go to the gym every day, do sit-ups for two hours, push-ups for five, and then play baseball, you'll stay in shape. Eating apples and fruits every day will also make a big difference. If you don't stay active, you might get sick or gain weight. You might spend all day playing video games, not getting any sunlight, and eating bad food. You also won't go to the gym. In the end, I think it's better to always be doing something. Being active gets you more and helps you in the future. It keeps your body healthy and strong."}

For example, when you read a book without pictures, you picture in your mind what it would look like with pictures. Imagination is your own world that only you can go into. It's how you think in your own way. Knowledge is what you know and your intelligence. Imagination makes learning simple and enjoyable. You see images in your mind that help you understand. But imagination is not as important as knowledge. Knowledge is your thoughts, and imagination is the images in your mind that help you think. Knowledge is your thoughts and intelligence. But it can be dull to read a book without pictures. Doing homework can be dull too. You just think about finishing it and handing it in. Knowledge is useful in life. It helps you in school and gets you a good job. Imagination is images in your mind that make things easier and more fun. Here's an example: when you play hide and seek, and you're hiding, you might think of a spy movie. You act like the spy to not get caught. This makes the game more fun. And you can imagine pictures when you read a book without them. So, do I agree with Albert Einstein? I do because you should enjoy life and make the most of it. When life is dull, just think of something fun. Knowledge is useful, and so is imagination. Together, they are a great mix. You have fun with your work and finish it on time while having fun."}

If they start young, they'll have more time to pick the job they really want.\n\nThe first reason this is smart is that it helps students learn about their job. The more they know, the better they get it. Students can figure out what to do next. They can check if they still like the job they picked. More schools will take them in because they know a lot about the job they want.\n\nThe second reason this is smart is that students have already made plans for their job. They don't have to look for it later. Without a plan, students won't know what job they want. They won't feel stressed about finding a job. Planning early helps them get the job they want.\n\nThe third reason this is smart is that students will have more time to pick a job. Those who wait until they finish school to choose will have a hard time. They haven't studied or learned about the job they want. This gives them time to think if they really want that job. Students also have time to look into jobs, find classes, and pick the right schools. It's better to start young because they'll know which job they want to pick.\n\nIn conclusion, students should know what job they want early on.

{"text_id": "4E3E28469C88", "output_essay": "Ralph Emerson had an interesting thought. I agree with him. I can picture him thinking about the words, 'Unless you try to do something beyond what you know, you will never grow.' When he thought of this, he may have been afraid to try new things. But I think he also felt brave enough to do them. First, Emerson didn't just think about these words. He wrote them down. He didn't write them just for himself. I believe he wanted to change how we think. We often settle for what we know. But that doesn't always make us happy. His words make me want to try new things and find out what I really want. We shouldn't stay in one place because we're afraid. His words tell us to move and learn more every day. Second, we often get stuck on problems. I remember when I was young, I fell in a park and lay on the grass for an hour. I didn't want to get up because it felt good. But when my mom found me, she said it was time to go home to my nice bed. I think about this when I read Emerson's words. He means we should grow in our thinking, not just in what we have. For example, a rich person may want more money. They grow richer but not wiser. I think it's better to grow as a person. To be kind, respectful, honest, and make friends. This makes us better than we were. In conclusion, remember Emerson's words: 'Unless you try to do something beyond what you know, you will never grow.' This is the key to being a better person. Even if you're scared, you can do it."}

This is useful for almost everyone in the US, as you can buy things from other states too.\n\nI like to shop online because it fits my busy schedule. I go to school in the morning and work at night. I don't have much time to go to stores. Sometimes store workers are not nice. Once, my mom and I went to buy baby formula, and the manager was rude to us. We found the formula ourselves. I was angry, but I didn't say anything. It's better to not deal with rude people.\n\nNot talking to people can be good. Many workers don't seem happy to see customers. When I worked at a sandwich shop, I liked to smile and ask people about their day. Some people don't have anyone else to talk to. Technology is also good for people who don't have cars. They can order things online and get them delivered. You can even get food delivered fast, like Chinese food in 30 minutes.\n\nBut shopping online can be risky. Hackers can get into your accounts and take your money. My dad's credit card was used by someone else. He found out when his bank told him he spent too much.

To lose weight, you need to be active and not avoid exercise.\n\nEducation is also important. School is a common way to get an education. Students worldwide go to school to learn and get ready for the future. Some study hard for good grades. Others don't study and do nothing. Those who study can do more in life than those who don't. Some students regret not doing well in school when they can't find a good job later. Always try hard in school. Even if you're not perfect, do your best and don't quit.

But if students forget what they learned, they need to review. Teachers should make a plan for this. I think we should keep summer vacation as it is. Students are smart. When they come back to school, they can catch up. Everything in life is a process."}

We could make new tech things, which would make our school better and more fun for others to join.\n\nPicture a student leading a class and everyone is focused. That would be interesting, right? If a teacher can't come, we could have students from the club teach or help with their subjects.\n\nSome students dream of being astronauts. What if we had a program to help them? It would be exciting because you could go on trips, talk about your future job, and get answers to your questions. I hope to see my friends go to space one day.\n\nAs a child, I loved big science labs with lots of equipment and tools. What if our school had one? It would be fun and useful. We want a big lab instead of doing experiments in class, which can be dangerous, like starting a fire. With a big lab, we would have rules to keep everyone safe.\n\nI really think these new clubs and a big lab would make our school better at teaching and a fun place for kids to learn."}
{"text_id": "AD7A25FEC2EA", "output_essay": "When I'm at school, there are extra things to do after class. You can stay and join in. Students do these things because they like them or find them interesting. Schools have these extra things to do so students can do more than just study. Clubs and help groups are examples of these things to do. Why do students like after-school things? They like them because they pick what they want to do. Students can show who they are in these things. For example, there will be a show after school for showing talents. Why do students join in? They might have special skills they want to show off. Talent shows let students share what they can do in a fun way and have a good time with friends. Students also learn from these things. If there's a science event at school, those who love science and work hard might join. Having friends there and a good feeling makes it fun. Some things teach you as well. Like a cooking group for those who like cooking. They join to make food and learn new things to cook. School spirit grows at things like football games, where students make signs and cheer for their team. Things can teach by talking about big world problems or showing students different jobs they might do. In the end, all things to do can teach you in some way, and students can have fun while they learn. Students might join something because they are good at it or just like it. Whether it's to help the school or be part of a special thing, students often do things for fun. In all, school things to do can teach you in many ways and students like them a lot."}

My first reason is that being lazy is bad for your health. It can lead to sickness. For instance, my grandma didn't move much. She always sat on her couch. Then, she started to get blood clots and later got bone marrow cancer. Moving around is good for you. It helps you not get sick a lot.\n\nSome might say that doing nothing is good. They say it's better than making mistakes while trying to do something. But I disagree. We do more when we keep busy. Here's another example.

You can choose to do nothing and watch Netflix or be busy and get a lot done.\n\nIn the end, I believe that doing nothing will not help us succeed in life.

{"text_id": "5F12064C5746", "output_essay": "Students choosing a career early is a great way to plan for their future. First, they can learn which jobs they like and might want to try. They also get a better picture of what these jobs are like, which helps them make good choices. Plus, getting experience gives them a clearer idea of the work they want to do. Some people think that thinking about careers early can stress students out. But this isn't true; planning helps students see what they'll do after school. They can figure out which job suits them best, understand what the job is about, and learn what it's like to work in that field.\n\nFirst, students can choose which career they want to go into. They can pick which areas they find interesting. For example, a student named Generic_Name, who likes watching technology change, is looking for a job that fits his interest. He looked into software and computer engineering. He thought he'd like software engineering more, but computer engineering was a better match for his interest. So, starting to think about careers early can help students pick what interests them. Looking into jobs early and doing research is smart. It helps students find the right job for them. If they find out the job includes things they like, they might get more interested in it. Clearly, students should pick their career early to find the best job they like and are good at. Researching jobs helps them see what the job is about and helps them decide.\n\nAlso, students can get a clearer picture of their careers by trying them out. They can understand better if they know what the jobs involve. For instance, Generic_Name, a student in a technology coding class, went on a school trip that let students see different jobs. The trip showed jobs like software and computer engineering. Generic_Name, who wanted a job in coding, tried computer engineering first but it wasn't much like coding. Then he tried software engineering and found out it was about designing and creating with code. After the trip, he knew more about what he wanted to do after high school. In short, students can get clearer ideas about their jobs after school. They can learn more about the jobs they want to do. Students will have a better picture of their careers, which helps them choose if they want those jobs. They also want to get more experience in the jobs they like.\n\nLastly, students can get more experience by trying jobs early. Experience teaches them what the jobs are really like. For example, Generic_Name, who is in a computer science class, got to work at a company for a week through his school. He did many things that were harder than he thought. This helped him understand the job better. Experience is very important; it gives students a better view of their future jobs. It also helps them learn more and get a clearer idea of their work. Experience shows students what the job and work conditions are like. But it can also bring pressure.\n\nSome people say that choosing a career early can pressure students. However, this isn't true. For example, Generic_Name, who is looking for a job he likes and fits his studies, finds that making career choices helps him learn what he wants to do after school. Choosing a job early helps students with their future and helps them pick which careers to go after. These steps help them understand the job they want and what it involves. Students want to experience the job, especially if it's something they love.\n\nIn conclusion, students can explore and decide which career is best for them. They can make choices based on how well they see their career. They can also get more ideas about their career from their experiences. While some think that choosing a career too early could cause pressure, this isn't usually true. Students want to move forward and know what careers they will have after school. Having more time to see which careers fit them, a clear picture of the career, and ideas based on experience helps students."}

We learn together and it's better than being alone. If I don't understand something, I ask for help. Working in groups helps the whole class learn and talk more. I like to work in groups. You can talk with friends and find answers together. We all learn at the same time. In group work, my teacher has us work at different stations. We look for answers together to get a good grade. I like this because we can compete with other groups. The group that gets it right gets extra points. I get along with my classmates. We enjoy working together and time flies. You don't want to leave. My grades are good because I learn a lot in group work. It's fun and we do activities that I like. Once, I had a math class where I didn't want to work in groups.

It's a smart choice because you can stay home and buy clothes; kids can play games on the internet, and you can talk to people without being there with them.\n\nYou can buy things on the internet without going out. For example, you can order food, shoes, and clothes. When you order shoes, you pick your size. If you order clothes, you choose the ones you like. You see many clothes on the website, but you only pick what you like the most. Technology makes this easy.\n\nKids can play games on the internet by themselves. For instance, if they have a game, they can play it on the internet with friends or cousins. When they play on the internet, they can talk using a microphone. Playing games on the internet has many good points. Technology has changed so much.\n\nPeople can talk to each other easily. For example, if you live here and your family is in another country, you can call them. You can send messages to people; sometimes you can't visit your family, but you can message them every day. You can also use it for work; many people need technology for their jobs. Technology gets better every day, and if you want to talk to your family or friends, just call them.\n\nI think technology is good because it helps with everything: you can buy things on the internet, play games, and talk to people.

{"text_id": "901DD3AC6032", "output_essay": "I have a question for you: is it better to work in a group or by yourself? I think it's better to work alone these days. I have three reasons for this: friends, today's students, and big distractions. First, friends. Everyone has friends. You want to spend time with them, not with people you don't know well. Friends chat about all sorts of things. When there are many friends together, they make a lot of noise. This can stop you from getting your work done. Second, today's students. Teachers will understand this. Students can be loud and often fight. Boys wear baggy pants, and girls wear tight clothes. When students get upset, they can start fights. They talk a lot about things that are not about work. This makes it hard for others to focus. Third, distractions. Students trying to work can be easily distracted by noise. Friends can be like brothers or sisters who distract you. If you're a teacher with kids, you know what I mean. Even if you don't have these problems, imagine working hard and then getting distracted by family. That's what it's like with students. Working in a group might seem good because more people can mean more ideas. But today, people are always on their phones and fighting. They don't talk about their future much. Working alone is better. You won't be distracted, you'll feel sure about your work, and you won't feel crowded. In conclusion, if you've followed what I've said, you'll see that working alone is better. You can improve on your own. It's up to you to decide: work alone or in a group. I hope you make the right choice, teacher."}
{"text_id": "2D7557DCE6AF", "output_essay": "Have you ever heard the saying, 'If you want to make it somewhere in life, you have to start with yourself'? This saying is a lot like what Ralph Waldo Emerson said. Everyone has their own skill, dream, and goal. People get good at things in different ways. But how? Giving up, doubting yourself, and not having drive won't help you or anyone else succeed. So, what Ralph Waldo Emerson said is inspiring. He says, 'Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow.' This should make some people think. \n\nMany people don't know what they want to be in the future. It's not easy, but you have to start somewhere. Take my uncle's friend, for example. He lost his sister when she was fourteen because of a sad event. This caused a lot of bad behavior at home. It hurt him and his parents. At sixteen, he chose to honor his sister and bring the family back together. He joined the high school wrestling team. He wasn't the best, but he worked hard. He wanted to beat other teams. His sister's death also pushed him to reach his goal. \n\nBeing sure of yourself makes you feel good, both in your body and heart. But it seems easier to doubt yourself when you're not sure if things will go right or wrong. For instance, a teacher might ask a question in class. If a student isn't sure about the answer, they might wait for someone else to answer. What if the other student is right? The one who doubted might regret not speaking up. This happens to everyone, including me. But sometimes, you need to be brave even if you might be wrong. You can learn from your mistakes and do better next time. \n\nDo you think giving up is the right choice? I think giving up is for quitters. If you want to succeed, you need to always try your best. Giving up gets you nowhere. Imagine running on a track. You've done three laps and need one more to win 1,000 dollars. Would you quit and lose the money just because you don't want to run one more lap? Giving up is not the solution. You need to push yourself and get back up. You might face hard times to get where you want to be. \n\nIn the end, I really agree with Ralph Waldo Emerson. Sometimes, you need to be sure of yourself instead of doubting. Work hard to reach your goals instead of quitting. And use your weaknesses to motivate you to find your purpose in life."}

Instead of writing it by hand and copying it yourself, you can type it and print copies with a printer. This saves a lot of time. Next, you don't need to go out to shop. You can buy things from home, using online shopping and delivery. It's much easier to get what you want this way. Also, ordering food is simple.

Learning about them can be exciting. You might even visit their place or buy things they use. This is all thanks to technology. Some might say that too much screen time is a waste and not productive. But technology can also teach us to manage our time better and be more responsible. In the end, technology helps us in many ways.

I like to talk, so I enjoy being with others when I work.\n\nOne reason I think group work is better is that you have people to help you. If you find a question hard, you can ask your group for help.\n\nAnother good thing about working with others is that you learn new things. When you listen to other people, you hear different ideas. For example, if someone in your group talks about something new and interesting, you can use that idea later or tell someone else about it.\n\nSome people might say that working alone is better because they like being alone and doing things by themselves. But when they have a problem, they don't have help right away because they are alone, maybe even listening to music. Working alone does make you think for yourself, which is good, but it also means that if you get stuck, you have to figure it out alone or ask the teacher for help. The only good thing about working alone is that you can listen to music and work at your own speed.\n\nIn conclusion, Generic_Name, I really think that working in a group is more fun and helpful than working alone."}

Your first drawing might be messy, or you might get stuck on one picture. But if you keep trying, you will get better. This is true even if someone in art class says you can't draw well. Then, you go home, keep drawing, and improve. The next day, your art teacher asks you to draw your favorite things. You show her, and she is amazed. She shows your drawing to everyone. The students who doubted you will stop because you are now the teacher's favorite student in the class. The teacher says if you keep drawing well, you can join other art students in a competition. There, a judge sees your work. Everyone is impressed with your art. They like it and want to buy it. This makes you happy and shows others that you are creative. They put you in an advanced class. Over time, you might get bored and want to try new things, like writing about your favorite sports. Imagination can be anything. You think of something and want to write about it. It could lead to something great in your life. For example, you might break a record you were writing or drawing about. This makes life easy and fun. Writing is not hard for someone who knows what to think and has experience. It will be easy for them, whether drawing or writing, especially if they started young. They can become experts and get any job they want. Their children might follow in their footsteps, doing the same at home or school. As the children grow, they might change. If they get bored with what their parents did, they might lose their creativity. That's why parents should guide us when we're young. If you don't listen to your parents, you might not succeed. Or, if you work hard, you might achieve something. Sometimes you might want to be an ordinary person without much imagination, or you might want something different. It's up to you."}

This makes us ask: do we do more if we are always busy, or is there a good reason to do nothing sometimes? Many people think that doing nothing sometimes is good because it lets our brains rest. Without rest, we could pass out from being too tired, and our brains wouldn't work well. \n\nOne reason people think doing nothing is good is that it lets our brain rest. For example, after a hard day at work, you might want to just relax at home. This rest helps your brain recover and think better. You'll go back to work feeling fresh and ready for a new day. Also, when I was in 10th grade, I was very stressed about not moving up to the next grade. After I took a day off from school work, I found out I could get extra help after school. This showed me that doing nothing sometimes is helpful. \n\nAnother reason doing nothing is important is that without rest, you could pass out from being too tired, and your brain wouldn't work well. There are cases where people have passed out because they worked too hard and didn't sleep enough. If you don't rest your brain, it won't work its best. It's a fact that 95% of people who pass out do so because they are too tired. \n\nSo, this is why you should rest and take breaks to relax sometimes. \n\nSome might say that you do more by always working, like learning more. But it's a fact that people pass out from not sleeping enough because of work or school. Also, you shouldn't risk your health just to learn more. \n\nIn conclusion, doing nothing is very important for your mental health. It lets you rest.

Then they can find out what they really like.\n\nStudents have lives outside of school that can be tough to handle. Balancing school with friendships is hard.

Working with others has many good points. One is that you can talk about the topic with others. This can lead to better work, and they can finish faster. Also, it's more fun to work with others because you can chat and listen.\n\nWorking in a group makes the project more interesting. You hear more ideas, which can make the project stronger. Everyone sees things differently, and in a group, this helps. People work in their own ways. When they find what they do best, they work together well and focus.\n\nThe work turns out better with different ways of doing things. It's also easier because more people can help. In a group, everyone should help each other. This makes the work go faster, look better, and stand out.\n\nIt's nice to work with others. It makes you happy and comfortable. Working with friends is great. It's fun and helps you work better together. Trusting your friends and enjoying time with them can make the group work better. This is why working with others is often better than alone.\n\nBut, working together isn't always great. Sometimes, people don't do their part. They might not care or forget to help.

They say this because the students' work is good and important for learning. Others believe that students who are not as good at learning still deserve praise. They work very hard and learn new things, even if it's not at the highest level. I think that students who don't do as well in school actually learn more than those who do well. This is because they have dreams for the future and are ready to work hard for them. Many of these students also have jobs after school. \n\nI think that students who don't have much in life try harder to learn in school. They listen carefully when their teacher shows them how to do something new. They have dreams and want a better life. For example, some students might be very poor, but they keep trying. They are working towards their dreams. They get up early every day and do their homework. \n\nAlso, some students work after school because they need money. They still want to go to college and find new chances in life. For example, students who work after school don't have a lot of time for homework. But they still finish it and go to bed late. They hope to get a scholarship for college. Their life is tough. Some students don't have parents to help them, and the oldest ones take care of their younger brothers and sisters. \n\nIn the end, I believe that students who don't do as well in school should get praise.

Our teacher shows us what dental assistants do. I want to help people, and in the dental field, I can help those with teeth problems. My family has had teeth problems.

But others feel that schools should not let them in because they are too young. I believe young students should be allowed in these classes. I've heard students talk about this. They wonder why schools want to let in young students this year. Some doubt it's a good idea because these students are young and may not know what they want. I think it's a good idea to let young people in. They are young and can learn important skills. For example, they can learn how to run a business for when they grow up. This is why I think they should have the chance to try. Also, young students who want to join these classes should be allowed. They want to learn things that will help them later. They could tell their kids about their experience in these classes. It would be helpful if schools let them in. They could spend more than one year learning about the job they want. If they want to be an electrician, a plumber, or learn about heating and cooling systems, they could make money easily. To sum up, when we were young, we all talked about what we wanted to be. But as we grow up, we often change our minds. I think young people should have the chance to take these classes. I'll give my own story. In 9th grade, I wanted to take an electrical class because I loved it. But they wouldn't let me. In 10th grade, I tried again but the class was full. Finally, in 11th grade, they let me in. I asked my teacher why they don't let 9th or 10th graders in, and he said they are too young. I only got to take the class for two years. It's not fair that young students don't get this chance."}
{"text_id": "74203BCE46C0", "output_essay": "Ralph Waldo Emerson thought that just because you are good at something doesn't mean you can't get better. I agree with him. Some people might not agree, but he shared this idea to show that people can find out what they are really good at over time. He meant that being really good at something doesn't mean you know everything about it.\n\nThe main point of his words is to make people believe they can do more. Even if they are really good at something, they can still get better. He shared this idea to push us to try harder and see what else we can do. He thinks that we haven't found out everything about what we can do until we try even harder. Being really good at something doesn't mean we know it all.\n\nBecoming really good at something is hard for anyone who wants to be an expert. It takes a lot of time and hard work. If you want to be really good at something, you need to know it's going to take a lot of effort and be ready for a long road. Working hard not only helps you reach your goals but also shows you what else you can do, which makes you feel proud.\n\nEmerson's point is that if you think you are really good at something, you're wrong. He tells us to go past what we think we can do and find out how much we can really do. He wants us to understand that even when we are really good at something, we can still do more than we think. The idea is not to stop trying when we think we've done well but to keep trying to see what we can learn and how much we can put into something that matters to us.\n\nIn short, Emerson says that if we think we are really good at something and just keep going like before, we haven't really mastered it. We should always try our best to see what more we can do and if we can really be the best at what we do."}
{"text_id": "0DA397621836", "output_essay": "To start, people who try new things every day might find good chances, while those who do the same things every day won't learn anything new. The writer Ralph Waldo Emerson said, \"If you don't try to do more than what you can already do, you will never get better.\" I agree with this for several reasons.\n\nFirst, people who take new chances learn, grow, and this makes them feel better emotionally and mentally. For example, we all make mistakes, but we learn from them and try not to do them again. Learning from mistakes can make you a better person. And if you are a better person, you might inspire others who look up to you.\n\nNext, I agree because if you don't try new things, you won't improve or be a good example for your kids. Your kids might copy you, get stuck, and be unhappy. Being unhappy can lead to poor choices. Learning from what happens to you is good because you learn from mistakes. But it can be bad if people don't move on and just look for the easy way.\n\nMy final reason is that people who try new things often have a better and happier life. Happy people can encourage others to be happy too. Those who learn from their mistakes can stop others from making the same ones. For instance, I once slipped on a slippery spot on my way to the bus and told my sister to avoid it so she wouldn't slip too. Stopping others from making mistakes can help them make good choices and have a better life. It also makes you feel good about your own mistakes.\n\nIn conclusion, people who learn new things do better than those who don't. People who look into new things they like know more than someone who just goes to the same places and does the same things without getting better. Not learning and trying new things can make life unhappy and boring."}

I need more time than that. I need to work in the summer to make money. A long summer break doesn't mean we forget what we learned last year. But, having school all year could help us do better in class. It might help us remember what we learned better. And getting only one week off in winter makes me unhappy. I think we should have longer breaks in winter. Winter is for family time. I don't want just one week; I want the usual break. However, I do think we should get a week off in spring. It helps us stay excited about school. In the end, I think we should keep our summer break. But, I also think school all year could be good for us later on.

{"text_id": "6F6305EDCDFF", "output_essay": "\"If you don't try new things beyond what you can already do, you won't grow.\" I agree with Ralph Waldo Emerson because I believe if you are skilled at something, you will aim to improve or learn new things. But this doesn't mean you can't grow without trying new things. \n\nTo grow in life, you must first finish school. If you don't go to school or if you get poor grades, you can't move forward. Not completing school means you can't get better, you can't graduate, and you can't move forward. The only choice is to try. \n\nIn jobs, as I have seen, life is about getting a good job to grow. You start with a small job. You work, and as you get better, you might get a raise. This shows you have improved. Then, the next step is to keep getting better, which helps you move forward in life. \n\nFrom what I've seen, I back up Ralph Waldo Emerson's idea. If you're not good at something, you can't move forward. The only way to grow is to be good at something and work very hard for what you want. Once you find what you're good at, you can grow."}

Staying busy is a part of our lives and it's good for us. Busy people often live well. They stay healthy, do well, and learn new things. On the other hand, not being busy can lead to problems with health, how you act, and what you can do.\n\nFirst, busy people are usually healthier. Many people who stay busy live healthily, but not all. Even though most busy people are healthy, some are not because of where they live. Lots of people say they are too heavy and not happy. Being too heavy can make you stressed and sad because you're not busy. Stress and sadness can ruin a healthy life. While many busy people are healthy, some are not. Staying busy helps you fight sickness. If you don't move much and are not healthy, you won't have the energy to fight sickness, which can make you very ill.\n\nAlso, not being busy can stop you from doing well in life. Busy people are the ones who meet their goals and do well. Being busy teaches you to work hard and be on your own. My dad once said, \"If you work hard, stay focused, and take care of your responsibilities, you will do well in the future.\" Doing well comes from hard work. To do well, you must try your best, focus on work, and keep busy with your life goals. But, some busy and hardworking people don't meet their goals because they stop trying once they finish a job. This is not how to do well because to do well, you should keep busy or try new things.\n\nLastly, busy people always learn something new. Being busy shows you how to do new things or do things in a different way. People learn from their mistakes because they keep trying. For example, I wanted to learn to play the drums. I kept busy, trying to find a beat with buckets and cans to make sounds like drums. Over time, I saw that this helped me get better. I didn't stop but kept trying to learn more. I joined a drum class, and that's when I really improved and reached one of my big goals. Being busy teaches you to be sure of yourself, patient, and excited to learn new things. People who are not busy often don't care about learning and are not patient. Learning new things is a way to do well and opens your mind.\n\nNot being busy won't help us in life; it will only lead to sadness, not understanding, and not taking care of things. Being healthy, doing well, and learning all come from staying busy. We get more done if we keep busy. Think about not being busy. What will you learn, what goals will you meet, or how will your health suffer? I leave you with this today: not being busy is not good, but staying busy will help you in some way."}

By the end of the day, everything is done. Working in a group is good if there's a big job and my boss wants it done by tomorrow. I can't finish it alone so quickly; I need help. If I ask my friends to help, we can get it done in time. Bosses sometimes give you a project, like a finance presentation due the next day. I can write the presentation, and someone else can make the finance graph. I think this way is better. But working alone can be good too because other people might distract you. Then I lose focus and forget my work. If I talk too much, my boss gets angry, and I could lose my job. This happened to my dad because he was texting at work and distracting others.

Take it easy and use your brain. Planning is key; there is no point in working if you don't have a goal. Rest, make a plan, like how to get the job you want or how to save money. Taking time to think is a good idea. We often forget to think when we are busy, and taking time for self-reflection is good. Some people say that we do more if we are always busy.

Also, the little kids can help the big kids remember to relax and have fun, which can make them less stressed. \n\nAnother reason people like this system is because it seems to stop bullying.

If they are at school longer, they might cause more trouble. Students who don't like school might even protest. \n\nLast, too much time studying could make our brains very tired. I sometimes feel tired after my second class. This is because we do hard thinking, like in math. More class time means we have to think harder. This could make us upset easily. When we get upset, we can't focus. This could make our grades worse because we are too upset to think. \n\nIn the end, the time we spend at school now is already enough. Some people might think more school time is good. But I don't think so. Our school time should stay the same. The school board should not make it longer for our own good."}

Thomas Jefferson said this because he always worked hard.\n\nNext, the President should work a lot for everyone. The President supports the community, and the community helps those in need. But, Thomas Jefferson is famous for his big impact on the world. Being lazy means you're not doing what you should.\n\nAlso, working a lot for the President can be tough. It means finishing all the work we have, like in the community when we work together on fixing streets, cleaning rivers, and helping society. We all want to make the community better. Thomas Jefferson was well-known in York, Washington, and he was important in the American War. He worked hard all his life.\n\nIn the end, we need to keep trying because being lazy doesn't add anything good to the community. Thomas Jefferson stressed this because he believed in working hard together. First, we should decide to never be lazy when we're helping others, just like Jefferson did by always working.

We can see news from all over the world. We can chat with friends and family. Technology helps us meet new people and learn new things. On the bad side, technology changes how we live. People stay inside because they are on their phones. For example, some people look at their phones while driving or walking. This can lead to accidents. For me, it's a tie because without technology I would feel bored. I wouldn't know what's going on in the world. In my country, I couldn't even talk to my family. With technology, I can enjoy video games and watch TV or movies. But there are bad sides too. For instance, technology lets us have fun and helps people find ways to heal diseases.

On your way, you can read books, watch movies, play games, shop, and listen to music. You can do all this with technology; it's amazing. Does technology make people's lives better?\n\nI believe technology makes our lives better because of what it lets us do. For instance, I just got back from camping and forgot my camera's tripod. So I ordered a new one on Amazon. I love technology because you can choose fast shipping on some shopping sites. I always choose this fast option. Technology makes people's lives better.\n\nTechnology is powerful because it helps people buy things like car parts, shoes, clothes, and home goods. Imagine you move into a new home and need to buy stuff for it. You go to the store and get most things. But you still need two more items. What if you can't find them in any store? I would use my phone to buy them online.\n\nSome think technology is bad for us, while others say it's good. For example, imagine a person and his friend get a taxi. The driver talks to them. The friend feels it's rude to ignore the driver. This is because he was busy on his phone with headphones on. When the driver asks a question, he doesn't answer. His friend has to tap him to get his attention. This shows how technology can be bad for us.\n\nIn conclusion, I think technology is more good than bad for us. Sure, there might be some bad effects, but mostly it's good. For me, it will always be good. I think technology is wonderful. The people who create technology are changing the world. Technology really helps with things like reminders and timers."}

Both adults and children can join in fun learning activities. This gives them a chance to try something new, share great ideas, and challenge one another. They can find activities that everyone enjoys and has fun with. Children can be in school plays and do other activities after school. Being in a play can make children feel more sure of themselves. It helps them show their confidence to an audience. Children will also start to like doing things other than just watching TV. If they don't want to act, they can help behind the scenes by making costumes or writing the play. Not every day will be perfect. Some people might not be happy with what they have to do. But in the end, good things will happen. Trying new things can make people interested, help them share ideas, and work as a team. To make a play, people need to think of ideas together. Writers, actors, and the crew behind the scenes all help make the play. This can teach them a lot. As they think of ideas, they are also learning to think in new ways. To keep the audience interested, the writers have to be creative and add surprises and drama to the play. Sharing ideas helps everyone think together, which is good for teamwork. Sometimes there are contests for plays. They judge who acts the best and has the best plan. This makes everyone work harder. They want to win. Even if they don't win, they learn the importance of hard work and focus. Some people might be too shy to speak in front of others. That's normal. But being in plays can help them become more confident when facing an audience. If someone has been in a play before, they won't be as scared the next time. Only those who work hard will win, not those who don't try at all. Being in plays is a fun and educational activity. I think doing fun and useful things can change your life. Adults and children should do fun things. They get to try new things, share smart ideas, and take part in contests. Life is not about staying still. It's about doing things to make life exciting for everyone."}

On other days, we start at 6 pm and end at 9 pm. My friends give me a ride to practice and take me home after. Track has one season that costs 75 dollars. It's a great way to make new friends because many people join and everyone is friendly. Track is fun but also tough. We do hard drills and warm-ups, which are harder in the heat. Warm-ups last over 30 minutes. Then we choose an activity like long runs or sprints. We are put into groups by age, like 13-14 and 15-16. Practices are hard. We get very tired and it's hard to breathe. The best part of track is the meets where we race and compete. Track keeps us active. My friends and I have been doing it for two years. Coaches are strict but nice, depending on how you perform. You don't need much gear for track, just a water bottle and running shoes. Some runners wear spiked shoes and tight clothes, which can help you run better. The track season is from March to June. It's a big commitment, even waking up at 11 am on Sunday. Track prepares you for other sports with running like football, basketball, and baseball. The best practices are on the track. Sometimes we practice on grass, which is harder and we don't like it. Kids often trip on grass. Grass can cause ankle injuries, which are painful to fix. Running on a track feels more professional and it's flat. In short, we enjoy track because it's simple, doesn't need much gear, and it's good for other sports."}

It also stops us from doing silly things. Instead of having short school days where we learn nothing, I think we should make the day longer by one and a half hours. Here are three reasons why. First, with more time, you can study or finish homework. You can also play sports in the last hour. Schools want to give us more time to prepare us for our future jobs and tests. Second, schools don't want to cut hours because students need time to study and do homework. If they don't have time, they won't do it. Some students want longer hours to help clean the school. But others don't like school and don't want to work. They want to be free to do what they want. If we cut hours, the school will be too busy and messy.

Many schools offer lots of activities, classes, and company programs. They want their students to think about what jobs they want in the future. Schools try to get students ready for jobs they like by giving them chances to work with companies and do internships. But some people think schools should not help students find these chances. They say students use these chances too much. In truth, schools should work with companies to give students a better shot at getting the jobs they want and to prepare them for the future. \n\nSome people say schools should not help students find jobs because they think students get too many chances and don't take them seriously. They want students to learn how to find jobs on their own. But companies should know that smart students can make their businesses better and bring new ideas. This is because students learn from working with companies at school. It's hard to get a job if you have no experience. \n\nStudents can plan their future and get the job they want if schools give them chances like working with companies. For example, I want to be a nurse because it's about saving lives and caring for people. My school has a nursing program, but it's not as good as working with a real company. People think students learn better by doing. They want schools to give more chances to work with companies. This way, students are more likely to get the job they want. Every student should have the chance to find the job they like. If a school doesn't offer this yet, it should be for students who really want to do something with their lives and know what job they want. Students should have these chances to get the job they like. \n\nAlso, if schools offer more chances to work with companies, students can see if a job is too hard or easy for them. They can learn about the job and decide if they really want it. Some schools have programs for certain jobs. I wish my school would let me work with a nursing company to see if it's right for me. I'm good with people and like helping the sick. Working with a company would be a great experience. I would be ready based on what I've seen and learned.

If teachers let students work in groups, they would be more efficient with projects or schoolwork. Some might worry that students will distract each other in groups. I don't think that will happen.

He has been doing this for two months each year since he was young. Summer is the only time he can see them because they are on vacation too. Now think about why schools should not cut summer break short. Schools should keep summer break long because it can be stressful and not fair to make it shorter for students. \n\nSchool can be very hard for students. Being in school too long can make students feel very sad. For instance, students often feel sad because of problems at home and other reasons. If they had to stay in school longer, it could make them feel even worse. This could lead to even bigger problems. School is important for students, but they should not be there too much. \n\nIt's not fair to have a short break for students and teachers. Teachers and other staff would not get a long break either. They have families to look after. Some students work in the summer to help their parents. Summer can be fun for some students, but others use it to work or get better at something. This is important for many students and teachers. \n\nIf summer break was shorter, students would be in school more. Usually, students are in school for 8 hours and then they are with their family. They should spend more time with their family, and that's why summer break is needed. Schools help students learn and finish school. But after that, they often forget what they learned. For example, if students only had 3-4 weeks of summer break and then went back to school, they would see that being in school more doesn't help them learn useful things. \n\nStudents should have a long summer break.

It lets teachers and students volunteer to help those who are having a hard time. Also, some schools have a homework club or a place to study after school to help students who can't finish their homework. First, students who find some subjects hard, or just want to finish their homework early, can use the club. This includes subjects like science, social studies, English, and history. It depends on if you're in elementary, middle, or high school. Students can stay after school with a teacher who wants to help. Teachers might tell students who are struggling to stay after school with them. Elementary school can be easy, but it gets harder in grades 3-5. Middle and high school can be even harder. Some teachers ask students to stay after school to study for big tests, like the SOLs. This depends on the classes students pick for the next year. Second, teachers and good students can volunteer to help others with their homework. If a teacher is busy, a student volunteer can help someone else. The student who is helping can show how to find the answer. Next, having a homework club has good and bad points. The good things are that students can stay after school to finish homework. They can start early on tests, quizzes, or projects. After school, they can go home and try to finish with family, alone, or by borrowing a computer. Some students don't have computers at home. They might have a phone or tablet instead. They can't do their homework at home but need a computer, so they stay after school for help. Teachers can tell students who need help to join the club. Any school can have a homework club. The bad thing is some students say they will do their homework but don't. If there's a test, they might fail. Homework helps practice what was learned before. Many teachers suggest it, but some students don't want to stay after school. They might make excuses. This happens a lot in middle and high school. They don't worry if their grades get worse. Colleges look at grades when students apply. Finally, schools like elementary, middle, or high schools might have a homework club. It helps students who can't finish homework, want to finish early, need to study for tests, or have a project to do. Schools in different places, like Generic_School in Generic_City, have a homework club. They bring in volunteers who are good at subjects to help students who really need it. They give snacks to students who stay after. They can eat and study with their tutor. Things might change over time. Every school is different because they are run differently. For example, Generic_School has Study Zone every weekday. On days without late buses, like Tuesday or Friday, students need to plan a ride if they stay after school. On other days, like Monday, Wednesday, and Thursday, there are late buses. Students can stay with teachers to catch up on missed work. They can choose to stay for a part of the day or go home with someone. In conclusion, research shows that starting a homework club after school can improve student grades. A homework club is great because it helps students who find subjects very hard. Teachers and students can help those who don't understand their work. Some schools have a homework club or study area to help students finish their work."}

To end, think if you could never go outside in your life. How would you get to feel the outside world? Here are my reasons why being outside is fun: because it's funny, enjoyable, and calming."}

Students enjoy doing things in summer like playing sports, going on trips, and having parties. Many students work to make money in the summer. They get to sleep more and then can work or spend time with friends. It's not a good idea to have only 3-4 weeks off in the summer. I also think they should keep spring break and the breaks in spring and fall the same. It doesn't seem right to me because students will already get days off in winter when it snows. They should not change it or maybe just let students choose to go to summer school. If they want to go, they can just sign up."}

When we do things that bring good into our lives, we should do them. For example, the President wants to make people happy and make the country look good. Parents work not for themselves, but to make their family happy. I believe many people work to improve their lives. Some think that doing nothing means you won't reach your goals. But I believe that if you work with all your heart, things will go well. That's why you should keep doing things that make you happy and improve your life.\n\nSome people are very lazy; they do nothing. They sit all day, play games, or drink and smoke. Some don't have a home because they are too lazy to get a job. They expect the government to help them with everything. But this is bad for someone who can use their arms and legs. Yet, there are people without arms and legs who still work to make their family's life better. For example, Americans want their kids to learn so they can have a good life later. They don't want their kids to suffer.\n\nWe must work hard to make our lives better. When we stop being lazy, life can be good. Life can be easy; don't make it hard. When you have peace and love, nothing is too difficult. When there's a problem, try to fix it and listen to your heart. We must live our lives. But don't trust anyone without thinking. Believe in what you feel is right. Some say life is hard, but it's people who make it hard for themselves. We shouldn't give up. Let's work together.\n\nLet's think about why Thomas Jefferson said, 'Determine never to be idle... It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing.' Do we do more if we keep busy, or is there a reason to do nothing sometimes? He believed that if people work together, they can make their country better and feel good about it. Like when you have a farm, you want it to look good. That's what Thomas wanted for his country. With good parents, everything will be fine for you.\n\nIn my view, people don't always win in life. There are wins and losses, so we need to focus and not be lazy. We should make our country look good. We need love and peace. When someone loves you a lot, you don't need to hate others. Thomas wanted to remind us to work hard to reach our life goals."}

I think that telling a student they did well just to make them feel good, even if they didn't try their hardest, is not right. Students need to believe in themselves to learn. If they don't believe in themselves, how can they feel good about themselves? \n\nBelieving in yourself is very important. Not everything in life is positive. Often, people will say bad things hoping to see you fail. Believing in yourself can make you feel better about yourself. Many people worry about what others say or think about them. This shouldn't be important because it's just someone else's view. \n\nSometimes, you might look at others and feel less. But this isn't helpful. It's better to stay positive and believe in yourself. It's also good to spend time alone and understand yourself better. Everyone makes mistakes, but that's fine. Making mistakes means you are learning and trusting in yourself. I think many people struggle with feeling good about themselves because they listen to negative comments too much. \n\nI really think that telling a student they did well when they didn't try their best is wrong.

Still, technology keeps getting better every year. We have new things like fast cars, TVs, cameras, microwaves, and cell phones that spread technology even more.\n\nComputers can be annoying when they don't work. Once, my computer deleted my work while I was writing a paper. Technology helps those who need it. But, it often stops us from getting our work done.

Some people think you should not pick me because I am lazy. But you should pick me because I learn quickly and I am very interested in your company's work. People say I am lazy because I don't like boring work. I also don't show excitement when I do things. For example, in 9th grade, I found math boring and slept instead of working. I only show excitement when I really feel it. That's why some call me lazy. But I learn quickly when I like something. I try to learn fast so I can do it on my own. In gym class, I learned to play basketball fast because I liked it. At my first job, I learned to cook quickly from a friend. When you like something, you learn it fast so you don't need help. I will work hard to learn quickly at your company. I am also very interested in your company's work. I want to know how you install air conditioning and how you choose the right size for a house. For example, does a three-level house need one machine or more? I want to see how you install and fix machines.

Sometimes, people are shy in groups and keep good ideas to themselves. I remember in 7th grade, my history teacher often had us work in groups. I wanted to work with my friends, but she put me in a different group. I was quiet until a girl asked my name and told the others. They were nice, and I started sharing my ideas. We all did different things, and in the end, we did well. I think working in a group is better. You meet new people and learn what they think. Thank you for listening. Sincerely, Generic_Name."}

These can include a kids' play area, walking on trails, and jumping out of planes with a parachute. Most parks have these kinds of things to do.\n\nOne fun thing is the kids' play area, also known as a playground. It's mostly for kids up to 12 years old. It's handy because you can let your kids play there while you relax on a bench. Why do kids like it? It's a place for them to go out, meet other kids, and maybe make new friends. It's also good for them to move around and get some exercise.\n\nAnother thing to do is walking on trails, or hiking. You won't find trails in community parks, but you will in state and national parks. Walking on trails is enjoyable. You get to be close to nature. But be careful, you might see a dangerous animal like a bear or a snake. That could ruin your day. But most times, you'll have a wonderful time.\n\nThe last thing is jumping out of planes with a parachute, known as skydiving. It might look scary, but it's exciting once you get the hang of it. People like it because it feels like flying. It's also a brave thing to try. If you're not afraid of heights, you might like skydiving.\n\nIn summary, these things to do are great for parks, especially big national ones. Playgrounds are best for little kids. Walking on trails is good if you like nature and don't run into bears. Skydiving is for those who are brave. All in all, these things are fun for most people."}

Acting well and having a positive outlook can change how others act in different places, like in sports and at school. \n\nHaving a positive outlook can change others. For example, in sports, if a football team loses a game, they will be upset. But if one player stays positive, this can change how the rest feel. This player knows how to handle winning and losing. He will tell his teammates that winning or losing is not everything. There will be times when you have to accept both. You should always stay positive. So, the team will learn that staying positive helps them deal with losing. \n\nYour actions and outlook at school can also change others. School is a place where how you act really matters. If you go to school in a bad mood every day, it will hurt your grades. This happens because a bad mood can make you not want to work. But if you see another student who works hard, gets good grades, and helps others, you will see it's because of their positive outlook. If you are positive at school, it will change others. They will see that being positive helps you do well and help others. They will understand that if they feel bad or get bad grades, it's because of their own bad mood and actions. If they see you are positive, they will want to be positive too. They will see that being positive helps them do better at school. \n\nIn the end, acting well and having a positive outlook are important to be a better person.

Also, when I see a new word, I can look it up online, which is handy. Technology is important for keeping in touch with my family. For instance, I was born in Generic_City, and when I moved to the United States with my mom three years ago, leaving my brothers, technology was the only way to stay connected to them. Without it, we couldn't talk to my brothers and our family back home.\n\nOn the other hand, I think technology can be bad. For example, at school, I don't need my phone because it takes my focus away, and I could get in trouble with my teacher if I don't listen. More, I could start losing friends if they feel I don't want to hang out with them or they're not important to me because I'm busy with technology. It could also make me talk less to my family because I'm doing things that don't matter. This is bad because if I don't talk to my friends, they might find someone else who is a better friend. Using technology too much is bad because it takes time away from things I like, such as playing with friends or reading.\n\nI know people who always use technology for things like Facebook, WhatsApp, and more. In truth, using technology all the time can waste time and stop you from doing more important things.\n\nI remember when I first came to this school, I was always on my phone because technology was very important to me since I had no friends. But as time went on, I made good friends, and now I spend more time with my family and friends, using my phone only when I need to.\n\nFor these reasons, I believe that technology has both good and bad sides."}

For example, you could talk to someone when you get coffee. But if everyone is looking at their phones, how will you meet and make friends? You'll be too busy to have a chat and share your happy or sad feelings. A counselor can be a big help because you have someone to talk to. But if you're always on your phone, you won't have anyone to share your deep thoughts with.\n\nBeing distracted by your phone at school, while driving, and at work is a big issue. Phones can take your attention away. For instance, if you're at work in a meeting, you shouldn't answer texts or calls. But you might want to know who contacted you and get distracted. Then, you can't finish talking to customers because you're on the phone. When driving, wanting to keep playing a game can be risky.\n\nShopping can be enjoyable with friends and family. They can tell you how you look. But if you're always on your phone and shop alone, no one will be there to help you. Sometimes, in bookstores, you don't know which book to pick, so you ask someone. A family night might be playing board games or Xbox. But if you're busy with your phone, you won't have time for games with your family.\n\nBeing on your phone too much can turn into an addiction. It can also hurt your eyes from too much screen time.\n\nAn addiction to your phone is tough because you use it for everything: shopping, getting books, and playing games. Too much screen time can hurt your eyes, and you might need glasses. This is hard if you need good eyesight for your job.\n\nIn conclusion, technology can reduce our contact with people. It can make tasks easier without needing someone else. But you can get things done quicker. You won't have to carry many books. You can take it with you everywhere.

I want to share the good things about working with others. It's better to work in a group because you can get better at talking to people, have more ideas, and finish work quicker. These are the reasons I think group work is better than going solo. \n\nTalking with others is a good way to get better at social skills. This is a plus of group work for students. They learn to work as a team and about working together. Being able to ask questions to a teacher or group members is useful. You learn how to speak up and ask things. Social skills are key because we use them every day, everywhere. Getting better at talking to people in school projects can help you later. Good social skills can help in job interviews and when you meet new people. I had a mock interview at school, and we had to know what to say. Speaking well in an interview is key to getting a job. Good talking skills are also important when making new friends or with family. It's good to say how you feel or ask for help because speaking up can make a difference in your life. \n\nWhen you need ideas and you're alone, it's hard to think of them. This is where group work helps. Everyone might have a good idea for the project. This makes things easier and faster. I find it hard to think of new ideas alone. But with others, it's easier and better. If you want to start a business in the future, sharing ideas with others is a smart move. You can find out which ideas are good and might work. This is why being in a group is useful now and later. \n\nIn a group project, everyone has a part to do. I remember making a poster in middle school with my group. There were four of us, and we each had a different job to get credit. We had to write, research, draw, and present. We picked my friend Generic_Name to write because he was good at it. Generic_Name did the research because he was quick and organized. I drew because I was the only one who could. And Generic_Name presented because he wasn't scared to talk in front of the class. Giving each person a job they're good at makes the work easy and quick. It helps us all and teaches us useful skills. \n\nTo sum up, group work is better than working alone. It's good because you get better at talking to people, come up with more ideas, and finish tasks faster. This is why I like to work with others. It helps me in many ways, and it can help you too."}

People who think they know everything often make big mistakes.\n\nIn conclusion, some people think asking for help is weak. But asking for help is not bad; using it wrong is the problem. I've shown how people don't ask for help or don't know how to use it right. Being independent is good, but you should still ask for advice when you're not sure."}

Technology helped me a lot to talk with my family, friends, and shop from my favorite store in Generic_City. Technology is great if you know how to use it. You can find lots on the internet, like shopping apps or information for schoolwork. You can buy clothes from a store in Generic_City, and they will send them to you. It doesn't matter if the store is far away; you can buy what you want. Also, when you need to look up something, you find it all on Google. For example, I had to write about an artist last week. I didn't know who they were. I used my computer and searched their name. Boom, I found all the info about them. But, I also saw ads I didn't like. When people use technology too much, they can get hooked. They go online to do bad things and can have problems. If you don't use it right, you can get hurt or hurt others.

{"text_id": "620CC00E6CD8", "output_essay": "I think a homework club is a great idea. Why? Because kids often find their homework hard. It's helpful for them to get support to understand it. This way, they won't have to fight so much with that subject. This is also true when they need help in a subject at school, even if they don't have homework.\n\nTake a student with homework as an example. They might think too hard about it. This can make it tough for them to do the work or get it as well as others. If the school has a homework club, then that student, and others too, can get help. They will understand the work better.\n\nAnother reason a homework club is great is that students sometimes fail their grade because of tests, like the S.O.L. This can happen in elementary, middle, or high school. They might start failing early in the year because of these tests. This makes the rest of their year hard. They fail a class just because they didn't understand or ask for help. This can make them even more worried about that subject.\n\nNow, let's talk about other big reasons for a homework club. What if the student's class is the problem? Maybe they tried to listen to the teacher but couldn't because of noise in the class. They couldn't learn because others were being loud or playing. But with a homework club, they can get the help they need and understand the subject.\n\nSo, to sum up, a homework club is a good idea. It helps students learn better at school.

Big companies help you understand business better. For example, at Nike, you can learn how shoes are made. They show you the materials they use for better shoe support. They also teach you how to work with them to do well in the company. At Walmart, which is a place where lots of people shop every day, workers learn a lot. They deal with many kinds of items and jobs. They learn to arrange products well and help shoppers find what they want fast. Even cashiers keep learning new things. Small companies, on the other hand, might not have many workers. This means you might not learn much if you want to know new things. They make fewer items, so they might only teach you things you already know. This can make your learning stop for some time. In the end, working at different companies always teaches you something. But working for a well-known company is sometimes a good idea. These companies know what they want and what they are doing. They keep trying to be the best and keep bringing in new ideas to do well. So, you always keep learning new things."}

They dream about fun activities like flying kites or playing football, not school. But imagine if they lost one and a half hours of free time. This could happen if the school board decides to make the school day longer. Most students would not want an extra one and a half hours of school. Opinions differ on this issue. I would only agree to a longer school day if it started later. I'm a student too, and I think exercise is important. A longer school day would cut into exercise time. Schools usually finish at three o'clock. With the extra time, they would end at four-thirty p.m. More school time could be good. Students would learn more instead of wasting time. It could help kids who are homeless or without parents. They could learn more and improve their lives. Parents working nine-to-five wouldn't have to leave their kids alone. Students might work harder and be more disciplined. They might get less homework since they'd have more class time. But I don't agree with a longer school day. It would harm students, the local economy, and taxpayers. Teachers would need higher pay for longer hours. The local government would have to pay them, which means higher taxes. People would protest the extra taxes needed for the longer school day. So, a longer school day would hurt students, the economy, and taxpayers. The school board should find a plan that helps students, parents, and the economy. There are a few good points to a longer day, but mostly bad ones. I hope the board leaders think carefully before making the school day longer. These are my thoughts on the subject."}
{"text_id": "B53C3B23C2A2", "output_essay": "Think about a school board in a county wanting to make school days one and a half hours longer. Doesn't that seem like a bad idea? The school board should not make school days longer. Students have other things to do, like activities, chores, and spending time with their families. First, students are busy with other things. If school is longer, they won't have time for sports or chores. For example, after school, I go to soccer practice and then do chores my mom tells me to do. I can't do these if school is longer. Next, longer school days mean less time with family. Some kids only see their parents in the afternoon. My cousin, for example, only sees her mom for two hours or less because she works at night. If school is longer, they'll have even less time together. This could make them sad or even depressed. So, the school board should not make school days longer. Some might say longer school days mean better grades, but that's not true. The Health Department of Virginia did a study. They found that 89% of students got worse grades and were very stressed when school was longer. They said making school longer is a bad idea because it hurts students. Also, many students get headaches at school, which makes it hard to focus. Longer school days could make this worse, and grades could drop. In conclusion, making school days longer will hurt students in many ways. They won't have time for their activities or chores. Most importantly, it will cut into their family time, which is very important."}

But these days, many kids stay inside because of technology. They play on their iPods or iPhones and watch TV. I think it's not good for kids to stay inside all the time. They should go out and enjoy being young. When I was young, we didn't have many parks in my country. So I would just play outside. Kids like park activities because they are fun.

So, working in a group is a smart choice.\n\nAnother reason is that people can learn from each other. Sometimes, when people work, they find something they don't know. But in a group, teammates can teach each other and learn from someone who knows more, like a specialist. An afterschool study club is a good example. Here, students help each other and learn from the teacher. By working in a group, people can help and learn. So, a group is better than working alone.\n\nSome people think working alone is better because it helps personal growth. It's true that people grow by dealing with problems and finding solutions alone. Studying for the SAT is one example. Students study in their own way. If they keep studying alone, they can find their own answers and make a study plan. When a student answers hard questions, checks their work, and looks at mistakes, they can grow well.

They say this because they believe people rely on technology too much. I disagree. I believe technology helps us a lot. It gives us things like X-rays, computers, and cell phones. Technology can make people lazy. They don't want to do things themselves. They let technology do it for them. For instance, they order food through Uber Eats instead of cooking. They shop online instead of going to stores. People can't imagine life without their phones. Some people even lose their jobs because machines can do the work now. In the past, people built cars by hand. Now, machines build cars, and workers lose jobs. On the other hand, technology has good effects. It lets us do things quickly and easily. If you miss school, you can write your paper and email it to your teacher. It's fast. You can also learn new things. If you're lost, you can use your phone to find the way. It takes less than 30 seconds. If you don't want to talk to someone, you can text or email them. Maybe you don't feel like talking one day. Just send a text. In the end, I think technology does more good than bad. It saves lives and makes our lives easier. I don't think we can live without technology. We should be grateful for the technology we have today."}
{"text_id": "2FD3308AC194", "output_essay": "I have played soccer since I was 11, on different teams and in school leagues. But once, I hurt my leg and couldn't walk on it. It was hard not to play soccer, because all my friends were on the team and I couldn't try out due to my injury. After a year, I started playing again, but I wasn't as good as before. This made me mad at first because my friends were better than me. So, I worked hard to get better at soccer. One day, while playing for a team, I did well, but another player tried to hurt my leg again. Luckily, I moved fast and he missed. After the game, I thought about what if he had hit my leg. Maybe I would get hurt again and have to stop playing. I know this could happen again and I might not get better for a long time. This year, my brother joined the school soccer team, and I'm worried because I had been hurt before. I don't want him to get hurt like I did, but I can see him playing for a big team. I really want to play soccer again because I think I could be good. I want to play soccer in college, but I can't play now unless I get my grades up. I had a friend who loved soccer. We used to walk just to watch soccer because we were too young to join the team. After a year, we tried out and got on the team. We practiced every day after school. In one game, he got hurt like I did, and I was sad because he couldn't play with me. I had to practice by myself for a year. Sometimes we won, sometimes we lost, but he got better. Then he said his family was moving so he could play for better teams. I felt mad, sad, and happy: happy for him, sad to not see him, and mad because I couldn't go. But one day, I'm going to be better than all of them."}

As we walked, Generic_Name asked me where I would like to visit. I said, 'Guatemala.' He was surprised by my choice. When we got to my house, we said goodbye with our special handshake. Inside, my parents were angry. They yelled, asking where I had been. I was scared my dad might hit me, so I lied and said I was at a friend's house. My mom said I couldn't go out anymore and sent me to my room. I thought about telling them about my girlfriend, but I didn't. They don't want me dating. I went to bed but couldn't sleep because my parents were arguing. I just used my phone until they stopped. The next morning, I remembered what Generic_Name asked. I tried to talk to my mom about it, but she didn't care. So, I snuck out to see Generic_Name. On the way, I saw my girlfriend with another guy. I felt hurt but didn't confront them. At Generic_Name's house, he said he knew I wanted to visit Guatemala. He's rich because his grandma owns a business. He even bought me a ticket to Guatemala. I was unsure about going. I spent the rest of the day trying to think of a plan. I had one week before the flight. I made up an excuse about a college scholarship. I told my mom, and she believed me but wanted to visit. I panicked inside. I ran to Generic_Name's house when it was getting dark. I told him I couldn't go. He gave me the ticket anyway. I packed, said goodbye to my parents, and Generic_Name drove me to the airport. My dad works there, and I saw him. I lied, saying I was there to say goodbye. I was nervous he'd catch me. But after security, I was safe. My dad saw me again. I tried to explain, but he already knew. He asked why I wanted to go to Guatemala. I said it was to write about the country and my family there. He let me go but wanted a good article. On the plane, I started writing. I titled it 'My Adventure to Guatemala.' I thought about my mom and the robot Generic_Name made to replace me. Then the plane took off, and I was on my way to Guatemala."}
{"text_id": "CCF04E3AD4B3", "output_essay": "Thomas Jefferson once said, \"Always be busy... It's amazing what we can do if we keep working.\" This means that if we do nothing, we won't get anywhere. We need to be busy to get things done. Some people think it's okay to do nothing because their family will do the work. But this is wrong. We do more when we take action. If not, we become lazy and don't succeed. \n\nFirst, to succeed, we must work hard for our goals. One reason is that finishing tasks means we don't worry about things we haven't done. For example, to be a doctor, you must study and work hard. Then, your effort pays off. We must try hard to do things and keep up with our duties. Another reason is that some people stop trying after they fail many times. But not everyone gives up; some get stronger from failing. For example, a 17-year-old girl looked for a job she loved. She applied for many jobs and looked online but found nothing. Then, she saw a job sign that interested her and went for it. So, keep trying is important to reach a goal. This shows that even when life is hard, it can still surprise us. \n\nSecond, doing nothing makes us lazy and gets us nowhere. Being lazy is a big problem. For example, a classmate had to clean the house before friends came over. She didn't, and the house smelled bad. She got punished, friends didn't want to visit again, and she was grounded. Laziness makes things worse and is embarrassing. Also, if we do nothing, life gets hard and messy. Think about a spoiled child who got everything while lying in bed. That child grew up and needed a job but couldn't find one because of no experience and a bad attitude. They gave up and went back to old ways. The adult didn't move forward in life. We could end up like that if we don't act. Or we could try new things and move up in life. \n\nIn conclusion, when we do something, we should see it as a step forward. This is important because looking at what we've done can make us feel good. We should all help each other to do better. The more we do, the better our lives will be."}
{"text_id": "167D451B5A78", "output_essay": "A few weeks ago, my sister told me, \"Homework club after school is really helpful. It helped me a lot in seventh grade.\" I think starting a homework club at my school is a good idea for many reasons. It is good for me and other students. It will also improve our country and save students time.\n\nI think starting a homework club at my school is good because it helps students. First, it will help many students get better grades on tests, classwork, and homework. This will make them happy and like school more. It will make their parents happy too. Parents feel happy when their kids are happy. Second, students can talk to their friends while doing homework. They can also stay after school to talk about group projects. Last, students can get help from teachers when they need it. In short, homework clubs help students get better grades, talk to friends during homework, and get teacher help.\n\nStarting a homework club is also good for America's future. It will help more people get better jobs. This means the U.S. will make more money. A character in a movie I saw said, \"Your future depends on what you did before.\" So, if we study hard now, we will get good jobs later. This will help our country. Also, more students will get good grades. When people think of America, they will think of a place with many chances. Overall, a homework club will help our country because more people will get good jobs, more students will get good grades, and it will make us proud.\n\nStarting a homework club also saves students time. Students can finish homework early. Then, when they go home, they don't have to do more work. They can enjoy time with their family or do what they like. The best part is they can join activities outside of school. This keeps them healthy and strong. It also stops them from getting tired at school. So, a homework club saves time because students can finish homework at school, spend more time with family, and stay healthy.\n\nSome students think a homework club has many bad points, but they are wrong. I agree with starting a homework club at my school. It helps students who find some subjects hard or who want to finish homework early. It is also good for our country and saves students time. A homework club will be a great help to many students, including me."}
{"text_id": "003969F4EDB6", "output_essay": "Albert Schweitzer, a thinker and doctor who helped people, once said, \"Being a good example is the only way to influence others.\" I agree that acting well is the best way to change how others act. I think this because people look up to others, doing is better than just talking, and it's always around us. Let me tell you why I think so. The first reason I think acting well is the best way to change others is that people look up to others. Both grown-ups and kids are changed by what they see others do every day. Everyone has someone they want to be like. What that person does changes what the one who looks up to them does. For example, if a TV actor for kids is nice and listens to his parents, kids watching will act nice and listen to their parents too. The second reason I think acting well is the best way to change others is that doing is better than just talking. This old saying shows this idea well. Doing things often shows more feeling than just words. Since we can see actions, they have a bigger impact on encouraging and changing others. For example, giving a high five shows being a good sport better than just saying, \"Good job.\" The last reason I think acting well is the best way to change others is that it's always around us. Babies don't know how to act; they learn by copying. Kids grow up doing what their parents do. Words don't mean much to them because they don't get them yet. As people get older, what they believe and think is always shaped by others around them. Then, what others do changes them more than words. Being a good example will always be part of our lives. Some people think there are other ways to change others. They say doing things is better to change others. They are wrong. They're wrong because doing things doesn't always change others; it can make someone want to do the opposite. Also, being a good example works better from far away than being close to inspire someone by doing things. In the end, because people look up to others, doing is better than just talking, and it's always around us, my reasons are good. These are why I think acting well is the best way to change others. Also, you should be a good example for your kids or friends, since it's the only real way to change others."}

Some people think that if you have what others don't, it's bad.

If you have a lot of good things, you can help those who don't have what they need at home. That's why I believe that having things doesn't stop you from improving. Some people who have nothing look for ways to get something.

It has changed how we think, reduced time with family and friends, and made us lazy and self-centered. First, technology has changed how we think. It tells us we can do everything alone. This makes us lonely. People don't ask for help or talk to others because they are busy with technology. For example, my little brothers used to ask me for homework help. I felt needed. But now, technology has taken my place. Second, technology has taken away time with friends and family. It makes people want to be alone. My brothers spend all day with their phones and games. They ignore what's happening with others. In many homes, technology has hurt the connection between family members. It has also hurt friendships because people don't talk anymore. Also, technology has made us lazy. We don't go to the library or shopping. We miss out on meeting people. Technology has even made us too lazy to exercise. Technology has also made us self-centered. People don't know how to start a conversation. They talk to their phones and games instead. They don't ask for help or advice when they need it. They don't notice when family and friends need help. In the end, using technology too much has bad effects. It has changed how we think, taken away time with loved ones, and made us lazy and self-centered. Many think technology is helpful, but it's not. It's taking away special times with family and friends. This is just the start. So I ask technology experts to find a way for us to use technology without ignoring our loved ones."}

We have many tools like phones, computers, TVs, tablets, and payphones. With phones, we can talk to anyone in the world at any time. TVs let us know what is happening all over the world. And technology gives us many other helpful things. Big companies make phones, including Apple, Samsung, Nokia, and HTC, along with others I can't think of right now.\n\nTechnology brings people closer. If we have friends in other countries, we can video call them to talk and see them. This is a great thing about technology. Long ago, before technology, people wrote books by hand. Now, we have printers that can print a book in 5 minutes. This shows that technology can do a lot of work quickly that people can't do alone.\n\nIn the old days, without technology, it took a year for people to learn about events. My grandfather once said, 'In his young days, people didn't even know what their king looked like.' Or they found out about a new king after a long time. But today, we learn about such things instantly from TV. We should use all this technology in good ways. Phones are a great example. We can take them anywhere and they make things much easier. We can use them for GPS, calls, finding information, taking pictures, and more.\n\nHaving all this technology is very important because life would be tough without it. People made all these technologies, and we should be grateful. Phones, computers, printers, tablets, TVs—they all work fast and smart. But they still need people to run them. They work for us; we don't work for them. We should always use them for good. I think technology is getting better every day. Each year, we will see new technology in the world. Life is better and more enjoyable with technology."}

But working alone can be hard and slow for someone to think and keep up with work. Also, it's more enjoyable to work with others than by yourself.\n\nFirst, I want to say that being in a team is better and simpler. It helps you feel sure of yourself and calm. For example, in a restaurant, filling a big order by yourself is tough and takes a lot of time. But with a team, it's quicker and easier. The customers are happy too, and that makes you feel at ease. Plus, being in a group makes you feel more upbeat and sure. You can also make more friends and spend time with them when you're not working.\n\nNext, I want to talk about when I first traveled alone to the United States from Generic_City. It was very hard. The things I had to do at immigration and the airport were confusing. My English wasn't good. I asked someone for help with the terminal, ticket, and flight times. That taught me that being alone or traveling alone is not as good as being with others.\n\nAlso, I think it's tougher to share your ideas or finish tasks alone. It takes more time. I work at a restaurant. Once, it was very busy and we were short-staffed. I had to fill a big order alone. It took me 1 hour and the customer was upset because of the long wait. I felt bad and worried about making the customer wait. That's when I saw that working alone is hard and slow.\n\nIn conclusion, I think we should always choose to work in a group when we can. It's easier and more dependable. We can also make friends and talk about our ideas together more easily in a group."}

They could use the last hour to better understand the day's lessons. Many students don't like staying after school for extra help. With an added hour, they won't need to, and it will help them a lot more.\n\nAnother reason is that sometimes we don't want to work hard in school, or we might miss or lose important papers.

They bring different ideas, which is helpful. If you make a mistake in a group, others can spot it and help you fix it. When you work alone, there's no one to check your work for mistakes. Groups can finish tasks or projects quicker. Usually, a team works better than one person alone.\n\nWorking in a group can be tough. Everyone thinks and works differently. It's hard for some to learn new ways and drop old habits. But understanding how others think and work is key when you're often in a team. With the right people, a team can do great things. At universities, group projects can become famous and help the world, like finding ways to clean water or cure diseases.\n\nTalking well with team members is important. When everyone shares ideas, the team can pick the best ones. Even a silly idea might lead to the best one. Being patient is important too, especially if someone doesn't like you or disagrees. Most problems are about who's right or wrong, so talking things through matters. Teams that are patient and talk well can do amazing things that matter to society.\n\nFrom my own group work, I've learned a lot about teamwork and always try to learn new things. Seeing how others plan and lead is interesting. It makes you think differently to understand them. Group work is like soccer; everyone has a role, like writing, drawing, speaking, or leading. Just like a soccer captain picks who plays defense, a team leader assigns the right tasks to people.\n\nWorking alone is different and can be simpler. You make all the decisions without anyone disagreeing. But it's harder because you do everything yourself, slowly and one step at a time. Choosing the best idea is tough. You have a 50% chance of finishing alone, but with a group, it's 75% likely you'll finish on time with good results. Many famous things were made by one person working alone.\n\nGroup work is easier and has lots of benefits. It makes finishing work faster and better because many people check that it's all good. But getting everyone to agree is hard because they think and work in their own ways. It takes time to come up with an idea and get others to like it. Problems will happen, but with patience and understanding, you can get great results.

For instance, I've seen people send mean messages. But, I think some older people don't care much for technology because they prefer old methods, like books and writing by hand. Young kids use more technology now. In my school, we often use computers, phones, and look up things online. We can also do our work from home or if we miss school for something like a doctor's visit. Without the internet or computers, life would be hard and homework would take longer. \n\nSecond, technology makes places around the world modern. Many people notice the good things technology does, like helping businesses, work, online marketing, and meeting new people. Rich people build fancy houses and big buildings, changing the world. Many like living in big modern cities because they are pretty or they enjoy the new lifestyle. Most people seem to like new technology. When a new phone, like an iPhone or Galaxy, comes out, people buy it no matter if they are poor or rich. People just like having new things, like machines, cars, and planes. \n\nThird, technology is very smart and quick now. With phones, you can use apps for work, business, and games. You can even make video calls, which is quite new. I use my phone like a tool to send money to my family in Guatemala. Advanced technology saves time. Without it, things like remembering, building houses, or sharing information worldwide would take longer. I think technology will keep getting better and will be a big part of our future. Even little kids know how to use it now. \n\nIn summary, technology is everywhere, making life easier and better for many. I think the future will be more advanced and better for young people. They will live with it longer than the older generation. I hope technology will improve and help us. Some worry it might not be good for our future. There should be rules for technology use because some might use it to harm others. But it is mostly good for us. It helps with jobs and makes things like work and school faster."}
{"text_id": "8CE5BAD8AF45", "output_essay": "I am going to write about the good things of working with others or working by myself. It matters if I work with nice people or not nice people. Sometimes I work with nice people who start doing things on their own and help each other. Other times, I work with not nice people who don't care about others and are rude. I also think a big good thing about working with others is that I learn more about how people behave.\n\nI think working by myself has its reasons. First, I have no one to talk to, which is good because I can pay attention to my work and finish fast. Second, I have more work to do, and I can make more money. Lastly, working by myself lets me see what I have done and how I did it.\n\nMy other points about working with others are: If someone needs help, like in building things, no one can do it by themselves. It must be a team of six or eight people for work like woodwork, painting, and fixing pipes. You need many people in the team so they can do their jobs.\n\nThe good things about working with others can be good or bad. But in every job, there will be a bad day with other workers. I think it's tough to work with others; even if you have a friend there, there will always be mix-ups. But it's important to work with them and try my best. And I think it would be tough without them; it's just simple.\n\nIn the end, I will find good things wherever I stay. The best thing is to learn how to work with others and how to work alone. Both ways have good things, and this is the heart of it all. It also depends on who you work with: women, men, young guys, or old guys. I only think about all the news I can hear, what can happen to me, and this is the most important thing."}

This is like wanting what your friends, family, and everyone around you have. I agree with Emerson that if you don't try to do more than what you know, you will never grow. We should be happy with what we have. Often, people are not happy with what they have. They want more; they want to grow. But this can turn into a problem where you don't care about your friends. You just want what they have. It's okay to be happy with what we have. Many people work hard for what they have. Some people are happy with what they have, but others don't see the value in things. When wanting more gets too strong, people can hurt their own family. This is very bad. Why would people want what their family has? Sometimes, families choose to split up because they see what's happening and know it won't work. For example, some people want the jobs, money, houses, or anything that others have. They just want it. Everyone should be happy with what they have. Some people say that those who want everything do so because their parents told them to want everything for themselves. But not everyone does this. They don't just do what their parents say. They make their own choices and know what's right. In the end, we decide if we want to want what our friends or family have. Everyone makes their own choices. Not everyone wants what others have. They know it hurts to have something and then want your friends' things. People who don't want others' things are okay. Those who want everything will face problems."}

It lets us talk, shop online, play games, learn, and do many other amazing things. The big question is: has technology, which cuts down on meeting people, changed our lives for better or worse?\n\nTechnology has changed our lives for the better. It does reduce how much we see each other, but it also helps us find new things and learn. If we didn't have some limits to push us to make great things with technology, we would still be way back in the past. I know that technology can make us see each other less, but if we use it well, it can help us deal with crazy things in life.\n\nTalking to each other is very important. Phones, computers, smartwatches, and social media are key ways we connect. With cell phones, we can be in Virginia and text or call someone in South America or anywhere else. Not everyone can afford to travel to visit people. Things like this bring families and friends closer when they need it most. For example, a holiday is near and you want to see your family. But you don't have money to travel. Your best choice is to call, use FaceTime, Skype, or other social media.\n\nLearning is the foundation of our life. The more we are taught, the more we learn. Technology is very important for learning well. With technology, you don't need to go to a school; you can take classes online if you're too busy. You could even get a degree from home and become a great scientist. Ideas like this let us learn and talk to each other without meeting in person.\n\nEveryone uses technology every day. Even kids as young as 3 can use a phone or tablet easily. Technology improves every day, making the future simpler and helping us talk more. Just think about what the future holds for us."}

Think about the good things that come from school all year. Students who go to school all year often do better and know more. Students should go to school all year because they will learn more, spend more time with their teachers to get help, and because students forget a lot during the long summer break.\n\nStudents will learn more in a school that goes all year because they have more time to focus on what they are learning. This means they won't forget what they learned. They have time to learn what they need and also to learn extra things for the future. Students in a school that goes all year get better scores because they learn over a longer time. This makes it easier for them to understand everything they need to know. Even students who have trouble remembering will have enough time to learn what they need.\n\nMany students forget things during the summer. With school all year, students can remember things better than if they had a summer break. This is why many teachers like the idea of school all year. What's the use of learning if you just forget it? If students forget, it will be hard for them later because they will need to know what they learned. Remembering is important because if they don't, school is pointless.\n\nStudents will have more time to talk to their teachers about what they need help with. This is very helpful, especially before tests or quizzes. It helps students who have trouble remembering. Many students trust their teachers with personal problems. When they have a hard time, like when my grandma died in 9th grade, I was very sad. My English teacher was the only person I could talk to. She was trustworthy and helped me a lot. Some teachers are trained to help like this. Having more time with teachers lets you get to know them better.\n\nSome people don't like the idea of school all year. But it is a good idea because there are many benefits. Students who go to school all year learn more. Many people forget what they learned during summer, and that's not good because you need that knowledge later. Students will have more time to talk to their teachers about what they need help with. Teachers are good to talk to when you're having a tough time. This is why school all year is a good idea."}

This is because it's very interesting, it's a part of music, and it helps some people build their music careers.\n\nLearning to play the guitar is not simple; it needs a lot of practice and time to get good at it. It's hard, but also very interesting because of how it makes sound. There is a lot of science behind instruments. Some might think this is not important, but it is a bit about science. We learn about sound waves and how sound is made in science class.\n\nWho doesn't like music? I think 98% of people do. Playing an instrument is connected to music, and people love music. That means they also enjoy playing instruments. Instruments are a big part of music. Ever since I was 5, I wanted to play an instrument. When my older cousin got a guitar and played it, she made me want to play too.\n\nBeing good at playing an instrument can also help you in your work life. You could join a band, or write your own songs and make music videos and tracks. If you do well, you could have a job many people dream of, like being a singer or in a band like Maroon 5.\n\nPlaying an instrument is more fun than some might think.

But not all students want to join an after-school club. If they don't want to, they shouldn't be forced. So, teachers can give out a paper to everyone in the school. They can ask if students want a club for homework after school. Then, the students can vote. The teachers can count the votes to make a decision. If the votes are equal, the teachers should talk to the students who don't want a club. They should ask why they don't want to join.\n\nAfter-school clubs are good for students. They can study, do homework, or play games there. One reason homework at the club is good is that if you make a mistake, a teacher or another student can help you. They can show you how to do it right. This way, you won't make the same mistake again. Another reason clubs are helpful is they give you time to study for tests. This means you have more free time at home to do other things. You can play on your phone, go outside, or do anything you like when you get home.\n\nA third reason clubs are helpful is they can make your grades better. This can help you reach your dreams. Jobs like being a doctor, teacher, singer, or nurse look at your grades. Studying is the best way to get better grades and follow the career you want.\n\nA fourth reason clubs are fun is you can meet new friends. You can say hi, ask their names, and talk. You can help them if they don't understand something. You might play math games together. You could become best friends. In the homework club, you can be a friend to someone who has no friends. You can always meet new people. You might find someone who is new to the school and needs help. Some people might speak your language and need your help too.\n\nA fifth reason clubs are good is you can be with your friends while you study or play games. They can help you if you don't understand something. If you find a subject hard, your friends or the teacher can help you.\n\nA sixth reason homework help is good is it lets you go home and read about the job you want in the future. You can plan for it or play sports like swimming, soccer, or hockey. You can also learn new languages like Korean or Japanese.\n\nA seventh reason clubs are fun is you can finish your work and then go home. You can sleep, enjoy the sun, ride bikes with friends, or have a picnic in the park with your family and friends."}

But if you stay home all day and do nothing, it can harm your health. That is not good. If you use technology all the time and don't talk to anyone, it can be bad for you. I would use technology to help me, like doing schoolwork on my computer. But apart from that, technology is not good. It takes away time you could spend with your family.

So, I only knew failure. Later, I took many guitar lessons. Now, I can play a lot of great music that I couldn't before. Thomas Jefferson once said, 'Determine never to be idle... it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing.' This is true. Being active is good. It helps you grow, inspires others, and gives you experiences that lead to success. \n\nBeing active helps you get better at what you do. We see experts who are great at their jobs, like famous soccer players, actors, musicians, and investors. They work hard to make difficult things look easy. Take Cristiano Ronaldo, for example. He wasn't always good at soccer. But he loved it and practiced a lot. Now, he plays for 'Juventus,' a big team in Italy. So, being active makes you better and smarter than before. \n\nSeeing someone do well can motivate you to do the same. The movie 'The Social Network' is about Mark Zuckerberg. He made 'Facebook,' the biggest social media site, before finishing college. This movie can make people want to achieve like him. Today, many websites and apps started because they were inspired by him. So, if you are active, you can inspire others. \n\nDoing things gives you experience. This can help you succeed later. Many famous people have failed but then improved their work. They use their past failures to solve problems. They may seem sad and tired, but they keep going. In the end, they succeed. So, even if you fail, being active gives you experiences for future success. \n\nSome people think doing nothing is okay. They believe they can succeed without being active. But in reality, doing nothing leads to failure. Being active is good. It helps you grow, inspires others, and gives you experiences for success. Now, you can choose. Be active and help yourself and the world, or do nothing and fail. The choice is yours."}

These things help you in more advanced learning. Studies show that 75% of people with more education learned new things. They started from the beginning. People looking for jobs that pay well with more education also learned new things. This was not just from education but also from work experience. It wasn't only education that helped them learn. People should learn new things beyond what they know. I have learned new things from what I knew before. Most people with more education did too. They got jobs that pay well.

I think that if you know your future plans, you should also believe that nothing is too hard. You will find new goals and the results will be great. I also think that to be successful, you need to fix the bad things around you or change them. In simple terms, if people want to be happy, they need to create new things and make changes. You should also try to be a good person and show your future plans. You will come up with ideas and do your best in every step you take. Some people travel the world without knowing what they want or what to do; that's why they fail. You must stay positive to reach your goals. If you keep going, every problem will turn out well in the end, and you will be proud of yourself when you see it. The choices you make will be good for you and will shape your future.

Take me, for example: to feel good about myself, I need to work hard. To pass the ESOL test, I must try my hardest and keep going. Confidence grows when you work hard at something you really want. Even an ESOL student like me can do it. I have a friend who had a hard time in school and every class, so he quit school. He started working in construction, but he quit school and didn't try to pass his classes or work hard. Another point is that you can learn new things from what you do, even if it's not your best work. You learn based on what you like or don't like. I don't enjoy English class, but I see that it helps you become a better writer and learn many new words. So, to feel confident, you don't need to be perfect. If you want to learn more, you can, even if you're not good at it yet. Confidence comes from doing well. Always remember, don't quit.

We need to support ourselves when making decisions; we are grown-ups now, and we decide for ourselves. It's good to listen to others and learn from their life stories, but in the end, choose what you think is best. It's fine to be unsure about which choice is the best. Often, the one that feels right is the one to go with. Be yourself and respond how you want; nobody is perfect at making choices, not even the smartest people. They just chose what they thought was right.\n\nWhen you turn 18, you're an adult. You might want to party and make bad choices. That's when you need to be careful and know what you're getting into, whether it's a party or going out to clubs. The choice is yours, not your parents' or anyone else's. Being a teenager is fun; you get to try new things. Teenagers will make bad choices, but that's how they learn and build character. They also make good choices, like going to college, buying a car, and starting to build credit.\n\nSetting limits is important. Without them, life can be chaotic. For instance, if you want a new car and have a job, don't expect your parents to pay. That's your job now. It's smart to think carefully, learn from the past, and look into things before you get them. Life is about learning from mistakes, but if you make too many without learning, that's a problem.\n\nRespecting yourself and being independent are important. How you respect yourself and others shows who you are and the choices you'll make. We don't need experts to tell us what to do; we already know what's right and wrong, and we have to choose for ourselves. Take Albert Einstein; he was very smart, but he made choices based on what he thought was right, not what others said. Trust yourself, because you can't predict if the result will be good or bad.\n\nIn the end, life is full of good and bad choices. It's up to you how you deal with life. People often complain about life, but that shows their character and how they treat themselves. No choice is perfect, whether it's a bad one or a good one; only you can decide.

Important subjects like Math and English need more time. Math is important for daily tasks. For example, you need it to work as a cashier or to understand interest rates when you buy a car.

Technology has changed how we talk to others, but it also makes it easier to do so.\n\nSome people, often older ones, think technology has reduced how much we see each other and has been bad for us. They say we don't meet in person anymore. It's true that meeting in person can tell you a lot about someone. But now, we can video call on our phones. This lets us see the person we're talking to, even if they are far away. I think video calls are even better in some ways.\n\nTechnology doesn't just make talking to people easier.

This helps them learn more and understand better what they are talking about. \n\nBecause people can figure out their own plans and make their own life choices, with or without help, they should make their own decisions. In the future, I will keep making my own choices and planning them out."}
{"text_id": "38B5AFD473E1", "output_essay": "Do you want your school to have a program where older students can help younger ones? It would teach them many things, like working together, and they might make a new friend. It helps them talk to other people. If they want a job where they help people, this can help them get it because they have helped others before. For example, it helps the younger students understand better when someone helps them. They learn quicker if someone shows them how to fix the problem. Working with someone can make teamwork and talking skills better, and you might get to know them well. The second reason is it can help the older students talk better with other students. It can be good for a job they want later. By helping a student, you can learn a skill, like helping others better. There are many good things about working with someone new; you can learn something new or get a new skill. That's why having a program like this at your school is good, as students help each other in many ways."}

Many people say that you won't grow if you don't try harder things. They are right. I know people who have grown by trying new and harder things. Now, they think clearly because they have more experience from trying different things. When you grow, you can do many things better. For example, you can look after someone, like your family or friends, because they trust you. When you get older, you focus in school and don't play around. It feels great when people trust you because you are grown up. I think we should all try hard things to grow up. If you are not grown up and do bad things, people won't like you. Some may not want to be your friend if you are not grown up enough. Also, we should all try to do things we haven't done before. Some people, especially young ones, don't want to move forward. They only think about now. But when you grow up, you think about the future too. Some people don't do well at work because they are not grown up. That might be why they can't find a better job. But it's great when you reach your goals. We should all try to be more grown up, try hard things, and make ourselves and our families proud. But some people don't want to grow up. They are happy where they are and don't want to change. They think growing up won't help them get a big career or other things. They don't know that if you don't try, you won't know what you can do. In the end, you grow in your job by trying hard things. You also grow your mind by being grown up and going through tough times. I think we all need to go through things to grow or be grown up. All grown-up people have faced hard times. So use every chance you get, keep learning, and push yourself."}

Some people think that trying new things might end in failure. But if you don't try, you won't know if you're good at it. Look at Jordan. He was great at basketball, but he tried baseball too. It didn't work out, so he went back to basketball. He didn't lose or win anything. When we try new things, we face a challenge. We don't know what will happen. We might fail, but we can learn from that. If we do the same things every day, we won't know what we're really good at. To grow and be our best, we must leave our safe space. If we only do things we know, we won't push ourselves. We might be good at something we never tried. We should learn as many skills as we can. The more we know, the more chances we have. We need to be our best to enjoy life fully. Yes, trying new things might mean we fail. But if you don't try, you won't know what could happen. Trying won't hurt. We can learn from it and keep going. If we fail, we still learn. There's a saying, 'You learn something new every day.' Failing isn't always bad. At least you tried, and that's important. We should always do our best to grow and reach our true skills. We should show we can do anything we decide to. Not everyone will support us. We should choose friends who want to try new things and be their best too. We should focus on our goal to be the best. We need to keep getting better. If we don't try new things, we won't improve. In the end, we need to try new things to grow. Trying new things helps us see if we're good at them or if we should try something else. Failing isn't the end. We should learn from it and move on. We won't know our best skills if we do the same things all our lives. We should go out and try new things. If we fail, we should get up and try again. We need to reach our true skills."}

These days, the way we talk to anyone is through technology. We can't go back to the old days. Back then, to talk to someone, we had to write letters or visit them. Who would have guessed talking to people would be so easy today? This issue has good and bad points. For example, some good points are shopping online, playing video games, and chatting with others. But it also has bad points, like 'cyberbullying.' Over the years, changes have brought good and bad things to our lives, but I think mostly bad, and here's why. Remember when you would go outside, meet friends, and there was no social media or tech? Just you and your friends having fun! Those were the good old days, right? I wish we could go back! Today, a big problem for adults, teens, and kids is 'cyberbullying.' If you don't know, 'cyberbullying' is when someone bullies another person nonstop online instead of in person. It makes the victims' lives a nightmare. They might even hurt themselves. This is one bad way technology affects our lives today. Have you ever felt too lazy to get up to buy food, clothes, or even read a book? They've found a solution! It's called 'Online shopping.' You can be at home or anywhere and buy anything online. It's that easy! But I think this is bad for us. With online shopping, you don't talk to people face to face. We always look for the easy way instead of meeting people while shopping. Not using your phone can be really good for you! Technology has cut down on how much we see other people. This has good and bad sides. I think it's mostly bad because of cyberbullying and not seeing others in person. Shopping online instead of going to stores is another example. There are many reasons why technology is bad for us, but those are my reasons. I hope people can change and not always think about technology."}

Yes, it's good to know what you want to be because it helps you choose your classes, make a plan for your future job, and work hard towards it. Knowing your future job is a great way to begin high school! Should you know what job you want by the time you start high school?\n\nFirst, if you know what job you want, you can pick the right classes. For example, if I want to start a business, I would take classes in money management, advertising, and how to run a business. These classes would teach me about business and how to keep it going. The classes you choose will help you learn about your future job. It's easier to pick classes when you know what job you want.\n\nThen, you can make a plan for your future job. You can choose which college to go to. Choose schools that are good for your job. I know I want to go to a business school to learn how to start my business. I also think about where to start my business, like in a big city. I have a plan for where to begin my job. Knowing what job you want makes it easier to start.\n\nAnother reason is to work hard for what you want. If you know what you want to do, you focus on that. \"I want it; I got it.\" If you know what you want by high school, you aim for how to get there. For example, my goal is to start a business. That's what I'm working towards. Work hard for what you want!\n\nIn conclusion, should you know what job you want by the time you start high school? Yes, because it helps you choose classes, plan your future, and work hard for your job. But many students don't know what job they want when they start high school. Still, it's very helpful to know. It makes high school better and easier. This is why you should have an idea of what job you want when you start high school. Now, what do you think?

At that time, I thought I could sign up for more classes than I had before. But I was wrong. I believe that if you want to grow and not be stuck doing the same thing or staying in one place, you need to be patient, responsible, and have time to be successful. First, you must learn to be patient. Being patient is important because things don't always happen fast. You also have to keep your eyes on what you want in life. Switching from one thing to another without staying focused won't help you succeed. Second, being responsible helps you reach your goals and grow. Some people think being responsible is hard. They feel this way because they either look after themselves or they don't. I think people who say it's hard are a bit lazy. And being lazy has bad results, which isn't good for our lives. Next, you need time to be successful because everything in life needs time to finish. For example, in school, it takes 4 years to graduate. Then you go to college to keep learning for your job. Time is very important because without it, we would never finish our goals or get better in life. In the end, I agree with the writer. If you don't care or put love into what you want, you won't improve. But some people say trying new things that are hard for you can end two ways: you can win or lose something. Either way, you will learn from what happened."}

You must keep practicing what you're good at to get even better at it. So, try new ways to improve, whether it's in reading, writing, sports, math, or anything else. Work on things that are still tough for you. This will help you grow. You need to get better, no matter if it's something you love or if you're trying to beat someone else. This can help you with other skills too. I'm good at reading, and I read every day. But I still want to get better at it. \n\nI have mastered reading, but I want to get better. I want to read faster by picking out key words. I need to grow in reading quickly and still enjoy the book. To get better at reading, I played games, started with easy books, and moved on to harder ones. I practice every day to read faster and enjoy the story. \n\nGetting better at something you're good at can help you learn something new. It also helps you get even better at the skill you're working on. For example, if you're good at reading and learn to read faster, it can help you solve math problems. You'll pick out key words and understand the problems better. This makes you better at reading and thinking logically. \n\nAnother example is math. If you're good at math, try different ways to solve problems. This will make you better at math and at thinking clearly and logically. You improve because you're always trying to know more than you do now. Teaching someone else also helps you get better because it makes you remember and understand more. \n\nIn the end, you must practice even if you're already good at something. There's always a way to improve. Whether it's sports, video games, or reading, keep practicing. People often practice because they like it and they want to be better. Getting better at one skill can help with another skill. That's why I'll keep reading to get better than I am now. Everyone should keep practicing too."}

For example, in businesses, they use technology all the time. This can make work simpler as technology keeps getting better. Making machines, for example, is very useful for makers or when creating new things.\n\nWe also have technology in schools, colleges, universities, and homes, which is useful because we can use technology to make study guides with projects or homework.

I think they shouldn't have to pick a job before high school. Many students need more time to think about their future job. They also learn about different jobs in high school. First, students should wait until they are in high school to choose a job. Most don't know which job to pick when they start high school. They need time in high school to learn about different jobs. In the four years of high school, students get older. They learn about jobs and what they want to do later. Second, students want to learn about jobs they don't know in high school. By 10th grade, many have ideas about their job choice. It's good to be at least 17 years old. Then, students are older and understand their choices better. They should also talk to their parents about the job they want. Some kids say they want a certain job when they see someone doing it. But they might not be sure. Third, it's not good for kids to pick a job before high school. Some don't even know what a job is. They need advice from adults, like parents or guardians. They need to be in high school to pick the right classes for their chosen job. In conclusion, students shouldn't have to pick a job before high school. They might want to learn about different jobs. Or they might pick a job in 8th grade. But in 9th grade, they learn about other jobs. They might want to change their mind. But it could be too late if they've already chosen their classes."}

An extra one and a half hours would take away a lot of their time and make them feel like they have too much work to do.\n\nI believe that after school, students like to go home to relax, do their homework, go to the park, or be with their family. The time they spend in school now is enough. They don't need more time there.\n\nAlso, making the school day longer by one and a half hours could mess up schedules, like the bus drivers' times for taking students home. This change could also upset the students' daily plans. The school should think about how this longer day might be a problem for kids who walk home. They would get home later, which could be unsafe if they are by themselves.\n\nThe extra time would also affect teachers and the school principal. They would have to make new bus schedules. Teachers would need to give out these new times to the students, who might get mixed up about when their bus comes. This could make them miss their bus and have to walk or call their parents. Some students live far away, and with parents working, they might not be able to pick up their kids. If students have to walk a long way and don't know the way well, they could get lost or have other troubles.\n\nParents might not like the school board's choice to make the school day longer. They are used to the current school times and would worry about their kids being out too late. Also, I don't think the students would be happy with more time at school. They might complain to their parents, which could make a lot of people unhappy with the longer school day.\n\nIn the end, I don't think it's a good idea to add one and a half hours to the school day to make it better."}

High schoolers shouldn't have to take special classes for a job because they might not know what they want and it can be too much for them to handle.\n\nKids shouldn't have to choose a job in eighth grade. Teachers shouldn't expect new high schoolers to know what job they want or to take classes for that job. These kids might change their minds any time.

For instance, a student might first want to be a writer, but then a year later, they want to be a teacher. Many things can change what job someone wants, like their teachers, parents, heroes, and themselves. Most students don't really know what job they want until they are juniors or seniors. It's a decision that comes with growing up.\n\nThe special classes for certain jobs can be too hard for young students. Going to school every day to study for one job can be tough.

To stay healthy, we need to be on the go. If not, we will get lazy and not want to pick up dropped things.\n\nSecond, when we keep moving, our mind stays sharp and busy. This is great because it stops us from thinking too much about bad stuff. Being busy can make us forget our worries. For example, someone might want to escape their troubles, but if they have to work, they focus on the job. This keeps their mind off running away. We must face our problems and do things that keep us safe, not things we will regret.\n\nThird, when we are busy, we also help others. We can be there for them when they need us. We should show we care and are willing to help. Helping means we like to be busy. When we help, people say 'thank you,' and that feels good because they are thankful for the help they needed.\n\nIn the end, I think Thomas Jefferson said that to motivate us to think and do something.

Some people also miss meals, job interviews, exams, and school. They are also getting more overweight. Technology can also hurt your personality. Be careful what you post online.\n\nNowadays, most people don't talk face to face because of technology that we update every year. It's a big deal that people don't read newspapers or books anymore. Many stores like JCPenney and Walmart are closing because people shop online for groceries, cars, houses, and clothes. People are also not paying attention to what's happening around them. I once got a ticket for texting while driving. In court, the judge told me not to let technology control me. I share this story to remind myself to pay attention to the world around me, not just my phone. I need to enjoy the beauty around me.\n\nBesides my story and stores closing, technology makes people skip meals. This has happened to me. I see that 78% of people eat at the wrong times. This can make you sick. People just want to eat and use their phones or computers without even taking a shower. Technology can also make you act foolishly. I had a friend who tried to fight like he did in a video game, but he lost. That's why I'm always careful with technology.\n\nTechnology can also cause accidents. For example, the light from screens can hurt your eyes. Many people have eye problems and need glasses to see, drive, read, and talk. Spending too much time on devices can make you late for important things like job interviews or meetings. If you stay up late and can't wake up, you will lose out. It's important to manage your time well and control technology, not let it control you.\n\nFinally, technology can damage your image.

You can't expect to see results without any effort; that's like me not going to work and still expecting to get paid.\n\nTo sum up, I believe you won't achieve anything if you don't take action. No matter what it is, you need to take steps to reach your goals. My mother always said, 'If you want something, you should go get it no matter what.' I think she's right; that's how life is."}
{"text_id": "B381602F5FA6", "output_essay": "Having good self-esteem in life will lead to great chances. If students don't believe in themselves, they will stop trying hard in their work. Being confident is very important every day. Meeting goals and finishing tasks will make someone feel much more confident. Students need to believe in themselves to learn. If they don't, they will find it hard to get new ideas, give up fast, and not try hard in important things. Not feeling good about oneself can really hurt a student's life. It can cause them to not try and to not reach any goals.\n\nStudents should understand that doing well comes from thinking hard, and thinking hard comes from being confident. Students do their best on their work and check that it is great before they hand it in. Also, students who believe in themselves won't feel bad about the results of their work. They know they have tried their hardest in something they love to do. Teachers should help students feel more confident. Without confidence, students will find it hard to get new ideas.\n\nTeachers and other school workers should talk to students about being confident. This is very important for those who don't feel good about themselves. Helping students could change how they act with others and at work. Not everyone believes in themselves. Some people quit fast and won't try again because they don't have support or belief in themselves. Having strong confidence will lead to better work and big successes.\n\nWhen times are tough, students may not believe in themselves and not try in important things. Strong confidence can make learning better and more effective. More students will respect themselves. Colleges and universities want students who believe in themselves and who do good work. Many successes can happen, and once you succeed because of your hard work, you'll feel great. This feeling will give you energy to do more great things.\n\nIn the end, self-esteem and confidence are key in school. Without them, what will students turn into? Reaching your goals and feeling good about yourself is very important. It's even better with help. But it's also fine to do things alone. This shows you are independent and have made it on your own. Students with strong confidence will create a better future."}

We can talk to family. Even if we are far from family or friends, we have phones, computers, and more. Think about being in a different place and not knowing about your parents for weeks. We care about our loved ones and want to know they are healthy. Technology helps us stay in touch. It feels like we are with them. We can share our feelings, like joy or sadness. We can see them on a screen and say we love them. This shows that technology helps us feel close to those who are far. Technology also helps people find jobs. Some people who are sick but can still work might not be able to do physical jobs. But now, they can work online. They just need to use a phone. This is true for everyone. Some people can't get to a job because they don't have a car or money. They can work two jobs, one in a place like a restaurant and another online. Having a job lets us take care of ourselves. Computers from technology help us learn and get a better education. Kids can play games that make them smarter. They can learn words and relax. Parents should watch how long kids use the internet. Schools and students use computers for projects and to find information. Teachers show videos and look up news to teach. We can also study from home. This means we don't have to be in school all the time. Some might say technology is bad for us. But I think it's good because it helps us talk to family far away, find jobs, and learn better."}

You can slide, swing, or take a nap. They also have events like fundraisers, fairs, and you can have a birthday or a picnic with others. I also like fishing. Fishing is easy but you need to wait. After you put your bait in the water, you won't catch a fish right away. There might not be any fish where you are. If you don't like the sea or get sick on boats, you can fish from a dock. But docks with boats have less fish because the boats scare them. Fishing is fun for me. Another fun thing is having a cookout or a party outside. Summer parties are great for playing games or sports. At these parties, I love to play soccer with my friends and walk in town. I also like the smell of food cooking on the grill. It makes me hungry for the tasty food."}
{"text_id": "166EC90C5D34", "output_essay": "Is showing others how to act by being a good role model the best way to change their behavior? Many people think that they can change others by what they do. Some people believe that everyone decides on their own actions. I think that people are changed by what they see others do because it can push them to improve and care more, and to help others too.\n\nFirst, being a good role model is the best way to change others. People can push others to be better. You can change others by how you treat them. For example, I look up to how my grandmother is with her customers; she is very kind and respectful to them. She always tells people to be kind. If someone needs help, she does her best to help. Many customers come to the hair salon with bad hair because they don't use any products, which makes their hair dry and break. She tells them she can make their hair better and that it will be fine. What she does makes me want to be a better person. She makes me want to be kind and caring to others.\n\nSecond, people can change others by helping. When you help someone, you feel good. Helping can make others want to do the same. For example, when I help my mother clean the house, my little brother watches. Sometimes my mother is too busy to clean, so I do it, and then my little brother helps me. He says that I make him want to help because he sees me helping our mother. I make my brother want to help when he sees someone doing it.\n\nBut, people are changed by what they see others do. Still, some people think they choose their own actions. They say that what others do doesn't change them because people don't just do bad things because someone else does. For example, if someone is mean to another person because they were treated badly, it doesn't mean they will be mean back. Everyone picks how they act.\n\nIn conclusion, being a good role model is the best way to change others. People can push others to be better and to help others."}
{"text_id": "014CA5A01658", "output_essay": "Making Choices\n\nPeople who like to depend on themselves think it's important to trust their own feelings and thoughts. Should we decide things on our own, or should we ask experts and leaders for advice on important life choices? It's hard to make your own choices. Some people think we should always ask experts and leaders for help. I believe we should decide things for ourselves because it's our duty, it builds confidence, and it's about being true to who we are.\n\nFirst, being responsible is a good rule for life. People who answer for their actions can manage their lives better. Even when people make mistakes, they usually know it's because of what they did, not someone else. Also, we need to be responsible on our own. When you make a choice and it goes wrong, you have to accept the blame. For example, if you study for a test and the top student says you're wrong, but you're sure you're right, remember that even smart people can be wrong. If you're sure about your study and your answers, trust yourself. You're in charge of your life, so don't let others run it for you.\n\nConfidence is another reason. People who don't decide for themselves don't believe in themselves. But those who make their own choices are more sure of themselves, think more clearly, and can pick the best options. People who always ask for advice might miss out on doing great things. But if you trust yourself, you can do great things. Feeling sure of yourself also helps you learn from mistakes. As you get older, this learning makes you wiser. Making your own choices helps you feel stronger.\n\nLastly, being true to yourself is very special. Not everyone is open about who they really are. Sometimes, people do things they don't want to because someone else tells them to. If you always follow others, you lose who you are. You're not the one thinking; you're just copying someone else. But if you're true to yourself, you feel better about who you are. This happiness and pride help you make good choices on your own. You don't get tired of deciding for yourself. You can do great things without needing experts. People with strong self-belief don't need others to build them up; they can do it themselves. Some people are afraid to be themselves because they fear failure. But why be afraid? If something doesn't work, just try again. It's the best way to learn. People who never fail don't know how to pick themselves back up. Decide for yourself; if you stumble, you'll learn how to stand up again. People who believe in themselves and are true to who they are can do anything.\n\nIn conclusion, we should make our own choices. People who decide for themselves are more responsible than those who follow experts. Confidence is a wonderful thing that not everyone has. Being true to yourself boosts your self-worth and helps you make the right choices. For these reasons, we should decide things for ourselves."}

They play sports, act in plays, or want to spend time with their families. They are often tired after school. More time in school could make us feel too stressed. The school board should not make our school days longer. Students do important things outside of school. Many play sports or are in plays. For example, Generic_Name plays football. With a longer school day, he would have to practice more and get home late. Some students get too much work and feel like giving up. Generic_Name, a 10th grader, gets a lot of homework. She had to cut back on her job because of school. Students want to hang out with friends or family after school. But they get home late and miss seeing them. More time in school means more homework, less time to relax, and maybe less sleep. Sleep is very important for students. If they don't sleep well, they might be very tired at school. This could be because they had too much homework. This can make a student very stressed. Stress is a big problem for us, especially when we're young. It can make us act differently. Generic_Name is stressed about school. She has unfinished work and is failing reading. She gets upset and has family problems too. Stress can hurt our minds, even as teenagers. Sometimes she stays up all night to finish work and doesn't sleep enough. This makes her fall asleep in class and get in trouble. It also leads to bad grades. I think the school board should not add 30 minutes to our school days. Less time with loved ones, no rest, and not enough sleep can harm us. We don't need this extra stress and should have more fun outside of school."}
{"text_id": "074E715BAE12", "output_essay": "Some people think it's better not to challenge yourself because you won't feel let down by others. But I think it's better to challenge yourself because it makes you keep going and feel good about yourself. People might not want to challenge themselves because they don't want to feel let down, and they have their reasons. First, some people might not want to keep trying the same thing. For example, I can't make myself focus on one thing, and it's hard to try things that are too hard for me. Second, people are scared of failing, and this fear stops them from trying new things. Even though some people think it's better not to challenge yourself, I believe it's better to do it because it helps you keep trying. I think everyone should try new challenges like I do. I've been in America for four years, and I still remember coming here for the first time to a place I'd never seen. I'm not the best at learning, but I still try to learn new things. When you challenge yourself and succeed, you feel very proud and more sure of yourself because it matters. It's important, like with President Trump. Even though many people didn't want him to be president because they thought a businessperson couldn't run America, he didn't care what they thought. He was sure of himself. The wall he built was to keep Americans safe. He's a businessman, but he tried to do more than what he was good at, just to make America better and stronger. People should try to do more than what they're used to, to become stronger and more sure of themselves. Nothing is impossible if you try."}

It also lets us talk to people without being near them.\n\nFirst, technology gives safety to those who don't want to go out. Some people like to shop online because they feel safer. For example, Generic_Name is a college student who was attacked many times at the library. She knew she was in danger when outside. So, Generic_Name started to buy her things online to stay safe. This way, Generic_Name won't be attacked again.\n\nSo, technology can keep us safe and make online shopping secure.\n\nSecond, technology helps us talk to people far away without meeting them.

You might even pinch yourself to check if it's true, but sometimes it's not. Think about having a great time with your friends and family, laughing in one place. You can visit a magical place with a happy feeling, like a story from a book. We can shop for new clothes for our trip. Picture a place with bright blue water and the smell of the air, all set for you. Imagine swimming in a clear blue sea, then eating a delicious steak with everyone. I can't wait for a day like that, so I want to go to the Bahamas. It seems calm, relaxing, and cozy, like sitting on a couch watching TV. The Bahamas has places to eat, swim, buy toys, and shop for clothes. You can buy a swimsuit to swim in. The water is so clear, you can see fish and other sea life, like dolphins and starfish. Sea creatures look different from each other. Some are friendly and you can swim with them, but be careful not to touch some because they might get scared. If you can't swim, be careful because it can be deep and there might be sharks. If you wear good goggles, the underwater view is amazing. Seeing the sea life up close is even better. When I get to the Bahamas, I'll see how my hotel rooms look. There will be two rooms, one for my family and a big one for my friends. I'll see which one is nicer. It's different from seeing it online. I want a room with a great view, like the sea or a sunset. I'll see if it's a nice place to stay. I want the room to be pretty and fancy. I'll invite all my friends so they can have fun too and not feel left out. We'll all go to a carnival and play games. When we get back, we'll roast marshmallows and drink hot cocoa on a breezy night. Then I'll walk and play on the soft, warm sand with everyone. We'll take photos to remember our fun time in the Bahamas. We'll also eat tasty food with everyone. We'll try new foods and drinks. They might become our new favorites. Trying new things is exciting for me when I visit new places. They can surprise you, like with a hidden filling or a different color. Looking back, if I could choose one place to visit, it would be the Bahamas. You can have a great time with your best friends and family. It can make you happier than before, with special memories.

{"text_id": "5D0E66357C33", "output_essay": "Lately, the Generic_School school board wants to make the school day longer by an hour and a half because they think students need more time to study at school. But many students and parents don't like the idea of a longer school day. In fact, having more time at school could be bad, not good like the school thinks. For example, students at Generic_School will have less time for clubs and activities, or they might be too tired to study well. Also, they will lose their free time after school. So, I strongly disagree with making the school day longer, just like many others do.\n\nFirst, students at Generic_School can't stay out late because they need to be safe and have privacy. Even though they don't have much time, many join clubs or do activities. If the school makes them stay longer, they won't have enough time for these things after school. Being in a club or playing sports are good for them, so they shouldn't stop. Adding more school time could ruin these good activities. For instance, Generic_Name has to be home by seven at night, so he has three hours for sports. If he has to stay at school for ninety more minutes, he'll only have an hour and a half left, which isn't much.\n\nAlso, being in school longer each day might make students not pay attention in class. Studying for too long makes them tired. Scientists say it's harder to focus when you're tired because your brain doesn't work as well. So, they might not learn what they need for tests. They might not do their homework or get ready for the next class if they don't understand what they learned. And if the students are tired, teachers can't teach them well. This could make their grades worse. If this keeps happening, studying will just stress them out.\n\nAnother point is that a longer school day means less free time for students. Right now, they have six hours after school before they should go to bed. That's not a lot of time to try new things and keep life interesting. But with the longer day, they'll only have four hours. They'll lose time for hobbies, family, and to relax. With just four hours, they'll barely have time to eat dinner, do homework, and study for tests. They won't have time for anything else.\n\nIn conclusion, not having time for activities after school, not being able to focus in class, and having less free time are big reasons why I really don't want a longer school day. This choice would make school harder and cause a lot of problems. School should be helpful and fun, not something that makes life hard for teenagers."}

Even if students don't always see eye to eye, it's still better to work with others than to work alone.\n\nEveryone has heard the saying, \"Two heads are better than one.\" This is very true, especially in group work. Being in a group can make your work lighter and more effective. This could be for a group task, essay, or talk. Sharing the work means the group can do more together. Jobs get done faster when people share tasks. Each person can focus on what they're good at. A group's mix of skills is a big help when finishing a job.

{"text_id": "A938F2109682", "output_essay": "I want to talk about being able to rely on yourself today. There are many things that affect how we choose to act based on what's happening in our lives. Making choices is a big part of our daily lives. Everyone has their own way of thinking about what they would do to make a good choice. I will focus on three things: trusting yourself, not making choices when you're mad, and not leaning on others for help. These can teach us how to make better choices. First, trusting yourself when you make a choice is important. It's hard to choose when things are tough. Even if the choice is good for you, you should feel sure it's the right thing to do. Many people don't think before they choose or about what might happen next. Sometimes things turn out well, but other times they can go wrong if they don't believe in what they're doing. People should think about what could happen before they choose. I always think twice before I do something. Next, I say you should make choices when you're calm, not mad. When people choose while they're mad, it often ends badly. So, I tell people to choose calmly. If you're not sure about a choice, wait. There's always a better time. Your choices can also affect others. Many people have made bad choices because they didn't wait. If we help someone to calm down and think, it's good. Being patient, trusting yourself, and helping others are good things we can learn from bad choices. These lessons help us move forward. Last, I want to talk about making your own choices and not relying on others. Choosing for yourself can make you feel good, no matter what happens. If you wait for others to tell you what to do, it's not the best way to choose. You should trust yourself and not rely on others. Making choices when things are bad or when you feel bad can end badly. People learn from every situation they face. Every experience helps them think more about what's happening. In the end, people make choices every day. Some are good, some are not. Some people choose quickly without thinking, while others think carefully to make sure everything will be okay. We're all human, and we all make mistakes, but we also learn from them."}

I felt very lonely because I only had my parents, and they were always working. I had no one to talk to and just sat on the couch alone. It was sad. Then I started school. It was tough to talk to people. Learning English was hard, but I worked at it. I also wanted a job. I told my mom, 'Mom, I'm going to apply at this restaurant.' She said not to because workers there get fired easily. But I said that was because they didn't follow rules or do their work. I told her, 'They pay me well, and the job isn't too hard.' Two years ago, I was scared to travel to Generic_City. But going there was the best choice I made. I enjoyed their food, drinks, and activities. It was fun. That month was the best. Trying new things has changed my life. \n\nIn this statement, I will say that I agree with Ralph Waldo Emerson. If you don't try new things, you won't know if they're right for you. You might miss out on something you'll remember forever and want to keep doing. Maybe it's a hidden talent you'll love. So keep trying. Don't think it won't work. Be positive and try. You have nothing to lose. Every good thing has its risks. \n\nTrying new things is exciting. It helps you grow as a person. I like trying new things. It has changed my life in every way. I have learned from my mistakes and try not to repeat them. For example, if you don't try something because you think it won't work, you might miss your best chance. But don't try something again if it already failed. \n\nSome people think trying new things is bad or a waste of time. They are wrong. If you don't try, you'll never know if something is right for you or if it's the best experience of your life. Many great and important things can happen when you explore and learn from new things."}

They worry about letting their parents down later. They also don't want to feel judged by other people. School and society play a big role in life. They can lead to different careers. Being respected is important. Without respect from family and others, people might question your job or think you didn't follow high school rules. You might also hurt your own image. In high school, students make friends and think about what to study. Classes show them many careers. This helps students feel sure of themselves. They use what they learn to figure out if they want a career. High school classes help students choose. If they pick someone as a role model who didn't study, they might be made fun of. Young people should pick a career freely. Picking a career is tough. Students wonder what to study after high school. They look at classes and credits. But parents see high school as just a start. They think students should choose a career later, when they know more about life and money. Companies and colleges look for new workers. Some fired workers say colleges only teach you to be a worker, not a boss. They say you learn to handle money, not to lead. But some think companies just need good workers. Having a career is key for getting a job. Teachers should make sure classes show what a career involves. Parents hope for a good future and don't want to be let down. Students have their own ideas about the future. Society can be tough. Some students work hard and get good grades. They become the teacher's favorite.

This is because working with others means people can talk well with each other, working together can speed up the work, and working with others lets people learn from what others know. \n\nWorking with others means tasks can be finished quicker. To do this, people must work together. Take a group of builders as an example. They can build a house quickly. They build the house faster by working together. So, working with others means finishing things quicker. Also, working with others makes work easier because people can share what they know, and they will have time for more tasks. \n\nSome might say working with others isn't the best. But working with others means people can talk well with each other. For example, Generic_Name and Generic_Name are doing a science project, but they can't work on the same days.

But when working with others, people should talk well to share their thoughts. \n\nIn the end, people who work with others will be more creative because they learn how to work with others.

But I felt I could do more. I told myself, 'I can do this,' and added more weight until I reached 630 lbs. I felt very happy with myself.

In the end, pushing yourself is the best way to see what you can really do and to find the strength inside you that you didn't know about before."}
{"text_id": "2B2F5AE0F6D2", "output_essay": "If people do not try new things beyond what they know well, will they improve? People grow when they take on more after achieving something. Even with a master's degree, they are ready for more. This is because they can make more money and learn more from doing extra things.\n\nThe first reason is that people can make more money. For example, if someone has a master's degree and studies for another degree, they will make more money. This means that with each extra degree, a person's salary at work increases. So, the more degrees a person has, the more they get paid.\n\nThe second reason is that people can learn more. Sometimes, people need help at work because they don't know how to do a task. If they have more degrees, they can do more at their job. They will also save money because they won't need to pay someone else for help. This way, people keep more money.\n\nHowever, some think that having just one master's degree is enough. They say that one master's degree can be better than many. It depends on the career a person chooses. But, if people get more than one degree, they are likely to learn more than with just one master's degree. In the end, getting another degree is always helpful.\n\nIn summary, people grow by learning. They can earn more money quickly. They learn more over time. Also, some believe that one master's degree is enough and can be more valuable than many. But people can continue to grow even after they get their master's degree."}

It's best to trust your own ideas instead of someone else's. This lets you share your feelings. First, people should choose for themselves because they can think about their choices. Second, you need to understand what is right and what is wrong, what you should and shouldn't do, and make the right choice. Third, trust your own thoughts. If you use someone else's ideas, you're not thinking for yourself. They don't know how you feel; they have their own thoughts and opinions. Always stick to your own ideas and choices. No matter what, people will talk about your choices, whether they are good or bad. I hope people act on their feelings, not on what others want them to feel. If you have a problem, ask trusted people for advice. Hear them out. Then think about it and decide which ideas to use, but do it your way. Use this to solve any problems you have. That's why I think people shouldn't just follow what others say. Why not trust your own ideas?"}

You can do all this on your phone or computer while lying in bed, without talking to anyone. Not talking to people because of technology can be bad for us. \n\nStaying inside all day and not going out can seem unfriendly, right? You can do almost anything on a device and just stay home. You can get food, clothes, and even groceries delivered to you. You can also order a car, like an Uber, to take you places. But this isn't good. You're not moving around or getting sunlight. This can make you feel tired and not want to do anything. It's also too easy to order pizza for dinner. That's why I like to ask friends to go out to eat. It's more fun. \n\nOn an iPhone, you can see how long you've been looking at your screen. It's called 'screen time'. Other phones have this too. You're supposed to only look at screens for two hours. If you look longer, it can hurt your eyes. You might need glasses, like me. That's not fun. \n\nDo you ever have trouble sleeping before a big day? Your phone could be the reason. The blue light from the screen keeps you awake and can give you dark circles under your eyes. I try to put my phone away and read a book until I fall asleep. \n\nAre you shy or nervous around new people? Do you find it hard to talk to someone? That's poor communication skills. Going out and having fun is good because you talk to people. You need to be able to talk well for work. For example, you need to speak well in a job interview. If you don't, you might not get the job. Working on your talking skills bit by bit can help a lot. \n\nTechnology has improved a lot recently. It's helpful, but it can also cause problems. Not talking to people because of technology can be bad for us. So next time you want a new outfit for a party, try going to the store to buy it. This way, you can make sure it fits you well."}

I think he was right because without imagination, we wouldn't be where we are today. Three things that show this are our gadgets, how we talk to each other, and writers.\n\nThe first thing is gadgets. We didn't always have gadgets. We had to dream them up first. Long ago, people would have laughed if you talked about smartphones, cars, the internet, or flying. But now we have all these because someone imagined them first. Imagination can turn almost anything into reality.\n\nThe second thing is how we talk to each other. All living things, like animals and people, and even nature, have their own way to talk. We have different languages like English, German, Spanish, and more. But we had to come up with these languages using our imagination. That's why it's so important. Without imagination, we wouldn't know as much as we do now.\n\nThe third thing is writers. Writers can make up stories about anything. To write a good book, they need to use their imagination. That's the most important tool for a writer. If a writer's book does well, he makes money from it. Without imagination, there would be no writers. And without writers, we wouldn't have many of the things we enjoy today.\n\nTo sum up, I agree with Einstein when he said imagination is more important than knowledge. I think this because without imagination, we wouldn't have the gadgets we have, we couldn't talk to each other as we do, and writers wouldn't be able to create their stories."}

But some believe you should get an expert's advice to help you solve your problems or figure out what to do in life. This can stop you from making bad choices that might hurt your future. It's good to learn from someone else's experiences. This can help you deal with different situations or help others who have the same problems or questions. Sharing ideas is useful because everyone sees things differently. You can try to figure out what to do by yourself, but you might keep asking yourself the same questions every day. You might wonder if you should think more or get expert advice to make sure you're choosing the best for now and later in life.\n\nTake this example: you've been waiting for a better job for a long time. You finally get a better job at your company, but it means you have to move to a new city or country. You can't bring your family or friends with you. Deciding this alone is hard. An expert can give you support and help you find a way so you don't miss out on what you've waited for. They can make you and the people around you happier. This can make your days better and less stressful. This support can help you figure out what's best for you now and later, and how to keep from making your life worse.\n\nThe best thing to do is to get help from an expert and help others find what they need to fix their problems. It's hard to solve issues when you don't know which way to go or how to start. Without an expert's encouragement and push to make good choices, you'll see that there are millions of people who struggle with their problems and need help, not just you. Knowing this can make you feel better and more ready to share problems, solutions, and ideas with others. Life goes in circles. One day you might help someone with their problems, and the next day you might need help with yours.\n\nThe best choice is when you think about now, the future, and other people who matter to you and who you want to keep close. Sometimes you need to think hard about how you solve problems to make sure it's not too late to change your choices later. An expert will be there for you at all times, pushing you to do things that make you feel good, to have the best life, and to be able to say in the end that you did the best for yourself.

We decide to try new things every day, and sometimes we learn from our mistakes. Mistakes can give us a fresh start or cause problems, but we always learn from them. People everywhere make poor choices, but they learn from them. Smart people like doctors, teachers, and even the president make mistakes. No one is perfect. Everyone has made mistakes, often more than once, and sometimes they don't know they've made them. For instance, a doctor might diagnose the wrong person. It's risky, but it's a chance to learn, even if there are bad results. Lawyers might wrongly accuse someone in court. What if that person was too scared to tell the truth and was actually innocent? Mistakes happen for many reasons, but we learn from everything we do. People make their own choices because they don't like being told what to do. This is true, not just a guess. People like to do what they want, even if it's not safe or wise, and they learn the hard way. People everywhere can make choices that change the future for themselves or others. Some save lives, help the homeless, or become foster parents. Choices can be good or bad, and they can lead to trouble. But every day, we make choices, big or small. We can choose to learn from our mistakes or not. Life is hard because we make many choices without knowing what will happen. Some people's lives are easier or harder because of their choices. Experts might not understand what someone is going through. People choose for many reasons. For example, a man with serious cancer might decide he's done making choices because he wants to let go. Experts might say to keep getting treatment. But it's not up to family, friends, or doctors. It's the man's choice. Experts can't make our choices for us. Our choices are our own.

They can work with their teacher, who knows a lot about the subject, and get help with their homework. Some students want to finish their homework early and need help. They can also stay after school for support from their teachers. Teachers can choose to stay after school and help students with subjects or homework. Students should get better because they learn more when they stay after school. The teacher explains things slowly to make sure they understand. This can help students do better on tests or the SOL, making it easier for them to pass. But the homework club should also have fun for about 30 minutes to an hour, depending on the time we have after school. We could help students with homework or hard subjects first, and then do fun things like play games, use computers, play soccer, or use their phones. This would make more students want to stay for extra help and not think it's boring. Students can stay after school if they need help and get better at their subjects. This way, they don't just play in the club. It's important for students to stay and work because they learn more. This will help them a lot in the future to get good jobs and follow their dreams. Learning more when you're young is good, and if you need help, the homework club can help you with your subjects and things you don't understand. But you have to study on your own too, both in and out of school, because education is important for everyone. So, students would want to join the homework club to get extra help with their homework and subjects like math, science, language arts, and social studies. They can learn more, understand better, pass their tests and SOL, and have fun after school. Getting better at their subjects, tests, quizzes, and SOL will help them as they grow up, in high school, at work, and in life. So, I think the homework club is good for students who need help with their subjects and homework. It helps them learn more and pass the SOL."}

Also, many people feel very tired at school and just want to go home. If they find out that school might last longer, they would be upset. I would be too, to tell the truth. I often wonder: Do I want longer school days? My answer is no. I work hard to make my parents proud. It's hard, but I do it because I love them. What I do now is enough, and I get tired. On that note, I also get tired quickly. It's hard to stay awake for 7 hours and think so much. I don't want to stay in school for an extra hour. Still, I know some people think more school time is good because it helps them learn more. But they might fall asleep; we need time to rest. Another reason I don't want longer school days is we need time for homework. If someone has a lot of homework, they might need the whole day to finish it. It's not right to make school longer and make it harder for them. We should have time after school for homework. Plus, sleeping well is important. Many students are late because they have things to do after school. If we don't add an extra hour, they can get home earlier. Lastly, I don't see a need for more school time. We have enough time now for teachers to teach. Adding more time just wastes it for students and teachers. It's pointless to have an extra hour with no real purpose. Teachers are running out of ways to prepare us for tests. Sure, we could finish the lessons faster, but we have time. We don't need to hurry. We, as kids, need to rest to stay energetic. I understand adults wake up early too, but they shouldn't have to waste more time. Some teachers have kids to look after. They need time with their families too.

{"text_id": "0FA0B0078686", "output_essay": "Working together is better than working alone because:\n\nWorking in groups helps you talk about the topic better. Each person in the group has their own view and ideas about the topic. This mix of ideas makes the group work better. Because of this, the work they turn in is likely to cover more points when the teacher checks it.\n\nFor example, a history teacher gives his class a task to learn about the seven wonders of the world. The teacher puts students into groups of seven, but one student wants to work by himself, and the teacher says okay. The group of seven splits the task, with each person looking into one wonder, where it is, and why it's special. They put together a slideshow with what they find and show it to the class.\n\nWorking in groups saves time on a project because the work is shared.\n\nFor instance, with the same history task, the student who works alone needs more time than the groups. He has no one to swap information with or to help split up the work.\n\nIt's also easier for the teacher to check group work. The teacher spends less time checking one project from seven students than checking seven separate projects. This way, the teacher has more time for other lessons.\n\nIn conclusion, working as a group is better because it leads to better discussions, shows more examples, sparks creativity, and makes checking work easier for the teacher."}

Some people say technology is good because you can find information for free and easily. But I disagree. Sometimes, when you look online, the information isn't complete.

Thomas Jefferson said that it's amazing what we can do if we're active and not lazy. Many people agree that we can do a lot by being busy. Being lazy means you can't get anything done; you miss chances. For example, some kids get to come to the United States for a better life, but they don't use the chance well. Others would love to have that chance and would use it to do great things. People don't get that if they don't try, they won't succeed. There's a saying, 'if you don't move, time will run out.' You can't do anything if you never try. Like my dad's stepdad, he was very lazy. He just sat at home, watched TV, and did nothing. Life is full of chances for those who use them. In my case, I had the chance to come to the United States for a better life. My mom said I could stay in my country and not follow my dreams, or move and make something of myself. I chose to move and now I'm going to make it because I want to. It's always better to be busy than to do nothing.

Others just sit and waste hours thinking about what to do but not wanting to do anything. That's pointless because life is short. Life will end if you're not alert and aware. Many people work hard, become professionals, and get rich because they put in the effort. You can achieve anything if you keep at it. But some people choose an easy life and don't get anywhere because success comes from hard work and facing challenges until you win. Thomas Jefferson showed us the value of doing more. If people want to succeed, they should learn from him. He can inspire and teach us a lot. Then life goes on, and the next generation can do even better."}

Will the program be useful for many students, both young and old, or not? \n\nThe program will really help young students. It is useful because older students have finished those grades. They know the work and can help the younger ones. That's my first reason for liking the program. \n\nThe program also improves older students' abilities. It is good for them because it's like they are teaching their own students. It helps older students practice speaking and teaching. These skills will help them later on. That's my second reason for thinking the program is good for them. \n\nThe program makes both young and old students more responsible. Teachers need help giving out supplies, and young students can help with that. Sometimes, a young student needs help or has a question. With only one teacher and many kids who need help, the teacher can't help everyone. So, older students can help by answering questions or helping young students with problems. This teaches older students to be responsible. Young ones learn this too, by helping the teacher with supplies or helping other kids. It makes them responsible. That's my third reason for saying the program helps students a lot. \n\nThese are my three reasons for thinking the program is good. It helps both young and old students become responsible and learn many skills.\n\nEND"}

I am against making the school day longer because kids will have less time to spend with their families or the people they love, and they will become very tired, since the day will be one and a half hours longer. \n\nFirst, kids will have less family time. If we make the school day longer, kids won't have as much time with their mom, dad, brother, and sister. Kids can become sick if they don't spend enough time with their families or the people they love. A longer school day could make a family feel pulled apart because the kid is too busy, or the kid might never see their mom or dad because of homework. A longer school day will change how they live at home. \n\nNext, school will become more tiring for kids. With an extra one and a half hours each day, classes will last longer too. Kids will feel more tired and stressed because they are so busy and have a lot of work. They will find classes boring because they will be in them for more than 2 or 3 hours! And I'm sure kids will feel like they've been in class forever. \n\nFinally, kids will overall not like school. Making the school day longer will really affect their personal and school life. This big change includes problems with family at home, getting sick from not being with family, and possibly making a family fall apart. Another big change is that classes will become boring, they will last longer because of the extra one and a half hours each day, and kids will have too much work and get too stressed or burned out. I am against making the school day longer because kids will have less time with their family, and school will become too tiring."}

People who have nothing to do are called lazy. Many people are not active because they don't do things for themselves. That's why many people lose their jobs and then, if they find a new job, they might lose that one too. It's very important not to be lazy because it's not good for anyone. It's great to see people always doing things; those people might become important in life. Everyone gets many chances, but not everyone uses them. Being lazy is why some people don't move forward in life. Being lazy can lead to bad things; for example, some people die because they don't go to the doctor. We have many reasons to be active and not lazy. If you are lazy, you might miss the chance to be a great person later. What we do now will change our future. Also, if we do too much now, we will have even more to do later. For example, doctors were not lazy; they worked hard to become doctors. It's hard to become a doctor; they have to study a lot and never give up, always focusing on what they need to do. Everything will be great if we focus on making our lives better. We must try to improve every day to stay busy and reach our goals. In the end, we should try to be better people every day, never give up, keep going, and not be lazy. If we don't, we won't get anywhere. We have to become someone in the future for ourselves, and we will see the results."}
{"text_id": "5BD60D0345BE", "output_essay": "Do you think self-esteem comes from praise or from what you achieve? It should come from what you achieve. Some people say that if you tell a student they did well, even if they didn't do their best, it will make them more confident. But I don't agree. Students shouldn't be told they did well if they didn't. This won't help them get better. A student's self-esteem should grow from their successes. This helps them improve, shows them what they can do, and makes them want to learn more.\n\nFirst, if a student is told they did well when they didn't, they won't learn from it. Self-esteem should come from working hard and trying your best. For example, my nine-year-old cousin was always confident because her parents always said she did well. But when her teacher saw her work and said it was all wrong, my cousin felt bad and less confident. If her parents had been honest and not praised her, she could have gotten better before showing her teacher.\n\nNext, when students do well, it makes them feel good about themselves and shows them what they can do. If they are told they did well when they didn't, they won't try to do better. My parents always pushed me to aim higher because they knew I could do better. This made me more confident because I knew I could improve. If they had praised me for bad work, I wouldn't be as confident as I am now.\n\nAlso, when students know they can do better, it makes them want to learn more. If they solve a problem correctly, they feel good and want to keep learning. But if they get credit for wrong answers, they won't learn anything.\n\nWhen I make a mistake, I don't want to be rewarded for it. It doesn't help me, and I won't want to keep trying in class because I'll just make the same mistake again.\n\nSelf-esteem should be based on what you achieve, not on empty praise. Students who build confidence from their successes will keep getting better, understand their abilities, and be eager to learn more. It's wrong to praise bad work just to make someone feel more confident. They need to earn that confidence through their achievements."}

Being able to rely on oneself is natural, and it shows when I speak. For example, as a student, you must explain a project or worksheet. Being able to express yourself makes everything simpler. \n\nBeing able to rely on oneself means you trust in your own decisions.

But you can learn from someone older because their experience is usually more reliable than what you know. \n\nThe choices you make for your future are based on one thing: your desire to be independent.

I believe working alone is better because no one gets upset if someone doesn't work, you can work how you like, and you can think for yourself about your work.\n\nFirst, no one gets upset if someone doesn't work. In a group, some people don't do anything. If someone in the group doesn't help, everyone gets upset. For example, in math class, we could work in groups. But some of my friends just talk while I work. When I'm done, they want the answers. This makes me upset. This can happen in any group.\n\nSecond, you can work how you like. In a group, everyone has their own way. Not everyone works like you. In a group, people do things differently, and the work should look the same. For a presentation, they do parts differently. Last semester, in biology, we had a final exam. The teacher said we could work with a partner. My friend and I worked together, but he missed school the next day. I worked on the exam my way. When he came back, his work was different from mine, and the exam didn't go well.\n\nFinally, you can have your own thoughts about your work. Everyone sees things differently. This can make group work hard. People might say you should work differently or that you're wrong. This can make you doubt yourself. It's better to work alone to avoid this.\n\nIn conclusion, it's not best to work in a group. It's better to work alone. No one gets upset if someone doesn't work, you can work how you like, and you can have your own thoughts. You'll feel better working by yourself. If you have questions, you can ask your teacher to make sure you're doing it right."}

Technology is a big part of progress in a country. A country needs technology to develop and look better. You need it to know where to start and to do your tasks.

From the time they start school, kids work in groups to learn sharing and teamwork. As they get older and move up in school, they do less group work and more work by themselves. Because of this, some students finish high school and start college or jobs only to find out that they need to work in groups, but they don't know how to do it well. Learning to work well in a group is a skill that should be learned in school, at home, and at work. Every teacher should make a rule that makes students work in groups at least once every day. If students have six classes, and they go to four classes each day, and if every teacher asks for group work once a day, then students would work in groups four times a day.

I think that showing how to act can encourage and change someone to be better. Being a good role model can make young people want to change. Actions often mean more than words. Words can be empty, but what you do leaves a mark. For instance, when someone says one thing but does another, we call them a 'hypocrite.' So, we can't trust words as much as we can trust what someone does. Actions can push people to improve. Many look up to their family not for their words, but for how they act well. Your own actions can also make others better. When you're with the wrong crowd, you might act like them. But if you grow up with someone who acts well and is nice, you'll likely be nice too. It's often what you see, not just what you hear, that can change you. People change from watching how others act, not just from listening to them. Many people focus more on what you do than what you say. Actions often have a bigger effect on people. If you're told not to do something bad, you might just do it anyway. Sometimes, no matter how good your advice is, they won't listen. That's why I think actions are stronger than words. In the end, I believe that being a good example is a great way to inspire others.

But even after reaching our goal, we can't stop and do nothing. We can rest, but we should then set a new goal. If we stop and do nothing, our lives will stop too, and we'll lose what we've done.

It also helps them find new things they like, get ready, and not waste time in high school. For example, when kids start their chosen job, they will already know some things and won't be behind.\n\nSecond, taking classes for a certain job lets kids figure out if they really want to study that job later.

Instead, we should think about what we really want.\n\nSecond, choosing on our own helps us grow mentally. For example, someone might not make the best choice at first, but they can learn from this mistake. This is very true for young people. They can then make better choices later. Being able to rely on oneself is important for growth and following one's own thoughts. At some point in life, we will have to make a choice alone.

In school, at work, or even at home, there are rules that you might need to follow, even in a small group. When you work in a group, you talk with your team. First, you tell the team what you want to do on the project. You talk about it to see if they like your idea. Second, they can give you help with the work. They give you ideas and talk about what everyone has added. Or at home, when the family is planning a party, everyone talks about what to do. This way, they can help plan what will be best for the party. It's not just for parties; it can be for housework or looking after the house. If something breaks in the house, everyone comes up with ideas to fix it together. Working by yourself is also good. You have more room to work on the project. You can handle the work. If you have an idea, you can work on it alone without asking anyone. You make your own choices for the project. When you finish, you get all the credit. Another thing about working alone is that you don't need to talk things over with anyone. So, working alone has its own good points. Both ways have their good points and bad points. Working with others means you can get help and different views. They can help you with anything you need, or you can help them. But you need to talk about ideas with them or ask if it's okay to do something on the project. When you work alone, you have your own space and ideas for the project. You don't need to talk with anyone. But you don't have anyone to help or give another view. Sometimes you need help or another person's thoughts. So, I think both ways are good for a project, whether it's at work, in school, or at home. Working alone lets you make all the decisions, and you get all the credit. But sometimes you need help.

I will talk about how we can do more by being active rather than waiting for others to do things for us.\n\nSome might argue that being inactive has its uses. They might think, why work hard if it ends up wrong, and you don't finish what you wanted? You avoid work because someone else does it. Why bother when others can do it? You don't have to worry because you know someone will get it done. These are reasons why some people prefer to wait for others to do things.\n\nDo I believe being inactive is useful? No, I don't think it is. Here's why: when you finish something you've worked on for a long time, it feels great. People who wait for things to happen can't feel the same as when you finish something on your own. By keeping busy, you learn new things. By trying new challenges, you grow. I believe being active is much better than doing nothing. These are my reasons for thinking that we can do more by being active.\n\n'Determine never to be idle... it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing.' People may have different views on this, but in the end, you choose what you believe. But remember, waiting for something to be done isn't always good because it might take too long. That's why you should try to do things yourself. You don't have to wait, and you learn more by doing it yourself."}

I think it's a bad idea to pick your job when you are very young. This is because when you start high school, you are not grown up enough. Your way of thinking changes a lot in high school. Also, you might not know if the classes for your job are too hard for you. As you get older, you become more grown up. You are more like an adult and less like a little kid. But when you are in the first year of high school, you are still like a little kid. You think like a kid. Picking your job at 12-14 years old is too soon. We don't know much about the job we pick at that age. We pick it because it's our 'dream job,' but that's just our imagination. When you start high school, you start your own journey. In the first year, you are the same as before. But in the second and third years, you start to think differently. The job you wanted before doesn't seem right anymore. The classes you take are not interesting. You become a new person. We all change, but high school changes us the most. When you pick the job you want for the future, you don't know if the high school classes you need will be hard. If you choose a job that needs high-level classes, they will be tough. But first-year students don't know this. They are too young to understand what you need for the job they pick. You might think picking your job when you are young is good, but it's not. At 13 or 14, you are too young to make these choices. You still think like a little kid. It's better to pick your job in the second year of high school. By then, you are grown up enough to know what you are doing. So, it is too soon to make big choices about your future when you are young."}

Your phones can't offer all the fun. Why not try something different and enjoy the outdoors? There's plenty to do. Here are some simple outdoor activities you can try. You can go bike riding with your close ones. It's good exercise and keeps you active. You could even set a place to ride to. Camping is another fun choice. It's a way to create memories. Imagine sitting by a fire, roasting hot dogs, and telling stories. Roller skating is fun too. It uses your whole body. You can dance and do tricks on skates. Playing sports is another way to enjoy the outdoors. Soccer, football, tennis, and baseball are some sports you can play. Having a cookout with family and friends is also active. You can play with water guns, jump on a trampoline, or play board games. You can chat and laugh, making happy memories. Without these, you'd miss out on fun times with loved ones. If you're shy, reading a book outside is a good idea. You can enjoy a book alone. You don't always need people around to have fun. Walking your dog alone or with friends is another option. Your pet needs to have fun too. They have feelings just like us. People use their phones too much. This isn't the best way to make memories. Being outside more can help you meet new friends or even a special someone. We rely on technology a lot. But it's important to go outside and enjoy life. Some people work on social media, but it's still important to spend time outdoors. Living life means making memories and enjoying it fully. So, go outside and have fun. Even if you're not very active, it's good for you. Staying inside all the time isn't really living; it's just passing time. You could be having a great day with loved ones instead. Some people are healthier because they make better choices. Don't do nothing. It can lead to health problems. Being active is good for you. You only live once. Make good choices and stay healthy for yourself and others."}

We will have less time to spend with our families. We will also have less time to hang out with friends and more time with teachers. But we need time to play games, chat, and be outside. Some people like to stay indoors and talk. Many girls enjoy chatting, whether at school or anywhere else. This is why I don't want school to be longer by one and a half hours each day.\n\nFirst, if we make school longer by one and a half hours, we won't have time after school. This means we can't do things like soccer or basketball practice. We also can't go to the Boys and Girls Club. If school hours were normal, we would have a regular day. That's why they shouldn't make school longer each day.\n\nNext, because of longer school hours, we won't have time for family and friends. It feels like being in jail because we have to stay there. School will feel like it never ends. For example, in jail, a guard tells you what to do. In school, we have to do what the teacher says. But we should have time to be with family and cousins.\n\nAlso, we can't go to the gym if teachers only teach their subjects. If we finish our work, we might go to the gym. But I don't think we will. We might just have to stay in the same class for a long time. They might say we will have gym class, but I'm not sure. They might also say we have to take three tests at once or do four homework assignments in one day. Can we do that? No. Only if you are very smart or have finished all your homework, you might go to the gym or health class. We might have health class because the school board wants us to focus on studying, not playing or talking. They want us to work hard and get good grades. That's why they are making school longer. But I don't agree with it. If it was just 20 minutes longer, maybe I would agree. But I don't agree with making school one and a half hours longer each day.\n\nFinally, I don't agree with making school longer by one and a half hours each day. It's too much time in school and no time for family and friends. That's the main reason I don't agree with making school longer each day.\n\nFor example, don't you want to see your family and parents? I do. That's why school hours should stay the same. That's why I don't agree with this plan."}

There are two kinds of people who believe in being self-reliant and who also look for advice from experts on important things in life. The first kind are sure of themselves and their own ideas. I think these people make their own choices and that is good because they don't rely on what others think about their lives. They are more effective and sure of themselves because they don't need help from others. They ignore advice from others because they are confident and don't care about others' opinions of them. It is wrong to think we know it all and don't need anyone else's help, to think we are always right and others are wrong, and to believe we are better than others. These thoughts can make us choose poorly in life. We all need help from others, to hear their advice, learn from their experiences, and consider their views. This helps us grow and make better choices for our lives. The second kind are those who listen to advice and learn from people older than them. They look for help from others to grow, hear ways to get better, learn from one another, and watch others' experiences. This doesn't mean they rely too much on others; they just accept that they don't know everything and need help. In the end, both kinds of people look for advice from experts on big life issues, to learn from those who have more experience, like adults. This helps us become mature and develop emotionally, starting to act like wise adults, thinking and making our own choices. It's not bad to look for advice to make better choices; it's bad when you don't ask for help because you think you're self-reliant, better than others, and know it all. We should ask for advice from experts. These people give us their views and share their experiences so we can understand things better. Then, we need to decide for ourselves and do what's best for us."}

Then, when we go back to school, we can remember what we learned before Summer Vacation.

But, we should not be busy all the time. We need to enjoy life too. We live every day and die only once. So, we should make each day the best. Once a day is gone, we can't get it back. If we miss something, we can't fix it. We should think before we act to make sure it's good. If we make a mistake, we can't change it. How we act and treat people matters. How you treat others is how life will treat you, not now, but later. Life is fair. We should treat others how we want to be treated. What we do now will affect us later. If you are good, good things will happen to you. If you are bad, you might think everything is fine. But then, life will surprise you with something bad. It will be worse than what you did. Life is about doing good and loving it. Even when things are tough, remember everything happens for a reason. It will help you somehow. Be ready for anything every day.

We are hurting ourselves and don't see it. We destroy nature for our wants, not thinking about the harm. Scientists look for new planets, but Earth is our only home. We must stop damaging it. Rich and poor people can be selfish. They think only of themselves, not others or the planet. We are hurting ourselves for money, not caring about the air or what we destroy. We are driving animals to extinction by taking their homes and food. We should share the planet with them. We need to stop building and destroying. We should see the harm we do to each other and nature. Isn't it enough? We are shortening the lives of future generations. We should share our world and live together, not fight. Wars are pointless.

Take a chef who knows what to cook and what to use. They still try to cook better. Or look at Bob Ross, the painter. He was great at painting, but he always tried new things on his TV show and YouTube videos. Even experts make mistakes. When they do, they fix them, learn, and get better. Bob Ross would fix his mistakes on TV. A master builder might rebuild a part of a building to improve it. I'm not saying Emerson is wrong. It's his view, and he's not making us agree. He's just sharing his thoughts, and we can choose to agree or not. It's good to keep improving, whether you're a master or not. It helps you succeed.

{"text_id": "A3ADD7AB0FB8", "output_essay": "I don't agree because people get up at 6:00 to get ready for school, and they don't want to wake up even earlier; students become tired. First, students often sleep in class while the teacher is talking. If they get in trouble, they don't want more school time. They would rather call their parents to pick them up. Teachers are tired too; they get up at 5:00 to prepare for the day. Even though it seemed like a good idea to have an extra hour, both teachers and students are too sleepy in the morning. But, I do think that if students have work they didn't finish, they should stay after school to complete it. If they don't, they might get poor grades. When teachers assign homework, many students don't do it at home. They prefer to do other things and forget about the homework. Then, they remember the homework at school when it's too late. If you have homework, go back and do it with your friends and teachers. That's one reason why people stay for clubs. Some don't care about clubs, but they do care about sports; that helps them earn more credits. If you want to stay for after-school activities, do so. Practice your sports and finish your work, or choose to do it at home. Teachers have a point; they could use an extra hour to teach more. But they could get tired or choose to help students after school for better grades. Many students fail because they don't complete their work. That's why they should stay after school with teachers and friends to finish and improve their grades. They are right about after-school time because it helps finish work.

First, everyone sees things differently. If you listen to others, you can mix your ideas with theirs. This might help you later. For example, in a school project, students share ideas to make the project better. Second, many people are afraid to talk about their problems.

We should always work to get better. For example, if someone wants to be a good singer and knows about music but does not try to show their talent, they will not succeed as a singer or sing on big stages. This is because they do not work to improve their singing or take extra steps, like starting to sing at school or other places.\n\nSecond, to do something big in life and be a better person or worker, one must get better at their skills, aim higher, and do all they can to be the best in their job, school, or college. We always have new things to learn, and there are always chances to reach our goals. For instance, doctors and lawyers always find new things to learn. Learning new things every day helps them be the best in their group or area.

Some schools say that students with bad grades can't be in clubs or sports. A student won't get anywhere if they don't do anything. Doing well can be hard, but without trying, they can't get better grades or join school activities. Doing nothing gets you nowhere.

Other students thought about starting a club for students to join. It was a smart move to start this club.

You should learn more about the job before you decide. Taking classes you don't need for a job you won't want later is a waste. That's why you should think carefully about the job that's right for you. Some people think it's good to pick a job early. But as you grow up, your views change. It's better to wait and pick the right job so you don't regret your choice. Students should have time to explore different jobs and then decide. If you stick with one job, it might get boring. You might have to go back to school to learn about a new job you like. It's better to pick a job that you'll want for a long time, unless you don't mind learning something new later. When you're young, jobs can seem easy, like on TV or in magazines. But it's different in real life. You should pick a job you'll enjoy after you learn what it really involves and what classes you need. People who like the idea of choosing a job early might have done it themselves. If they picked their career early and are happy, that's great. But I think students should wait until high school to think about jobs. They should learn about jobs that fit their interests and who they are. Sometimes, choosing a job early is about following a childhood dream. But you have time to find the right job that has everything you're looking for. People have different ideas about this. When I was young, I wanted to be a doctor. Then I wanted to do performing arts or be a nurse. Some kids want to be firefighters and they do. That's why I don't think it's good to learn about a job you wanted as a kid and then change your mind. Students should be sure about their job choice before taking classes. As I said, everyone has their own ideas about picking a career early. Everyone's different and can decide what's best for them."}
{"text_id": "1CE68763BF59", "output_essay": "These days, there's a big argument about how technology changes our lives. Many people say technology improves the way we talk to each other, but some disagree. I believe technology hurts our communication. This is clear when we look at teenagers fighting with their parents, people becoming less social, and the struggle to talk to others. As a teenager, I see these problems at home, school, and work. Teenagers have trouble with technology. They use it too much, and it causes fights in the family. Parents try to stop their kids from always being on their phones. Teens annoy their families when they use phones in school to cheat, record fights, or tease others. Technology also harms teens' mental health. Some stay up all night on their phones instead of sleeping. This affects their thinking, talking, and reactions. For example, I'm on my phone for eight hours a day, can't focus well, and sometimes get panic attacks. A psychologist told me lack of sleep was causing my problems and I should stop using my phone at bedtime. More people are becoming less social. Online games change how they talk to others. Many prefer playing games alone instead of meeting people. Kids choose games over going out with their parents. Social media also stops people from meeting up. They just text or call instead. People are losing the skill to talk and be with others. Some are so used to technology that they can't interact well. I saw this at work when a customer ignored me because he was on his phone. He left without buying anything. Technology is useful for things like shopping online, finding homework help, and quick chats. But it has more downsides, like bad habits and mistakes. Technology can make life worse. It hurts our family ties, our thoughts, and our mental health. Some don't see the damage and just accept it. Technology leads to bad habits and it's hurting our families and communities. That's why I think technology has a bad effect on our lives."}

When you are a good example to your friends and family, you help them in a positive way. For example, I want to be a vet because my cousin showed me how great that job is. She changed me. If you act badly, people won't pay attention or be changed. You want people to notice and be proud of you. This inspires them to do well too. My mom always said to be a good example for my younger brothers and sisters. I didn't listen at first. Then I saw they copied what I did. This made me see that you're like a leader when you do the right thing. Some people might do drugs and get attention. But you should always think about making your parents proud. Think about how what you do can change others. Even if you're not close to your family, they still want the best for you. They want to be happy and proud of what you do. Think about the future. In 10 years, you might have your dream job and kids. You'd want your kids to be like you or even better, with many goals. People see things differently. Say you want a job at a fast-food place. Watch how they act before you ask for a job. If they are nice, you might want to work there. Changing others for the better should make you feel good. You helped them get where they are.

The teacher asked us if we wanted to work alone or in groups. Some wanted to work alone, others in groups. I chose to work by myself. I had a hard time and didn't know what to do. Meanwhile, students in groups finished quickly. Teachers should have students work in groups. It lets them share ideas. But some students like to work alone. They think groups are distracting. It's okay to work alone. But in a group, you can put together many ideas. Sure, students might talk about other things. But we have school staff to handle any issues. I believe group work is good. It helps students create a big idea from many small ones. Also, it's a better way to learn. Studies say high school students share more when talking with friends. They work better together."}

Some students like to work alone, but working with others can make our talking and listening skills better. This is good for our future. I think working with others is better than working alone. When you're in a group, you can share many ideas about the same thing. These ideas come from what we have learned in different ways. There's a saying, 'Two minds think better than one.' This means that working with others can give us more ideas on how to start something or make good choices for our work. In a group, you have more people to help and more ideas than just one person. You can split the work so everyone has a part. But if someone doesn't do their part, the whole group's work might not get finished. A group depends on its members like a building depends on its supports; if one fails, the whole thing can fall down. Working in a group can be hard, too. You have to pick the right people to work with. If you pick the wrong people, you might waste time because they talk about other things. Many stories, movies, and books show that working in a group can be better and stronger than working alone. Some people always want to do things by themselves. But sometimes, they need help with things they can't do alone or don't know how to do. This doesn't mean working alone is bad; some students work alone because they get distracted by others. In the end, working in a group is better than working alone. It gives us good experience, helps us talk to others, and lets us make friends. These things are important for being a better person and for learning how to work well with others, whether they are new or old friends."}

I believe that having a friendly and open nature can change the people you are with a lot. Also, if you show that you work hard and give a lot to your community, it can make others want to do the same. \n\nWhen you act well and are friendly, it can change the people you hang out with. For instance, if you have a friend who acts very nicely, it can make you want to act better too. Another example is when people see what kind of person you are and how you help others with what they need, it can make them feel good in many ways. This could make them want to do nice things later on. \n\nIf you show that you work hard and do a lot for your community, it can change others in a good way. If you help the community by setting up fundraisers or keeping the area clean, it makes the community better and gets others to do the same. Also, if you show that you work very hard at something, it can show what kind of person you are. This can help change those around you to do well in their own goals for the future. \n\nSome people might think that how you act doesn't change others because they think there are many other ways to change people without showing your nature. I think the opposite because how you act can change others because of the mood you set and how you behave.

Thomas Jefferson said that if you believe in something, you can do it. He meant that hard work is worth it and better than doing nothing. It doesn't matter how fast or slow you work. What counts is how much effort you put in. Thomas Jefferson always tried new things and did his best with them. I believe doing nothing is useless.

I think having a big imagination is better than just having a lot of facts. I think imagination is more important because it helps your mind grow, it makes you more interesting, and it helps you think of new ideas. \n\nThe first reason I think imagination is better is that it helps your mind grow. Knowledge can help your mind too, but imagination does it better. Without it, your brain would be full of words and numbers. You would only think about facts and charts. Your mind would always be stuck on them. But with imagination, your mind can go on adventures and think about things you never thought of before. \n\nThe second reason imagination is better is that it makes you more interesting. Without it, you would be boring. You wouldn't have many feelings. Sometimes you wouldn't feel anything at all. But with imagination, you can show who you are more. You're not stuck feeling one way; you can feel any way you want. \n\nThe third reason imagination is better is that it helps you think of new ideas. Being able to think of new things is important for your mind. Imagination makes you more creative and helps you come up with new things. If people weren't creative, many things we have now wouldn't exist. Things like phones or the internet might not be here without creativity. And you need imagination to be creative. \n\nIn the end, imagination is more important because it helps your mind, makes you more interesting, and helps you think of new ideas. This is just what I think. It's fine if you think facts are more important. I understand why some people might think that. I respect their opinion. But if you ask me what's more important, I would say 'imagination.'"}

I think that students should pick a job path in their first year of high school. Picking a job early helps you pay attention to your schoolwork and your future. First, students should pick a job that is good for them. They should pick a job that pays well and makes them happy. The school will offer the classes they need to reach their goals. These classes can be tough, but don't quit. Quitting won't help you meet your goals later. Next, schools should have classes for the jobs students want. These jobs can pay a lot or a little. For example, being a doctor pays a lot, so schools should have the right classes and resources for that. Schools should also help students get scholarship money for college. This money can help pay for college and let them follow their job path after high school. But, students might want to switch their job path after they start their classes. Some schools might not have the right classes or resources for all jobs. For example, some schools don't have what's needed to become a professor. They might not even have enough teachers for some classes. These are some downsides of choosing your classes early in high school. If you start on a job path, you can change it after a year. If your school doesn't have the right classes, you can move to one that does. You can also take online classes if there's no teacher for your job path. In conclusion, I think students should pick a job path in their first year of high school. Picking a job early helps you focus on your schoolwork and future. You shouldn't quit because quitting won't help you reach your goals. These are some great reasons to think about your future and pick a job early in high school."}

If you like to do things yourself, you should still ask experts for advice. This way, you will learn more, have a better chance of doing well, and figure out what is best for you.\n\nOne way to get advice is to ask people what they think. This gives you a new way to look at things and helps you learn. For example, in school, you learn a lot by asking the teacher for help. This will surely give you more knowledge and get you ready for the future. Getting different views from people is useful because it helps you see things in a new way and make good choices for yourself.\n\nAnother reason to ask for help is to be successful. To do well, you need to work hard and know how to do it. Some people know more than you, so asking them for advice can help you reach your goals. They can point you in the right direction and help you succeed. You might not always succeed, but if you get help, you have a much better chance than if you just rely on yourself.\n\nAsking for help can also show you the best choice for you. Your own ideas might not always lead to the best choice, but advice from others can. Many people can tell you the right thing to do because they know more. Take personal trainers, for example. They can help you pick a good diet and exercise plan because they know what works. Getting advice can help you make the best choices for yourself. Sometimes, your own ideas might not be the best.\n\nSo, people should ask experts and leaders for advice. It's better to get help to do big things and succeed.

But, thinking and working on a goal every day is not the best plan. This is because we need time for ourselves, we need to rest our minds to keep going, and stress will come into our lives. First, to do well in this world, we need a plan with useful tasks and also time to do what we like. We need time to relax and enjoy life. Five years ago, my parents were too busy to take a day off and look after me during school. My dad worked at a building company from Monday to Saturday, and my mom was studying at college. We didn't have time to talk a lot and enjoy a day at home. We needed a break, but when Spring Break came, we stopped our usual things. My parents and I were happy because we had time for fun, and we stopped worrying about school and work. After the break, we were ready to start our usual things again. Taking a break helps us get ready to start again. Second, people can reach big goals, but it takes time. In middle school, my teacher let us take breaks to rest. My teacher said doing nothing gives us energy and helps us keep going with schoolwork. This helped me because I could focus better on school. Also, when my friends were tired, they asked for a break to clear their heads from worries. My friends and I needed time to meet new people. Meeting someone new makes me feel important to them. We need time not just for tasks and duties but also to rest and stop worrying about work to rest our minds and do well. Finally, stress can lead to feeling very down. Life can be hard. By focusing more on must-do tasks than on fun, you see the bad side of life. Some people might give up their goals by not having time for themselves. For example, when my older brother went to college, he needed money for school and things. He had to work at a restaurant to make money. When he started college and work, I saw he was very tired, stressed, and quiet. He felt he couldn't finish college. After a few days, he left college and his job because not having time for himself made him stop trying. He could have reached his goal, but too much work and stress made him very down. Breaks are as important as tasks in our lives. Many say that starting tasks early and fast gives you more chances to finish them. Also, some think breaks are not needed or good for reaching a goal; however, taking a break can change your life. Because you have time to rest your mind, you also have time for yourself, and stress doesn't hurt your health. Life is short; don't let tasks make you feel down. Take a break and start again."}

For example, many of us teenagers come home from school and do nothing. We could be doing school work or homework, but we don't. This gives us too much free time. Also, if everyone in the world did things every day, I think there would be fewer problems. This is why I think being busy is the best way to get a lot done. Next, I think it's better to always be busy than to do nothing. Being busy can change your life or someone else's life. Doing tasks now and then also makes you ready for the future. If you do nothing, you waste time. You could be helping someone or yourself. If you are busy, you can do more for things and people than if you just sit around.

Next, if students know what job they want, they can start groups like a health group or a sports group to use their time well. They learn skills that help the community. But there's an issue: what about students who don't know what job they want? They might skip school because of this. Then, if students don't go to high school because they don't know what job they want, they won't get a good job or have a good life later. That's why I don't agree with places that make students choose a job before high school. They need to learn and get ready for what comes next; school is key for all kids. Lastly, I feel that some places and high schools should try harder to guide their community and support students in choosing their classes. This way, students will prepare for life and find a good job. These students have many chances."}
{"text_id": "A91334BE97E8", "output_essay": "Dear Educators,\n\nI am writing to share my thoughts on this idea. I believe that giving students three to four weeks of summer vacation is a great idea. First, it's good because students won't forget what they learned in school. For example, with a long summer break, they will spend all day outside having fun and will stop thinking about school.\n\nSecond, a longer winter break is good for students because it's very cold. They won't have to be cold waiting for the bus. For example, walking to school in the cold can make them sick. It's better for them to stay warm at home. Third, a week off in the spring and fall will let them rest. For example, they can sleep more and have time for homework. These are my reasons and examples for changing students' vacation days. Thank you for reading my letter.\n\nSincerely,\n\nGeneric_Name"}

My first reason is that in a group, if I don't know something, others can help me and give me lots of ideas. When you work alone, there is no one to help you. My second reason is that being in a group is more fun. You can talk and not feel bored. If you're not sure about what you're doing, you can ask others or try different things. You have more choices. Working alone can be boring, and if you're stuck, you might feel lost. My third reason is that in a group, you don't have to do as much work. The work is shared among the group members. Also, if you need to buy things for the work, the group can help pay for them. But if you work alone, you have to pay for everything yourself. You also do more work and have fewer ideas when you're by yourself. This is why I think group work is better for me, even though I know some people may not agree."}

You don't just think about what your imagination shows you. Knowledge is useful, but imagination is better in this situation. With imagination, you can think and learn new things. Imagination is better for people because it helps when you are bored. If someone talks about their new truck, you will think about what it looks like. Some people say knowledge is more important. But how can you think if you can't imagine things? I think that's not possible. Yes, knowledge can help you achieve things. But you need imagination to see yourself in the future, reaching your goals. Imagination is the best. It's even more important than knowledge. Without imagination, you can't think at all. Knowledge is good, but it's not much use if you can't think because you lack imagination."}

When Thomas says, 'Determine never to be idle,' I think he means don't be lazy. Being inactive is useless. If you move around a lot, you finish tasks faster than lazy people. If you sit or lie down doing nothing, your day feels very long. You might just watch TV or play games. I do both. It's fine to do both, but I prefer being outside. Every day is important to me. Some people enjoy working out, others don't. Most people prefer to be lazy. Sometimes there's nothing to do, but we should go out and play sports or do hobbies we enjoy. Fast food affects us! It wastes our time. People buy food, go home, eat, and lie down. This is why some people are not active. Not everyone is the same. Some can't go outside. Being lazy is okay sometimes. We need days to rest. We are all human. No one should judge us. Having a job fills time and teaches us new things. I like this topic. I may not have special skills, but I know how to enjoy life. I play basketball and skateboard. I also love spending time with friends. And don't forget to spend time with loved ones because we don't know about tomorrow."}
{"text_id": "4FA52B61777E", "output_essay": "Do we get more done if we are always busy? I believe that when we help others, we achieve something good. Thomas Jefferson was famous for many things, but he did not create the light bulb; that was Thomas Edison. Jefferson wanted to do something important in his life. He said we should always be busy doing good. If we want to do something in life, we should try because life is short, and we should help those who need it.\n\nSome people think doing nothing can be useful, but we can decide what we want to achieve. But sometimes, doing nothing can take over. If Thomas Jefferson were alive today, he would help the world understand themselves and what it means to set a goal and chase it. Some people don't understand what doing nothing means; I don't really either. It's a big word, but I'm sure it's not something bad.\n\nThomas Jefferson was very famous for his actions. They wrote books about him, and they liked his investments and work. Jefferson was a kind person; he wanted to know how to help people. People began to use his ideas in their homes. Without his work, no one would have invented things like he did. It took time for his ideas to succeed, but it turned out well. It would be great if we could meet him today.\n\nWhen I was in school, we learned about famous people who did good things in life. We learned about Thomas Jefferson and how he started his life. We didn't learn much about his life or childhood; we only learned where he was born and who his parents were. Jefferson is a great person, and his work changed the world for others to dream about their own lives.\n\nBut it's never too late to help others and reach your goals, no matter how hard it is or what people will think. As long as you have your goals in mind and know what people want to see in the world, then yes, you can change the world. It just takes time to learn in school and understand what you need to know."}
{"text_id": "B6620FD3348B", "output_essay": "\"Never be lazy... It's amazing what we can do if we keep busy.\" This is what Thomas Jefferson said. He meant that being lazy won't help us reach our goals. We should always be busy and work hard towards them. It's surprising that the best way to get something done is to stay busy. Some think we do more when we're not busy because we can plan our goals better. But in truth, we do more when we're busy. This is because we have more time to work on our goals and reach them faster. We also don't waste time that we could use to work on our goals.\n\nSome say we do more when we're not busy because we can plan our goals. They think being still is good because it gives them time to think about what they want in life. They have their goals planned out. The New York Times says people who take breaks are often sure about what they want in life. They know what goals they want to reach. They also feel more driven and work harder on their goals.\n\nBut, we do more when we're busy. This is because we have more time to work on our goals and reach them faster. Being busy is the best way to reach our goals. A study from Generic School shows that all successful people were busy with their goals. They never stopped to wait for success to come. We must always be working. Our goals won't come easy. As we work on our goals, we will reach them faster.\n\nWe do more when we're busy because we don't waste time. When we work hard on our goals, we might think we need to stop and rest. But we shouldn't. That would waste time we could use to work more. My dad is a good example. When he was young and finished school, he wanted to be an Industrial Engineer. But he didn't go to college right away. He wanted to take a year off. That was a mistake. He didn't work during that year. He spent some of the money he saved for college. Now, he's not an Industrial Engineer. He didn't reach his goal because he wasted time he could have used to reach it.\n\nEven though some think being still is better for reaching goals, being busy is the best way. This is because we can reach our goals faster and we don't waste time. To sum up, being lazy is not the best way. The truth is, by staying busy, we can reach our goals and get many great things. Taking a break might feel good, but it's not as good as getting what you want in life. Doing things that show our hard work and commitment is better."}
{"text_id": "181D23AC5C01", "output_essay": "In my essay, I will talk about how using technology can limit the time we spend with other people. I will explain the good and bad sides of this issue. I believe that technology has both helped and hurt our lives. For example, it is now easy to shop online, but this means we meet fewer people because we rely on technology more for our needs. Technology is helpful because it lets us do many things easily, like shopping and playing games on the internet. It is good because it saves time. Some people like doing things online because it's quick, while others prefer meeting people because they find it more rewarding. Technology gives us useful things like cars, computers, phones, and Wi-Fi. Wi-Fi is very important because we need it to access the internet at home or school. Without it, we would miss out on many things, which would be bad. However, technology can also be harmful. Staring at your phone too much can hurt your eyes. Using online services a lot means we talk to each other less. This is like when many people lost their jobs during The Great Depression, and it hurt their lives. When we use technology more, we talk less to each other. I think technology is a big problem because people spend too much time on their devices and don't take breaks. This can make someone lose friends if they care more about their phone than people. Phones can also distract us and cause problems. But technology is still helpful for things like Wi-Fi, which lets us do our work. I have discussed how technology can be good and bad. It can change our lives in both ways. I compared this to job losses in The Great Depression. They are different, but both show how big changes can affect us. I think technology changes our lives, for better or worse, depending on how we use it now and in the future."}

It can change friendships, and using it too much can hurt you. For example, your eyes might get blurry if you look at screens for too long. The goal of technology is to make work easier, quicker, and better. It has good and bad effects on people. For example, using your phone a lot can make you forget about others. But technology can also help you with your work. \n\nThe good thing about technology is that you can make a call with your cell phone when you are not at home. Without technology, we couldn't do many things we do now, like checking the news, the weather, or looking at messages we missed. The latest technology is very creative, including things like smartwatches. You find technology in cars, planes, and game controllers. But it has problems too, like hurting your eyes or making your vision blurry if you use it too much. Also, if you focus too much on technology, you might ignore your partner or not pay enough attention to them. \n\nTechnology is everywhere and will surely be part of the future. It is the most wanted thing in the market, in the world. So, it's important to not use technology too much. Pay more attention to your partners instead of your gadgets.

I want to talk to people there, and I would learn from someone who knows the language. After I learn it, I will teach my family. We can have fun learning together. Then, we can all go to Japan for a holiday. It will be easy because we will know the language. \n\nMy second reason is to see the city from a tall hotel. When you walk in the city, you see many signs and colors. At night, you might see fireworks. I want to see things related to anime because that's where it started. I also want to see a famous Goku statue. \n\nMy third reason is to visit a soccer team in Japan. I want to ask if I can practice with them and see their stadium. Practicing with them will let me feel like a pro. Then, I can watch a game if I buy a ticket. I can get their autographs to remember the day. \n\nMy last reason to visit Japan is to try their food, like sushi. I want to eat sushi where it was first made.

But if you think they didn't try their hardest and did things right, and you say it just so they don't feel bad, they won't keep trying. Some people think telling students they did well is right because they did a good job. But not telling them can lead to more success because they will try harder and believe in themselves more.\n\nTelling students they did well is right if they tried their hardest. For example, in school, imagine your art teacher asks you to draw a face. You start drawing. She wants it done in three days, but you finish in one day. She might be happy and tell you it's good. But then she sees you didn't try your hardest. How can she give you a good grade for not trying hard, even if she said it was good?\n\nBy not telling students they did well, they will do better because they will try their hardest. If you think your work isn't your best, start over and keep trying. Don't rush just because others are done. If they are done, it's not because they don't care or are smarter. People who try hard can do much better and succeed more.\n\nBy not telling students they did well, they can do better and believe in themselves. Trying and saying you can do it shows you believe in yourself. You should always be positive about what you want to do in life or when you have goals. I have a friend who always asks if her work is right or wrong, even when it's right, because she doesn't believe in herself.\n\nIn conclusion, telling students they did well is not always good. It's like saying they should stop working on it and it sets low goals for learning. But by telling them to work hard and explaining things, they will do more and believe in themselves. That's why trying and not giving up is the way to be someone in life or have a career. Self-esteem comes from success through hard work, not from your teacher or others saying good things."}

I prefer to work with others in class because it seems easier and more helpful to work with classmates. Working with others keeps you entertained, and you can share the work with your partner. I believe group work is better than working alone.\n\nOne reason I think group work is better is that you can help each other with the task or project. If someone in your group is struggling, you can help them. The whole group gets the same grade, so we all share the results. If your partner needs something, like markers, you can get it for them while they keep working. If someone is not there, the rest of the group can cover their part until they return.\n\nAnother reason group work is better is that you can divide the work fairly. If you have four people in your group, each person does a quarter of the work. If someone is not there, you can do their part. The project or task gets done faster when you split the work. For a presentation, two people can make the slides and two can plan what to say.\n\nThe last reason I think group work is better is that it's fun to work with classmates. You can talk about sports or anything else while working. You can chat with other classmates to get their thoughts on your work. If you're stuck, you can look up answers on your phone. You'll discuss what you're doing with your group.\n\nI believe working in a group is better because you get help, share the work, and enjoy talking with your group and other classmates.

Real self-worth comes from doing well because students know they worked hard, they use what they learned, and they get more praise for their work. But some people think that just getting praise makes students feel good. For example, a student gave a talk and was told he did great. But maybe his friends just said that to be nice. Still, self-worth comes from doing well. First, students know they worked hard. Like a student who studied all weekend and got an A. He knew he would do well and felt good about himself. Also, there's a boy named PROPER_NAME who got better at skateboarding by practicing a lot. He is proud of himself. Next, they use what they learned. They know what they learned will help them. Someone might learn from a mistake and know they won't fail again. Or what they learn from a teacher helps with homework and tests and makes them feel ready. Also, students get more praise for their work. Like when you get a diploma, you know you earned it. You get praise for your hard work. You can also be seen as a good student if you take notes, join in, and get good grades. This kind of praise helps you feel good about yourself. In the end, real self-worth comes from doing well because students know they worked hard, they use what they learned, and they get more praise for their work.

{"text_id": "6F63F3BCD18D", "output_essay": "Why do we get more done when we're busy? It's because when you're doing many things at once, you move faster and finish tasks quicker. When you're not doing anything, you become lazy, and being lazy means you don't finish tasks. You should always be active. If you're not, you won't achieve anything.\n\nThomas Jefferson once said, \"Determine never to be idle... It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing.\" I agree with him. Being lazy and stubborn will stop you from succeeding. Not doing anything is a big reason why people fail to achieve. In life, we set goals. To reach these goals, you must work hard. People often put off tasks because they don't need to do them right away. But I think you should finish tasks as soon as you can. This way, you can relax later.\n\nWhen we're always busy, we don't think about resting. But when you do nothing, you feel tired or sleepy. This shows that not being active is bad. Take Thomas Jefferson for example. How did he become president? He worked hard and met his goals. Being active or not can lead to success or failure. By being active, you might go far and do many things you like. But if you're not active, you might fail and not meet your goals. People must choose their path in life, good or bad. They decide, no one else.\n\nBy finishing all your tasks, you achieve a lot. It's important to finish your tasks. Why? Because finishing tasks on time or early can make you feel proud. Feeling proud can boost your confidence and help you grow. You must be determined. You can't just ignore tasks and say you'll do them later. If you do, you'll never finish them.\n\nIn conclusion, we have many things to do in life. Being busy keeps your mind sharp. We all have days when we feel lazy. But you must always try to do more. Being busy helps us do a lot. I agree with Mr. Jefferson. We achieve a lot when we're busy. Thinking about many things at once is good for us. Indeed, we do more when we're always busy."}

How often do you hear someone say they want to work in marketing or own a business? Some kids pick the easy way, but the ones who really know what they want usually do well and get their dream job. Many college students don't know what to study, and kids my age probably don't know either. So, how many times did you change your mind about your job?

It's not nice, and it's not what you want. So you aim high. But then you see it might mean 8 or 14 more years of school. Time passes, and you didn't have as much fun as others because you were always studying. I was told to make a job out of what I love. Photographers, artists, and dancers do this. But a young student picking a job and then changing it in college isn't smart. They might learn things they'll never use.\n\nMany college students finish late or quit. Few finish in four years. This could be because of money or because it's too tough. This shows how much they care about their jobs. Not everyone gets the job they always wanted. If they did, we wouldn't have police or firefighters. It takes hard work and wanting it. I think we should help kids with jobs, but not when they're too young. High school juniors and seniors are the right age to get ready for college and jobs. If you ask a teacher if they always wanted to teach, most would say no. That's because you're choosing your whole life. So it's not good to make a middle school kid decide their whole future.\n\nA 14-year-old shouldn't have to pick a job. Being stuck in an office isn't ideal. Maybe you'll have your own office at home and be your own boss, but it's tough. Or you might be a lawyer because you want to, not because your parents were.

They help me understand the assignment better. In my English class, I had to write two paragraphs about summer vacation. We had 45 minutes to write. We wrote our own thoughts to mix together later. Getting different thoughts from classmates was useful. It helped me understand the assignment better. Working with others also helps save time. Writing alone takes me 1 hour and 30 minutes.

Having a goal is easy, but reaching it is tough. The key is to keep working. This is how we learn and get experience. Experience helps us succeed more in life. For example, a salesman can't be good if he has never sold anything. So, experience is important for success, and we get it by working. This is why many jobs want people who have worked before. Experience makes us more confident in reaching our goals. Confidence is important. It makes reaching goals easier and quicker. Research shows that confident people are more successful. Our society thinks so too; a confident person is seen as better than someone who is nervous. It's hard for people to leave their comfort zone, which is why they do nothing. But doing nothing is like giving up. It doesn't help us or give us anything good. It actually stops us from reaching our goals. People need to find the will to work; this is the solution to stop doing nothing. In the end, it's much better to always be working than doing nothing.

I believe it's a bad idea because students need a break from their studies before starting again in the fall. Here are my reasons: \n\nStudents need to spend time with their families and rest from school stress. \n\nDuring summer, parents have more free time. Families can celebrate holidays, go to festivals, visit museums, travel abroad, and learn in a fun way. They don't have to worry about school for a while. For example, my friend Generic_Name went on a trip to Generic_City with her family in the summer. She had no stress about missing school or homework. She still learned new things while having fun on her trip. \n\nStudents need a break from the stress of school so they can think clearly and be ready to learn more in the new school year. They don't really forget what they've learned because we keep learning all the time. My sister Generic_Name, who is in her junior year, has to take many important tests. She would rather have a summer break to relax and get ready for her last year of school. Some people say that having no long summer break is good because students keep their minds sharp and don't forget what they've learned. But I think these reasons are not strong enough. Every student needs a break. Even if they don't get distracted, it's okay. Holidays are for fun, not for study or worry about the next school year. They need to clear their minds to learn new things later. \n\nIn conclusion, I think balance is important. If students are doing well with their work and tests, they should have a long summer break. They have earned it. Not only students, but teachers and school staff need this time too. Students keep what they've learned safe in their minds. They won't forget it. Plus, students come back after summer feeling good and ready to learn new things."}

If a student likes sports, he can work out like an athlete. But he does not have to become one. Everyone has different interests. They should not just think about future jobs.

{"text_id": "1F4BEAB4F48F", "output_essay": "Albert Schweitzer, a thinker and doctor, once said, \"Being an example is not the main way to influence others; it's the only way.\" I think there are other ways to influence people. Gary Vee, a popular figure, doesn't only show his customers what to do. He also helps them. I think teaching, showing, and having faith are key to influencing someone.\n\nI understand this well, and many others might too. When I was young, my parents didn't just show me how to act; they explained things to me. Otherwise, someone might tell you, \"I did this or that.\" That's an example, but it doesn't really change what people think. You need to show them you can do something. Imagine you want to be a pro soccer player. Your coach can't just be a good example. He needs to teach you, help you, and show you that you can make it. It's like a test; if you don't study, you won't pass. It's the same in soccer: you need to practice. Just watching won't help much.\n\nIf I were a role model, I'd say believing in yourself is most important. If you don't, you won't get very far. You'll always think negatively. It's like playing a video game and losing. You need to think, \"Yes, I can win.\" And if you do, you might just win. Take Michael Jordan. He was kicked off his high school basketball team. But he didn't give up. He knew he could make it. Now, he's one of the greatest basketball players ever. He motivates young people to try to be like him. Losing weight is another example. You can't just walk into a gym and expect results. You have to believe you can do it. A fitness coach will show you others who have lost weight. But he will also teach you and help you along the way.\n\nThat's why I think being an example isn't the only way to influence someone. It's also about teaching them, helping them, showing them, and having faith in them."}

I think older people will only like the young ones if they make an effort. If you don't try to meet up with young students, you won't be close to your brother, if you have one. They will find out that young people can be fun, but not all are. It doesn't matter if you are young or old; just make friends and meet up.

These are my two favorite things to do. I like football because you can tackle people who run at you. I enjoy long walks because I like to see colorful things. Anything with lots of colors gets my attention. Another thing about football is that it needs teamwork, and I'm good at that. I think I'm very good at football and maybe one of the best. Some people like to visit new places like national parks. Others might like different sports like soccer or baseball. I don't really like those, but I did play baseball for a year. I think I was good at it. But I liked football more. I stopped playing baseball because my friend got hit in the face with the ball and it was scary. I don't go to parks much. I don't think they are for me. But many people like parks to run and walk their dogs. I think more people should play sports like football or baseball instead of just playing video games at home. I tell people to play outside or take a walk. It's good for you and fun. People who play video games a lot are missing out. They could have more fun outside. Most of my friends play video games a lot. They stay inside, look at screens, and get mad. I never really liked video games. They make people act silly. I liked them until 6th grade, then I stopped. I don't know why, but I did. Now, I spend most of my time outside. To finish, I wrote this to share how fun it is to be outside. There are many things to do outside instead of staying in, feeling bored, and not doing much."}

The University of Alexandria found that these choices shape how you live, like if you'll do well or not. Many believe that thinking quietly can lead to smarter choices. Picking your own path is best to reach your dreams because experts might mislead you, you'll be much happier when you succeed, and it turns you into a leader. \n\nFirst, experts and people in charge want your money. They're not there to help you for nothing. If they were, they wouldn't charge you. Picture this: you're low on money and think hiring a pro is smart. But they'll still want payment, not caring about your money problems. \n\nMy second point is about the joy of reaching your goals alone. Most who did it without help are more joyful than those who had it. Doing it solo changes your life in a special way. \n\nThirdly, deciding for yourself leads to leadership. You learn to handle issues because you've come this far alone. Being calm and experienced is what you gain from making choices. Leaders, like presidents or company bosses, can tackle problems and pick the best options. \n\nAt times, you might want a push or tips from family, pros, or pals. But this can't match the pride of making it by yourself. Owning all the credit for your wins is key."}
{"text_id": "0A1B8662B5AC", "output_essay": "A Program Good for Both Older and Younger Students. Have you ever seen a program that includes both older and younger students, or thought about if they would like each other? Older students know more because they have been around longer, which helps them solve problems. They can also make better friends since they come from different places. They can think of good ideas for a project because they have different life stories. The program is good for both groups because they can do things like contests, and they can learn from each other to reach the goals they set for their class, especially if they work together.\n\nFirst, this program is good for both older and younger students because they can do contests. Both groups will try very hard because they either want to win or do well in the program. They will use their time well and focus on their studies.\n\nThere is a saying, 'Education is the key to success.'\n\nWhen students compete, they study more to reach their dreams and to make others believe in them. Contests make students work harder and help them succeed.\n\nSecond, this program is good for both because 'they can learn from each other.'\n\nFor example, if I work with someone three years older than me on a project, it's easier to finish it. We come from different places and were raised by different people. This helps us learn from each other because we will want to know about ourselves. When we find out we are from different places, we will want to learn about each other's lives and how we do things. Learning from each other is good for us, especially when we understand what we like and don't like.\n\nLast, both students benefit from this program because they can reach their class goals, especially if they work as a team. There is a saying I remember, 'Two heads are better than one.' For instance, if one person can carry twenty out of fifty books, then two people can carry all fifty books or even more. The students have goals and dreams. But since they want the same thing, they will work together to help each other reach their goals.\n\nIn conclusion, both students will gain from this program because they can compete and work hard to achieve their dreams, to learn about each other, and to help each other aim for their goals. The benefits of a program that pairs older and younger students to support each other are listed above. Students can get help from those who are older, younger, or even from a different race or gender."}

The help they get will make them understand the subject or their homework better. Not everyone knows how to do things. Many kids can get help to learn better. They need help with homework they might not get. The teacher who gave the homework might help them. It's good to go for help because you might learn something new while you're there. Some kids don't learn as fast because their brains work differently. Some kids go to understand the subject and homework better. Homework can be hard. Sometimes, people forget their homework. But if you do it there and hand it in, that's good. Some kids don't do homework because they don't get it or don't have time. Most kids try hard, but some don't because they feel they can't do it. Many kids in class forget how to do the work. If they're sick, they won't know it well. Often, they can't focus because they're worried about other things. The way to get better is to focus on work. If they can't, the homework club is a good place to learn without worry. So, I think the homework club is good for them to get better at the subject and understand their homework more. The club is for those who need help and want to do better in a tough class."}
{"text_id": "2089E34381BE", "output_essay": "When students get to high school, they need to pay more attention to their studies because things are not easy or given to them. At 15 or 16, when you start high school, you may look for a job. Then you get more busy with school or work every day. Often, you can't do two things at once. So it's important to think early about what job you want in the future. Some students plan to go to college, but others don't. They just finish high school and start working right away.\n\nThinking about jobs is tough when you're young. After you finish school or college, you might not like the job you thought you wanted. Or it might not be what you expected. You might switch jobs and find one you're better at. So you need a backup plan. You also need to know how to handle your money. When you're young, you might not know what you're doing or what you want to be. You're busy with a part-time job, school, spending money, and being with friends. So many students don't focus on their future.\n\nKnowing your job when you're young can be good. You can put all your energy and money into it. But you might not like it when you get there. You might not feel as excited about it anymore. You can like many jobs, but not all are right for you. These days, students think about quitting school. They don't want to keep going with a job they chose because it's too hard or they don't like the study.\n\nMany students have a hard time in school. That's why they stop caring about their education and don't want to advance in their jobs. Half of the students don't graduate and just work in construction or other basic jobs. They don't have careers and stay in the same place. The other half, who care about their studies, do well in their jobs. They might even move up in their fields.\n\nI think it's not good to worry about your job when you're young. It's too much pressure. It's better to see where life leads you. You could try many things—sports, cooking, technology. There are many paths to find the right job for you and end up with a good one."}

They don't want to take the risk to grow. They think it's better to keep doing the same things. But this can hold them back at work. Having a goal helps people. It gives them steps to follow. When they reach their goal, they can do more than what they were good at. This can lead to a better life and make them feel proud of their achievements. \n\nI agree with Ralph Waldo Emerson.

Some say talking to people is good because it helps you become more confident. But for some, meeting people face-to-face is tough. Learning to look people in the eye is also tough. With new tech, you can buy books, shop, play games, and even go to school online. If I could, I'd stay home and do everything on the internet. Some think it's better to do things by yourself. I prefer doing things online. Some are great at talking to people. I know many who don't like to talk much. When I meet someone new, they ask why I'm quiet. I always say, \"I don't like people.\" Tech is helpful because it has many features. You can do almost anything online. It's a big help for those who need it. I think it's great that we can do so much online. I really don't enjoy talking to people. It makes me very nervous. I blush, talk fast, and my hands shake. My friends say I should talk to more people to get better. But I say no. I'd like to study online or be homeschooled. Going to regular schools means too many people. In the end, tech has improved a lot over the years. I think it's good to have many online options for those who don't like talking to others. I don't like interacting with people; it's uncomfortable.

{"text_id": "1CDBF6CC97BD", "output_essay": "People often tell you to 'Do this' or 'Do that.' But you can choose for yourself. I believe you should trust your own choices instead of letting others decide for you. One reason is that you can do what you like without anyone else's input.

I want to show you why it's better to decide for yourself. \n\nMy first point is that making your own choices lets you do what you enjoy. You don't need to listen to others. If you want to play soccer, football, baseball, or basketball, just go for it. Don't ask others what to do. They might suggest something you don't like or have already done. When you decide for yourself, you can choose what's right for you. You learn and have fun by making your own choices. \n\nMy second point is about gaining confidence and not being afraid to speak out. Many people are too shy or scared to say what they think. But if they made their own choices, they wouldn't feel this way. If you let others decide for you, you'll always be afraid to speak out. I used to be shy and let others decide for me. When I started making my own choices, I became more confident. Now I'm not so shy and can decide for myself. \n\nSome people think it's better to get advice and let others decide for us. They say experts know best because they've done it before. They can give us good tips to make things easier. They might help us decide or even decide for us. This could help us try new things and see if we like them. If not, we can get more advice to help us decide. \n\nI still believe it's better to make your own choices.

I think that getting a new job and learning new skills can open up better chances in life.\n\nFirst, learning a new language can give you more chances because you can get a job that needs someone who speaks two or more languages. For example, my cousin works as a secretary in a hospital and she speaks English and Spanish. She was scared to take the job because she thought people would laugh at her accent. She wasn't sure about working there. But she took the job and now she earns good money because she speaks both languages. She uses that money to pay for college.\n\nShe tried, and now she's reaching her goals.\n\nSecond, looking for a new job means you'll learn new things. I worked as a chef in a restaurant in the summer and knew everything about that job. When school started, my mom said I had to find a new job. I found one as a cashier. I was scared and thought it would be too hard. But I learned a lot and found being a cashier is less stressful and pays better than being a chef. Learning new things can make life easier and give you better chances. When I moved to this country, I felt out of place because I had always lived in my home country. But I moved for a better life. Over time, I felt like I belonged. I learned about the culture, got better education chances, and I'm going to college next year. I wouldn't have these chances back home. Even though I was scared to start over in a new place, this change is giving me a better life with more chances.\n\nOn the other hand, if you're already good at your job, trying something new might not be smart. For example, if you've been a teacher for years, it might not be wise to switch to being a veterinarian. You know how to work with students, not animals. Also, if you switch jobs and get fired, you could lose everything you've worked for.\n\nIn conclusion, learning new things can bring you better chances, and these chances can make life better and easier. It's hard to try the unknown, but if you don't try, you'll stay in the same place and never succeed or reach your goals. So, starting new things can help you succeed in life."}

They would be learning and getting ready for their job at the same time. Then, they could start working as soon as they finish high school. If a kid doesn't like the job they picked, they can try something else they might enjoy. This is important because almost all kids want to get out of high school quickly. They want to go to college and finish fast. Kids want to be on their own and not rely on their parents, but they can't get a job because they are too young. Kids should be able to pick a job early and become skilled workers. Even though many kids want a job early, some can't afford the classes. Here's a story: A friend of mine finished high school early.

Doing nothing is useless because you're not active. \n\nFor example, in school, if my teacher gives me time to do homework, I might waste that time. I would not get anything done.

It's amazing how much we can do if we keep busy. \n\nTake construction workers as another example. If they don't work hard, it will take them a long time to finish a building. But if they work hard, they can finish their work faster because they are busy all day. Building a building can take a year or two. If they finish in this time, they worked hard. If it takes them three or four years, they did not work hard. They did not do much on the days they worked. \n\nIn conclusion, Thomas Jefferson was right. It is great how much we can do when we keep busy. I understand this quote. It's true that the more effort we put in, the more we achieve. This quote is very valuable and easy to relate to.

But I still want to know more about hospital work, how to care for severe injuries, and understand diseases like cancer. I have many questions I want answers to. That's why I think you should pick me. \n\nMy mom is a nurse and she helped many people in Generic_City. When I was young, she would visit people's homes to help them at any time. She was always tired but never stopped helping. Being a doctor is hard, but I want to help people too. A doctor is someone who works in a hospital almost every day, not just someone who is rich. I want to learn what being a doctor really means because I know it's hard. \n\nI want to be a gynecologist. My sister joked that gynecologists need long fingers, and I worried because my fingers aren't long. For a moment, I thought I couldn't be a gynecologist. I want to be sure about my career choice. College is expensive, and being chosen for this program could help me decide if gynecology is right for me. \n\nIn conclusion, I believe I should be one of the two students chosen for an internship or shadowing at the hospital. I want to learn a lot about the human body, help people worldwide, and make sure I choose the right career."}
{"text_id": "2488814B8440", "output_essay": "In the world, everyone has different things they want to do. Students work hard to reach their goals and don't stop, even when it's hard. Why do they do this? They want to make their parents proud, or they want to get out of being poor and get rich. If you don't have a goal, or if you don't want to do anything, you will not do as well as others. When you're older, you might have to work because you don't have enough money for your bills. Every student and parent should always be busy or have goals to reach.\n\nFirst, you need to know what you want to do and write it down. Think about how long it will take and when you can start. Ask yourself these things and start now. If you fail many times, don't get mad. You learn from your mistakes. Stay focused and try again. If you're not sure you're doing it right, ask your parents for help. They often know a lot and can give you good advice. If you're lazy, you won't know what you want, and you won't move forward. Being active is good. Exercise is good for everyone. If you don't want to exercise, you might just sit and watch movies while eating snacks. This is okay for a few days, but after a year, you might gain weight and your health might get worse. Then you'll have to see a doctor who will tell you to eat fruit and exercise every morning. You know this is good for you, but if you're still lazy and do nothing all day, you need to change and do something for yourself.\n\nWe should always be busy because trying new things is good for your brain. It makes your brain work better. If you don't use skills like math or thinking for a while, your brain will get slower. If you like science, you might find out something new or make something yourself. Like Newton, who found out about gravity when an apple fell on his head. He kept thinking about it until he understood it and used it in physics. Don't worry that you can't do it or that you're not smart enough. Believe in yourself. If you don't try, you won't know what you can do.\n\nIf you're not sure what to do, read a book. Books can make you think better and give you good ideas. Generic_Name says, 'Read books every day; if you don't, you might lose your way.' Bill Gates always has a book with him in pictures. Books are like best friends and can guide you. If you want to be a surgeon, read books about surgery or look up how to learn it online. If you don't get something, ask your teacher at school. You might become a great surgeon and be lucky.\n\nWhen you reach your goals, you and your family and friends will be happy. Don't be scared of making mistakes; be scared of not trying. Life is exciting; it has many choices. If you keep going, you will be a good person. There's no place for being lazy on the way to success."}
{"text_id": "3E85CCEE0601", "output_essay": "I think it's not good for kids to join clubs after school. What if kids don't have time for the clubs they like? Will this stop them from joining the club? Can it teach them to work as a team and do things together? Will they learn to always support each other and be responsible for what they do? Plan things as a team. Can this make them smarter and better at taking part in school? Will the kids act in a way they don't at school? Will everyone think positively in this club? I hope it has a good effect on the kids. They should have fun and move around more instead of just being at home. It might make them understand their lessons better. This could make them more helpful to their teachers and friends. I feel making a club after school might not be good because there might be fights, and teachers might not want to deal with that. Maybe they can try next year."}

Trying new things is more exciting because different things happen. Choosing to do new things is better. You will do what you choose anyway. You don't have to keep doing what you're good at. Another point is that everyone tries new things. Not everyone does the same thing. That's why I think trying new things is better than sticking to what you know well."}
{"text_id": "2F439149E85C", "output_essay": "Can a person who is always busy do more, or is there a reason to do nothing sometimes? This makes me think of when I was in middle school and doing badly in math. I was too lazy to study every day. I would sleep in class and not write anything down. This was not smart. After school, I wouldn't do my homework. Weeks passed, and my grades got worse. I got an F and was shocked but not surprised. Doing nothing was not helping me. I needed to get better grades. My teacher, Generic_Name, told me to practice and study. This advice worked. Soon, my grade rose to a B, and I was very happy. Sometimes, doing nothing can lead to success, but being busy is better. For example, my cousin, Generic_Name, who is 16 and plays basketball, never went to practice and didn't exercise. But his team still won. Even though you can succeed by doing nothing, being busy helps you do more, stay excited, and find more chances in life. First, if you want a job, you can't seem lazy. A person who does nothing seems uninterested and not serious about work. Like my mom, who was a cook, came home tired because her coworkers did nothing. They ignored the boss and played on their phones. She got paid more because she worked harder. She told me to work hard at my job or I could get fired. It's not that hard to finish things; the more you do, the more you can achieve. Second, by trying, we learn more than those who quit. We have to push ourselves. Our minds may say we can't, but we can do great things. But it won't just happen. You have to work for it. Being busy is important for life. Doing nothing doesn't help us do amazing things. Some people may not try hard and still get results, but that's not meaningful. We shouldn't stop trying and expect things to happen. We can do more by working than those who don't. This way, we finish our work, don't get lazy, and get more job offers."}
{"text_id": "BDE8D9692A79", "output_essay": "I recall being thirteen and hearing my grandpa say that technology would rule the world and cost many their jobs. He was right; a talking machine took his job. Technology is making life tough for those without education, and even for those with it. I believe that less human contact because of technology is good for us. Not long ago, a robot built by humans took the jobs of twenty-four scientists. If we didn't control technology, we could lose even more. First, technology that limits contact helps everyone today. For instance, not all have good education, so not relying too much on technology isn't bad for many. This means more people can keep their jobs. People can use technology to talk or work without going into debt. Then, for safety, we should keep some technology, like self-driving cars, away from people. Take Tesla's self-driving cars. They can catch fire more easily, and escaping from them is hard. There's also a big risk of bad crashes because humans, who make errors, create these cars. Some argue that technology helps us live longer. It speeds up farming and lets us trade with other countries easily. But before technology was big news, humans lived for ages without it. They walked or rode horses to trade with other countries. So, we shouldn't rely too much on technology. We survived before it, even if it was harder. In the end, to save our planet and keep it livable, we must limit technology. Otherwise, we might make dangerous robots by mistake and risk wiping out humans."}
{"text_id": "744C96D9BE0B", "output_essay": "Active or Not Active?\n\nWe should always be doing something instead of doing nothing. If you are always busy, you are more likely to finish a task or job. Some think that it's okay to do nothing sometimes and that it can make you less stressed because you don't have to hurry. I think that if you have a goal, you need to do something to reach it.\n\nOne reason you get more done by being busy is that you will try hard to meet your goal. After you decide on your goal, you just need to plan how to reach it. Nothing is too hard to do. For example, if you want to be President of the United States, you would work hard in school, study, and be active in life. Or if you want to lose weight, you would do exercises to lose the extra pounds. Everyone has a goal or reason in life, and by doing even small things, you can finish many tasks.\n\nAnother reason why being busy helps us finish things is that it is good for our mind and body. For example, if someone is feeling down, helping them get out and think about other things means you are helping someone and being busy at the same time. Being busy can also make you look better. What I mean is, someone might not like how they look, and just by walking, they can change that. It doesn't have to be a big task, but when you finish it, it feels great to see what can be done.\n\nLastly, I know that in this country, nothing is free and you have to work hard for your goals. We all need to work hard to finish our tasks. Whether we go to school, work, or pay bills, we need to do something because no one else will do it for us. People who do nothing are less likely to succeed because they avoid their duties and let tasks pile up. I think everyone should be busy, even with small tasks.\n\nAlso, you are more likely to finish something if you are busy, even with a small task. Life is full of hard tasks, but we have to get past these problems. We can rest when we're sick or stressed, but most of the time, we should try to be busy. Life is about always doing things, not just sitting around waiting for things to happen. We all go through hard times, but that's just another problem to face. The point of life is to be busy so that one day all the hard work pays off and you reach your goals. Not everyone has the same chances; some can't walk, talk, or move. Small things like these should push us to work hard and meet our goals. I believe that if you are busy, you can finish more than one goal, and this makes you feel good about yourself."}
{"text_id": "6208D64AAA34", "output_essay": "The best way to feel good about yourself is by doing things well. Doing things well is a great way to feel better about yourself because it is about what you have done before and can make you feel good quickly. Some people think that telling students they are great can make them feel good about themselves. But I think when someone tells you that you are great, it doesn't really change anything. You are just waiting for your good feelings to come by chance. There are many ways that doing things well can make you feel good about yourself. \n\nDoing things well works better than just being told you are great. When you do something well, you can remember it and feel inspired. Students should try harder to think about doing well. Many just sit around hoping for someone to tell them they are great. That's not how it works. When you work hard, you feel proud. This pride leads to doing more good things. You learn more and know what to do next. \n\nAnother way doing things well makes you feel good is by giving you confidence and the push to learn more. Wanting to learn more can really make you feel good because you are open to trying new things. You also try to do things right. It might be tough, but you are still trying your best. That's what feeling good about yourself is all about. You also have the courage to do it. This takes bravery because many people just sit and hope for something amazing to happen. But that won't lead to anything. \n\nSome people think that real confidence comes from being told you are great. But I don't agree with that. Being told you are great won't help if you just sit and wait for something amazing. So, I say you should think about the good things you have done to help yourself. By doing things well, you can get more good things. You can also do well in life by thinking about your good deeds for a good reason. This is why doing things well has a bigger effect than just being told you are great."}

When you're active, you learn things like tricks, how to fix your errors, get better at what you do, finish tasks on time, and learn unexpected things. Even if you don't plan to learn, you do by being active. Being active helps you understand the world. You see how things work and see the world differently. This changes you. Being active means you face everything. You learn to handle life's problems and get advice from others who have been there. You also give help to those who need it. Even when you can't solve your own problems, you find ways to do it and help others with similar problems. It can be hard to always be active, but it helps many people get things done and learn.

They said to stay positive no matter what problems I faced. Some people think that students need to be sure of themselves to learn. Others think that saying good things to students, even when their work isn't good, helps them feel better about themselves. I think that feeling good about yourself really comes from doing well at something. \n\nFirst, when students get work in school, teachers want them to try their hardest. Teachers are there to help and answer questions anytime. For instance, if students don't know how to do their work, teachers will explain it and show them they can do it. In my junior year, school was tough for me. In the second semester, I had a project that was hard. When I finished and showed it, my teacher said I could have done better. This made me want to work harder and learn more so I wouldn't make the same mistake. \n\nNext, high schools get students ready for college or university. There, students have to do a lot of work by themselves. They have to study or ask professors for help. So, it's important for teachers to tell students when their work isn't complete. It helps them learn and grow. Like soccer players who train hard to be good. Coaches don't go easy on them. They practice a lot. If they mess up in a game, coaches tell them so they can do better next time. This shows them that feeling good about themselves comes from doing well. \n\nSome people say that saying nice things about a student's work makes them feel good about themselves. They think students need to be sure of themselves to learn. That makes sense, but if teachers say good things just to make students feel good, even when the work isn't good, it gives students the wrong idea. They might think they can do little work or not meet the standards and still get good grades. They won't learn from their mistakes. \n\nIn the end, students are here to learn from their mistakes. It's okay for teachers to tell them when something is wrong with their work. It helps them do better in school and later in life in their jobs. I believe that for students, there's nothing better than feeling good about themselves because of their own hard work. They should be proud of what they've done. \n\nToday, we should help others, especially students. We should show them they can do things well because of their own hard work. They will remember this and be happy with the results."}

Grades would get better because the kids get help in a way that isn't boring. It's not dull because they are doing something they like, instead of just sitting and listening to a teacher for an hour and a half. They can also meet new friends, which keeps them off their phones. Now, they have time to study instead of ignoring a subject.

For example, I lived in Generic_City for thirteen years. We had many days off during the school year but only two weeks in summer. Students didn't like it. I couldn't enjoy my time off. Homework and tests always got in the way of fun with friends and family. I had to stay home and study instead. \n\nTeachers also need the whole summer off. They work hard and get stressed from school and tests. My cousin, Generic_Name, lives in Generic_City with short breaks. He can't vacation or play basketball with friends. He only has fun when friends come over to study. He used to be active. Now he's sad and stays home. I don't want to be like that. I want to travel and have fun with friends. \n\nSome people think differently. They say students can have longer breaks in spring or during fall and winter. They say this helps students learn more and teachers prepare them for college. \n\nBut I think those short breaks don't help. Schools give students work even during those breaks. Kids feel bad when they have a short break and then have to return to school with homework. \n\nIn conclusion, we should not make summer break shorter.

Another reason I don't agree is that when people finish high school and pick what they want to study in college, they apply for jobs after they graduate. Companies and bosses in their area of interest give them job forms to fill out. Then they send in their resumes. People with a college degree often find jobs easier because of their resumes and past work. But those who didn't go to college can have a hard time finding work. This is even more true for people over forty. For example, my dad's friend is forty-five and hasn't found a job in six months. This shows why it's important to finish high school and college. We know studying is hard. But people should work hard to reach their life goals. They should study while they're young, before it's too late.

I would be outside with my friends from 9 in the morning until 9 at night. We would play soccer, baseball sometimes, or simple games like hide and seek, or tag. We were active instead of just sitting at home playing video games or using social media. Technology has hurt our eyes, and more people need glasses now.

They can share their experiences and views, which can help your group a lot. We all have different backgrounds and ideas. Sometimes, this can make us feel closer than you might expect. If the project is about culture, everyone will talk about how they are different and the same. Everyone will talk about the topic, and soon it will become easier and more fun.\n\nWorking in a group with friends has many good points. One is hearing what they have to say and understanding their point of view. Every student will always have something interesting to share, and your friends will want to listen. In a group, they will agree or disagree with you. You might get good or bad feedback. It's important to listen, talk when you need to, and be nice.\n\nIn a group, everyone has a job to do. You can ask questions and get help from friends. Working together is useful, and you can finish work quicker. One friend might write down ideas while others look up facts about the topic.\n\nYou must be responsible with your work when doing a project!\n\nAnother good point is handing in your work on time and getting good feedback.

We already spend seven hours at school; why make it eight and a half hours? I feel that we students already spend enough time in school. I don't agree with making the school day longer because some of us have things to do after school, and others want to spend more time with their families.\n\nMy first point is that some students have things to do after school. These activities begin an hour or less after school ends and finish late. Also, I think we will get more homework. If we have things to do after school, we might be too tired or not have enough time to do our homework. I know this because I go to church class every Tuesday after school. I get very stressed if I am even five minutes late. Being late to activities, falling behind on homework, or projects can stress a student out quickly. It is said that 45% of students died from stress this year because it's too much for the heart.\n\nMy final point is that we need more time with family and friends. Being in school too much can make us feel sad and pull away from our loved ones. I think some students will give up on school so they can fail and have more free time. I believe being with family and friends is a great way to have fun, relax, and be together. For some, family and friends are what make them happy and focused in life.

Still, some think self-worth is about getting praise. They say that's how people feel good about themselves. But I believe it really comes from doing things and succeeding, even if some don't agree. So, having self-worth means you are strong, sure of yourself, and brave. \n\nSelf-worth should come from doing things well, right? To get there, everyone needs to work harder and trust each other. Being strong is important; it's the key to everything. My mom is the strongest person I know. She's been through a lot. Yet, she always stays positive and tells me to be strong. She wants us to make something of ourselves. \n\nBeing sure of yourself is powerful because it stops you from failing. You try your best and show what you can do. Look at Lionel Messi, the best soccer player ever! When he plays for FC Barcelona, he never quits. He tries his hardest. He makes me want to be a great soccer player too. With my own confidence and strength, I believe I will be. Anyone can reach their goals with a positive attitude. \n\nBeing brave is also important. It's like being confident and strong. Goals can be scary, but we must go for them anyway. Everyone is scared of something. But we must push ourselves to reach our goals. I've been brave too. In June 2018, I went to a military camp. We cadets had to swim to a raft. I didn't know how to swim. I always stayed in the shallow pool. But that day, I jumped in and swam to the raft. I'm saying we should make smart choices and aim high. \n\nIn the end, self-worth really does come from doing things well. We must keep working hard to finish what we start. Like wanting an iPhone XS Max, we must earn it by doing our work. We should stay sure of ourselves and focus on what matters. Trust others and believe we can do hard things. Forget the negative thoughts and think smart. Anyone can do anything; they just have to try."}

They want to get better than before. They push themselves and keep going. They don't stop trying. Most people don't bother. They don't choose the right way and fail. They quit too soon. But those who do choose the right way do well in life. They do better than they did before because they don't quit. Many people quit because they don't try. They think it's not worth it. People want to meet their goals and not let down their friends and family who believe in them. They want to get to a higher level and get better at what they do. I think people can go even more forward and keep moving up. They will get better because they don't quit. They will learn more and could become an engineer, professor, or firefighter. Those who don't succeed at first can try again. They can pick the right way, do well, and keep trying. I believe you can go further than you are now.

Some prefer to trust their own gut.\n\nWe can do what we want. No one can tell you what to do. We choose what to do in life.\n\nI think we make our own choices because we pick what we do. Some choices are great and we're happy with them. For example, I made a good choice last year that helped me a lot. I'm happy about it. We all make choices for our future. Some are bad, some are great.\n\nWe can do what we want. Freedom is very important to us. Why do we value freedom? It lets us show our feelings and wear what we like. Some may not like how you look, but ignore them. Live your life to the fullest.\n\nHalf the people think they don't make their own choices. They believe they just copy experts or famous people. That's not true. For instance, some friends of mine want to be like the band BTS. They have BTS pictures all over and try to copy their style. They want to be them. But you shouldn't just copy others because things aren't always what they seem.\n\nShould others tell you what to do? I don't think so. You should live your life, not someone else's.

This helps make life in the future easier. Things like cell phones, computers, and video games are part of this. They can be good or bad.\n\nEven though these tools help us borrow books, buy things, and play games without talking to people, studies show they distract kids, teenagers, and grown-ups a lot.\n\nThese tools can be used for good or bad things. A cell phone helps us talk to people far away without seeing them. This is very helpful. But cell phones do more than just let us talk. They let us send texts, play games, use apps, and listen to music. This can make people use them too much and cause problems. Studies say that cell phones are the top reason teenagers crash cars because they're not paying attention.\n\nMany new tools can be harmful. Studies say that video games with fighting may lead to mental health issues, violence, and even people hurting themselves. This hasn't been proven yet, but it might be true. These games have guns, blood, and a lot of shooting.\n\nSome tools can be very dangerous. Things like guns, knives, big bombs, and other weapons can start wars and cause a lot of harm.\n\nBut these tools have also been helpful since a long time ago. For example, before we learned how to make fire, people would get very cold, eat raw food, and couldn't see in the dark. Fire changed all that. Tools still help us today and will in the future. Cars, planes, and boats let us travel and move things around quickly and easily.\n\nIn the end, these tools and machines are some of the best ideas. It all depends on how we choose to use them. We can use them to help ourselves and others. Or we can use them in bad ways that hurt people."}

My whole family is there. My dad, aunt, grandma, and grandpa all live in Puerto Rico. I grew up loving plants and we grew our own food because we weren't rich. The schools were great. I learned a lot and knew what to expect on tests. In the US, I feel like I don't know anything. I've had tough times, but I keep living life well. I tell anyone having a hard time to not give up, because I didn't. I want to go back to Puerto Rico to buy my mom a house. I love her a lot. I also want to remember someone special who passed away. She died giving birth. Only one puppy lived. It's healthy and has a mix of black, white, and blue fur. It's strange, right? I know. I want my future family to speak Spanish and have the same traditions I did. There's a tradition with a rocking 'Amaca' that all kids go through. I want to do hair and nails like my mom. I love soccer. It helps me relax. I dream of being a singer. When I was young, I sang a lot. My cousin encouraged me, but my mom said I couldn't sing. That made me want to sing more. At night in Puerto Rico, you can hear the 'coquí puertorriqueño'. It's a famous animal that sings. But there are also big spiders. I'm not scared of them, though. When I get to Puerto Rico, I want to hug my dad. He's special to me. He taught me how to write. I used to talk a lot, but now I struggle to speak. People laugh at me, but I'm used to being sad. I want to see the beach again. It reminds me of good times with my dad. My mom thinks he's bad, but I don't. I see him differently. I'm positive. My dad raised me well. I want to help feed dogs. Some are so thin and need care. People don't see the sad parts of Puerto Rico. They only think of the beautiful beaches. I'll tell you some stories. There's a legend about 'El CHUPACABRAS', a famous monkey. It's not proven to be real. There are aggressive monkeys in Puerto Rico. My aunt has many in her woods. There's a dry river there too. There's a place called 'El Yunque'. It's beautiful with rivers and animals. 'El Faro' is also nice. I have memories there with my dad. Puerto Rico has many turtles and crabs. I've never eaten crab, which is crazy. I really want to see my dad. Living in Puerto Rico is my biggest dream. I want my kids to grow up there. I might move back this summer to be with my dad. I want to build my own house, relax on the beach, and visit 'El Yunque'. I want to listen to the animals at night. I want to see my mom happy. I can be myself.

{"text_id": "11952FBA5AE5", "output_essay": "Many people think that high school students in some places must choose their future job as soon as they start high school. But others disagree. They believe students should not feel forced to make such a big choice so soon. They should have plenty of time to decide what they want to do with their lives. The classes in high school can push them toward a certain job. Is it right for someone so young to make such a big choice about their future? \n\nI think students should not rush to pick a career, especially when they are young. If they hurry or can't decide because they feel pressured, it could hurt them later. What will they do when they have to live on their own? Parents or guardians won't always be there to help, and small jobs that don't pay much won't be enough. \n\nStudents should not be pushed to make a quick decision about their future job. They need time to rest and slowly find out what they like to do. Classes should be regular and not force them into a career. You can't make someone do something they don't want to do. When a student decides on their own, it shows they are mature. Being mature means they are sure about their choice. \n\nIn conclusion, students should use their high school years to explore and learn. They should choose a career when they are sure and feel ready. This is because a person knows best what they want to do for the rest of their life."}

Not moving doesn't make life easier. In fact, to make life easy, we should do as much as we can today and not wait until tomorrow. To live our lives, reach our goals, and get what we want, we must work for it.\n\nOur bodies need to move because we need to use the energy we get from food. If we sit all day, eat, and do nothing, our bodies will work, but only use the energy they need. If we have too much energy, it can cause problems like being overweight. Being overweight is a big problem. It can lead to other health issues like diabetes, heart attacks, and problems with our blood and digestion. People who don't move much often have fewer friends and can get mental health problems like depression. They are not inactive because they are depressed; they are depressed because they are inactive.\n\nLoqman Hakim, an Afghan scientist, said, \"Don't be inactive; there are always things to do, and if there was nothing to do, shake your head and sing to yourself.\"\n\nNot moving doesn't make life easier. You should do as much as you can and not delay today's work until tomorrow. A common saying is, \"If you want to change the world, do it today; there might be no tomorrow.\" The more you do, the better your work will be. But if you think that by doing nothing, everything will be fine, you're wrong. Not moving is a big problem by itself.\n\nEveryone has goals, things they want, and places they want to go. These are what give life meaning and make people want to live. No one can reach them by just sitting and thinking all day. To get what you want, you must get up and do what's needed. Work for your life. The more you work, the closer you get to what you want. The more you move, the more confident you feel. Never give up. It's your life, so don't waste it by not moving.\n\nStill, some people think not moving is good and useful as a rest after working a lot. But they are wrong. A rest is not about not moving. It's about doing what you enjoy and having fun after work or school. Not moving is never fun, a rest, or a vacation. If you need a break or are tired, don't pick not moving as a rest. It won't help you relax or feel less tired; it will make you more tired. Instead, you could read a book, travel, or go on a trip with family and friends."}

Football teaches you about teamwork, moving your whole body well, and it's enjoyable to play. First, people often say, 'There is no 'I' in team.' Football is a good way to learn to work with others. For instance, the quarterback won't do well if his team doesn't block the right people. Also, the wide receivers need the quarterback to throw the ball to them. Football teaches you to work with others in real life too. Second, football helps you control your body and react fast. You'll get better at responding to things quickly. Before playing football, if someone says, 'Think fast!' you might try to catch something but drop it. After playing football, you might catch it and feel good about yourself. This is why the sport is fun and good for you. Lastly, watching and playing football is exciting. If you like an NFL team, you know the thrill when there's a big play. Playing is also thrilling. Imagine you're a kicker, and you score the winning points as time runs out. The happiness of winning and celebrating with your team is great. Watching the replay and seeing how people react to your success is fun too. Even though you might get hurt, playing football is still fun. In the end, football is a fun sport.

But working with others helps students feel more sure of themselves. It also gets more done than working alone. Plus, students make fewer mistakes when they work together.\n\nFirst, working with others gets more done than working alone. Every time my friends and I work together, we finish first. This shows that in a group, you can do different parts of the work at the same time. But if you work alone, you can only do one thing at a time. This makes it take longer.\n\nNext, working alone doesn't help students become more confident. When I started high school, I was too shy to work with others. But being confident is important. It makes life easier and helps you work with others without problems.\n\nLast, it's easier to find mistakes when you work in a group. For example, I always make mistakes when I work alone. But groups don't make as many mistakes. This is because when you work alone, you might not notice your mistakes. You think everything is right. In a group, someone will tell you if something is wrong.\n\nIn the end, I think working in groups is better. It helps students more in the long run than working alone.

I think that if we try hard and work towards our goals, we can make it. People don't know their limits. We can't know what we can do if we don't try. For instance, my friend Generic_Name was good at basketball. But she always found a reason not to play in the state game when our coach asked. One day, the coach told her he was afraid to play in the state game too. He said we can't know our limits unless we test them. Also, Generic_Name's sister is a talented artist. She never sold her art because she thought no one would want it. Then she put some art online to sell. She sold her art and even got a job from it. As children, we were taught to never give up. At school, kids are told to chase their dreams and keep going. I like to draw. In my art class at school, I felt bad about my drawings compared to others. I wanted to quit art class. But my art teacher told me not to compare myself to others. She said to think about my progress and what I still want to do. In gym class, I couldn't run for more than five minutes. My teacher challenged me to run for ten minutes. It seemed too hard. But after walking one mile every day, I managed to do it. My teacher said there's no limit to what we can do if we try hard.

I think that being a good role model is very important. But there are also many other ways to affect others. You can explain why they should do something, inspire them, and give them a small prize.\n\nFirst, being a good role model is the main way to affect others. But sometimes people don't get why they should help or join in. For example, some people set up a fundraiser and need others to help or join to reach a goal. But do people understand what we are doing or why? Being a good role model isn't always enough. We should also tell them why we do things. Then they might understand and do the same. Like when people throw trash in the bin at a park to keep it clean and nice. Giving a good reason can make them understand and get others to do the same.\n\nSecond, sometimes people know why an action is good and what it can lead to, but they don't want to join in or they feel lazy. So, inspiring them is another good way to affect people. For example, some people start doing a good job but then want to stop. They don't want to keep going. Here, inspiration is very important to help them keep going. We should also push them to meet their goals. They can use this experience to tell others and spread the good. This can get more people to join in. Also, when they work hard to get others to do the right thing, they should get a thank you. This could be a certificate or a small gift for their time.\n\nIn the end, being a good role model is a big way to get others to do the same, and people often argue about it. But affecting others isn't just about being a good role model. It's also about giving reasons, inspiring, and giving small prizes. These can be good ways too."}

They don't need to work more.\n\nIf school lasts longer, after-school clubs will also finish later. For example, if the late bus usually comes at 4:15, it will now come at 5:45. Students will get home too late to relax. They will lose an hour and a half that could have been spent at home.\n\nLastly, students need time after school for homework and family. With longer school days, they will have to start homework right away when they get home. They won't have time to relax or be with their families.\n\nIn summary, making the school day longer is not necessary. It will make after-school activities end too late and leave less time for homework and family. I hope you agree that there is no good reason to make the school day longer."}

For instance, if I learn about life's tough parts early and start working towards a job, I can learn a lot before high school. Then, high school problems won't be so hard. This is because I picked a job when I was little that got me ready for these problems. I believe it's great for young kids to have the chance to think about jobs.

{"text_id": "AAFE35314AEA", "output_essay": "Some students think that to feel better about themselves, getting praise is the best way to get great work from them, but I don't agree. Praise isn't the only way to get great work or the best choice.\n\nFirst, students should learn to be more sure of themselves on their own. Praise isn't the only thing that will make them great; they should think about how to do their work by themselves, not just wait for praise to feel good.\n\nSecond, they need to think about how they will do their best work and be the best student without getting praise.\n\nSome students think praise is the only way to please God and do good things, but that's not right. The truth is that being taught discipline as a kid shapes who you are and what you want to do.\n\nI want to give another example. When you pray, you shouldn't just give praise because you have a big school project. You should give praise when your family supports you. That's when you should thank your family, and that can help you in the future, not just with a project. If you want to do really good work, you must work hard all night or all day to make it better and the best in the class.\n\nThe most important thing is not how you decide things or how sure you are; it's how you train yourself. Praise doesn't come from what you do; it comes from inside us and our choices.\n\nI think the most important thing in life isn't about giving praise for work or anything like that. I think if you're going to pray, it's when you want to talk to God and ask for help in tough times.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe discipline guides you in a way that will help you in life and the future. With discipline, you learn to be more sure of yourself, have more self-respect, and do the best work. It's not just because some students think praise will make them feel better; you make your own path. You shouldn't be what someone else wants you to be. I think you must make yourself important to you. You can make yourself sure, respected, and strong with discipline and by always trying to do your best.\n\nI think true self-respect comes from working hard on yourself; it doesn't come from what you think. The most important thing is how you think you can be your best self. Some students say self-respect only comes from success; I think this is partly true. I believe it comes from inside, from what we want to be in life. It's also true we need to work on ourselves, but not in a bad way. So that's what I think and believe about praise."}
{"text_id": "51109FD6CDA7", "output_essay": "As students, writing is a key skill you need while learning. When writing, you must make sure your essay has enough paragraphs, the right punctuation, and strong words to impact readers. Your essay should have an introduction that grabs the reader's attention, several reasons with details and examples to convince your reader, a section that looks at other views and errors, and a strong ending that ties your ideas together. You should also pay attention to how you put together sentences, the tone, and the words you choose. There are many things to know to write a powerful essay, and some think that showing a good example through your actions is the best way to do it. I think that even with a first try, whether your example is good will decide if readers pay attention to your writing. Your teacher often tells you to provide examples for your reasons when you write. Have you thought about why? There is a reason. First, examples help people believe you; you need to give readers facts they can trust. Your examples make people understand your writing better and picture it in their minds. They provide a strong foundation for your reasons and make your essay easy to read. Also, when you share every detail about your thoughts, feelings, and actions, readers can feel it too, and your essay seems more real. When it feels real, they are more likely to trust your story, get your point, and learn from it. The second reason to use good examples from your actions is that it grabs the reader's interest. Examples make your essay more exciting, and people enjoy reading your story. They want to know what happens next and how you deal with problems. You can use an engaging tone to tell your story, making it more alive. After reading your examples, people might think well of you and trust you more. That's when you really impact your reader. But some disagree; they think other ways, like a strong introduction or conclusion, are better to influence others. Albert Schweitzer, a thinker and helper, said: 'Example is not the main thing in influencing others; it is the only thing.' With good examples, you can convince others to believe in you. It's the best tool you have to get past the reader's doubts. To have a good essay, you need to do every part well, so an example is not the only part of the essay, but it is the best way to persuade people. If you want them to read, write an engaging introduction; if you want them to stay, give them solid reasons; but if you want them to believe, give them true examples. As you live, you will go through many things, meet different people, and think different thoughts. Each experience can be a strong example to persuade others. Using good examples can also help your writing get a better grade. So when you write, you should show a good example through what you do to better influence people. Good examples will make readers believe and be interested in your writing, get students better grades, and impact the essay."}

Making these choices early helps you plan for where you want to end up and how to reach your goals. I believe it's not a good idea for young students to decide on a job path too soon. You might choose wrong because you don't have the right skills yet. You might just like the idea of a certain job, not the job itself. Picking a job when you're young can be fun, but it can also be hard and make you upset. Imagine a teenage girl in high school wants to be a doctor or an engineer. These jobs take a lot of work to get into. She might stop trying because she thinks she's not good enough. This way of thinking can hurt her later. She might have what it takes but not remember what jobs she wanted. She had many options, and they are tough to work through. In short, she didn't choose well. We often pick jobs based on how we feel, not on what's real or what will happen. It's sad to dream about a job and not be ready to work for it. School can make us think there's only one job for us because we do well in certain classes. But this might not be true. After high school, you might want to change your mind, but it's too late. You start to regret your choices. That's why we have problems in life. Our future isn't planned right because of our choices. It's hard to pick a job when we're teenagers. We're still young and don't know what will happen. We need help from teachers and counselors. They can guide us, shape our future, and support our choices. We always have options, but what matters is picking a job and sticking with it, not just what we think. Your future depends on it. Dreaming about doing something is like starting a trip, but actually doing it is like reaching the end. Teenagers often can't think about something and then do it. That's why it's a bad idea to choose a job too early."}

{"text_id": "7D39F3EBFA9C", "output_essay": "People all over the world are learning new things and becoming better because of it. Trying new things helps people grow. Even if it looks too hard, people should still try. Learning can be tough for some, but they need to learn to improve. Two ways to grow are by learning a new sport or a new school subject.\n\nSome people play sports for fun or to become pros. But they often stick to one sport. They should try different sports to learn about them. For example, a person good at soccer might try basketball if they start liking it. People might not want to try a new sport because they think they won't be good or it won't be fun. But they should try it anyway. They might find it more fun than they thought and learn about the sport's beauty.\n\nPeople might be good at one school subject but bad at another. This is because they spent a lot of time on one subject and not enough on others. This can be a problem in school where you have to learn many subjects like math, English, and science. If someone is good at math but bad at English, they might fail tests. Being good at one thing doesn't mean you'll be good at everything. It can cause trouble if you need that skill later. Students should learn about all subjects and get help to be ready for school.\n\nSome people think they can get by with what they know and don't need to learn more. Like someone who is good at cooking and other basic life skills. They don't want to learn new things. But sometimes they might get interested in something new and not know much about it. This can be a problem because they don't understand it well. Learning new things gives people more knowledge, which can be helpful. So, people should keep learning new things even after they are good at something. It could help them later.\n\nIn the end, learning new things helps people grow and reach new levels. Not everyone wants to learn, and it might seem too hard, but they should try their best. They might need it in the future. It's not always easy or fast to learn something new, but it's worth it. They will know something that many others don't."}

We can do even more if we are always active. But is there a reason to do nothing sometimes? We can think about this and answer all our questions. We can see what is good and bad about these ideas. \n\nChoosing not to be lazy is a good first step because we shape our own thoughts.

This could change how people see us. \n\nIt's amazing what we can achieve if we keep busy. This means if we are on the right track in life, doing good things like helping those who can't become educated or professionals. We can give them advice or help with what they need.

{"text_id": "6A5AA50BB348", "output_essay": "Thomas Jefferson once said, 'Determine never to be idle... It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing.' Jefferson wanted people to be more active in life. This could be in a physical or mental way. Being active means taking part in activities or helping a good cause. It's easy to be active in the community. You can pick up trash from the street or join marches and protests for human rights. When you join in activities, you show who you are in the community. Your voice or help shows you want to make the community better. It's good to be active to get the most from life.\n\nFirst, being active has many benefits. It helps people reach their goals, improve society, enjoy life, feel good, and use time well. People have big dreams and want to do great things. To achieve these dreams, people must work hard. Small actions like recycling and helping in the community can make a big difference. Being active lets people enjoy life more and have new experiences. People will have fewer regrets if they live life fully by staying active. Being active stops people from feeling bored and makes them feel useful. It also helps people use their time well and not waste it.\n\nSecond, even though being active is often seen as the best way to behave at work, it's also possible to be idle, or choose not to work. This might not be good because less work gets done and it can lead to bad habits like putting things off. Working lets you finish tasks, which is important when you have many things to do at once. But putting things off can become a bad habit. If you keep delaying work, you might think you always have more time than you do. Being idle for too long can hurt your work habits and your life.\n\nSome people think being very active can cause health problems and that being idle is better for you and those around you. They say being active can lead to mental health issues. They also say the good things about being idle are better than the good things about being active for some people. But without activity, the mind doesn't get enough exercise. Being idle can be good because it lets your mind and body rest. But it's not always good. Being active can have problems too, like memory loss and stress from too much activity. But these problems usually happen when people work too much without breaks. This can affect people who already have stress problems like not being able to sleep. Too much stress from being active can also affect soldiers with PTSD who work in stressful jobs like law enforcement or office jobs with tight deadlines.\n\nIn conclusion, being idle can be okay if it's just a break. But staying idle makes you less productive. Working all the time isn't always healthy or fun, but it's better than doing nothing. By working, we get more done and help society move forward. Whether it's for food or fame, working is needed for most people. Being idle might feel nicer, but hard work and determination are what you need to succeed and earn respect. So, between being active or idle, being active is the better choice."}
{"text_id": "812334AB4E73", "output_essay": "I think having a homework club at my school is a good idea. It would help both teachers and students. Teachers can help students understand what work they need to do and how to get better grades. Students can ask teachers about what they missed when they were not at school. They can learn what they need to do in the homework club so their grades don't go down. Teachers can show them how to answer questions. I remember when I was in sixth grade. I missed a lot of school and had many things to do to keep up. I asked my history teacher to help me after school. My teacher said yes and helped me with some questions. I didn't finish all my work, but I did half and learned how to do it. Some students might want to finish work early to have more free time at home. I am busy at home and have little time for school work. For group work, students can meet after school. I don't talk to anyone from my old schools and I like to finish my work early.

We will look at if this is good or bad. If students don't pick a job when they are young, they will focus more on school. But, choosing a job early is good because it makes future work easier, lets students do what they like, and makes them smart.\n\nFirst, choosing a job early is good because future work will be easier. Everyone will pick what they want to do and practice for their job. For example, my friend wants to be a doctor. She always studies for that. She watches doctor videos on YouTube. I think her job will be easier when she is a doctor. So, thinking about jobs early is useful.\n\nNext, choosing a job early is good because it lets students do what they like. I think young people want to know what they will do later and have many dreams. For example, I want to be a teacher or a manager. I have time until I finish school to choose what is best for me. Thinking a lot will help a person pick the best job.\n\nThird, choosing a job early is good because it makes students smart. I think when a student thinks about his job, he takes on a big task, and that is good for his brain. It makes them smart and responsible. I think they will be just like older people. So, this makes students smart. Students should think and study hard for their future. Schools should have classes to help plan for jobs.\n\nIn conclusion, choosing a job early is good because it makes future work easier, lets students do what they like, and makes them smart. It is important for students to think about their future and get ready for it. They can take time to think and pick what they like to do later. They must take this seriously to become responsible."}

{"text_id": "51684135262A", "output_essay": "The writer Ralph Waldo Emerson said, \"Unless you try to do something more than what you know, you will never grow.\" I think Ralph Waldo Emerson said this because he had hard times when he was young. He wanted to be creative and change other people's thoughts. I believe this quote means that you won't grow if you don't try to learn more than what you can do now. But I don't agree with this quote because you need to keep practicing to get better at anything in life.\n\nFor example, think about playing basketball. You would search 'how to shoot a basketball for beginners.' Then, you would go to the gym every day until you make those shots. Another example is getting ready for a history test. A student would make flashcards with history questions and study them before the test. Learning to drive is another thing you need to get better at. It's fun but also scary. You need to learn the signs, how to turn, park, and use turn signals.\n\nTo get better at something, you must keep trying. You should not stop trying to improve. I have quit some things before, but then I watched videos that encouraged me to keep going. They said problems are just 'a bump in the road' that you need to get past.\n\nI almost gave up on my grades too. I was doing badly in math and science. But I took a deep breath and talked to a teacher the next day. They helped me make a plan to finish my work and study for a test. I passed that test. I was surprised, but I knew hard work would pay off.\n\nI also wanted to join the high school varsity basketball team. I was nervous about what others would think of me. I was very anxious. I wanted to show my skills to the coach, so I asked him for help. He trained me after school so I could feel more at ease playing basketball.\n\nIn the end, I think the quote means to focus on one thing to grow, and I don't agree. Chase your dreams and don't stop, even when you feel like quitting. Keep practicing and working hard. It doesn't matter what others think. In the end, you can achieve many things."}
{"text_id": "ABB6A19842F1", "output_essay": "People who like to depend on themselves think it means to trust their own feelings and thoughts. They are partly correct. It is good to depend on yourself. But should we always make our own choices, or should we ask for advice from experts on big life issues? Most people think you should trust your feelings because it is your life. But wise people would do this and also ask for expert advice to improve. Getting advice is not bad. It actually helps you. With expert advice, you can learn many things. For example, you will choose better as you get older, you will know how to do things well, and you will act more grown-up and careful. \n\nWhen you ask for advice, you will choose better as you get older. It can help you get a better job by teaching you new things. Knowing more can help you understand jobs better. Imagine you are a cashier and a customer yells at you for not having their favorite cereal. You feel like yelling back, but if you knew how to handle yelling customers, you would stay calm and be nice. Many people have been fired for not dealing with customers well because they followed their first reaction. When you handle things well and are nice, you might get a promotion or a raise. \n\nGetting advice on big life issues teaches you how to do things well. For instance, you might fight with your partner and want to win because that's what you learned. But that can make things worse. If you had expert advice, you would let the fight go because that's smarter. You and your partner should talk it out to solve the problem. Many relationships are violent because of fights. If people knew the right way to handle them, there would be fewer violent relationships. \n\nAsking experts for advice helps you be more careful and grown-up. Say you buy a house with your partner. You want to go out every Friday and spend a lot. But bills are coming. You still spend because it's fun. Then the bills arrive, and you can't pay them. This leads to fights. You borrow money but can't return it. This looks bad. Soon, you might lose your house and have bad credit. But with expert advice, you wouldn't have these problems. You would pay bills on time and not overspend. You wouldn't mind if friends tease you for not going out because you're acting grown-up. \n\nIn conclusion, life is better when we ask experts for advice on big issues. You act more grown-up, make better choices, and do things the right way. People who like to depend on themselves think it means to trust their own feelings and thoughts. They are partly correct. It is good to depend on yourself. But we should also ask for expert advice on big life issues."}

National parks have fun things for families and sometimes special things to do on holidays that you and your family can join in on.\n\nI think parks in our community, state, and country can have lots of fun things to do. A national park might let your kids or your whole family do things, including things on holidays. State parks might have things for families and could have events like a fishing contest or a boat-making contest to see if the boats can float. Community parks may have summer things to do, like a 'mud run,' where there are lots of things to try, including a race through mud.\n\nI believe parks are valuable because they have different things to do, but it depends on the park. A community park might have things to do, or it might just be a place to have a cookout, where you can take your kids to play, walk with your friends, or play sports like soccer or football. Community parks often have fun summer things for people looking for something to do.\n\nAnother reason is that parks offer different experiences. A community park is a place for fun and family time. A state park might have fun things for families and kids, and it could be a fun place to go. State parks might also have holiday things to do or just be a place for families to get together and find fun things to do. State parks often have cool things to do in the summer that friends, families, or kids can enjoy.\n\nMy last reason is that each park offers something special. A community park is for fun and family time. A state park may have things for kids and families, while a national park has many things for families to try. National parks might also have holiday things for kids and families. In the summer, national parks have lots of things that friends and families can enjoy, and they are big enough for everyone doing the things.\n\nIn conclusion, parks in our community, state, and country each have their own special things. While some may not have as many fun things, they all are places where people can go to have fun with their families. National parks, especially, are known for their many fun and interesting things that can be enjoyed with friends and family, including on holidays."}

Students won't like it, they might feel more stressed, and the day will feel too long.\n\nFirst, students won't like having more work. They will be less active and healthy. They might fight more, which can make the school's grades go down. Then, fewer parents will want to send their kids to these schools. They might also give the schools bad reviews.\n\nNext, students might feel more stressed. Stressed kids often make bad choices. This can lead to more trouble at school and more punishments.

If I don't listen, I won't learn and I won't finish school. We must get ready for the future because we have chances that we should take.

When you show what's right and what's wrong, it helps them think better. For instance, if you tell someone, 'Don't do this, it will hurt you later,' it means a lot. I know this because I used to smoke every day. I wish I had listened when people said, 'Stop smoking! It's bad for you.' Now I have cancer in my lungs. I should have listened to my dad. He always said, 'Son, I don't want you to be like me. Please listen to me.' This is a strong way to let others change your mind. But I don't think it always works well. Sometimes, you can be pushed by the good things that happen to others. Like if someone says, 'When I was 19, I didn't know what to do after high school. I wasn't into any job. Then I chose to be a doctor even though I didn't like it. But I tried it. Now I'm a doctor, I love my job, and you should pick a career too. I'm sure you'll like it once you get used to it.'

I want to share my thoughts and say why I don't agree with Emerson's idea. Many people love hobbies like sports and music. They might do these for life and maybe work in these areas. You can practice or take lessons. If you don't want to pay for lessons, you can teach yourself and go at your own speed. In sports like basketball, soccer, and football, people play for fun. If there's a place to play, they will likely spend a few hours there. Most student athletes practice a lot in school, so they don't get extra coaching. People who like music and want to be in a band can take music classes in school. But guitar classes are not common in schools. They teach simple things, not hard stuff. This is because the guitar is easy to start learning by yourself. To work in a music studio, you don't need a college degree. But if you want to get better and write songs, you might go to music school. Pianists who want to play big concerts have a hard road. They might need to go to music school and get a degree to play with a big orchestra. For sports fans who watch the NBA, NFL, or FIFA World Cup, becoming a pro is a big deal. Sports are popular on TV, and many start playing young. They often try out for school teams later. There are tryouts in different seasons, and the time depends on the weather and weekend games. Athletes have to wait for one season to end before the next one starts. High schools have summer tryouts for football because the season starts before school. Sports also help students get into college and win scholarships. They might even become famous if they are the best. This is how people get better at what they know, by loving it and working hard. They spend a lot of time on it and want to do it in the future. They will grow with it. Everyone has their own dreams. These are the ways people can improve their skills."}
{"text_id": "5F99A89B93BE", "output_essay": "Many schools work with companies to let students see and learn about different jobs. These chances are great for students who want to know what job they might do. They help students understand the work they want to do. I have read about this, and I think it's a great idea for students who don't know what job they want or can't decide on a job to follow. I also think this helps students decide if they want to be professionals in that job or career. These chances give students experience and knowledge about jobs they might choose or just to learn about what the company does. Today, many students pick a career or job without really knowing much about it. Then, when they start working or studying, they are not happy with their choice. So, it's very important to ask ourselves: How can I be a professional in this job? What do I need to do to get this job? Is this job right for me? Asking these questions is key when picking a job or career. It's also key to know why we want a certain job or why we like it. We can look online or read books to learn more about the job we want (good and bad points). I want to work with this company because it can give me experience and teach me about different jobs. I also want to visit and learn about the job I want to do. I want to be a professional with the job I love. Having a job at a company is so important. That's why we need to study hard and get better every day at any job we do. Sincerely, Generic_Name"}

It can be both entertaining and a chance to learn. Plays can be serious, silly, or full of drama. But they are always fun to be in or to watch. People enjoy them for many reasons. Shakespeare got famous from his plays. If he could get famous and dedicate his life to it, it must be enjoyable. A play is a chance to have fun and learn at the same time. Plays have bright costumes, big scenes, and most importantly, they tell a story. The story turns it into a play. When you act in a play, you become someone else. Plays are fun because of everything you can do in them. A play is like a short movie or TV show, which makes it exciting. People think acting in a play is fun because it's like being in a movie or TV show. That's why acting in plays is enjoyable. Overall, being part of a play is a great time. From the clothes, acting, scenes, to the story, and feeling like you're in a movie or TV show, that's what makes it fun. It's no surprise plays have been popular for so long.

I have, and it's really nice because when you play, you focus on it and forget about being tired or stressed. This is one way to have a good day. There are many ways to enjoy being outside, like playing a sport. You get exercise and have fun with your family or friends. Playing a sport is a good choice because you move more. There are many sports like soccer, basketball, volleyball, and football. Choose the one you like best. You can play at the beach, in a park, or other places. It's better to go outside and move than to sit still. We all need to move to stay healthy. Exercise is a big problem today because we can do everything at home, like play games, chat with friends, or use social media. With technology, people don't mind staying inside. But if we keep doing this, more people will die from high blood pressure. Also, many people find it hard to move and don't feel good about themselves. So, you should start exercising now before it's too late. I think soccer is the best sport. You don't need to be tall or jump high. You just kick the ball to score. Playing a sport is good for your health. Take some time to play a sport you like. It makes life better. Go outside to relax. We all get stressed every day. Instead of keeping it, why not get rid of it? It's also fun to play with your family or friends. Think about how often you have fun with them. Some people have a lot of fun, others don't. For example, many people travel to other countries for school or work. They can't spend time with family because they're busy. My sister used to only care about studying. She had many books and once fainted from studying too much. She was always stressed with work from her teachers. She looked very tired. She forgot things and sometimes didn't eat. She was preparing for college exams. I wouldn't want to study for so many subjects and tests in one day. Before her exams, I asked my parents to go somewhere fun. They agreed. The next morning, I got ready and packed for my sister too. I woke her up to go with us. She thought we were just getting breakfast. But we all got in the car and she fell asleep. When we arrived at the beach, it was beautiful. I ran around and she woke up, surprised. She asked where we were. I told her we could eat breakfast at the beach. We had a lot of fun playing. Once, I kicked the ball and it hit her head. It was funny. Spending time with family is a good choice. It's something many people want to do. Family is important, so it's great to be together. Leave everything and spend time with your family. You will feel relaxed, like my sister did. You won't know how fun it is until you try. Activities can help you relax after studying. You can make new friends too. There are many good things about it. Don't just study in a room. Go outside and play for fun. Invite your friends and family to play a sport together. It will be great. At the park, you can do fun things or just talk with others. So, let's go play your favorite sport and forget your worries. Let's have a healthy and fun day together."}

We do more when we keep busy because it helps us stay on track, finish tasks, and make sure we're not idle.\n\nFirst, it helps us stay on track. For example, if you didn't work or go to school, you'd be on your couch doing nothing and not using your muscles. You'd eat too much bad food and get very heavy from not moving. Experts say that if you don't move for at least seven hours, your muscles will get weak and your body won't fight off sickness well. So, move around and don't be lazy.\n\nSecond, it helps you finish tasks. Think about doing housework, like tidying your room, washing clothes, cleaning dishes, or throwing away trash. If you did nothing, your place would be dirty and messy. But if you start doing these jobs, your home will look nice and clean. This shows young people how to finish their work on time.\n\nFinally, it keeps you busy. For example, you don't want to be bored with nothing to do; you want to have fun doing things. Like playing sports, being in clubs after school, reading books about the world's history, working out to stay healthy, and having a job to make your own money. This fills up the free time of young people and adults and lets them do things they like. You could do something that might make you well-known or liked by others.\n\nWe get more done because we do more, and we become more active by doing more. Some people think that doing nothing still means you do something. But they are wrong. It should be important for people to do more in their spare time. This way, they get stronger and learn more about what they can do."}

But you can also make them think or feel different by sharing your ideas or feelings. There are many ways to look like a good person. But what you do is what people see first. If you want to make others look up to you, your style might get noticed. But often, people don't look at what you do. Some students work hard on things they like. But they might not work hard when a teacher tells them to. They might not care what other students think. But students who enjoy their work and try hard can do well. I believe students should be sure of themselves. Teachers give them chances. This shows if a student is not trying hard enough. Doing well at something makes you feel good about yourself. When you reach a goal, you trust yourself. You can make choices and use your own experiences to help others. Some students think success comes from praise.

Even if you don't know whether trying new things will be good for you or help you improve, you can always get better at what you do. I don't agree with Emerson's idea because you can be great at something, but you'll still learn new things and keep improving. You'll always find ways to improve, even if you do the same thing. Growing is a part of life, and you don't have to try new things if you can learn more every day about what you love and keep getting better.\n\nMy first point is that you can be great at something, but you'll still learn new things. I've found that no matter how skilled you are, there's always more to learn. Everything that's happened to me has taught me something. For instance, I work at a fast-food place. I know my job well. But I'm still learning and getting better. You don't have to try new things to improve.\n\nMy second point is that you'll always find ways to improve, doing the same thing. Growing is a part of life. You don't have to try new things if you can learn more every day about what you love. Growth is very important. It's something you'll do forever, no matter your job. For example, teachers learn new things to teach. They don't have to try new jobs because they love teaching and they're still improving.\n\nLastly, you can't be sure if new things will be best for you or help you improve. But you can always get better at what you do. I think it's sometimes good to try new things. They might teach you to be a better person. For example, I tried to do better in school. I didn't care much before, but now I value education more and have improved a lot. Trying new things can be good at times.\n\nIn conclusion, I disagree with Emerson because learning and getting better every day is key. There's more to life than just trying new things. Enjoying what you love and getting better at it is more important. Growing is a part of life, and you don't have to try new things if you can keep learning about what you love every day."}

It was once owned by the king of Spain. His chair is still there. You can take photos of it and even sit on it. I also want to go to the top of the castle to see Mallorca.

I believe it's smart to think about many jobs in high school. It gets you ready for life after you finish school. But, some students might ignore their school work.

Many have made mistakes before. Someone with knowledge can really help you. For instance, if a student wants to pick a college but might pick a bad one, a parent can guide them to a better choice. Parents can also help with the sports you play. They can assist with college forms and tell you if a college is good or not.\n\nYou should always talk to others because they know a lot about colleges, sports, or jobs. They have been through it before you. So, they know more and have more experience. Someone with knowledge can suggest what to do before you make a mistake.

We could give them food, clothes, and more. We should always try to help people who need it. First, we get more done when we do things that matter to us and to others.

At school, we might think we don't need to do our homework. But then we don't learn as much as other students. It's important to do our work on time. If we don't, we waste time, and we can't get that time back. At work, we should be helpful. If we finish our tasks, we can help a coworker or clean up. This might make our boss think we are good workers and maybe pay us more. At home, if our mom is working, we can clean or make food. This helps her. She can come home happy and have more time to rest.\n\nSecond, staying busy can help us in our lives. Exercise keeps us fit and healthy. It lets us do things faster without getting tired quickly.\n\nThird, we should try to be different by doing new things and staying positive and busy. Being different is great. We can have new experiences. For example, we can help an old person cross the street, clean parks so kids have a clean place to play, or help homeless people with money, food, or other things. We can change our world by doing good things for people who need help. If we always do good things, our world would be different. Right now, people don't see what others need. They only see what they want. Many people waste time on bad things like drinking or gambling. Resting is good, but too much downtime can be bad.

Being good at what you've learned feels great, not just for you but for your family and friends too. Remember, you want to do better for everyone's benefit.\n\nGoing after your dreams and goals is key. I think you should always follow your dreams. It might be hard, but finishing the job will be rewarding. Don't just listen to what others say because, in the end, it's all about you. Having a goal can push you to do even greater things. Taking on bigger challenges will improve your skills.\n\nAlso, your attitude can show how much you're ready to achieve. It's well known that a positive attitude can take you far. When working on something, stay positive and avoid negative thoughts. You can't let failure stop you from growing. If you want to grow and stay positive, you'll do more. How you deal with problems shows your attitude.\n\nAnother point is to always try things you haven't done before. Trying new things is safe. It helps you find out what works for you and what doesn't. You might get to be great at something even bigger than what you've done before. I think everyone should be open to new experiences instead of staying the same.\n\nTo sum up, these are my reasons why you should aim to be better than you are now.

I want to enjoy the warm weather, see famous spots, and visit a big historical place there.\n\nThe first reason I want to go to Hawaii is for the warm weather. Hawaii is near the equator, so it's warm all year. Some might not like the heat, but I do. You can dress in comfy clothes and not be cold. You can also do fun things outside. For example, in Virginia's winter, I had to wear heavy clothes because it was cold. But in Hawaii, it's almost never cold. This means I can wear what I like and do things I enjoy.\n\nThe second reason I want to go to Hawaii is to see its famous spots. There's a volcano in Hawaii that has been active for years. I've always wanted to see it because it's been spewing lava and gas for over ten years! There's also a huge tree in Hawaii that I want to see. It's famous for being very big and having pretty leaves. It's so large that it makes people look tiny.\n\nThe third reason I want to go to Hawaii is to see a big historical museum. I've wanted to see the Pearl Harbor museum since I was in sixth grade. It's special because it's built on a big US military ship that sank in World War II after Japan attacked it by surprise. I learned that this attack made the US join the war. That's why I want to see this museum more than any other place.\n\nIn conclusion, Hawaii has many cool and important things to see. That's why I want to go there more than anywhere else."}
{"text_id": "BE0E8A444B0C", "output_essay": "I agree with Emerson when he says 'you should try new things beyond what you know; otherwise, you won't grow.' My first reason for agreeing is that when I wrote my last English essay, I didn't know how to do it. But the more I tried and failed, the better I got. I learned and gained a new skill. Sticking to what I know doesn't make me smart. Without trying new things, I won't grow. My second reason is that I'm not good at spelling, but it's important in life. You need to spell for many things. I have to practice and take classes to get better. It will take time, but it will make me happy. I'll think, 'If I don't learn this, I won't grow or do well in life.' My third reason is that some people with disabilities achieve great things. They or their families push them to do well and grow. They don't let their disability hold them back. Others have everything they need but don't push themselves because they are lazy. They don't care about growing or succeeding. My fourth reason is that I think teenagers should work. Jobs teach you how to work, handle money, and spend it wisely. It prepares you for adulthood and helps you succeed. It's tough, but it helps you grow. My fifth reason is about studying. You need to study for many things, like driving tests and school exams. I didn't study for my test, so I might fail. It's my fault. I chose to play instead of studying. I wasn't acting mature. Now, I might have to retake the test. I need to study to grow. My last reason is that everyone should pay attention in school. If you don't, you'll fail and might have to repeat the year. You need to pass to move on. Paying attention helps you grow. You need to pass to go to college or get a good job. It helps you grow and become someone. If you don't try harder things, you won't grow. You'll be stuck doing the same small things. But if you challenge yourself, you'll seem smarter and get better jobs than those who don't grow. That's why I agree with Emerson."}
{"text_id": "C0665B1D1449", "output_essay": "Self-esteem grows when we learn. As students, we need to believe in ourselves to learn well. Teachers and staff work hard to help us succeed in life. Some people think differently, but self-esteem is about trying hard, not giving up when learning is tough, and it's better to try than to do nothing.\n\nSome say self-esteem comes from success, not from kind words. For instance, in my first year of high school, I had a hard time because I didn't try my best. I was a good student, but I didn't like to learn or listen in class. Then, in the second half of the year, I started to focus in class. By the end of the year, my grades were better, and I passed with B's and one C. I think I gained self-esteem and succeeded because I learned from the experience.\n\nRight now, many students in America are having trouble in school. Some say it's because they don't try to learn. I agree because I had the same issue. People don't like to say 'not trying' because it sounds like failing in life. But if we don't try, it affects others and our own education.\n\nStill, some think self-esteem comes from praise, not success. I believe it comes from success because trying is better than not trying. Others don't agree. They say that if students keep trying what they're bad at, they'll just get upset. I don't think so. If students listen, they can improve instead of wasting time. My cousin had this problem too because he didn't try and was too lazy to listen. That's why I think self-esteem is about learning from the past.\n\nIn the end, I learned that self-esteem is about growing because it made me a better person. I also reached goals like never giving up, always trying, and pushing myself to do better. So, self-esteem isn't just about praise; it's about what we achieve and the mistakes we learn from in school."}

This is why I must choose for myself. I can be free by making choices, like buying a car. I can also be free by paying my rent and starting my own family. So, people should think more about their own choices. To do what I enjoy, I take part in fun activities and make choices that are good for me. I hear what others say but don't copy them. For these and more reasons, I need to choose for myself. I shouldn't let others sway me easily. I can become more self-reliant by thinking about what I do well. I might listen to advice, but it's not always good for me. Still, I can listen and think about it, then decide for myself without being swayed easily.

{"text_id": "88B748EC71BA", "output_essay": "Dear Principal,\n\nI think it's a good idea to make the school day longer. This could help some students get better grades. But, I think only students who need extra help in some classes should stay longer. Some students are good at certain subjects, while others need more help.\n\nIf we have more school time, students could get better grades. They would get more one-on-one time with teachers and could study more. Teachers could spend more time explaining things and helping students who don't understand, like important dates in history they didn't know before.\n\nAlso, with a longer school day, students would have more time to finish their work, like projects or homework. They could do better and be more careful with their projects. They would finish their work on time because they could work with other students, share ideas, and see things in new ways. Some students might get new ideas from their friends. They could find their own way to do things in the future. They can work at their own speed and feel good about what they do.\n\nStudents also need time to talk with each other, explain things, and understand what they need to do for projects. When they work on big projects about things like saving animals, environmental problems, or the risks of some products, they need to be careful and have enough time. Working in groups means they have to put everyone's work together to make a good presentation.\n\nMaking the school day longer gives students enough time to do all their work and get help. They can move at their own speed and study well for tests. This could help them get better grades and maybe be the best students. But we should remember that not everyone can be the best, and getting help can be very important to understand things at the end of class.\n\nTo end, a longer school day can help students pay attention to their studies, go over their study guides after finishing their work, and work well in groups. Having more time at school is very helpful, especially for group work and getting ready for tests.\n\nI hope you see my point of view and will think about making the school day longer for those who need it. This could help them get better grades and do better in school.\n\nSincerely,\n[Your Name]"}
{"text_id": "6113ABE39260", "output_essay": "Most students like summer vacation, but some teachers think it's too long. Some people say schools should be open all year with shorter summer breaks, a longer winter break, and a week off in spring and fall. Teachers should not change summer vacation because kids need a break, should enjoy being young, and need time to set goals for the next school year.\n\nTeachers should not change summer vacation because kids need a break. Kids who work hard in school should get a reward for trying to learn. They can use what they learn in their everyday life, which is what teachers want. They wake up early to go to school. Many kids try their best in school to plan for their future. They learn new things in every class. Kids need a break from school just like adults need days off from work. They get tired and need a rest now and then; we should treat kids the same way.\n\nTeachers should not change summer vacation because kids should enjoy being young. Every kid should learn new things on their own. They should have their own fun and keep it to themselves. They can't be in school all the time; they have their own lives. It's important for kids, especially young ones, to do things other than school. School isn't for everyone. If school was all year, they wouldn't have much free time to do things by themselves like they can in the summer.\n\nTeachers should not change summer vacation because kids need time to set goals for the next school year. Students could find out new things about themselves. Everyone has doubts, wondering if they can do it or not. But they often prove themselves wrong by aiming high. They can fix last year's mistakes and feel sure they can achieve what they decide to do. Setting goals can make them feel confident. If they want something, they need to work for it. It can make them feel proud when they do something they weren't sure about.\n\nIn conclusion, I don't think making breaks shorter is a good idea. It would take away kids' freedom to have fun, or they might not care about school. Some might say it's hard for them to remember things after a long break. But having breaks not during school could help kids focus better because they'll know when to be serious."}
{"text_id": "2643FB528BF2", "output_essay": "Is real self-worth from compliments or from success? I think that self-worth for students comes from finishing their tasks. I pick success because students finish work and then do well. I don't agree with compliments because they don't help students learn more. When students do things on their own, they can learn from errors. They will try to do better next time. My first reason for picking success is that it helps students do their work well. This is how students try hard to reach their goals and not fail. By succeeding, students work hard so they don't get bad grades or make wrong choices. Students succeed by keeping on trying, not by giving up. The second reason I pick success is that it makes students feel sure of themselves. Students do their work with sureness because they are learning. Feeling sure helps them not get upset. By working on time and with sureness, students don't have regrets. My last reason for not agreeing with compliments is big. I don't agree because just compliments don't help students learn from wrongs or push them to do better. Also, students won't learn to give their all and will learn less. Students should want to do more than just get compliments. This is how they will do great and not get bad grades. In my view, self-worth comes from success, from being very sure of oneself and doing the right thing. Success means finishing work on time and being ready. But what I really don't agree with is just getting compliments. It stops students from learning from wrongs. Succeeding is the best way to work, to push limits, and to keep going."}

You can do a lot of things there. But, it's important for everyone to throw away their trash. If you see garbage on the ground, please pick it up and throw it away. This keeps the park nice for people and animals. Animals live in parks because they find food there and places to hide from hunters. Hunters, called poachers, kill animals to sell them. But they can't shoot animals in parks because it's against the law. If they do, they might have to pay money or go to jail. We need to clean up the parks so animals don't get hurt by trash or eat it by mistake. Trash can also make the water in lakes dirty and harmful. This can kill fish and animals that drink the water. If you throw trash in the park, you might have to pay money. But it's not as much as if you hunt animals. Little kids love to play in parks, and adults like to watch them or relax. Some people like to fish in the lake or go boating. You need a permit to fish. If you don't have one, you can't fish. You can also have a picnic, a birthday party, or watch fireworks in July. There are many things to do, like helping out in the park. Remember, there are things you can and can't do in the park. Follow the rules to stay out of trouble and keep everyone safe. And don't forget to recycle and throw away your trash to keep our parks and the environment clean and safe."}

But, I believe not every student should pick just one job. They might change their minds later on. Some young students already know what job they want. Often, their parents had the same job when they were young. It's like a family rule to be a doctor, FBI agent, teacher, and so on. Parents want to know their child's job choice by middle school. They expect them to follow the family's job history. Some parents make their kids pick the same job they have. They want to keep the family rule going. But if the kids don't like the job, they will hate going to work. They will find their job dull and wish they had picked something else while sitting at work. Other students struggle to pick a job when they start high school. In the first year, their counselor asks them what job they want after graduation. Some know the answer, but others don't. Family members suggest some jobs and ask them to look into them. So, it's better not to rush into one job. There are many jobs to think about. They don't have to choose right away. They can wait until their last year of high school. High school students should not worry about picking a job right away. It can stress them out and make it hard to focus in class. It can also upset them if people keep asking. Choosing one job too early is not a good idea. What if a student takes a class for a job they thought they wanted, but then they find another job that seems more exciting?"}

{"text_id": "27DBD975EC8E", "output_essay": "Working by yourself or with others has good and bad points. Being in a group has its upsides, but I think working by yourself is much better and has more pluses. Some folks don't like group work because it can be harder. When you work by yourself, you know what's good and what's not. That's why I feel it's better. You get more chances. I think working by yourself is the top pick for some for a few reasons. First, they can work more hours and know how much they can handle, whether it's a lot or a little. Someone on their own, like they have their own business, can make more money for themselves. They don't have to take little pay for tough, good work at a company or shop. Some need more money because they have big families or emergencies. That's why they work by themselves to get the money they need. Also, some might work too much or too hard because they're sick and can't do much. But they might not want to tell their boss why they can't work more. Some like their work to be perfect. If something's wrong and you're on your own, you can fix it. It's not a problem because you did it. Working by yourself is better because you don't have to tell others what to do. You know what you need to do, and no one says to do it again or better. Sometimes bosses like some workers more, which can be bad, especially for black people or Latinos. Every country has its own language, so some don't like to talk or make friends with others. They don't want to deal with language fights or other problems from where a person comes from. If someone doesn't speak the main language, it's a big issue. That's why immigrants often start their own businesses. They can speak the language there. When you work by yourself, you can be yourself more. You can pick your hours and start when you want. If you have your own business, you know how long you can work. Working alone means you can make more money. The only cost is what you need for the job. No one says they can't pay you because there are more workers. If your boss pays you badly and others get more for doing less, that's bad. Some places don't treat women, black people, or Latinos right. They don't pay them well because of where they're from. If you work for yourself, you know when your work is good. Some don't care if it looks bad; they just want the money. So, if you're on your own, you know when it's good. You don't need someone to say it's bad. You know what to do, and you can do it better. Some don't like being told what to do. They think they can do anything or that their work is perfect. When you're on your own, this isn't a problem. If you own a business, you decide your hours. You have your own money, which is fair for your work. If there's an emergency, you don't need to ask. You won't have issues. Some places only give you 20 minutes for lunch. If it's your job, you take as long as you want. Some need more time before work, or have kids and no babysitter, so they go to work early. For example, if you don't speak the language well or at all, or you're from another country, it's harder to work with others. That's why they may not like group work. Working alone is a good choice if you have to pick between that and a group. You won't have issues with coworkers. In some countries, it's easy to find a job, but not in others. That's why some like to work alone, or they work differently from a company."}

There are also programs outside of school that do the same thing. For example, at my church, we read to little kids about being polite and showing respect. Also, listening is a part of the program. It makes students listen better when they hear the older students read. This is like the 'ELL's test,' which includes a reading part. While reading, the older students can ask questions or pretend they are in the story. In my middle school, students go to the elementary school to read to the little ones. I think the program helps them read and listen better. This could help them in the future or at work. It's also good to have this experience."}
{"text_id": "643EF7B3B591", "output_essay": "I think that working with others in class is better than working alone. It is good training for jobs where you need to work with others. Students who work together often finish their work quicker. It also helps students who need help to ask their teammates for it. In most jobs, you will need to work with others. My dad's friend, Generic_Name, was a car mechanic who worked alone. But when he got too many cars to fix, he had to hire another mechanic, also named Generic_Name. At first, they did not work well together and were slow. But after some time, they learned to work as a team. Generic_Name saw that working with others was quicker and hired more people. Now, he has a successful business and understands the importance of teamwork. I also learned about teamwork at my job at Adidas. I had to work with someone I did not like, and we argued a lot. Our boss made us go to a team-building exercise. It helped, and we became friends and worked better together. Now, in school, I like to start group work. Working in groups helps you finish work quicker. When I do projects with others, we finish faster than if I did it alone. For example, my group finished a math project in two hours, but my friend who worked alone took five hours. Teams at NASA and in sports like the NBA and NFL also need to work together to succeed. If you need help, you can ask someone in your group. I did this for a school project and learned quickly. My brother in the military says teamwork is essential. He says he would not be here without his team. Some people think working alone is better because it lets you focus. But working in a group is better for the future. You can get help and finish tasks quicker. More people in the group can make it even faster. In the end, working in a group is likely in your future, and it has many benefits. Teams, like in sports, work together to achieve their goals. Group work is the quickest way to finish tasks. People with important jobs, like at NASA and in the military, work in groups."}
{"text_id": "5E15F2923699", "output_essay": "I like to work with a group because it helps more. Everyone has different ideas and ways of seeing things. If the teacher gives us too much work, we can split it up in a group. This lets everyone give their ideas and do the part they like best. Working in a group means we help each other, are nicer, spend time as friends, share ideas, see things differently, get to know each other, and succeed together. In a group, we work as a team to reach our goal and try to be the best. But, working in a group can be bad if someone distracts you or is too loud when you need quiet. Working alone can be hard if you only have one idea or if there's too much work for one person. You might also get tired from working a lot. The good thing about working alone is no one distracts you, and you don't have to go to a friend's place to work. Take a soccer team, for example. They work together to win games, become the year's champions, and get trophies. A drill team works hard together to win. They like helping each other and do great work. I think it's better to work in a group. You make more friends, find new ideas, and learn new ways of looking at life. It helps you finish work on time and shows you're responsible. I like working in a group because we can share ways of doing things, and it's easier since we all help with the work, so I don't have to do it all by myself."}

I think adding one and a half hours to school each day is a good idea for many reasons.\n\nFirst, I agree with the school board. One reason is you get more summer time. More summer time is great because you can spend it with family in Virginia or other states. You can also travel to different places and stay longer. Another reason I agree is you will get less homework. You will get less homework because you can finish it in class with the teacher's help. Also, the school board might give us a day off. If they do, we will have four school days and a longer weekend.\n\nSome people might not want longer school days. They might like school and learning new things. They might like homework because it helps them get better grades. To do homework well, you need to listen and remember how to solve problems. Doing homework can lead to better grades on tests too. Another reason is they will get less summer time. Less summer time means less time with family, which would be sad for me. Others might not mind because they prefer school. The last reason people might disagree is they want more time in class. I think less time in each class is better, but I still support longer school days. People who disagree want to go home sooner.\n\nLastly, I have three more reasons why I agree with the school board. One is I will play video games less. Playing too much is not good. It can hurt your brain and eyes, and you might need glasses. Another reason is we can learn more. Learning is important for exams, graduating, and getting a good job. The last reason is I like when time feels slow. Slow time means more time with friends and doing activities together. Friends are important, and we should treat them well.\n\nIf I were you, I would add one and a half hours to school each day. I suggest you agree so you can finish school without rushing and spend time with friends. My advice is to just do your work and get it done. Remember this and think about your future.

I said we could be friends, but I wouldn't join. They got mad. They liked the gang because it made them feel safe and strong. After I refused to join, things changed for me. My grandma got a letter asking for money because a gang member died. She was afraid and gave them money. They kept asking for more.\n\nIn 7th grade, my friends pressured me to join. They said I'd be in danger if I didn't. I was afraid and said I'd think about it. I avoided them because I didn't want to say yes. Two weeks later, at the mall, three guys followed me. They asked if I'd join. I said no. They seemed okay with it, but then they attacked me. My grandma told my parents, and they said I should come to the USA.

If they just do what they already know, they will become old-fashioned and won't get new ideas about the subject. \n\n\"If you don't try to do more than what you know, you won't get better.\"\n\nFor example, in a history class, imagine we are studying the 1860s and you like it.

A person who learns more can get more from life, like chances, new experiences, and pride in what they've done. \n\nGetting past a goal can lead to more chances and experiences.

Also, in jobs or sports, having more experience can help someone get a better job or a top spot. So, people who ask for more usually get more. \n\nIt's good for people to look at their goals and be proud of what they've done. Take high school as an example. If students worked hard for the first three years, they wouldn't have a hard time in their last year. They'd be proud and have more free time to choose their classes. Another point is that as people get older, they might see they could have done more. It's key for people to chase what they want so they don't have regrets later. \n\nSome think that reaching a goal is enough because it takes time and hard work. But I think that someone who tries to learn more than they know is someone who wants to succeed in many parts of life. For example, in 10th grade, I barely passed History with a D. I wasn't happy because I knew I could do better. I retook the class in summer school and got a B, and I passed the SOL test. I realized that if I could get a B in one class, I could get A's and B's in all my classes. To me, it's not just the time or effort that matters. It's what a person learns and how they plan to use that knowledge later. \n\nIn the end, if people aim for many goals instead of just one, we could have a lot of successful, wealthy people.

Others think that real self-worth comes from doing well. I believe that students feel good about themselves when they do well. Students who don't get praised will want to do better. They will work harder and do their homework. If they get a high grade, they will feel proud and confident. They didn't need praise to work hard and do well. So, doing well makes them want to keep trying hard in all their classes. Let's be clear: students who get praised without trying their best shouldn't be praised. This makes them think they don't have to try hard. They might do worse in school because they think it's okay not to try. Praising students who don't try might also affect other students. They might think they don't have to try hard to do well. Students who do well and feel proud of their achievements will feel better than those who just got praised. The ones who tried hard will feel even better. I also think self-worth comes from doing well because some very rich people in the United States didn't finish college. They felt proud of what they did and worked hard for it. Some people think students need to be confident to learn. I don't agree. I think students learn if they want to. If they are just playing and not listening to the teacher, they don't want to learn. Being confident is good, but students need to listen and pay attention too. In the end, I really think that real self-worth comes from doing well. Students will keep trying their best, and others won't think they can do well without trying hard."}

This is because they are not sure about what they want to do, might find other jobs they like, and need to get ready. Picking a job path early can be good because it gives students time to think about their future job. But it is better not to pick a job path early. This way, students are more ready and sure about the job they want to do. Students should not pick a job path early because they are not sure about what they want to do. Some people quit college because they chose the wrong job for themselves. High school students are very young and do not have clear goals.\n\nStudents should not pick a job path when they are young because they might find other jobs interesting.

They should be able to choose for themselves in this world that is full of puzzles and problems.\n\nShould we decide for ourselves, or should we ask for advice from experts and leaders on big issues in life?\n\nPeople often decide for themselves when their gut feelings match up with a different situation. Sometimes, they make big choices to think over their inner struggles. Some trust their gut, while others depend on their thoughts and past experiences. But, the question is: should we ask for advice from experts and leaders on big issues in life? This is hard for some people today. Even now, in the 21st century, some people are pushed around by others who make choices for them. There are many nice people who see the world as a happy place. But, there are also those who want to control others, like experts or leaders. I think there's a good side to this, too. For example, when experts or leaders choose for others, they bring new ideas from what they know. I also believe that two people thinking together is better than one.\n\nPeople make big choices when their gut feelings match up with a tough situation. This means they decide when they face a big problem. At this time, people are meant to choose for themselves.\n\nSometimes, people make big choices to think over their inner struggles. Still, there are those who decide based on solid thinking.\n\nSome people decide by trusting their gut. Long ago, our ancestors hunted dangerous animals and had to trust their gut and thoughts about hunting. They thought hard about how to make big choices in life. In short, we all have these basic survival instincts. What I'm saying is that people who stand on their own two feet believe in trusting their gut and thoughts in life.\n\nOther people decide based on thoughts and past experiences. People always have thoughts to make their lives better; thoughts are the start of human ideas. With clear and steady thoughts, people should be able to make the right choices for their lives. On the other hand, past experiences are very important in making good choices. For example, I saw a grandma and a kid in a store. The grandma checked the prices of each thing carefully, while the fifteen-year-old boy just took things without thinking, because he didn't have experience. The grandma's experience helped her pick better prices. Even if she didn't have enough money for everything, and the boy had more money, her experience was more useful.\n\nShould we ask for advice from experts and leaders on big issues in life?\n\nFirst, we could use help from experts, people who know a lot, because we all need help with making choices sometimes.\n\nSecond, experts are not always the best at making choices. They can help with good plans and ways of doing things. Experts may know a lot to make choices for others, but they shouldn't tell us what's best for us. We run our own lives and thoughts. Some experts might be tricky and want to make our choices no matter if we agree. We can get advice from experts on how to make good choices, but in the end, we have the right to pick our own way.\n\nThird, leaders have a big impact on what happens to people. Nowadays, leaders have a lot of power. For example, leaders like TV try to make us believe they have the right way and choices for everyone. But, this can be bad.\n\nLeaders are not always bad in making choices.\n\nIn the end, we should make our own choices, even if the result might not be good. I believe that life is what it is; the only trap is in our minds. People who stand on their own two feet see it as key for everyone to trust their gut and thoughts. We should all have basic survival instincts to make big choices in life before we act. We also need thoughts, as ideas lead to actions and a good life. Even though some will say to trust your gut and thoughts, don't follow false leaders. Be true in life and make your own choices, even if you make mistakes. Experts are not always the best for everything in life, but we need to know that we can make our own choices. Don't let others push you around; be true and take charge of your own future."}

This is why I knew my choice in my first year of high school. \n\nKnowing your future job is very important. It helps you choose the right classes. It gets you ready for what's next.

She has some ideas but didn't think it through. She can't take the same classes as Student A. \n\nThinking about your job early helps you plan your money.

She talked about her job as a kindergarten teacher and how much she loves it. She thinks it's the best choice she ever made. This made me wonder if we should make all our choices on our own or listen to others too. Self-reliance means following your own thoughts and feelings. I agree with this because school, friends, and jobs are big parts of our lives. First, school is a big choice. We pick our school and what we study. For example, my friend Generic_Name had to choose a college last week. Teachers say picking a college is tough for students. This choice can change their school life a lot. Second, friends and family are a big part of our lives. They shape how we feel and what we do. My friend Generic_Name had to choose who to live with after his parents split up. It was hard because he loves both parents. Decisions like this are tough but matter a lot. We need to trust ourselves to choose well. Third, picking a job is key. It shows what we want to be. My sister Generic_Name saved a life in surgery last month. She's glad she became a surgeon. People think picking the right job leads to success. We should love our job to do well in the future. In conclusion, I saw Generic_Name at the coffee shop yesterday. She loves being a teacher. It was her choice and she's happy. This made me think about making our own choices or getting advice.

It's true that if someone doesn't try to do something more than what they already know, they won't learn new skills or hobbies. Just doing what you're already good at won't help you succeed in other areas of life. For example, Generic_Name was great at art, but as time went on, she didn't learn anything else. She kept doing the same thing and didn't gain new skills, which stopped her from growing normally. It's very important to learn and get good at things you don't know yet. This is good for you and for others. People grow normally by trying and getting good at new things. Sticking to what you know isn't good for you and can stop you from growing. For example, people usually want to get really good at their favorite subjects or hobbies. They work on what they like first, and when they're good at it, they should try to learn new things. But because they like it so much, they often just want to get even better at it instead of learning something new. Another problem with Emerson's idea is that people can get too caught up in what they're good at. Doing the same thing over and over can get boring after a while."}

The more you do, the less work you have left. Thomas Jefferson said, 'Determine never to be idle... It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing.' Doing nothing doesn't help; it leads to failure. It's important to finish what you start. It's better to do one thing than nothing at all.\n\nWe learn to finish our work. But sometimes we do nothing. Everyone wants to achieve their goals. It can be hard, but it's worth it. We all have dreams. To reach them, we must work. If you don't, you won't meet your goals. You might complain, but it was your choice. If you have dreams, work for them. For instance, my sister was bad at history. She had a test on Thursday and wanted to pass. She studied a lot and got extra help. She passed her test. She reached her goal because she worked hard, even though history was tough for her.\n\nSome think doing nothing is okay, but it's not. Being lazy won't get you far. Laziness is a choice. If you're lazy, you won't finish your tasks. My brother had homework due. He planned to do it after school. Instead, he played games. He didn't do his homework and got a bad grade. That was the result of his laziness. If you want to finish something, do it. Don't be lazy, or you'll face the results. If you finish your work, you can relax later. Don't blame others if you didn't do the work yourself.\n\nFinishing tasks gives you more chances in life. If you chase your dreams, you'll have more opportunities. You might fail, but that's okay. Everyone does. If you try hard, you'll succeed. For example, my cousin was a great student. She wanted to go to Generic_School. She worked hard and got in. She was so happy. She had other options, but she wanted Generic_School. If you want something a lot, you must work hard. You can do anything if you try. Even if you fail, you learn and keep going.\n\nIn the end, you can do anything. It's up to you. What Thomas Jefferson said is right. Finishing tasks makes you happy. It's better to be busy than idle. Doing things brings joy and success. Not doing anything won't help. It's about working hard and getting things done."}

The real issue isn't if some teens can pick a career; it's that they don't want the stress and people telling them to earn money all the time.\n\nWhy do people see being a musician or a dancer as poor jobs? Society often makes us think you can be a musician, but only if you get an Engineering degree first. I call these 'The first goal in your life.' As a child, you have dreams, but as you grow, you often put them aside because you learn to make choices.\n\nAs you get older, you understand that being an astronaut or doctor is hard. It takes a lot of time, and you might change your mind. It's the same in high school; changing your mind is okay. It means you're thinking better. I think as you stay in school longer, you learn more about life and discover your main skill.\n\nI've said a lot about why we shouldn't force kids to choose a career too soon. Now, I'll talk about the good things for students who know what they want. You can take special classes in high school to prepare for college.

You won't get free education anymore, so use it well. What if you didn't take important classes and didn't go to college? It will be tough to get a job. Some companies are strict. They want people who finished high school because they're easier to train and talk to. Don't let anyone say you can't do something. I've seen people who were told they can't do anything. Often, they are the ones without a job or anything else. Just because someone says you can't, doesn't mean it's true. Keep working hard to get a good job, make money, travel, and enjoy life. You don't know how long you have. In the end, it's smart for students to start planning early. You'll get more chances in life and better jobs. You might even earn enough to live on your own. So, choose a career early, never give up, and chase your dreams. We all have a special talent given to us."}

But if you pick just one job, you can't have more than one. You need time to look at different choices. Still, if you focus on one, you'll be ready for later. And later, you can help other students get ready. They pick their high school classes to help them get ready for a certain job. It's good to use high school to get ready for many jobs. It's better to learn about different jobs. This way, you're ready for anything. But if you pick just one job before high school, you should think about more than one.

{"text_id": "39C652D0822E", "output_essay": "Teach yourself and choose for yourself. Many people seek advice to understand life and big issues. Getting advice is good because it lets us exchange thoughts and learn from others. It also stops us from making errors while learning about big life issues. But, it's important for people to choose for themselves to build confidence, face challenges, and get better at things.\n\nFirst, choosing for yourself builds confidence. For example, when you make your own choices, you feel sure of yourself. This sureness helps people grow. It also gives energy and the push to try new things. Choosing for yourself makes you more confident.\n\nNext, choosing for yourself brings challenges. Facing challenges is key. For example, challenges help you grow, get stronger, and learn from old mistakes. Choosing for yourself can be hard because you might be scared of mistakes, tired from trying, or think too much about the choice. Choose for yourself and take on the challenge.\n\nLast, choosing for yourself helps you get better at things. When I choose on my own, I feel like I'm improving my abilities. Even though it's tough, I manage, which makes me better and more knowledgeable. People get better when they choose for themselves because choosing is not easy; it means learning new things, looking at new ideas, and more. Choose for yourself and improve your abilities.\n\nIn the end, people should choose for themselves because it makes them confident, brings challenges, and helps them learn new skills. Making choices on your own makes you feel sure and ready to do more. Also, by choosing for themselves, people push themselves to think better, feel stronger, and learn from mistakes. They also get better by trying more and finding new things. For these reasons, people should choose for themselves."}

Being in a group also lets us make new friends and we try to be the best group in class. We also learn new things together. In groups, we are curious about other countries' cultures or want to learn new languages. Some people don't like working alone. Sometimes we like being in groups, but not always. This can happen when a teacher puts you in a group and you think, 'I don't like this group.' But I wonder why some people don't want to be friends with others just because they look different or follow a different religion. That's why they might say, 'I don't like this group' and want to change groups. This is why working in a group isn't always good, but for me, it is. When we give presentations, we work together and don't argue. If a new student from another country doesn't know anything, we should help them because they are new. Everyone from another country feels this way. When you come from another country and don't speak English, it's very hard. I remember feeling alone in my first years at school because I had no friends. I was sad because Spanish speakers didn't talk to me, and when someone did, I didn't understand them. But then, I only worked in groups with people who spoke different languages. This helped me learn English better. If they needed help, I would help them because they helped me before. Now it's my turn. That's why I like working in groups. If we work alone, we might need to ask someone for help. It's better to work in groups, but not good to always work alone. We need other people's support. Our parents aren't at school to help us. When I can work in a group, they help me, but sometimes I don't want to. People think working in groups is good because we need to help newcomers learn. I won't let people say, 'You won't succeed in this group.' It's a group, and they shouldn't talk down to others. I prefer working in groups. There are more benefits, like getting support and learning new things. Other people can help you improve and be kind if you want to do better in life."}

It's important to rest so your body can recover. Schools should not make the day longer. Teachers and staff would get more tired. They already wake up early. If they finish work later, they will be even more tired. I think schools should let kids choose to stay later for extra help. If school lasts longer, then workers should get an extra hour too, to be fair. Kids should not have to stay in school for so long.

It makes talking to others easier, is helpful at work, and lets people learn important tech skills.\n\nFirst, technology helps people by making it easy to talk to others. For example, I use technology to talk to my family in Generic_City. Some people use social media to tell family about big things happening in their lives. Also, technology is very important in emergencies. If someone needs to go to the hospital, they need to use a phone to get help. Technology is a big part of our lives because it lets us share big news with each other.\n\nAlso, technology helps people at work. I think technology is a must-have for big stores like Amazon, Target, or Walmart to sell things. If they have sales, they use social media to make ads to get customers. Technology also lets people work from home. When I am sick, I can use my computer to work from somewhere else. It helps office workers talk to customers on the phone. Some people like to call their doctors to set up visits. Technology is a big deal at work.\n\nLastly, technology helps people by letting them learn a lot of tech skills. Using technology will help students get good jobs later. I think learning PowerPoint will help me because I want to be a teacher and it will help me show new ideas to my students. Also, knowing how to use gadgets will help people teach others. Being good with technology is important because bosses want people who know how to use it. Technology is a good way to learn.\n\nIn conclusion, technology helps people's lives because it makes talking easier, is useful at work, and helps people learn tech skills. It helps people talk all over the world, talk to customers, and helps students get ready for jobs. Technology is a great way to share ideas and get students excited to learn new things every day. It's also a strong way to spread new ideas to others."}

Often, people use their ideas to make or build things that will be helpful later. But, many people need help from those who know more; some ask their older brothers or sisters for advice, and to persuade someone, you often need help too.\n\nSome people get the right help about things. 'Some people need help from those who know more.' For example, if you are opening a bank account for the first time, you need someone to show you what to do. Also, if you start a new job at a fast-food place, you need someone who knows that job well to teach you.\n\nSome people have older brothers or sisters they can ask for help. 'Some people ask their older brothers or sisters about these things.' This shows that it's okay to ask for help, like if I just came to the United States and my older brother has lived here for 25 years. I would ask my brother for help because he knows a lot about living and working here, like how to do taxes and about home loans.\n\nSome people need to know how to persuade others. 'To persuade someone, you need help if you can't do it yourself.' Say you're not good at convincing and you want to ask your strict boss for more pay, you need to know how to talk to them so they might say yes. They will probably respect you more because you were brave enough to ask a strict person.\n\nSome people need help from those who know a lot because they are expected to know everything. That's why we call them experts. They can teach us about the topic. Some people have their older brothers or sisters to ask about things they don't understand. Older brothers or sisters are there to help you when you're in trouble and need support. Some people need to know how to talk to strict people so they can give reasons to do something. This also shows that you are brave enough to act."}
{"text_id": "A29A9D973316", "output_essay": "Many people think that working with others or by yourself has good points, but it can have bad points too. I believe that both ways can be good, and they can have some downsides. When you work in a group, you talk more with others and you don't become shy. For example, you can chat about the task, share ideas, decide together, and finish your work fast and easy. Working with others teaches you to listen and work well with others, getting you ready for a job in the future.\n\nThe bad part of working in a group is feeling that you work better and harder, and thinking that others don't deserve praise. Sometimes, you might argue or fight because you don't agree on the work, or you might feel ignored and not try hard. You can also lose focus and stop caring. For instance, if a friend is in the group, you might talk about things not related to the work. This can mess up your task.\n\nWorking by yourself can be less fun, but it helps you rely on yourself and focus. You get all the credit for your work and avoid issues with others. It can teach you to handle problems on your own later. The downside is feeling stuck when you don't know something and need help. For me, working alone is harder because I like doing many things and talking a lot. Being alone feels like being in a tiny cage with no help to escape. But, it also gets you ready for life because we won't always have help. We need to learn to fix our problems and do tasks on our own.\n\nIn conclusion, I think working with others or alone is good, even though they have different bad points. Both ways teach you to be responsible, work well with others, be friendly, and be more creative. They make you more social and push you to try hard. They also show you how to help others in different cases. The biggest lessons are about teamwork and being independent. Everyone works in their own way, but I think both ways are very useful and good."}

I believe families wouldn't be happy with a shorter break. Summer break is three months long. This gives students plenty of time to rest and enjoy time with friends and family. Winter break is fine as it is. No one wants a long break in the cold weather. Most people like their time off when it's warm and sunny. If students have breaks during the school year, they might forget what they learned. I don't think many students want to study during those breaks. I feel that making summer break shorter is not needed. If we make summer break short and other breaks like Thanksgiving, Winter, and Spring longer, it's just a small break for students. But if breaks are too long, students may become lazy and not want to go back to school. We have a long summer break so students can take a big break from school."}

If students are having trouble with a subject they don't get, they could ask their teachers for help. The teachers might offer to stay after school to explain things, or they could match the student with someone who is good at the subject to work together. Working together helps students succeed because the hard subject becomes easier. I think we should have a club like this in our school because it would help students and teachers support each other.\n\nI think a homework club at our school would be very useful. For instance, it would help me with subjects I find hard, help me understand them more, and get me ready for learning. It would also let me make new friends by getting help, become closer to teachers, and not worry about homework at home since I would finish it at school. Then, I can do other things because my homework is done.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that if students and teachers create a homework club at our school, it would not just help me but also make learning better for everyone. It would let us finish our work before going home. Then, we wouldn't have to stress about it and could enjoy our free time because our homework is already done after school."}

I believe that using technology instead of meeting people in person has good effects on our lives. This is because many people find lots of useful information online, learn about the world, and find new things that will help in the future. Also, technology gives both students and adults important information for study, making projects, and learning about any subject.\n\nFirst, many people use technology to find lots of useful information to learn about the world and to get new knowledge that will be good for the future. Often, people don't understand what teachers are saying, so they use technology to learn more about the subject. Today's technology is much better and gives more information that can make us better learners. For example, as a student who speaks two languages, I sometimes don't understand words and look them up to know what they mean. I also look for information that will help me with projects or homework to get good grades and be a better student. The internet has a lot of useful information that can help anyone at any time with projects, homework, work, or anything else.\n\nSecond, technology gives students and adults important information for study, making projects, and learning about any subject. For example, many adults and students used to go to the library to find information for school or work, which was hard for those who lived far away. Students who had to drive or take a bus to the library lost time traveling. Now, the internet gives great information that you can get at home, even on a phone. Smart devices have apps that can find amazing information, and you can find interesting articles that will help you. Also, many people have found new ways to keep good information close; for example, many adults who like reading news can easily get online news of any kind. The internet is an exciting place where we can find things like recipes, news, and information about the world.\n\nHowever, some people don't agree with using technology instead of meeting people. They think it has bad effects because they believe too much technology can hurt your brain and eyes. But this idea is not true as many people love technology; it has made many things in life, and we use those things every day. Also, some parents worry that students or others might hurt their eyes from using smart devices too much. This worry is not true because taking breaks can keep your eyes healthy. People who don't like technology often don't know much about it and may not see that a lot of what we use is made with technology. In my view, technology is a great help when you're stuck on something or don't know about a subject. The new generation is full of new ideas, and technology is the biggest source we have to learn from; ideas from the internet are there for us to use.\n\nIn the end, using technology instead of meeting people has good effects on our lives. It brings many ideas that can turn into new ones and will be useful for getting new information to answer questions in the future. Many people like the internet for better resources, to shop online, to find books, and even to play games without bothering others, enjoying their own space without being disturbed."}

There's always something to reach for, whether it's a task you've put off or something you love, like art. I think we get more done when we're busy. It's like hard work; it always leads to good results. You might also be surprised by how much you've done, and you won't be someone who never finishes their work. By working hard, you finish things and complete your tasks. Take school, for example. If you keep up and hand in work on time, you should be close to your goal. It's not easy for everyone, but if you try your best, you'll feel proud, and that's what counts. Even without homework or a job, you can find a fun activity. The main thing is to stay busy and not make excuses to do nothing. If you worry about not seeing results, let that go. You'll always surprise yourself with what you achieve. Many people delay tasks, thinking they'll be let down by the results. But they don't realize that things often end well. For example, if I mess up a nail design, I don't ignore it. I turn it into something that surprises everyone. You shouldn't give up; just go for it. It keeps you busy, and you never know what will happen. In the end, you'll think, \"Wow, time flies.\" Everything is good, but procrastination can ruin it. You might feel ready to work and then suddenly decide to put it off. It's hard to explain because it depends on how you feel that day. You might take a test and then do nothing else all day. It's strange because many things can affect how much you do and your drive to do it. We always get more done when we're busy. In my view, if you do nothing, you won't see results, unless you can do it in your sleep. By working hard, staying driven, and not giving in to procrastination, I think nothing should stop you from reaching your goals. But I don't judge anyone.

Some also think we should have a shorter summer break, a longer winter break, and a week off in spring and fall.\n\nStudents often feel tired after a long break. I know students who do well in school, but after a long break, they start to do poorly. Three years ago, a friend of mine always got good grades until the first long break each year. After the break, his grades dropped. I'm not the best student, but I do even worse after a break.\n\nStudents might remember more if breaks were shorter. They would be more alert because the breaks wouldn't be so long. For instance, my 17-year-old brother gets great grades. He's the top student in his classes, but his grades drop a lot after a long break. He says, \"I'd like shorter breaks.\" He thinks his classmates dislike him because they call him a nerd for wanting shorter breaks.\n\nWith shorter breaks, students would be more alert, and teachers would be happier because they wouldn't need to go over old lessons again. This would also be good for students; they could learn faster and move on to new things.\n\nSchools should try this: if a class goes through material fast and students do well, they could finish the class in two quarters, or one semester. This way, students could take more classes in less time.\n\nIn the end, I agree with most teachers that students should have shorter breaks to remember more, stay sharp, and make teachers happier.

Ralph Waldo Emerson, a writer, said, \"Unless you try to do something beyond what you have mastered, you will never grow.\" He means that people won't get better if they don't try new things. I believe people can improve by doing new things, like working hard and getting past tough spots. But some people think you can't get better at things you don't know about.\n\nFirst, working hard is one way people can improve by doing new things. Working hard can lead to success. For example, being confident can push you to reach many goals. When you are motivated, good things happen. Also, solving your own problems can lead to success. Dealing with your problems can help you focus and feel less stressed. These show that working hard can help people improve.\n\nAnother way people can get better is by getting past tough spots. Tough spots can be hard unless you deal with them the right way. For example, moving forward step by step can help you succeed. Also, when you finish steps, you understand better how to get past tough spots. Writing things down or remembering them can help you get past any tough spots.\n\nThese show how getting past tough spots can help you do new things and get better.\n\nHowever, some people think you can't get better at things you don't know. For example, making mistakes can take a lot of time. Also, mistakes can mess up your focus. True, mistakes can be stressful. But people should learn from their mistakes. For example, you will know better what to do the next time you try.\n\nIn summary, people can get better by doing new things like working hard. Being confident can push you to reach many goals. Also, getting past tough spots can help you do new things. Moving forward step by step can help you succeed. Even though some people think you can't get better at things you don't know, mistakes can take time, but you should learn from them. The next time you try, it will be easier with experience and knowledge. Why should we care? People should try new things and get better at skills.

Doing the same thing every day is a waste because trying over and over without learning is frustrating. I agree with Thomas Jefferson that it's great how much we can do if we're always busy, like getting better at my job, going after what I want, and getting better at things. If I practice or do something a lot, it will become normal for me. With hard work, I can get better at things. To really know what I want is to keep at it.\n\nI can become really good at something if I do it all the time. For example, I could do my job faster and easier.

I can keep trying to finish high school, so my family will be happy when they see the good results.

Believing in myself is important; when I'm sad, I tell myself, 'Keep going, Generic_Name, you can do it.' When I'm done, I'm just proud of myself.\n\nAlso, I always do things that make me better at skills. If I'm reading a book or a website to learn, it helps me know more and read better.

Our minds often fool us when we face tough times in life.\n\nI don't agree with Albert Einstein because people with jobs, families, and loved ones can't ignore their responsibilities just because they thought of something different. For instance, if you try to live by your imagination alone, you won't be able to get a real job and earn money.\n\nAnother reason I disagree is that living by your imagination can make you miss out on what's happening around you, whether it's good or bad. You shouldn't ignore real-life events because others care about you, and you need to show you care about them too, even if you don't like them for some reason.\n\nMy final point is that you shouldn't abandon someone you love just because you imagined something else. For example, your thoughts shouldn't stop you from helping yourself or someone else who needs help.\n\nIn summary, you shouldn't let your imagination control you or hurt people who matter to you."}
{"text_id": "3BCD9AA3A1F7", "output_essay": "Ralph Waldo Emerson once said, \"If you don't try to do more than what you can already do, you won't grow.\" I agree with him. It doesn't matter how old you are or what you look like when you want to do something. The important thing is what you want in your life. I want to be a businesswoman, even though my family doesn't. I choose this because it's my life. To get something you want, you should work hard and do everything to get it. Trying is the best way. If you don't try, how can you know if you can do it? In my country, I thought you could only have what you already have. I believed that only men could work and do what they want. Women couldn't work or study. They could only stay home, clean, and take care of kids. Women couldn't do what they wanted, which was bad. But in the US, I learned that women can do what they want. Now I try for everything I want, the job I want, the life I want. In my country, I couldn't do this because I wouldn't have the freedom I have here. I think if you're born poor, it's not your fault. But if you die poor, it is your fault because you didn't try to make your life better. You should always try and never give up. If you fail, it's okay. Try again. Each time you fail and try again, you learn something. Life is tough if you don't try for what you want. Trying is like taking tests at school. If we study, we get good grades. If we don't, we get bad grades. It's our choice. If we want good grades, we study. If we don't, we don't study. Life is the same. If we try, we can get what we want. If we don't, we won't. Life is about trying. If you try, you can have a better life. If you don't, you'll have a bad life. Being happy also makes life better. Try to be happy. Do things that make you happy. Think about how to be happy. When you're happy, you can do everything well. So, trying is key. The first thing I try for is happiness. Happiness is hard because many things can make you sad. But only a few things make you happy. So, you should try hard to be happy. I know many people who look happy but aren't."}

I need to leave my usual routine and try different things to see change. For example, I sometimes go to different restaurants and try new foods, and I often like them. I bring this up because I used to hate sushi and all Japanese food, but now I enjoy sushi and some Japanese dishes. Also, I'm changing the way I dress with different t-shirts, pants, and shoes because I'm in the USA now. I can do this here. In Generic_City, I couldn't because I didn't have enough money. But here in America, there are more options, which brings me to my next point.\n\nMy second reason is that trying new things gives me more knowledge. This will help me later because I learn something new every time I go out. Every day is a chance to learn. But if I just stay in my room and waste time, I won't get better. I also don't want to keep doing the same things if I already know them well.\n\nIn Generic_City, there's not much education or knowledge. If I were still there, my learning would be limited. But now, I'm in the United States, learning a new language, which will help me in my future job.\n\nMy last reason is about my future. If I keep trying new things every day, and still remember what I'm good at, I'll become experienced. I might have a good career and job. This is about making yourself and your family better. Family is very important, second only to God. And thanks to God, I'm here taking this test. The last thing I want to say is that everyone should try new things.\n\nSo, why is this quote important? If you think about it, you'll see how it can change your mind. Like I said, everyone should try new things. This can lead to a better future, and you might find something you love."}

But some people who finish high school don't continue their education because it's too expensive. They think they know what job they want to do for life and want to make money from their hobbies. They should think about going to college or university to get the best job they can. These places teach important things and can help pay for school. Going to college or university is a big step after high school. It helps you find the right job for you. High school is important, but the next step is to pick a place like ECPI University or VCU College, which are well-known. The choice of college should be your own, without pressure from others, including parents. Everyone likes different things, and it's okay to follow what you want. Students often need help to pick a job, and school staff like teachers can give good advice. They help students look at what they like and choose the right college or university. They often suggest schools in the same state because they cost less. Schools in other states can cost more, which might not work for everyone. Money problems shouldn't stop students from going to college or university. Families often help with money, which you can pay back after you get a job when you finish school. You should think about your future goals, not past worries or what your family needs. College can be too expensive for some people, and they decide not to go. But college is very important for your life and job. Some people say you can get some jobs with just a high school diploma, but not having a college degree means you can't get as many different jobs. If you don't have a high school diploma, you need to think about other ways to start a new life. In the end, going to college or university is very important if you want the best job for you. It gives you help, money for school, and gets you ready for work. Family can help with money, but it's up to you to decide if you want to go to college or university. There are choices for people without a college degree, but there might not be as many chances."}

{"text_id": "2D48DB7BFE46", "output_essay": "Do you run fast or like running? Do you enjoy running on a track? I do! This year, I've been into track. I find running track fun and educational. It's fun because it helps you run faster, keeps you fit, makes you think about helping your team, and makes you listen to your coach. This is especially true during competitions, which adds to the fun. \n\nRunning track helps you speed up because your coach tells you to stretch, warm up, and use your arms. You'll notice you get better and faster each day. This makes track enjoyable because you see your speed go up, and that feels good. Did you know that when you run, work out, and stretch, your muscles are stretching and getting small tears? That's right, when you work out on the track, this happens. So, the next day, you might feel sore because your muscles are growing. That's why stretching every day and taking warm-ups seriously is key. Even though these activities make you tired, they're worth it. \n\nTrack also makes you want to stay in shape and eat better. You don't want to eat too much junk food and become slow. But being fit and eating well is important. For instance, I once ate hot Cheetos before practice and regretted it. I got heartburn while running, which was distracting, and I had to stop until I felt better. Since then, I eat better because of that experience. Enjoying track comes easier when you're fit and healthy. \n\nListening to your coach also makes track more fun. It's very important, especially at meets. If you don't listen, you might miss something, get upset, and not have fun. Meets are noisy with lots of students and parents. So, paying attention to your coach is essential. You don't want to miss out or get in trouble for not listening. \n\nHaving supportive teammates makes track enjoyable too. With them, you feel more confident and have no doubts. But without support, you might feel sad. That's why it's nicer when everyone is kind and encourages each other. It's better than having mean teammates. Everyone should be treated well. \n\nIn conclusion, track is many things, but mostly it's fun. To enjoy it, you need a positive attitude, just like in track. It's as fun as a holiday. Well, not exactly, but it is for those who take running seriously. You feel like you're reaching goals, which is enjoyable. Track might seem tough, but it's not if you try hard. You won't regret it later. That's why many people, including me, like track. If you're serious about it, you'll do well."}

I think this is true because the internet is useful in many ways, even though it can be bad sometimes. I agree because people today are very busy with work, school, and taking care of their homes. They don't have time to visit libraries, shop, or spend time with friends or family. The internet helps college and high school students get books and other things they need when they can't go to the library or use a computer. It's easier for them to study and do homework at home or in their dorm. They can rest more and have free time. Even though libraries are good, students can't always go there. But the internet has apps and websites that can help with lots of topics. Technology also makes it easy for new moms to buy groceries and clothes online. When moms are busy with the house, cooking, and looking after their babies or kids, they can't shop in stores. It lets teenagers buy things online too, so they don't have to ask their parents to drive them or worry about driving themselves. People in the military who are away can shop online and send gifts to their families. Kids and teenagers can have fun with technology. When parents are cooking or busy, kids can watch videos or play games on phones, tablets, or laptops. There are fun apps for kids to learn and play. If teenagers can't go out with friends, they can play online with them. The internet also lets family members who live far apart text and video call.

But imagination is still very important because it can be used for art and making things. Albert Einstein was one of the smartest people ever, and he was mostly known for his science work.

In high school, you might wonder if you want to make a mark on the world or if doing nothing will lead to success. But doing nothing won't help. We're meant to be happy, even if we don't always act right. We should be good, but often we ignore God. We need Him. We're here to be good people, but we often fail. Heaven is wonderful, and we all want to go, but we must earn it. We should be grateful to God for each day. Even when we feel unloved, God loves us. He wants the best for us. We should serve Him and live for Him because He sacrificed for us. We must chase our dreams and achieve our goals. So, being active is better. \n\nMy first point is that being active helps us achieve more. When we're busy, we get results. If we do good, God will bless us more. To reach big goals, we must work hard and never quit. Always think big and positive. Nothing comes for free. You must keep busy to live well and be happy. This will motivate you to chase what you want. Believe in yourself and know your desires. \n\nMy second point is that your life is in your hands. Life can be tough, but it's harder if you think you can't succeed. You can if you believe and trust in God. Pray and don't stop because God is always there. If people aren't achieving, it's not just laziness. But being lazy and doing nothing is bad. Staying home all day can lead to bad thoughts. \n\nMy third point is that being active gets you closer to your goals. How you spend your free time matters. Some people make money at home, like by playing video games. But being inactive won't fulfill your dreams. You must do what you love and be happy with your life. Never give up. Your background doesn't matter, but your effort does. I want to be a soccer player, and I've learned that staying home doesn't help. Practicing all day is making me better. I have to work hard. \n\nIn conclusion, life gives you chances. Use them or lose them. Some people waste opportunities that others want. People want more, even with lots of money, they're unhappy. They need God. With God, you're happy, rich or poor. Life is about fighting, not quitting. Always try your best. Believe in yourself. Doing more leads to success. You need a purpose in life. Be with friends who encourage you to do right. Never give up. Be happy and work hard for your dreams. Remember, money isn't everything. Seek God before it's too late.

That magic is your mom, dad, teacher, sister, brother, or friend. They are always there to help you when you need it. So, when you have big choices to make, you should ask for advice from people who know a lot. They can help because they have lots of experience and know things well. Also, things go better and faster when more than one person helps out.\n\nFirst, people who know a lot have more experience than you. They were born before you and have lived through more things. They have been through the best and worst times, often much worse than what you've faced. For example, if you burn your French toast and start a kitchen fire, what do you do? Some people know how to fix it, but others don't. You might need to call the fire department or a parent. They would know how to stop the fire. But if you try to fix it and you've never done it before, you might not be able to stop the fire. Even if you know what to do, you could still mess up and make things worse. Solving problems takes experience, not just knowing things. If you know water puts out fire but pour it near electricity, you could make a big problem. The electricity could make the fire worse.\n\nNext, people who know a lot have studied things you haven't. For example, if you're stuck on English homework, you might ask a parent or teacher for help. They've learned about it and can teach you. But if you try to do it alone, it might take longer. You have other homework too, like math. Plus, you might make mistakes and get a bad grade.\n\nAlso, working with others is important for success. In class, you might work with a partner or a group. Working with others can be better than working alone. Alone, you only have your own ideas, which might be wrong. But with others, you get different ideas. This helps you think again and make better choices.\n\nIn conclusion, you should ask for advice from people who know a lot about life's big choices. They can give you the best advice. They've made mistakes and fixed them, so they know how to help you. They also know a lot, which won't go away when you need them. So don't be scared to ask for help. Plus, you won't feel alone when someone is there to talk and advise you. More than one person is stronger and better than one alone. Working alone can lead to more mistakes than working with others. So, asking for help and working with others will help you make good choices and face the toughest parts of life."}

If some group members are very smart, they can help others by explaining what the teacher said. It can also help people meet more people, learn where they came from, or what their life was like in their home country.\n\nComing up with new ideas can help people. When we work in groups, we feel more sure and supported. We can share our ideas with others. When we work in groups, we can get help and ideas about the work from others. Working together also teaches us to be patient, and being patient is important for group work.\n\nIn conclusion, working in groups is very important because it helps people learn more.

Is it better to always be busy, or is there a good reason to do nothing sometimes? I believe that we can do a lot if we are always busy. Let's think about what we can do if we keep busy. We can't just sit with our arms folded, waiting for things to happen on their own. If we sit around and do nothing, we won't get what we want. Having a goal is important. Everyone has a goal, and to reach it, you often have to work hard. For instance, I want to pass my SOLs. I know I won't pass if I don't try. So, I will try hard to pass. Another example is students wanting to graduate. They have to try hard to graduate. If you just wait for things to happen, they probably won't happen the way you want. This is because you didn't try. What will you do in life if you don't reach your goals? Will you not even try? Everyone has something they want to do. It might take time; things don't happen quickly. The more you do, the more successful you can be. I still think it's better to do more if we keep busy. It can help us as we grow older. Doing things can make us happy. Thomas Jefferson wrote about how much we can do if we are always busy. Don't you think he had goals before he died? He probably reached some goals because he tried hard. So why can't we do the same?"}

{"text_id": "287965E2FCB7", "output_essay": "Should people ask for advice from experts, or should they trust their own feelings and ideas? People can find out big things by themselves, but it is better to ask for advice from experts. People should ask experts because they know a lot about what matters in life, they have seen many different ways people live, and they have a lot of training and knowledge. \n\nFirst, people should ask experts for advice because they know about the important parts of life. For example, at school, counselors help students with their problems because they are the experts. They can suggest ways to fix the problem. Another example is when people see a psychiatrist because they find it hard to see the value of life. The psychiatrist helps them find their purpose or understand why they matter. Also, social workers help people by talking to them and showing them why life is important. Experts find new ways to help people. \n\nSecond, experts have always watched the different ways that people live. Experts can be in your family; if there is an older person at home, you can talk to them about important things in life. They have a lot of experience because they have lived for many years and may have seen many lifestyles. Experts talk to many people, so they know a lot about life and how people live. When an expert talks to people, they make them think about their lives. Experts get a lot of experience over time. \n\nThird, people should talk to an expert because they have a lot of training and knowledge. When experts go to school, they learn a lot that they can use to help others later. All experts study for a certain job, and they know a lot. But they get even more experience over time, which helps people more. At this point, the expert knows more about the problems people have in life. Experts have the knowledge to point you in the right direction and help you find something that gives you a purpose. Experts must be ready for their job; they have to study a lot. \n\nPeople should ask experts for advice because they know a lot about what matters in life, they have seen many ways people live, and they are well-trained and know a lot. People should talk to an expert first because they know how to solve problems, they have seen many tough situations, and they have a degree that shows they are ready to give advice about important things in life. In conclusion, for all these reasons, people should talk to an expert who can help them understand why life is important."}

It can cause harm, make people harm others, or lead to phone addiction and less social interaction. But some say it's good and can even be helpful. They think technology is good because it lets us do more, like pay bills, chat with family, and find our way to places. For instance, technology lets us do more. You don't have to drive far to pay bills, spend money on gas, and wait in line. You can just pay on your phone. Still, some like to go out, talk to others, and don't mind spending on gas. Also, finding a babysitter can be tough. Some have family to help, but others don't. They can look online to find someone they trust, so they don't have to worry. People can also keep in touch with family without traveling. They can video call, email, or use social media. This avoids car accidents, getting lost, or fights. It helps people stay close, even if they live far apart. Some families grow up together, others don't. There's no middle ground. What if you're new to driving and need to find your friends in another town? You can use your phone for directions. Some might use a map, which works well, but most use their phone.

{"text_id": "38FD642A3223", "output_essay": "I believe that working in a group is better than working alone. Group work has many good points. I have several reasons for thinking this. The first reason is that it makes us more efficient. This means that working in a group helps us manage our time better. We don't waste time and can solve problems quicker than if we were on our own. This is because we have more people to help and give us ideas when we run out. Even with hard tasks, a group can finish them quickly because everyone adds their knowledge and effort. My second reason is that group work makes solving problems easier. In a group, we have lots of different thoughts and ideas about a problem. When we put these ideas together, we can find better solutions. We can also learn new things from each other. This helps us see where we are not strong and lets us add more ideas. The third reason is that it helps us connect with people. It makes us talk to others more and ask good questions. We get more interested in how others in the group solved a problem. We also get better at talking to each other. And we don't ignore our work. Even if we want to quit, there is someone to encourage us to keep going and work on solutions together. So, I think working in a group is very important to make our world better. One person can't clean a whole football field by themselves. But if many people work together, we can clean the field quickly and be ready in time to use another field. So, I really think we should all work together."}
{"text_id": "D84B259E5355", "output_essay": "Asking for Help\n\nMany people choose on their own or ask experts for help before they decide. Those who choose on their own either gain from it or learn by facing the results. But, asking experts for help has helped a lot of people. People who get advice can avoid bad choices. Talking to someone with experience can help people know if their choice is smart.\n\nIt is smart for people to ask for help instead of just trusting their own feelings and thoughts. The reason asking for help is better is that experts have gone through things like what the person wants advice on. When people talk to an expert who knows the good and bad of the choice they want to make, it helps them see the decision like the expert does. Talking with someone who knows a lot can stop people from choosing something they are not sure about. When people don't know what will happen after they choose, they get mixed up about whether to go ahead with their plans, not knowing how it could change things for them.\n\nAsking an expert for help can stop bad choices. People are not always sure about what they want to do, so they might just go with the first idea they have. A while ago, a friend of mine thought about quitting high school in her last year. She really liked her idea and asked me what I thought. I did not know what was best for her, so I told her to talk to the school counselor. After she talked about her idea with the counselor, she saw that stress was making her want to quit. The counselor showed her that quitting would not be good for her future and said that getting a job that pays well without a diploma would be hard. Just by talking to someone who knows a lot, a bad choice can be stopped.\n\nEven though asking an expert for help can be good for many, some people like to choose on their own. Some people want their own experiences and learn from them, whether they are good or bad. They think that experiences are different and won't always end the same way. Another friend of mine also thought about quitting and did it without asking for expert advice. When she chose on her own, she knew it might not go well. Luckily, a few months later, she started her own makeup business and did well. She often thinks, \"What if I had not trusted my gut? Would I be where I am now?\" Like my friend, some people trust their own feelings, wanting to learn from or gain from their choices.\n\nIn the end, whether you choose on your own or ask for help, you will learn and gain from what you decide. Choosing on your own is not always good; sometimes things don't go as planned, or maybe they do, but you can never be sure. Asking an expert for help is a big plus for many because it can help them see their choice like the expert does. Talking to an expert can stop you from making a choice you are not sure about. Asking for help is not always a bad idea."}

For instance, if people think we can pick a job after middle school, why not go straight to college? Here's why not. Even if people believe students can pick a job, it's often not the case. High school is where we begin to understand life, love, and making errors. We need this time to be certain about our true desires. Young people at 15 and 16 should have great chances. Yet, they also need to go through high school. This step is important, and we shouldn't skip it. We don't focus on our future plans. For example, we don't list out job options. Instead, we list what we want to buy or what to do with friends tomorrow. We don't worry about doing something wrong in class until after it happens. We're not busy choosing our future jobs. We don't search for job choices. For instance, I don't look into jobs when I'm busy with 11th-grade homework. Pay attention to this: people think we know how to pick a job when we start high school. But choosing a job is a big decision. It can change your life. We're not ready for that choice yet. We focus on simple things, not other job paths. We don't always choose well. When we begin high school, we dream a lot. Some just want to have fun, stay up late, and compete over who is better or who has a better partner. We're young and learning. We make mistakes without thinking ahead. We're not ready to choose a job at 15 or 16. We shouldn't rush that choice. I don't agree with these expectations. Students shouldn't have to pick a job as they start high school. Even with expectations, everything takes time. Nothing should be rushed or delayed. We're not planning our futures yet. We're not searching for a job. We're not ready to make a solid choice. For these and many other reasons, I don't agree that students should pick a job by the time they start high school."}

If you stop working, someone else will work harder than you. Keep going because you love it and it motivates you. Don't listen to people who say you can't. You can. Keep going and you'll be a better person later on. The first reason I believe you should never quit is because of the future. You'll say, 'It was hard, but I did it.' In the future, you need a diploma for a good job. I will do everything to finish school and make my family proud. I learn every day to improve and achieve my goals. I love life and think moving forward is better than quitting. I've learned that if you work for what you want, you'll get it, no matter what others say. The second reason is my family. I will work hard for a good job to support them. My family works hard to give me a good life. They are always there when I need them. They will say, 'It was tough, but now you're a doctor.' I'm happy to be their daughter. Life wasn't easy back home in Generic_City, but now I'm in the U.S., getting ready for a better future. I'm here to achieve what I couldn't back home because they wouldn't let me. The third reason is money. Money is needed to buy things. But for me, it's important because many people can't afford food, clothes, or rent. When I came to the U.S., I had no clothes. Life was tough, and I was bullied in middle school because I didn't understand English. Then I focused on learning the language by watching videos every day. I earned a language diploma in 3 months. To conclude, I've shared what I'll do for my future and some personal stories. These are lessons I've learned. So please, never quit. Life is full of lessons. Life is great; don't let anyone control you. Don't be lazy, work hard. Remember, someone else is always working too. You can do it. If you're not, remember these lessons from my life."}

Working alone might seem better to students because they can focus more. But working in a group has its good points. Students should work in groups because they can think of more ideas, it helps them more, and they get to practice their English.\n\nFirst, students should work in groups because they can think of more ideas. When in a group, there are many people to come up with ideas. For example, in English class, if I can't think of a good idea for a project, my group can give me lots of good ideas. We can share these ideas and do great work on the project. I remember doing a podcast project in a group. We were good at sharing ideas and picking the best ones. Working in groups is a great way to think of ideas. We can talk about them and pick the best one. Teachers, you should let students work in groups. We have many people thinking of ideas, sharing them, and trying hard on projects.\n\nNext, students should work in groups because it helps them more. In groups, we get more help. There's usually a leader in the group. If someone doesn't get the topic, the leader can help. That's one way group work helps. Another way is that students can help a group member who needs it. If someone doesn't understand, they can stay after school with the group and get all the help they need to do well on projects. Also, students can learn important skills. Learning to work in a group is a skill that will help not just in school, but in life too.\n\nWorking in a group helps students learn a lot and get ready for the future.\n\nLastly, students should work in groups to practice their English. Teachers, we're learning English and need lots of help. When students work in a group, they talk to each other. This is good practice. They get better and feel more sure of themselves when speaking English. Some students don't talk in English to others because they're scared of making mistakes. But in a group, they'll feel braver and get to know people. In groups, students can practice writing, reading, speaking, and listening in English.\n\nI think being in groups is good because students practice these four skills more.\n\nIn conclusion,\n\nStudents should work in groups. This way, they can think of more ideas, it helps them more, and they get to practice their English. First, groups help come up with ideas and pick the best one. Next, group work is good for learning and getting ready for the future. Lastly, students in groups can practice writing, reading, speaking, and listening in English. Teachers, please let students work in groups. It will teach us how to work together and help us in life."}

Being in a group can push someone to try new things, improve talking skills, and learn about working together.\n\nBeing in a group can make someone more open to new experiences. Not everyone is social or likes new things. It can be scary to do things that make us uncomfortable. But a group can help us face our fears and try things we haven't before. In a group, we have to talk and interact, which can break down our fears. Groups make us feel less alone. We can be ourselves without worry of judgment.\n\nAlso, being in a group can make us better at talking to others. Talking has always been important, whether in person, on the phone, or online. In a group, we must talk to work and make friends. Talking to strangers can be hard, but it's necessary for jobs. Starting a conversation can be tough, but it gets easier with practice. By talking, we learn about others and find common ground. It's hard, but we must take the first step.\n\nLastly, good teamwork is key in a group. Work is shared, and everyone does their part. For those used to working alone, sharing tasks can be tough. It's hard to see things from others' views. But we must remember that others matter too. Teamwork teaches us patience and how to give up things for the group.\n\nSome think working alone is better because it teaches independence. But being independent doesn't mean we can't work with others. We can still be ourselves in a group. Being independent doesn't mean avoiding help from others. If we did, we'd miss out on what others can do and become selfish.\n\nIn conclusion, working in a group is good because it helps us talk better, be brave, and work well with others. To succeed in jobs and life, we need these skills. They help us see the good in life and learn from others and ourselves. Without trying new things, we stay stuck in our own fears."}
{"text_id": "C3D8BAA89C4F", "output_essay": "Albert Schweitzer, a thinker and doctor who helped people, once said, \"Setting an example is the only way to influence others.\" Is acting well the best way to change how others act, or are there better ways? Yes, there are other ways, like telling people to do good and helping them have a better future. For instance, if my friend is doing something bad, I won't let her because I care. By acting right, I show her and others how to be good. If I let her do bad things, it means I don't care about her or what others think of her family. People might think her family is bad, but often, bad influences come from outside the home, like the streets, school, or friends who don't want you to succeed. By being a good example, I help others, especially kids. They will grow up to be good and teach others too. This way, we encourage good actions in ourselves and towards others. Some people only want to look good for themselves and don't mind if they are bad for others, even kids. These days, many have stopped trying to be good. Bad influences are everywhere, and some people will try to pull you down because they are not happy and don't want you to be either. My mom says this often. But if we all try to be good for ourselves and others, we can make things better. Schweitzer was right when he said setting an example is the only way to influence. Good examples help you and others. Sometimes, bad examples are useful because they teach us who to trust. We learn from our mistakes and avoid bad influences next time. But can we trust ourselves? Can we resist our own bad ideas? To stop being bad for ourselves, we must see the good in everything. Take school, for example. Not everyone loves it, but we keep going because it leads to college and then to a job we want without too much effort and with good pay. If we skip school and college, we might end up in a job we dislike that doesn't pay well. So, stay positive, surround yourself with good people, and you'll reach your goals. Like those who dream of traveling, I know that good behavior and listening to my parents will help me get there. Good influences push you to do your best and support you. They won't let you give up on yourself."}

I say this because now, when someone tries to help another person with a big choice, it's often because they are nosy or want to meddle. Some people decide for themselves because they don't want others to know about their lives. As for me, I would let someone else decide for me if they knew more about what I need to do.

The club is open to all students who need help with their homework or with understanding things in subjects like Math, Science, English, and History. The club will help with these subjects.\n\nThe club is also good for students who don't focus in class. Sometimes, students are distracted by friends or toys they bring to school.

When I was in a very bad relationship with a harmful person, I felt very sad and let down. I thought I would never get out of that tough spot, but an expert helped me. People with experience can help us with big life issues too. For example, my mom and my best friend helped me get over my sleep problems. First, it's important to talk to an expert when you're having trouble. An expert won't hurt you; they can make you feel better. I was dating a guy from far away. At first, he was great. He worked hard to make me love him because I didn't want a long-distance relationship. He liked me from my online videos and photos. He said he'd do anything for me if I became his girlfriend. He even flew to the U.S. from his city to see me. I met him because he really wanted to. He rented a fancy car and got a room in a very expensive and nice hotel to impress me. But I didn't care about money. When I met him, I started to like him. Then I thought about him a lot. Suddenly, he started acting differently, and I got very depressed. I was so upset. I didn't know what to do. One day, I talked to my teacher. She knew a lot. She told me to focus on school until I got my college degree. She told me to forget him. She really helped me in that tough time. She helped me make a big decision. Second, people with experience can really help with big life issues. I couldn't sleep for months. I didn't want to tell my family or friends. One day, my friend noticed I looked very tired. I told her I couldn't sleep. She knew what to do. She told me some ways and things to try. When I did what she said, I could sleep again. Also, older people can give great advice, like parents, older brothers or sisters, and teachers. They've been around for a long time. They should know about our tough times so they can help. They've seen a lot of what people go through. They've been through a lot themselves. So, I really think people should talk to an expert, someone with experience, and an older person when they're in trouble, like I was. I was lost and didn't know what to do. I asked my counselor for help. She gave me advice about the relationship; she changed my life. From that day, I focus on my schoolwork.

Also, when you help people in need, no matter the size of your help, you bring them joy and feel it too. These acts can fill your life with joy as they do for others. Even though being busy is good, we also need time to relax, to be free, and have no duties. Everyone needs a break from their routine sometimes. Doing nothing can be good for us too. For example, we all want to feel free, but duties often mean we can't always have time for ourselves. This can make us stressed and even annoyed. Taking a break can help us feel better. From what I've written, I think both being busy and taking breaks can be good for us. I lean towards being active, but we need to balance it. Whether we do big or small good things and have responsibilities, we can't forget about ourselves. We need to find a balance to make others happy, help them, and also feel free and happy ourselves. Being active and taking breaks at the same time is good for us and brings us joy."}

{"text_id": "226D3E32B7D0", "output_essay": "I believe that when Albert Einstein said, \"Imagination is more important than knowledge,\" he meant that you don't have to be super smart to know everything. Imagination lets you think in new ways, about things you never considered before. Imagination is better than knowledge. Without it, you would be someone who knows a lot but can't think of new ideas in what you say or do.\n\nImagination lets you think in new ways. For instance, if you're doing homework and can't remember a formula, your imagination might help you think of a way to remember it, like with a song. Knowing things has good and bad points. A good point is that you can know answers fast and say them out loud. A bad point is that thinking too hard can make your head hurt.\n\nSteve Jobs, who started Apple, left high school early. He had some knowledge and lots of imagination. He made iPhones, which were a big hit and made him successful. Albert Einstein wasn't seen as smart when he was young and was teased for it. But he didn't let that stop him. He became a great scientist and got a Ph.D. in Physics. Imagination can help you in ways you might not realize, like if you're stressed, it can help you think of something else to relax and see things differently.\n\nIn conclusion, you need imagination to think in new ways.

{"text_id": "33B5A70B7B4B", "output_essay": "Some people think that 'true self-esteem' comes from praise. Others believe it comes from doing well in tasks. I think that 'true self-esteem' comes from doing well, and I will explain why. When someone does something rare, they feel good about themselves. They know they did something special. This makes them feel better about themselves and more important than others. True self-esteem is not something you are born with. Some people think this. But I think true self-esteem comes from doing well and winning. This is what I believe, and I will tell you why.\n\nFirst, I will talk about why I think true self-esteem comes from doing well. I think that when you do something not many people can, it makes you feel more confident. For example, if two people are climbing the highest mountain and one gives up, he will feel bad. His self-esteem will go down because he lost. But the person who keeps going and reaches the top will feel great. His self-esteem will go up. He will be very proud because he did something hard that others give up on. He will talk about his success all day because doing well is important for a good life.\n\nAnother reason I believe this is that I think students don't need to be confident to learn. Learning is about wanting to know more and liking the topic. This means that students can learn well even if they are not confident, as long as they like what they are learning. If the topic is boring, they won't learn. They will think about other things. Young people like teachers who are lively and interesting. If the teacher is boring, they won't listen.\n\nThis also supports my belief that true self-esteem comes from doing well. How? If a teacher is boring and students don't listen, they will probably fail the test. Then they will get bad grades, feel sad, think they are not smart, lose confidence, and their self-esteem will go down. But if the teacher is fun and the topic is interesting, students will listen. They will do well on the test. Their grades will get better, they will be happier, pay more attention, pass more tests, do well more often, and their self-esteem will grow.\n\nSome people think that 'true self-esteem' comes from being praised. But I think it comes from doing well. I have explained why true self-esteem comes from success. I gave examples like not quitting and doing better than others. I also talked about students learning about things they like. I shared my reasons, and I hope you understand my point of view. I hope you liked my essay. I worked hard on it. Here's a last example: If I pass this test, I will be happy. That will make my self-esteem go up because passing is the success I want."}
{"text_id": "2D07CFE4B821", "output_essay": "People who like to depend on themselves do things alone. They don't need to ask others before they make plans. Many think nature is a great place to live, so they don't rely on others. Believing you can do everything by yourself is called self-reliance. It lets people work alone and learn from what happens to them. They understand life better this way. But self-reliance is also natural. We can believe in 'God' without going to church. People just try to do what's right and be good. First, those who like self-reliance do their own work. They are not just trying to make themselves happy. They learn from their successes and mistakes. Nature is a place where they can be happy and not worry. They think they are doing the right thing. People who want to do everything alone practice self-reliance. Second, only people who like to do things alone really practice self-reliance. They feel sure about what they can do and don't trust others. They think others might make them choose badly. So, they believe in themselves and don't let anyone distract them. They focus on themselves because they think that's the best way to be happy. Third, I think these people should be right in what they do. But they also learn when they make mistakes. Then, they try to improve by learning from these mistakes. Also, I think self-reliance fits those who always do things alone and trust their skills. But it would be better if they asked experts before doing something. They could get new ideas, which would help. When people ask experts, they can do things better. They are more ready for it. People can be shown how to do things the right way. If people don't ask experts, that's okay. They just want to be happy doing what they like. If they do see an expert, they should have some idea of what they need. It's good to see an expert because they can tell you what to do in tough situations. But if you don't, that's okay too. You just want to be happy, feel sure, and not trust others who might lead you wrong. Finally, self-reliance is mostly about nature and being your own person. Some people think doing things alone makes life easier. They want to be as happy as possible. Self-reliance includes nature, where people can find joy. Nature is very beautiful. So, people who like self-reliance think you can believe in 'God' without church. Just be sure you're doing right and not hurting anyone. This is a good way to be your own person and keep your beliefs. Many think self-reliance is key because you can be yourself. Choose what makes you happy and be your own person. Others can't lead you wrong then. You should do what's best for you and others. In the end, people who like self-reliance and being their own person have a great chance to do this. They can share their ideas and wishes to be very happy. You rely on yourself. People who believe in self-reliance think nature is the best place to find happiness. You can find God there. You don't need church to find God. He's everywhere. Just do right and don't harm others so they can't harm you. I think people who rely on themselves would do even better if they saw an expert before acting. It would make them more ready to do what they like. It would also prepare them for any problems. Seeing an expert is best because you can do everything right. An expert can guide you. They give you tips on how to handle tough times. But if you prefer to go alone, that's fine. It makes you happy and you feel you can do what's best for you."}

Kids will hear this and do the same when it's their turn. Acting better helps kids choose better. For example, if someone crosses the street without looking and gets hurt, kids will see the mistake and remember to look both ways next time.

They could help them finish their homework by explaining things. Sometimes students don't hand in homework because they don't understand it. Patient explanations from teachers could change this. They might stop looking for answers online. The club could also give out snacks. Everyone is hungry after school! Students who work hard deserve a little treat. Homework is exhausting. I know students who get 3 to 4 hours of homework a day. That's a lot. Students need time for themselves too. We could do homework in the park to make it more relaxing. Students would like the change from the usual school setting. Doing homework in a new place could make them more eager to work. If homework is done in a fun place, it could be enjoyable. Having motivation and sharing it could make the club more willing to try new things. Students can show they are responsible! Activities like this will make the clubs more interesting and help students get better through motivation. There are many ways to get people to do their homework. Having teachers and students help will make a big difference. With lots of homework but also great activities and fun ways to learn, it will all get easier.

Big kids may know more, but not always. Sometimes little kids study more and know more. But what big kids learn is usually harder than what's in elementary school. There is always a big kid in middle school, high school, or college who can help a little kid who needs it. Kids in elementary or middle school think about going to college. College students can tell them how to save money or suggest cheap colleges. Many colleges are far away, and you might have to leave home. College costs a lot of money and saving takes time.

{"text_id": "45A7755F4F43", "output_essay": "People have learned from their own actions for many years. This helps them teach and affect others. But I think that giving examples is not the only way we can learn. We have many ways to learn. We can learn from everything that happens to us, the good and the bad. If we do something wrong, like stealing or trespassing, we can get into trouble. We might go to jail. In jail, we can decide to be better people. Schools should take students on trips to see the worst parts of cities. They will see where drugs are sold, where there is a lot of crime, dirty streets, and homeless people. This will show them what could happen if they don't work hard in school. They will want to do better in school because we can change our thoughts. Seeing people in bad situations, with crime around them and no police help, will make students think about their future. They will want to avoid living like that. I think we can change our lives in many ways. For example, going to jail for a small crime can make us want to improve. Jail can be a place where people decide to make better choices. Some prisoners can go to school while in jail. This helps them when they get out. They don't want to waste their chance to be free. They learn that crime is not a good way to live. That's why jail can be a place that changes people. Another way to change people is by having programs with people who are missing arms or legs. They still do many things and don't always need help. This teaches us to be grateful for our bodies. We should not complain. We can work and live well, even if we are missing a part of our body. People with disabilities can work without complaining. So, we should too. Life actions are not the only way to change people. Many things can change a person's life. Getting in trouble with the law can change us.

Self-esteem helps us feel strong and sure of ourselves. But how do we get it? Some think that kind words can build self-esteem. But really, doing well and achieving things is what builds it. This is because it shows what we can do and pushes us to try harder. \n\nSelf-esteem comes from doing well because it shows what we can do. For instance, my little sister, Generic_Name, likes science. She was in her school's science fair and came fifth. She felt bad and doubted herself. Her teachers tried to make her feel better, but she didn't listen much. The next year, she worked really hard on a volcano project. She read a lot and made a big volcano model. She came second and went to the next level. After that, she wanted to try even harder things. Some students from UVA found that when students do something they want, they feel more sure of themselves. They try new things and often do well. Doing well is what really shows us what we can do. \n\nSelf-esteem also comes from doing well because it makes us want to work hard. Like this one time in chemistry, we played a game called Kahoot to get ready for a test. I was winning and everyone was saying nice things about me. I got too happy and stopped trying as hard. I did worse and came ninth. The next time, I just focused and won with a high score. In 2014, some UCLA students were in a study. They took an easy test and were split into two groups. One group got a lot of praise and the other didn't. The next week, they all took a harder test. The group that didn't get praise before did 40% better. The praised group did 30% worse. Like me, the praised group didn't try as hard after getting praise. But the other group really wanted to do better. When we do well, we feel better about ourselves and want to keep working hard. \n\nDoing well is the real way to feel good about ourselves. It shows what we can do and makes us want to keep trying. Some people think saying nice things about our work can help, even if it's not our best. But this can make us not want to try harder.

If the world were idle, nothing would get done, and no one would achieve anything.\n\nIt is great how much we can achieve if we keep active. We get more done if we are always busy with something. Getting things done is very important, and that's why people should try hard to do it. Some people don't care, but others do."}

Directing and editing videos would be enjoyable but also hard work. I want to meet Cole Bennett because I think he is one of the top 5 directors and editors in the world, even though others are good too, like louisknows.

His most-watched video has about 200 million views. But being a director is tough. You need to go to college, get a degree, find people to work with, and get noticed. I believe many skilled directors and editors don't get enough praise. They should because they need to be creative, make new things, and spend time making videos. I would like to be a director, but I have other career plans too. Being a director is my backup, like my third choice. My main goals are to be an artist or a sports player (NFL or NBA)."}

They believe it's key to know what matters in their lives, to follow their own thoughts, and to know what they need. Some say that relying on yourself means being true to who you are. Others think we need help to make our own choices. People who choose for themselves are ready for life. They understand what life means to them because they are strong, stand on their own, and are sure about what they do.\n\nFirst, people who choose for themselves can shape their future. They are strong enough to make it happen. For example, when I came to America, my mother said we were here for my education. She told me to do what I must to improve and see how I could help my family back in Africa. Being strong is hard, especially now when people can hurt others online without seeing the real damage.\n\nSecond, when you make your own choices, you are also on your own. You decide everything by yourself, every day, without help. Not everyone can do this. People who are on their own know it's tough and work hard to get better every day. For me, being on my own is not easy. I work hard at it every day. My father always said I must be on my own and do my own thing. He said no one will always be there to help or give advice when I need it. I must try my best to improve and make my future important.\n\nThird, to be strong and on your own, you must also be sure of yourself first. You can't do all this without being sure and believing in yourself that you can do what you want. Being sure of yourself is not easy. For example, back in my country, I was always the top student because I was so sure of myself. I liked learning, was always curious, and worked hard every day to get good grades, which made my parents happy.\n\nSome say that being strong, on your own, and sure of yourself is something you can do without help. They think you can handle your life and work every day on your own. But in truth, many don't think relying on yourself is important. This means those who are strong, on their own, and sure of themselves are really tough. They work so hard they do it without help or advice, often thinking about their future. People should think about relying on themselves and their future. They should work hard on their own so that later they can be strong, on their own, and sure of themselves with their own work and thoughts."}

It's like if you haven't gotten good at something you've had for a long time, you won't get anything big in your life. You need to get good at what you have now to be great later. I'll give an example from my time in high school. I had a geometry class, and I was really bad at it. I always thought about what would happen if I failed. I knew I needed to get good at that class. If I didn't, I wouldn't finish high school, and I wouldn't get a good job. It's the same for everyone; we must get better at what is hard to have a good future. This writer tells us we need to get good at everything in our lives to be great later on.\n\nI think Ralph Waldo Emerson knew about what he wrote from his own life. I believe every writer talks about things they've been through. That's why he writes about 'getting good' at things. We are the ones who need to get better. We must win in our lives to improve. Not all experiences people have are good. They fall, but they stand up quickly. Those who stand up fast are stronger and always get better. They have lots of experience. We should be like them."}

It's important to be interested in a job early and to have clear ideas. If we wait too long to think about what we want, it might not happen. Also, if we don't think about a job early, it could be too late. If students don't use the chances high school gives them, they might not start working towards the job they want. \n\nPicking a job early can be good. It might be the smartest choice because it makes students care and work hard for that job. This can shape their future. Students should grab every chance they get. This can help them in their future jobs. Thinking about a job early has no bad sides. It gives students a way to shape their future and have a good life for themselves and their families later on. \n\nWhen making plans, students should think about their safety and their family's well-being. It's important to work hard to make our parents proud. We shouldn't make them feel like they wasted money on our education. Having clear plans can help people pick their jobs. Making choices on time can give our families a better life. They will have health care, food, and other important things. It also stops problems at school by making sure we get a good education. \n\nHaving a good job makes our families feel safe. They know they will have a home and health care. A job can also make our children want to go to high school and college and finish like we did. For these reasons, we should think about a job early and not miss chances because we think we can't do it. If we don't try, we won't become important in life. \n\nTrying to be successful by planning what we want is the best way.

Being self-reliant means using your own thinking to solve problems at any time.\n\nFirst, self-reliant people are better at handling things than those who need help. They think on their own and don't need others to think for them. They can fix their own problems and find answers. They make choices every day, like walking their dogs, watching TV, buying stuff, eating out, and seeing family and friends. For instance, I choose to play soccer with friends and walk to clear my mind. Sometimes, I make choices for my little brother, like telling him to stop playing games and do his homework. He's too young to make big decisions.\n\nSecond, self-reliant people use their own thinking to solve problems in any situation. They know what to do in most cases. Solving problems is easy for them because they rely on their own thoughts and don't need others. For example, when I had a math test, I studied on my own. I didn't ask friends for help. I trusted myself to know the material, and I passed with a good score. This made me more self-reliant.\n\nLastly, people who rely on themselves make smart choices and work towards their goals. Some people let others decide for them, but it's better to make your own choices. Then you follow your own plan, not someone else's. For example, I was asked to write a story.

If young people don't pick a job early, it's better for them. It's a bad idea for them to choose a job early because they can get mixed up, they might not think it through, and they need to get ready. Some people say young people should pick a job early to get experience. But they are wrong. Young people can find out more about different jobs and what they really want. It's clear they need to get ready to study for a job. First, it's a bad idea for young people to pick a job early because they can get mixed up. For example, Generic_Name was learning for a Science job but changed to another because he didn't get science. He wasted two years on a job he didn't like. Also, Generic_Name thought the job was easy, but he was wrong, and he quit the next day. Young people need to understand the job before they choose. Next, it's a bad idea because young people can't think it through. For instance, Generic_Name wanted to study law but knew nothing about it and just joked around. That's not good. He didn't want to study, but his mom did. So he chose a job he thought he couldn't fail at and then left school. Young people need to think about their future, not be lazy. Last, it's a bad idea because they need to get ready. For example, Generic_Name is a junior in high school with enough credits for a diploma. But he needs to finish school the normal way to get the experience colleges want. He lived in a place where the final test wasn't important. Then he moved to a place where it was, but he failed all the tests and had to take his classes again. No college will take him because he failed and got bad grades. In conclusion, it's a bad idea for young people to pick a job early. They don't think clearly, can't be serious, and aren't ready. These three reasons show why it's a bad idea. People need to know how important learning and having a job is. Schools should look at how students are doing."}
{"text_id": "0C164408ED84", "output_essay": "Dear School Board,\n\nMy name is Generic_Name, and I go to Generic_School. I've heard you want to make the school day longer, and I'm worried about how the students will handle it. I know you want to add one and a half hours to our day, but I think this will be bad for us. Students who do things after school will have less time for homework and might miss some of it. Many students could feel overwhelmed with too much to learn every day. This could make them fall behind and get stressed out from trying to keep up with school and other things they do each day.\n\nFor example, students in sports or clubs might not get their homework done because they have less time. Being in school for over eight hours and then doing these activities could cause problems. They won't have as much time to work on homework, which could make their grades go down. Students also like to have free time to be with their families or friends, but they won't have much time to make plans if they're always busy. Not enough free time could make a student rush to finish assignments, which could make them lose sleep. Not sleeping enough could make it hard to focus and stay awake in school. A student shouldn't have to feel stressed or struggle to find time for daily things. This could make a bad setting for both students and the people who work at the school.\n\nAlso, students might feel pushed to learn too much, which could make their grades suffer. Our school's research says that when school days are longer, lessons go up by 78% all over the world. Teachers might add an extra lesson each day, which could be too much for students. If they learn too much in one day, they might not understand it all and fall behind. If they start to fall behind, catching up could be hard. This could stress them out. Teachers might have trouble too if students can't keep up, and it could mess up their teaching plans. This could make the school disorganized because no class would be on track.\n\nIn the same way, students and teachers would feel more stressed trying to balance unfinished work and other daily things. Teachers might have a hard time planning lessons, grading, and having personal time. Students might struggle to hang out with family, finish schoolwork, and go to activities. This could stress them out and make them think about quitting a sport or club. Teachers could also have a hard time. They might have to keep teaching new things without helping students who are lost. Students and teachers shouldn't have to choose between helping or moving on. This could make students' grades drop and leave some without the help they need.\n\nIn conclusion, adding one and a half hours to the school day would hurt both students and teachers. Students in sports or clubs would have less time for homework, everyone would be overwhelmed with too much to learn, and it would be harder to balance school and free time. This would create a bad environment for everyone at school. No one should have to stress about a longer school day. I hope you think about what I've said for the good of the students.\n\nSincerely,\n\nGeneric_Name\n\nGeneric_School"}

To keep kids coming back, we should give them gifts and prizes. \n\nIn the end, this after-school program is the best way for students to do well. It offers all the help they need and gives prizes. Students can get much better and make their parents proud by going to this program. They won't feel uncomfortable in after-school programs anymore because they can sit on bean bags.

People should choose for themselves because they can become more confident, they can be happier, and they can deal with hard times in life.\n\nFirst, people should choose for themselves to become more confident. If people are confident, they can learn and do things alone. For instance, someone might try to choose for me something I don't like, but I shouldn't listen. I should be brave and choose for myself without help. Also, my friends might try to pick my classes, but if I am confident, I can pick the classes I want. No one can control my life. It's better for people to choose for themselves to become more confident.\n\nSecond, people should choose for themselves to be happier. If others choose for me, I won't be happy because they don't know what I like or dislike. For example, if my family picks something I don't like, I should say it won't make me happy. Also, some people might not want others to be happy, but they shouldn't let them control their lives. It's better for people to choose for themselves to be happier.\n\nThird, people should choose for themselves to deal with hard times. Facing hard times can make us stronger. For example, if I make a choice that is not good, I can learn from it. If people do something and don't like it, they should learn how to get through the hard time. Also, this year I took hard classes and did badly at first. But, I changed the class after getting bad grades. It's better for people to choose for themselves to deal with hard times.\n\nIn conclusion, people should choose for themselves to become more confident, be happier, and deal with hard times. First, they can become more confident to do things alone. Second, they can be happier if they make choices that make them happy. Third, if they make a bad choice, they can learn from it. For these reasons, it's better for people to choose for themselves."}

{"text_id": "707127A44212", "output_essay": "The school board wants to make each school day one and a half hours longer. I am a student, and I strongly disagree for a few reasons. It would make people stressed, it's not clear what we would do with the extra time, and it could make us very tired. \n\nMy first point is easy to understand: after a long day, teachers and students just want to go home. If we add one and a half hours, everyone will likely feel more stressed because they can't leave at the normal time. Parents might also be stressed since their children will still be at school instead of at home with them. \n\nMy second point is about not knowing what to do with more time. Teachers plan lessons for the current class length. More time is hard to fill because they don't have plans for it. A normal school day works well because it's already set up. But with extra time, it's not clear what to do. \n\nMy last point is about being tired. After a long day, students are already tired. With more school time, they might forget their homework because they need rest. This could make good students get worse grades and start failing. But with the usual school day, they won't be as tired. Good students will stay good, and those who need to get better probably will. \n\nIn the end, a shorter school day that teaches well is better than just having more time. Students and teachers need time with family and to relax, which they get from normal school days. A longer school day could mean less family time and more stress. So, normal school days are better than longer ones."}

I believe that using technology to meet our needs stops us from showing what we can do to the world around us. There are three ways technology impacts our lives: our minds, making money, and stopping us from discovering our surroundings.\n\nShopping online is changing how money is made. People are using sites like Amazon, eBay, and Wish more and more. This shift is hurting malls and small shops. Now, more people shop online, and the number of jobs in stores is going down by eighty-five percent. For example, I worked at a Nike store, but it got less busy, and I think it's because of Amazon. This change also hurts the workers because they are losing jobs they worked hard to get. So, we should shop at stores.\n\nNot talking to others can hurt our minds. Mental problems can come from things like playing games, which might damage the brain. Using technology too much can even lead to cancer, linked to brain damage. Also, video games can hurt our eyes. I love games, but they made my eyes worse. My doctor gave me glasses. Instead, we should go outside and play sports to avoid these problems.\n\nNot visiting the library and getting books online stops us from exploring. Libraries are places where people meet, talk, and share ideas. I work at a library, and people get books online without knowing about our events. It's the same with museums. People don't go to museums; they learn about history online. But we should visit museums. Seeing historic places on a phone is not the same as being there.\n\nIn summary, technology stops us from using our skills for personal growth, making money, and exploring to help our community. Also, online stores like Amazon are taking over what malls used to earn. People who don't communicate might face many health issues, like eye problems and cancer. Electronics can't replace seeing real museums or traveling, so it's important to go out and explore. We need human contact in our lives because technology is taking over."}
{"text_id": "987A62FA9CDB", "output_essay": "Do you think it's good or bad to make the school day longer? I think it's a bad idea to make the school day longer because students will have less time at home, and it will be too much for them to learn in one day. Students should not be in school for more than seven hours. If they are, they won't have time to relax at home. For example, if students are in school for six to seven hours, they will have seven to eight hours or more to relax at home. But if we add one and a half hours to the school day, they will have only six hours to relax at home before they have to come back to school. Also, students will have less time to do their homework. If they don't finish it, they might get in trouble. They might have to do homework during lunch or stay after school. They will also have less time with their families.

Another problem is that students might fall asleep in class because they are bored or tired. If we make the school day one and a half hours longer, students might sleep in and be late to school. Teachers won't like that. The school board should not make the school day one and a half hours longer. It will cut down on students' time at home and make it hard for us to learn so much at school. So, students should not have too much schoolwork. If they do, they might forget everything and could fail a grade, a test, a class, or even an SOL."}

It is useful for lots of things. Many people have family in other countries. They talk to them using technology. Technology helps people at work and helps students with schoolwork. We have phones, computers, tablets, and more because of it. People don't need to watch TV to learn the news. Students don't have to wait for TV to tell them if school is closed. Most students have phones. Schools can text students or parents at night about the next day. This is how technology is good for us. It gives us information when we need it. Students look up help on their phones when they need it. Technology is good if we use it for the right things and in the right way.\n\nTechnology is helpful when we use it right. Using a phone or computer is very helpful for many things. But sometimes it's not. That's why we must use technology in a smart way."}

{"text_id": "AE9542EB602D", "output_essay": "Do kids need to stay after school for homework and trouble with schoolwork? Research shows that staying after school for teacher help can make students do better. I think students should stay after school for help. They can get to know teachers, learn better, and understand their lessons more. They can also get ready for tests. First, students can get extra help from teachers. If some kids can't pay attention in class, they can focus better after school without any noise. Teachers can do their own work too, like checking homework, putting grades into the computer, or sending things they need to. Students who are not doing well in school could do great if they tried harder. Just by staying after school for a few weeks, they can become top students. Also, students who don't talk to their teachers can start to know them. There's always a quiet student with bad grades in every class. They don't finish work on time, don't hand in homework, and get poor marks on tests. They can talk to the teacher alone, or the teacher can talk to them about how to get better grades. Teachers are people who help you with your future, but you need to work hard for a good future. Lastly, students can stay after school to study for a big test or the final exam. For example, if you failed math in fifth grade but passed in sixth grade because you stayed after school with your teacher, keep doing it every year to get better at tests. If you do well in advanced math, keep studying at home. Teachers are there to help with tests. In the end, I think we should have a homework club after school. It helps students with homework or tests and lets them meet other kids who are having a hard time. It gives extra practice to those who need it. Some kids might feel shy about going to the homework club because of bad grades. But, this club can make them better at learning. Will joining this club help students pass their tests and classes? I think it will."}

When you do something well, you might get a reward. This makes you want to do even better next time. Doing things shows you can handle tasks without doubting yourself. It can also lead to better chances to do more important things. This proves you are skilled. Finishing tasks can lead to more good things. It doesn't matter if the result is good or bad; you learn from it. This can inspire others to believe they can do it too. It also builds your confidence to take on more tasks. Doing more helps you get better at things. For example, if you finish a job, you'll feel ready to take on another. If you never try, you won't know what you could have done. One success can open the door to more chances. For instance, if you do well, you might get to do more important tasks. Feeling that you've completed something can be a big relief. Some people avoid finishing tasks. But in the end, it might have been worth it. We shouldn't think too hard about this. One thing can lead to another and change everything around you.

We can play games or shop online. But it also makes us stay away from each other. Technology changes us in many ways.\n\nSometimes, people stay away from their family because of technology. For example, my cousin always played video games. He did nothing else. His family was worried, but he didn't talk to them. Once, when they were out, he called them. They were at the hospital. His grandmother was very sick, but he didn't know because he was too busy with his games. There's another sad story. A friend of mine stayed in his room a lot. His family saw but thought he was just using his computer. He took his own life at 16 because others at school were mean to him. Technology can make us ignore our family.\n\nFriends are important, but technology doesn't help us get closer to them. I used to play a game called Call of Duty. I had friends in the game, but I never met them for real. I stopped seeing my real-life school friends. When I sold my computer, I tried to reconnect with them, but some were not there for me anymore. I had stayed away too long. Another time, my friends and I played soccer. We were good and practiced twice a week. Then a new game came out. We played it a lot, every day after school. We missed practices and got worse at soccer. Our families hoped we would win a tournament, but we didn't because we skipped practice for the game. Games can hurt friendships and lives.\n\nWe are ignoring other people and our planet. We don't take care of things because of technology. For example, sea animals are dying. We don't recycle and throw trash in the ocean. Fish and turtles are dying. We don't talk to each other or see what's happening. We just stay home with our gadgets and don't care. Also, food companies make our food easy to buy. But they don't care about nature. They use machines that hurt our world. Nature suffers a lot, and we don't notice.\n\nTechnology helps us, but it also keeps us apart. It makes us feel alone from our family, friends, and nature. Families break because kids focus on games and not their parents. Friendships end because kids don't play outside. The earth is hurt by things like dying sea animals and harmful companies. We don't see it because we don't look outside. Technology makes us ignore each other and the world. It changes us, and not in a good way. We all should try to change."}

One reason is that students can finish their work because there would be more time. They wouldn't have to hurry through their tasks. They would have an extra hour to finish, and that's why I think a longer school day would help students. Another reason is they could do their homework at school and have free time at home. Sometimes, teachers give so much homework that students spend all day on it at home and can't relax or do other things. That's why a longer school day would help students. A very important reason is that some students don't like being at home because it's dull or for other reasons.

I really believe a longer school day would help all students and they would be okay with it. Students may not like school, but they don't like being at home either. If the school can offer something students like and that helps them, they will be fine with it. It's okay if we add more hours to the school day. School is not just for fun; it's for learning.

Taking a break at the right time can make you do better work and improve what you make. Not just workers need breaks. Everyone does, even students. High school students have a lot of stress from clubs, classes, and friends. The best way for them to relax might be to dream and imagine for an hour at school. Young people can imagine things easily.

They need to move around and do different things. They need to fill their minds with different things, not just schoolwork.\n\nStudents also have work to do at home besides schoolwork. If they don't get home early, they can't do these jobs. Some jobs at home are washing clothes, mowing the lawn, cleaning, and throwing out the garbage. School times don't fit with these jobs.\n\nWhen parents or brothers and sisters are sick, students need to get home early to help take care of them. Worrying about their family can be too much and can make it hard for them to think about schoolwork.\n\nThese are just some reasons. I think students often have more important things to do at home than at school, especially if they don't have a mom or dad. That's why I believe students should not get home late. What if one of their brothers or sisters is very sick and they don't know about it?"}

It can make them enjoy going out less, make it hard for them to do everyday things, and might cause mental health problems if they do too much online. Some people use their phone, computer, and tablet all day. If they do this, they might not go outside much. This can make them not want to be with others, have trouble sleeping, or put on weight. Often, people who use technology a lot forget to do simple things like cook, clean, or take care of themselves. Too much time alone with technology can make someone feel very anxious around others. It can also make them feel very sad if they are alone all day. Technology can be bad for everyone because some people use it too much without knowing when to stop."}
{"text_id": "3D73663FE12D", "output_essay": "I believe that working in a group is better than working alone. This is because in a group, we can share ideas since everyone thinks differently. It's important to work with others, work alone, and talk to our favorite teacher. When we work with others, we can help each other. Sharing ideas is very helpful and can support others. Working alone lets us think for ourselves and take good advice from others. Young people can do well and have a better future. When students have a favorite teacher, that teacher can help us with anything we need and we can trust them. Teachers just want their students to do well.\n\nWorking in a group lets us help each other. This is very important because sometimes we face hard times at work or have problems. Some people give up when they can't find a solution. But with support from others, it's easier to solve problems. For example, when people build something, they work together because there's a lot of work and they need help with different things. Also, when someone wants to start a career, they often ask their parents for help, like buying books or paying for college. These are reasons why working in a group is a good idea.\n\nWorking alone lets us focus better. When we work alone, no one interrupts us and we can finish our work faster. For instance, students doing homework alone can work harder because it's quiet. Students can learn more and prepare for a successful future. Also, if we work and our boss yells at us, if we have our own job, we can be the boss and no one will yell at us. It's better to work alone sometimes. Plus, working by ourselves can make our minds stronger.\n\nTalking to our favorite teacher is good because we can promise to be on time for class. When we have a favorite teacher, it's easier to ask for help or for another chance, like redoing a test. We can promise to study harder, pay more attention in class, or stay late to finish work. Another example is when our parents won't let us go out unless we do our homework or get good grades. Having a favorite teacher can give us chances to solve problems.\n\nThese are some reasons why I think working together, working alone, and having a favorite teacher are all helpful. Working with others lets us meet new people and hear what they think. Working alone shows us that we can get better and think more deeply. Having a favorite teacher can give us more advice on chances we have. All of these things are valuable."}

I believe the after-school homework club is a good way to help students. It gives a quiet place for students to do their homework. If they need help, they can stay after school in the homework club. Teachers and students are there to help them.\n\nFirst, students need a quiet place to do their homework. They need a place to work without other things getting in the way. At home, many things can distract them after school. It's easy to not pay attention. In the homework club, they can focus on their work without being bothered. They can also finish their homework early. Then they can go home without any homework left. So, if you really need a quiet place to do your homework early, the homework club is a good choice.\n\nSecond, students sometimes need help with school. In the after-school homework club, students can get help from teachers and other students. For example, if they did not do well on a test, they can get extra help from a teacher. This helps them understand the material better. It can make their grades better. If students did not get the lesson in school, the teacher can teach it again at the club. With this help, students can do much better than before.\n\nFinally, I truly think the after-school homework club is a good way for students to get help. It is a quiet place to finish homework early. They can get help from teachers and other students. If a student did not get a lesson in school, he can stay after school. A teacher can teach the lesson again.

Kids should play sports, do fun activities, or join clubs they like. \n\nIn some places, people believe students should know their future job when they start high school. But more and more people think students should not have to choose a job until they are in high school. Kids are too young and not ready to think about jobs.

They should not have to choose classes for a job. They should pick a job when they have less to worry about. \n\nSome kids know what they want to do when they grow up. But it is often better not to choose too early. This can limit their choices later. It is good to have many options in high school.

The doctor asked Generic_Name to clean up blood. The blood was on the floor, and Generic_Name felt sick.

{"text_id": "2DC1A5B465B3", "output_essay": "I think having a homework club after school is a good idea. You can finish your homework early, get help, and get better grades. It's important for high school and middle school. It's easy to go and get help to do your work or to improve your grades.\n\nThe first reason I think a homework club is good is that you can finish your work early. You won't have to worry about doing it late. Many people leave their work until the last day. This is not good because there's not much time to finish. If you do your work early, you won't be stressed. I used to wait until the last minute to do my homework. I didn't like it because I was late and my grades were not good. I started to do my homework early. Now, I do it the day I get it or the next day. It's better because I don't worry or stress about it. This helps you learn how to handle problems, which is good for the future.\n\nThe second reason a homework club is good is that you can get more help after school. This is helpful because some teachers go too fast or don't explain much. It's hard for some students to learn this way. Some students think they should ask more questions and talk to the teacher about how fast they teach. It's not fair when a teacher doesn't answer your question just because they think you weren't paying attention. If you're having trouble, you should talk to your teacher. If you stay after school, you can get more explanations. Some people think after school is just for talking, but it's not. Teachers are there to help you, and you're there to help yourself.\n\nThe last reason it's good to stay after school is to fix a bad grade. You can't fix your grade in just one day. You need to stay more than once to get a better grade. There are many ways to improve your grade, like fixing missing work or turning in all your homework. After school is your chance to work on your grade. Sometimes, you get points just for coming. That can give you at least 3 points to help your grade. If you turn in your work, you'll have a better grade in a few weeks. It might take a little longer because teachers have other work to grade."}

{"text_id": "CF250284D721", "output_essay": "Thomas Jefferson said, \"Determine never to be idle...It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing.\" Today, there are many new things for us to discover. Some people think that the more they do, the more they will achieve. Others disagree. Is it better to always be busy, or is there value in taking breaks? There are two sides to this, but one is more convincing. People should keep busy and not waste time because it leads to success and offers many chances.\n\nFirst, being busy shows people how to succeed. We can see a big difference between times of war and now. This progress comes from people who never stop searching for ways to improve the world. Take Thomas Edison, who invented the light bulb, as an example. He faced many problems but never gave up. When a reporter asked him how he felt about failing at first, he said, \"I'm not failed, I just found out 10,000 ways that won't work.\" Edison's story shows that staying busy can bring better results and make people stronger when they face failure. In short, being active can be the key to success.\n\nNext, chances are there for those who keep going. In cities today, there are many unexplored opportunities. People compete for these chances. For example, Generic_School in Generic_City only takes eight hundred students each year. But over a thousand students apply. So, those eight hundred must work hard to get in. Clearly, opportunities are there for those who do their best and never quit.\n\nAlso, staying busy helps people be more lively. Many people are afraid to try new things and get sad easily. But those who stay positive and work on new ideas are usually happy. For instance, Generic_Name loves math. She always does her best in math class and talks about math with a big smile. This shows that a positive attitude and hard work can make people more active in their daily lives.\n\nHowever, some think taking breaks is important. They say breaks help people relax and avoid stress. This is true because rest gives energy and reduces stress. But being inactive can cause health issues and make people miss out on learning and exploring. Working on new ideas doesn't mean no breaks. Also, nothing comes for free in life. In short, people need rest to refresh their minds, but they should still work and move forward for new chances.\n\nIn conclusion, Thomas Jefferson advised against being idle. He suggested we should seek more chances in life. While breaks are important, doing nothing leads to laziness. Working and trying new things will bring the best results and opportunities. Let's agree to be ready for a great future."}

Some suggest schools should be open all year with shorter breaks throughout the year. I think summer could be shorter. After a long break, it's hard to remember what we learned. For example, I forgot a lot from my first year of high school when I returned the next year. A shorter summer means we could learn more during spring break. Older students could use that time to plan for college or improve their grades. If students need extra help, they could go to school in the summer. For instance, new high school students might need help with hard subjects like algebra. If they get help, they'll do better in their next year. Schools should be open for students who need it, not for everyone. Like my sister needed help with English last summer, but the school was closed.

For example, in a restaurant, if there is someone who does nothing, the other workers won't want to work with me. They will think I am lazy and just waste time. If I stay busy, I have more chances to work and to improve myself. Like, if I am a bartender who is not lazy, I could become a manager if I work hard and give time to my job.

Students can learn to make certain foods, keep a clean space, and find out if they really want this job.\n\nOne reason why local businesses and groups might let students come is so they can learn to make certain foods. Some foods are hard to make, but students can start with the basics when they are young. For example, in cooking, you must follow certain rules, like how much spice to use, how long to cook the food, or how big each serving should be.\n\nAnother reason local businesses and groups might invite students is to teach them to keep their space clean. When students think about being a chef, they often just think about cooking and forget how important it is to be clean. Local businesses can show them what cleaners to use for different parts of the kitchen, like the stove, floor, and sink. They can also tell them what clothes to wear to work and what they should not bring.\n\nThe last reason local businesses and groups might let students come is so the students can see if they really want to do the job they are thinking about for their future. Students need to know everything about the job and what's good and bad about it.

{"text_id": "B99737209BDF", "output_essay": "Working in a group has many benefits. For example, you can finish your work faster with help from others. It can also be quicker than doing it alone. Groups make it easier to understand what you need to do. Everyone helps each other and finishes tasks faster. Working alone can be hard because there's no one to help. Many people like groups for the extra help and benefits. But working alone means doing everything yourself. Sometimes this is easy, but other times it's very hard. The difficulty depends on the task. Some tasks are simple, but others are very tough. That's why working in a group is often the best choice. Plus, working with friends can be fun, and you can finish tasks together. Still, some people prefer to work alone. They think groups waste time and stop them from finishing their work. But some of these people do well on their own. They stay focused and are sure of their work. In a group, everyone can offer different ideas for the project. If you work alone, you must work harder to finish tasks. In the end, both group work and solo work have benefits. Group workers usually do a great job and finish tasks more easily. Even when it's hard, they find solutions.

Having good software to keep your files in order and safe is another benefit. Technology also lets you talk to family and friends who are far away. For schools, computers are essential; teachers and students use them to get ready for teaching and learning. A computer can make your work easier and help you stay calm.\n\nIn conclusion, technology can be used for many good things. Many people have jobs because of technology. It has really helped this generation. Every device was made to help and make life easier for people."}

They need time to play sports. They need time for activities they like after school. Some students need time to work to help their parents with money for bills or rent. Some students have to look after their younger brother or sister while their parents are at work.\n\nStudents need time for sports like soccer; they need to practice a lot. They need to finish sports early so they can go home and do their homework. They need to study for tests or finish other school work. They might need time for housework. Some have to care for their siblings when their parents are out.\n\nOften, their mom and dad work and can't stay home with the kids. They need their older child, who is in school, to come home early to look after the younger ones. While their parents work hard to make money for bills and to earn more, they might need a lot of money, so they work a lot. They might work late, so the student has to stay home to watch the kids, do housework, and keep the house in order. He might have to do everything at home, like cooking for his younger brothers.\n\nMaybe the student has to work to help his mom with bills and rent. Help her with food, especially if she is alone and has like five kids. She might work hard to provide what they need, so the student has to help his mom with expenses. He can help pay so she doesn't worry too much. She won't have to work so hard and fear losing her home because she can't pay the rent.\n\nI disagree with making the school day longer because we, the students, need more time. We need less time in school; instead of adding an hour and a half, they should cut an hour from the school day. This way, we can have more time for our activities, to play sports, or to help our parents with their needs. Help them not worry about money. Help them make money and pay for things they are concerned about. Make sure they aren't too stressed and can stop working so hard. Look after things they are worried about."}
{"text_id": "D4B9293426B6", "output_essay": "Have you ever sat down and thought, 'What is next?' In life, we all reach a point where we wonder about the future. As kids grow up, those without plans can get lost thinking about what comes next. To help with this, schools offer chances for students to explore careers early on. Some people think it's bad for young students to pick a career path early, but it's actually good. Young students have new ideas about their future jobs. They also learn the basics of what to do and what not to do in their work life.\n\nOne reason young students should pick a career is that they have new ideas about their future work. For example, my dad loved engineering in high school. He took an engineering class and built his first robot. He learned to program and control it. Later, in college, he knew more about engineering than his classmates because of his high school experience. This shows why it's good to choose a career early when you're eager to learn. Another example is the actor Will Smith. He took a film class in school and played different roles. This class helped him in acting school later. So, Will Smith's story shows that it's good for students to start focusing on a career when they're young.\n\nAnother reason is that young students learn the basics of their future job. In high school, I want to be a writer. I talked to my counselor and started a creative writing class. I learned about formal and informal letters. In formal letters, you must be serious and professional. In informal letters, you can be more relaxed. This class taught me how to write and the right tone for a book. It showed me what to do and what not to do. This is why it's good to start learning about a career early. Also, the soccer player Cristiano Ronaldo started playing at fourteen. He learned the basics from his coach and became one of the best players. His school experience shows that starting early is beneficial.\n\nSome say it's bad to guide young students toward a career because they're not mature enough. But starting early gives them more experience. For example, the artist Frida Kahlo took her first art class at ten. She learned about colors and expressing feelings through painting. This class helped her become a great artist later.\n\nAll these facts show that it's good for students to start learning about careers early. It gives them a head start and more experience.\n\nSo, let's not worry about the future. Instead, let's focus on what we can do now to prepare. Life is like a game. We shouldn't wait for problems to come. We should plan ahead."}

{"text_id": "ACE9A214AD3E", "output_essay": "Technology is a big reason why people don't talk to each other much. It has hurt people's lives by taking over jobs, harming people's minds, and filling all their time with more apps on devices. Technology is replacing jobs that people don't care about anymore. For example, at McDonald's, there's a machine to order food. This is because some think it's easier to let a robot do the work. Jobs help people learn to talk to others. But now, there are fewer chances to learn because technology has taken them away. Also, cars can drive themselves now. Some people trust the cars and don't think anything bad will happen. They will trust technology until something goes wrong. People let technology control them because they gave it power. Technology is also hurting people's minds. They hear that it's better to learn from technology than from a teacher. Kids are told by older people that technology can teach them a lot. This might be partly true, but not for the world they live in now. In the past, technology was made by scientists to find new things. Now, people use it to learn online or just to waste time. Finally, devices are taking up people's time with more apps. Some don't see this as a problem. But it's why people use their phones, computers, or tablets so much. Because of new tech, people talk less to others and spend too much time on their devices. Apps might not look harmful, but when parents make apps, their kids think devices are more important than the real world. For instance, if a young girl gets a phone at seven, she might be smart by twelve if she uses it for school. But if she gets distracted, she might fail her class. Technology has changed some people's lives for the worse. It has damaged minds and taken jobs. It has made people doubt school and hurt kids whose parents are too focused on tech.

One is that when you do something, people will tell you. Another is that you feel uneasy thinking about it.\n\nReason 1: People always watch what we do; they are like critics. When we succeed, they talk, and when we fail, they talk too. We all get noticed or worn out. But we should not worry about this. No matter what we do, what others say is not important.\n\nReason 2: Worrying about all this can make you lose peace of mind. I say this because when our minds are full, we feel stressed, mad, and sad inside about everything. But we must make sure what we do works, makes us happy, and proud. Also, we should ignore those people because they are envious of our lives and success.\n\nIn conclusion, people notice us if we are always active, whether it's right or wrong.

My 8th-grade teacher used to say, 'Walk alone and you will go faster, walk in a group and you will go farther.' I think that working in a group has more good points than working alone. \n\nFirst, working alone can make you feel left out. You might think no one wants to work or talk with you. On the other hand, working in a group lets you share your ideas. You feel safe because everyone else shares too. Together, you can make ideas better and get great results. It's also good for your mental health to talk with others. \n\nSecond, being in a group has perks like learning new things, having less work, saving time, and finding out more facts.

Thomas Jefferson said, 'Decide never to be lazy...it is amazing how much can be done if we are always busy.' I really think that students will do more and go further by keeping busy. By doing more, students will have less to do later and more time to relax. For my first point, being busy helps students have less to do. One reason is that students will worry less. If students had more worries, they might not listen in class. This also means not feeling stressed. Why? Because students won't panic about work they haven't done. Otherwise, they would worry about when to finish it, maybe before, after school, or on the weekend. But, if they finish their work, they won't have to worry about it. Also, with nothing else to do, students can focus on their schoolwork. They won't worry about handing in work late or not at all. This brings me to my next point about why finishing everything is important, so you have more time to relax! Another reason to stay busy is so students can have more time to relax. Everyone likes to relax, right? Having free time can help you do more. If you're free, you could do something extra, like more work for bonus points. But, if you want to have fun in your free time, go on an adventure. For example, spend a weekend at the beach with friends. Enjoy a sunny day with your feet in the sand, watch kids play, and enjoy a beautiful night out. Also, it's great to spend time with family, have a barbecue, or watch a movie. Lastly, going to a school event or activity with friends, like a volleyball, soccer, or lacrosse game, is fun. Not worrying or stressing about work because it's already done is perfect. In the end, I think Thomas Jefferson knew what he was talking about when he wrote that quote. Some people might think it's bad to always be ahead. Why? Because everything students do leads to something good or makes them better. Having less to do and more free time are just some benefits of staying busy. Students will succeed if they believe in themselves."}

Which is better: working with others or by yourself? When you work with others, finishing work by the deadline is easier. For big tasks, you can share the work, so you don't worry about doing it all alone. If something is hard to understand, a team member can explain it to you. The best thing about group work is that if you run out of ideas, others can help you think of new ones. A group can think of better ideas because different people add their thoughts. The more ideas you get, the better. In a group, someone might suggest something. Then the group can talk about if it's a good fit for the task. Group work is good because you can suggest ideas. Some people might like your idea, and others might not. But if most agree it's good for the task, then the group can use your idea.

For example, in my country, when I was in school, the teacher made different groups. My group had 5 students. We got a math project called 'The 5 Combinations.' Each of us had to solve one part. But, some students enjoy doing different things, like drawing or doing other homework. For example, I do what I'm told in the group, like drawing or reading when the teacher says so. Plus, some students like to be in groups of 4 or 5, depending on the work. I like groups of 5 because we come up with more ideas. More ideas are good for the group.

If you decide things on your own, you won't know what they think. When you're about to do something big, you need to know what others think. You need their views because you might feel sorry later for the choice you made. You might wonder, \"Why did I do this?\" It's smart to ask for someone's view, like your mom's. \n\nAsking for help can also point you to the right choice because experts know more than you. They are older and have done more. They would share their stories and the truth. They don't want you to make the same mistakes they did. They know how bad it feels to choose poorly. \n\nThey also have more experience and know more about the topic. People who decide things alone often feel sorry because they didn't get advice from those with more experience or knowledge. So, before you make a big choice, be sure to ask someone older or someone who knows a lot about the topic. \n\nIn the end, I think asking for help from experts, leaders, and older people is the best way to get advice.

Even though some believe working alone is better, working in a group is actually better because we can finish our work fast and learn more. \n\nThe first reason working in a group is better is that we can finish our work fast. For example, in my history class, some students did their work alone, and others in a group. The first one to finish would get a prize. The group finished first and won. Working in a group is better because without the group, we wouldn't have finished fast and won. Another example is a man who had to fix many cars in two days to pay his rent. He couldn't do it alone, so he asked his friends to help. They worked together, and he finished fast and paid his rent. Working in a group is better because if he hadn't fixed the cars, he would have lost his home. But with the group's help, he finished fast and paid his rent. \n\nThe second reason is that working in a group lets us learn new things. For instance, I didn't know how to make a pie chart for my chemistry project. My friends helped me learn in a group, and I got a perfect score. Working in a group is better because if I hadn't made the pie chart, I would have failed. But I learned with the group and got a perfect score. Also, a girl didn't know how to swim. Her sister and brother taught her in a group. She learned to swim. Working in a group is better because if she hadn't learned, she might have drowned. But they taught her together, and she learned. \n\nSome might say working alone is better because it makes us responsible and sure of ourselves. But we can be even more responsible and confident when we work in a group. For example, many kids were learning to ride a bike together, but one kid who was very sure of himself tried alone. He was 11 and thought he could ride without the group. He fell and hurt his leg. Working in a group is better. If he had learned with the group, he wouldn't have fallen. Another example is a boy I know who wanted to live alone in a big house. He couldn't pay the rent. Working in a group is better. If he had shared the rent with others, he could have afforded it. \n\nSome might think working alone is better, but working in a group is actually better because we can finish our work fast and learn more. \n\nWorking in a group is better because it's not as good to work alone. In a group, we are safer, can do things easier, finish fast, and learn new things. Working in a group is better for success."}

Sports are good for staying fit and strong. I think people should play sports for scholarships and future benefits. The school board shouldn't make the school day longer. We have after-school programs to finish work. People have activities like sports and clubs after school. More school time isn't needed. After school should be a choice. Students have other things to do after school. The school board should add more after-school programs instead. Some need to leave to see sick family members. The school board shouldn't make the school day longer."}
{"text_id": "AAABD4F8A515", "output_essay": "People are interesting. We have scientists, doctors, firefighters, pilots, police officers, cooks, and more. Some people always try their hardest to make our society better. Every day, new people are born into the world they are making. Like everyone, they start from the beginning. As they grow, they wonder, 'How do I get what I want?' We grow up watching things happen around the world. These things shape our thoughts. They make us think about our future and push us to make choices that will change our lives. What's the problem? You might ask. Well, many people don't know how to get what they want. When they're older, they're not sure which choices to make for a good life. They wonder if they should get help or do it alone. I remember when my older brother, Generic_Name, wanted to be a doctor. He finished high school and was ready for the next step: to work as a doctor and succeed. We all wanted to know which college he picked to learn to be a doctor. When my mom asked him, he said he wouldn't go to college. He wanted to learn on his own. My mom was angry but let him try. She thought he'd see his mistake soon. My brother always liked to do things alone. He trusted his gut and did what he thought was best. But after a year, he hadn't gotten anywhere. His friends were learning in college, but he was just reading books and articles online. That wasn't enough. His friends said he needed college to be a doctor, but he didn't listen. He thought it would take too long. Time went by, and he never became a doctor. His friends graduated, but he never changed his mind and chose a different path. Now, he sometimes tells me he wishes he had acted differently. I want to make it clear with this story: being stubborn and thinking we're always right can make us lose our dreams. I'm not saying you can't succeed on your own. There are ways, but are you sure you can? Knowing yourself and your abilities is key to doing it alone. But remember, it's okay to ask for help. There are experienced people who can teach us to be great, to be who we want to be. We don't have to learn or decide alone. There's always someone who can help."}
{"text_id": "6EC39DD682AF", "output_essay": "Do you ever feel happy when you plan to do something fun after school? I don't agree with the school board's idea to make the school day longer by one and a half hours. This change will make it hard for students to do things like after-school clubs, sports, and other activities. They will also have less time to finish their homework and do things they planned to do after school. \n\nI don't agree with making the school day longer because it will stop students from joining after-school activities, sports, and other plans. Some students play sports every day, and others play twice a week. Students who play every day will come home very late. Those who play twice a week will come home late two days in a row. This will make some students tired at school. Coaches may give time for homework during practice, but it might not be enough. Students will not finish their homework after practice because it's too late. They will need to sleep to not be tired the next day at school. Also, if students have a group project, they might not all be able to meet after school because of practice or other activities. Not everyone will be able to do their work because school is too long. \n\nI also don't agree with adding time to the school day because some students have other things to do after school. For example, some students have to look after their younger brothers or sisters or pets. Those who pick up younger kids from school need to be on time. If school ends later, it will mess up their schedules. It will be hard to find someone to look after the kids for longer and it will cost more. Students with pets need to feed them and play with them after school. If a student with a dog comes home late, it will be hard to find someone else to take care of the dog. \n\nIn conclusion, I think it's a bad idea for the school board to make the school day one and a half hours longer. It will make life hard for students and their families. Students will have trouble finishing homework, projects, and other activities because they will get home late. They will also have less time with their families. Those who play sports will be very tired and won't have time to do their work. I really don't agree with the school board's plan to make the school day longer because it will cause a lot of problems for students and their families."}

Change can be good, but it's not for everyone. It's better to do what you enjoy as yourself, without changing because others want you to.\n\nJust being you should be enough for everyone.

{"text_id": "357A3AE05BE8", "output_essay": "Emerson was a writer who shared many ideas. One of these ideas is especially interesting. It talks about something a person is good at or knows well, mostly about their experience. Emerson says that doing what you know can make you better. Even if you think it won't help, it will. Learning more means knowing more than you do now. That's why Emerson said you grow by doing the same things or having the same experiences without trying new things. It's important to learn from what you've done before to get better, as Emerson thought. Going through the same thing again isn't easy. It can make you see things in a new way or understand them better. But this depends on how you think and act because not everyone sees things the same way. Some people agree or disagree with Emerson for good or bad reasons. He wanted to tell people that they can improve and grow from their experiences if they are strong and in control. If they don't face their experiences, they won't grow. Some think repeating the same thing is a waste of time or don't care much about it. That's why not everyone feels the same about Emerson's idea. Some don't care or can't see what they could learn or how they could improve. Being good at something can make solving problems easier and help others with their problems. It's not just a waste of time. Getting better is about learning from experiences to understand life better. Many people ignore their past experiences. But not everyone does. For example, I've faced tough times more than once. It's hard, but it helps you grow and learn new things. I agree with Emerson because I've learned and improved. Not everyone thinks like this, though. We all have different stories and lives. Emerson's words encourage us to keep going and stay strong, no matter what we've been through. The meaning changes depending on how people view their experiences. Those who agree with Emerson think repeating experiences helps them handle situations better and achieve more. The idea is you can't grow if you don't try new things. For some, trying new things is important because it helps them get better and understand life better. Some people are better at dealing with life because they learn from small changes. They become wiser from their experiences, not because they change for others, but because they learn from mistakes. Others disagree because they don't see what they could become. They think trying new things is a waste of time because they've done it before. That's a mistake. They don't realize how much they could improve by trying new things. Some don't want to change. They're happy as they are and don't see the benefits of new experiences. Some find it boring because they think they know what will happen, or they just don't care about improving. But some people have learned and changed by trying new things. Emerson wanted to show how trying new things can change you for the better. Many have changed because of this idea. They've learned a lot and become better people. I believe that trying new things can make you a better person, no matter your situation. Learning from mistakes is good so you don't repeat them. Emerson's message is to try new things to become better in every way."}

{"text_id": "4FCC4BEB161A", "output_essay": "My grandma said, 'People who do well in life should keep busy.' Doing well means you have achieved something. If people do well, everyone gains. Busy people do more because they work hard, meet their goals, and help others.\n\nSome think that doing nothing has its uses because it lets people rest. But, those who keep busy finish tasks faster. It's clear that busy people do more.\n\nFirst, people who work hard are important because they give their all. For example, Generic_Name works at Sephora and wants to be a manager. She never misses work. She got promoted to manager because of this. Also, Generic_Name is a boy who wants to be an artist. He put a singing video online, and it got a million views. Then, someone offered him a chance to be an artist. It's clear that hard work leads to big things.\n\nAlso, people who meet their goals are key because they work hard. For instance, Generic_Name went to the gym and ate well for a year to lose weight. She lost the weight. Another example is Generic_Name, who had bad grades because he didn't work or study. He changed and started to study and do his work. He stayed after school and improved his grades. You can see that to meet goals, you must work hard.\n\nMost importantly, people who help others are crucial because this can lead to big wins. For example, Generic_Name was carrying pizza and Chinese food home. He saw a homeless family that was hungry and gave them his food. Also, Generic_Name saw some kids picking on a little girl. After the kids left, she helped the girl. It's clear that helping others can bring more success.\n\nIn conclusion, busy people do more because they work hard, meet their goals, and help others. This shows that staying busy can bring more wins. People need to work hard, meet their goals, and help others to do well. There is only one way: to do well, people must keep busy."}
{"text_id": "26650408983", "output_essay": "People are talking about whether using technology too much is good or bad for us. Technology lets us do things without seeing other people. Some think that we should use less technology. They say it takes our attention away from real life and has a big impact on teens. Technology can make us ignore the real world. For example, my brother was a good student with high grades. He did his homework well. But when he started using his phone, video games, and computer, he stopped caring about school. Now he is always on his phone. He uses the computer to look up homework answers. Before, he used to read books or his notes for better information. He used to hang out with friends or go to the library for books. In school, he could have learned a lot, but he didn't because he played video games. Now, he has no friends and doesn't talk to anyone. He likes technology more than going out. My mom talked to him. She said school is important and he lost interest in it. We should use technology like phones and computers less. Too much technology can lead teens the wrong way. For example, my mom limits my phone time. She says I should do my homework. She lets me use my phone for 50 minutes. Then I have to do all my homework. This helps me not waste time on technology. I use books for homework and look for more information. Some teens waste time on video games or social media like Facebook and Instagram. This is because their parents don't watch them. Teens like playing more than doing homework. We should use technology less. This helps us care about learning and gives us time for other important things. Teens today don't care about their education as much as using technology. When they have homework, they use computers or phones instead of going to the library to get books. We should use less technology in society. This can help stop bad things like car accidents.

Technology has cut down on our face-to-face time in a bad way. When we connect with others online, we stop paying attention to the people right next to us. The way we act on the internet can make it hard to talk to people face-to-face. First, almost everyone uses technology every day. Many use social media to meet and chat with lots of new people. They become close to online friends and spend time with them, not with real-life friends. If you focus on online friends more than real ones, you won't get much attention from the people around you. This creates a gap in your relationships. People often choose to text instead of talking to someone who is right there. They prefer online chats over deep, in-person talks. Second, using technology too much can change how you think and talk to people face-to-face. On the internet, you can say things you can't in real life. This lets you create a different online self. This can hurt your social skills because you get used to being someone else online. In the end, we see people on their phones all the time. The way phones have reduced real human contact is huge. Relying on technology has made people stop talking to each other and create fake online selves. So, technology's impact on human contact is bad."}

I think real self-esteem comes from believing in yourself. Here are three reasons why:\n\nFirst, you trust yourself; second, you do something good; and third, you can learn and try hard on your own, even if it's not the hardest you can try.\n\nTo start, when a student trusts themselves, they can do well without trying their hardest. They still do something important.\n\nThe first thing I'm talking about is what happens when students trust themselves. But trusting yourself is not the same as self-esteem. Some people say students need to trust themselves to learn. I think this is true and I see that many students trust themselves more than they believe that real self-esteem is about doing something great.\n\nNext, some students will do something good in the future because of what they learn today. If they try a little bit every day, they will reach their goal. Like in soccer, you want to score a goal. If you're confident, you can do it. Confidence helps people reach their goals and stay excited.\n\nLast, doing things on your own helps you focus. Some people say we should say good things about a student's work to make them feel good about themselves, even if it's not their best. I agree because it helps them trust themselves. For example, when someone trusts themselves, they will do something good on their own. It might not be their hardest try, but they will do their best until they reach their goal. It's not about getting a lot of praise for trying hard; it's about the effort you put in by yourself.\n\nIn the end, real self-esteem might come from believing in yourself, and I think this is true. It's not about trying super hard, but about what you do with the effort you put in. Also, I think when we say good things about a student's work to make them feel good, the student needs to believe in themselves to learn."}

I have to practice a lot. If I just sit at home and watch TV, I won't become a pro. But if I keep practicing, I will get better and might become a pro one day. Second, doing nothing does not help us in any way. People have dreams, but if they don't do anything, they won't reach their goals. My friend wants to be strong and likes watching workout videos. But he doesn't go to the gym, so he can't get strong. Some people say their dreams don't need them to be active. But sooner or later, they will need to do something to reach their goals.

Now, think about what would happen if school added an extra hour and a half to each day. I don't want a longer school day because it would give students very little time to play or have fun after school. It would also make them have more work and less time with family and friends.\n\nFirst, playing sports keeps us healthy in mind and body. But when we are tired, sports can be very hard. Also, we could get hurt more easily. You will have homework too. You will have to fit in your favorite activity and homework in about three hours. For example, say you play volleyball and then go home. It's 6:30, you take a shower and eat. By 8:40, you need to get ready for bed at 9:00, but you still have homework and a project. If school is longer by one and a half hours, you won't have time for your hobbies.\n\nNext, more time in school means more work and more homework. If school is longer, students will stay up late to finish homework. They will work late and probably be tired and grumpy. So, longer school days could make grades drop and behavior get worse.\n\nLast, students will have less time with their families. This could make family relationships not as good. While the student is busy with work, the family might be eating or wanting to go out, but the student can't join. The student might not like the work, but not doing it could make grades go down. Either way, the family relationship gets hurt.\n\nIn conclusion, the school board should not make the school day longer.

In school, there are music groups or bands too. If I had to choose an activity for next year, I would pick the guitar. I think playing an instrument is fun and teaches you a lot. It helps students learn different instruments, relaxes them after a busy school day, and lets many find their music talent.\n\nLearning an instrument teaches students to play different ones. There are many to choose from, like the guitar, piano, drums, and more. At first, students can't just pick up an instrument and play right away. When you pick an instrument, you need time and patience to learn. For example, the guitar made me upset at first because it was hard. The first guitar I tried was an acoustic one, not a classical one. It hurt my fingers and made me angry. But now, I can play pretty well, and I'm happy about it. Also, when you spend time on something and do well, you feel great.\n\nPlaying an instrument gives students a way to unwind with music after a tough day at school. Every school day is hard. Students get up early, work in school, and try not to fall asleep. About 70% of students like to listen to music after school. I asked some students what they do after class. One girl said, \"I just listen to music; I really love Ariana Grande.\" A boy said, \"I listen to acoustic music; it's good for sleeping.\" So, we see music is more popular than other things. What's better for relaxing than music or playing an instrument?\n\nPlaying an instrument helps students find their music talent. Those who love music often want to learn more. Like singers, when they are alone or want to sing with music, they can play an instrument to improve a song. When you know how to play, you understand the song's feeling and can play it like a pro. Each instrument sounds different, and students will find out which sounds they like best.\n\nSo, I believe playing an instrument is a fun learning activity. It teaches students to play different instruments, helps them relax, and lets them find their music talent. Don't wait; go to the music group or band and have fun. I'm sure you will enjoy your time with music or your own instrument."}

In this essay, I will talk about why it's important to make choices with care and skill. People should choose for themselves because no one else should tell them what to do, it helps create a good future, and you can trust yourself. First, choose for yourself; don't let others tell you what to do. When I turned 18, I felt I could do anything. But in my family, parents still decide for us. They say, 'As long as you live in my house, you follow my rules.' I told my mom that I need to choose for myself and learn from my mistakes. I want to be free to make choices and find out what life has for me. My mom wants to keep me safe, but I need to learn to take care of myself. Second, I believe a good future comes from my choices. It's hard, but I will work hard and no one will stop me. My grandpa once told me, 'Keep doing what you love and fight for your future. If you're stuck, keep moving.' I remember his words every day. Choosing for a good future is something to be proud of. Third, trust yourself and take chances. If you're stuck, you know how to fix it. Sometimes you feel like giving up, but you shouldn't. People support you and you should trust yourself too. I've been there. I did poorly in school and my life was bad. But then, family, friends, and others helped me. Their support helped me get better. You can't do everything alone; sometimes you need help. Then you can go back to trusting yourself and making smarter choices. In the end, I really think that making your own choices is better than depending on others. It makes people trust themselves, leads to a good future, and lets them control their lives."}

This can also encourage others to keep trying. People need to see this for themselves. First, doing things is better than doing nothing. When we finish tasks, we feel good. If others see we've done nothing, they may think we are lazy. They might wonder why they admire us if we haven't done anything. Some people believe they can get things done by just sitting down. But many people had dreams when they were young. Today, they still haven't achieved them. They keep trying to reach their goals. They want to fulfill their dreams. When they do, they will feel good. Next, if someone gives up, others who look up to them might quit too. Often, people stop trying when they are close to success. We should not do this. If people see us not giving up, it can help them keep going. Still, some people don't care. If they think quitting is the only choice, they will quit. Others think that sitting still can help them succeed. Some say that having fun with friends can create good memories. If we can show others not to quit, that would be great. What's better: sitting and trying to do something, or actually doing it by moving around? For instance, taking action, making progress, and helping others are ways to feel good about ourselves. So, people shouldn't quit. They should keep going. When they see someone quit, they might want to quit too. We should not let that happen."}

Many people don't realize this because there are so many fun things to do inside that keep them from going out. Recent studies have shown that being inside too much is not good for you. But people still choose to stay indoors. These studies say that more people will stay inside as time goes on. This could lead to more health problems than we've ever seen before. There are lots of fun ways to enjoy the outdoors, like playing games with friends. First, it's nice to spend time with friends inside, but it's even better outside. You can go to a park and play games you can't play indoors. For example, you can play Four Square with just some colored chalk to draw the squares. Jump Rope is another outdoor game. It's about how fast you can jump over a spinning rope without hitting it. Then there's Twenty-Four Circles, a running and thinking game that's really fun and can make friendships stronger. Being outside is good for your mind and body. The air is fresh, and it helps your heart and blood flow better. So, playing outside with friends is not just fun, it's also good for your health. Secondly, indoor games are popular, but have you tried playing outside? Capture the Flag is more exciting in a big field with lots of space to run. Soccer needs a big field too. Football also can't be played inside because it needs lots of room. Overall, outdoor games are more fun than indoor ones. To end, there are many things to do outside that are fun, like playing games with friends. Think about how this can make you healthier and help you live longer. It's important because it can really affect you and the people you care about. Life is too short to just play games inside. Go out and spend time with your loved ones in nature."}

A stranger visited my home and asked my parents if I could go to the United States to play sports and study. After the stranger left, my parents and I talked about it. They said I was grown up enough to decide on my own.\n\nI thought about it for two to three weeks. The man, Generic_Name, had told me that living in the U.S. is hard, especially for a teenager from another country. My parents and I finally decided, and five days later, I was on a plane to Generic_City. Now, I go to Generic_School. It's been tough because I left my culture, family, and friends behind, and I didn't speak English. Learning basketball here was hard too because it's different from how we played in Generic_City. I've had many challenges over four years, but I kept going. Now, I'm the third-best prospect in Virginia. My life is very different since I arrived.

They should take time while they are young to learn about jobs they might like. Some kids are pushed by their parents to pick one job and stick with it. Other parents let their kids take time to decide. They let them learn about what they might want to do later in life.\n\nFor example, some kids grow up fast and know what job they want. They focus on that one job in school. But other kids need more time to find out what they like.

People have different thoughts and can share advice or point out mistakes. For example, I enjoy working and making mistakes. Mistakes help us learn. Once, I was painting a room at work. I was new and thought I was doing it right, but I was wrong. My co-workers showed me I was painting the wrong way and taught me the right way. That's when I saw how important it is to have people who can help you get better at your job.\n\nWe always need a partner at work. The Bible even says, 'Two heads are better than one.' We often run into problems or questions. When that happens, we need someone to talk to about it. For example, at school, my classmates and I had a project on a small town in Sudan, Africa. We didn't know what it looked like. But we talked to a classmate from Africa, and he knew about it. I believe I wouldn't have figured it out alone.\n\nWorking with others is the best way because no one is perfect. We all make mistakes and need people with different ideas.

It took a lot of learning and time to see that a phone is the most useful tool you can have. Also, we don't need to depend on others as much anymore. Our phones and devices give us many benefits that help us every day. If technology gets even better, life could become simpler. People like to know what's happening in the world. Social media is everywhere and very popular. It's easy to share news quickly. For school or events, it's simple to keep in touch with someone who's not there by texting or emailing them. Being able to plan is a great skill. Being ready for new things keeps us on our toes. If a family member lives far away and wants to talk or visit, we can call or video chat. Online shopping is also popular. It saves us from driving to the store. As we age, we learn more about social media and technology. In the end, technology helps us be better and think about careers we might want. We can help others and come up with new ideas that others can use. Sharing ideas is easy in a group chat. When meeting new people, we can get their contact info to stay in touch. People who use technology well can inspire others to improve.

Like, I didn't know birds eat worms until I camped. You might think I didn't know much, but it's true. Also, you can look around old caves where people used to live. You can watch how animals live and grow. If you like science, you'll find this exciting.\n\nSecond, you meet new people. If you already have friends, you'll make more. If you don't, you can meet others camping near you. You can share what you find and look around together. You might even make friends with animals.\n\nThird, you can take it easy. In a loud city, you can still hear cars even with windows shut. But when you camp, you only hear nature. You don't have to wake up super early. You can dance to your favorite music without people watching you.\n\nTo sum up, I think camping is the best because you learn, meet friends, and relax.

Getting advice from experts, leaders, and wise people helps us make good choices in life. Some people say we should depend on ourselves and trust our gut feelings and ideas. They say if we mess up, we can learn from it. But those who only trust themselves are often the most unaware and stubborn. If they mess up once, they might keep messing up. Experts are great for help, especially with new things. For example, a new worker, Generic_Name, had trouble with the printer. He asked the boss for help. The boss has been there a long time and knows what to do. Another example is Generic_Name who wants to play football. He asked a coach for lessons. The coach knows a lot about football because he has learned, played, and taught it. We can trust experts because they know a lot. Leaders are also important in our lives. They shape who we are. For instance, Generic_Name's dad is kind and puts others first. He is a good leader because he teaches his son to be nice. But there's a bad example too. Generic_Name is a mom who texts while driving, has been caught driving drunk, and swears a lot. She is a bad leader because she puts herself and her kids in danger and sets a bad example. Leaders can push us to be our best. Wise people also help us make smart choices. Like with the 'Nigerian Prince Scam' that tricked people into giving money with the promise of getting more back. Smart people knew it was a lie. Also, Generic_Name's grandma can often tell when someone is lying because she has the sense to know. Being wise is important and should be shared with the next generations. It helps them know right from wrong. In the end, we should not just rely on ourselves. We should get advice.

We do more because we start to understand what we are doing and how to do it. Our minds start to work, and when we do something we've done before, we know how to do it from experience. We also do it quicker. This way, we do more than just one thing. Thomas Jefferson once said, \"Determine never to be idle... it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing.\" This means we should keep busy to do more than we think we can because with hard work, we can do a lot.\n\nWe can do many things. We can build schools for poor people so they can learn. We can make parks for kids to play and for people to walk or run. We can help animals by making a National Park for them to live safely. We can use less natural resources to keep our environment clean and safe. We can do many things, but we are not doing enough. We just think about these things and never actually do them.\n\nSome people might say we do more when we are still because we think more. But they are wrong. What's the point of thinking if we don't do what we think about? It's good to think, but not good to keep ideas in your head. I think people who don't act don't do as much as those who are active.

Everyone has done something that others haven't. Whether it's reaching goals or taking chances, being busy usually leads to more success. I believe anyone can do things because we all have a reason to. Many people work hard to succeed in their usual activities, like students in school. Some stay busy to keep active, like parents. And some do things to feel good about themselves and to encourage others to keep going. In my view, people everywhere are always busy with something. Achieving goals is key for many, which is why they find things to do. Take students, for example. College students write essays to get good grades, so they practice writing. Younger students in school also do more because they have to finish assignments, get good grades, and earn credits to go to the next level. School is a big deal and is noticed by many. Also, Jefferson's words remind us to stay busy in life. I think adults are busy because life demands it. Adults prepare for parenting or work. For instance, many work as teachers or in the community and stay busy. They also care for their kids. Adults often see more work done than young people because they have to look after themselves and their kids' needs. But by staying busy, they achieve more. Finally, Jefferson wanted to inspire pride in ourselves and others. I've seen older people help each other to places or carry things. They feel good about what they do together. It's not just older people; young ones help too, like in tutoring or practice sessions. Those who get help or give it might not achieve much alone, but they do it to help others, not just themselves. Helping can lead to learning and more chances to help. To sum up, people worldwide achieve things by staying busy. All our efforts are valuable because of what can be done when we keep at it. From students and adults staying active to making others proud, it's all about doing."}

I can't wait until next summer to see them again. Summer break is the best! Schools should not be open all year because of summer school, family trips, and summer events.\n\nFirst, schools should not be open all year because of summer school. Summer school is very important for many students who need to take a class again. They use half their summer break to go to summer school. The good thing is, we have a long summer break, so they still get to enjoy a month of summer after summer school. For example, last year I had to go to summer school for chemistry, which I passed! And because summer school was only a month and our summer break is two months, I had time to visit my mom in Generic_City! Isn't that great? Some people, like teachers, think summer breaks are bad for students.

{"text_id": "44FD30777ED7", "output_essay": "To be fair, there are many ways to influence the people around you. Everyone has their own way of influencing others. Some do so with their strong actions and some with their great behaviors, but not all of these influences work well. As Albert Schweitzer said, \"Example is not the main thing in influencing others; it is the only thing.\" The best way to inspire someone is by being a good example through your own actions. This is because you are not changing your looks to be inspiring; you are just acting with a strong and positive way. Also, everyone can easily trust you.\n\nThe power to affect other people is in how you act. Your actions are your power; it costs nothing to change from a mean way to a kind one. Acting well can make your days exciting. For example, by saying \"Good morning\" to your classmates, you can make friends. On my first day in geometry class, I waved to someone I didn't know; the next day, she asked me for help. I helped her, and over time, we became friends. Now she is my best friend. Last year, my cousin helped someone by inspiring him. His classmate, who was 15 and smoked, became friends with him and learned from him. He stopped smoking and thanked my cousin for being a good friend. It is also hard to talk to someone who thinks they can inspire people by changing their looks. But if you talk to them with a kind way, you can influence and maybe change their mind. Nowadays, plastic surgeries are common. People think they can inspire others without knowing that being good is not about looks. Only your heart shows through your actions. For example, on social media, celebrities can post photos of their surgeries, which can interest their fans. But if they see someone with good actions, they won't care about that stuff.\n\nMoreover, having a kind way can make others trust you. Who can't trust someone who acts well and has a great way? As an inspiring person, you are trusted. For example, it's hard for business owners to hire someone who does not act well with staff or customers. It's not about looks; it's about how you act. If they find someone who inspires others, they'll hire them fast. People who inspire others are trusted. For example, you don't do wrong to someone, you want the best for others, you don't lie, and you help people around you. Anyone near you can believe in you. Last summer, my teacher's coworker inspired us all. She taught us new things, listened to our questions, and told us that \"nothing is impossible; just do your best.\" We went on a trip, and our teacher couldn't come because she was sick. My teacher's coworker took charge, and we had a great time. After summer, our school gave her an award.\n\nIn conclusion, the best way to inspire someone is with your own good actions because you can influence people with your kind way and feelings, and people can trust you. Although some might say there are better ways to influence people without your actions, like by being rich or how you look, I still believe that the main way to influence others is your actions. You have a special way and feelings, and you are trustworthy. It is very important to know how our actions can affect the lives of those around us."}

I usually see them at school, so I'd like to do a science project with them or join a PE class together. It would be fun because we could hang out and not get bored. After school, we could go to the movies and do what we like. But in school, we have to focus and do our work. We could work on a science project and talk about it. If possible, I'd love to have the gym to ourselves and play all day. We could eat snacks, stay home, and relax for a day. We might even start a band and play for people on the street, and they might give us money. But we don't know how to play instruments, so we'd have to practice a lot to play for others. Who knows, we might become as famous as Queen. I want this because I want to enjoy life, not just work all the time. I want friends who support me, don't judge me, and are loyal. With such friends, my life would be perfect, and I wouldn't need to look for more friends. I dream of visiting places like Italy or a city with lots of famous people. I want to play games and maybe win some. This is for when I'm an adult and can make my own choices. I also want my parents to be proud of me. We could do summer activities like going to summer school to learn more. There's so much I want to do, like skydiving with friends or meeting celebrities and doing fun things like bowling. Some people try to stop others from reaching their dreams, so we should ignore them and do our best. You can't tell if someone is nice or mean until you meet them. Some friends might take advantage of you for money or other things. That's why I want friends who are kind and don't use me. I'd like to run a company, be the CEO, make a lot of money, and help those in need. Starting a YouTube channel would be really fun. I'm not sure what I'd talk about, but if I do well, I could make money from making videos. Many YouTubers make a lot of money from their videos. I doubt all this will happen, but it's possible to become rich. One thing I plan to do is save all my money, invest in Bitcoin, and maybe become the richest person. There are many jobs I could do, but I want to be a company CEO."}

Some do illegal things, like bidding in wrong ways, or they bother others in video games or on their computers. What I mean is that technology can be good or bad. It should be for learning, not for hurting people. Some people use it to hurt others, which is bad. On the internet, many people think technology is very risky, but it can also be very helpful. The internet is where technology can be the riskiest because some people are good and some are not. Technology can give you many chances for your future. It is very important.

White guys finish in two years because they speak English well. So, some students must study English longer or think about school or stay for four years. If they stay longer, they will learn more and be ready for college. Second reason: Students who finish in three years might struggle in college. They need to learn a lot in high school. Trust me, college will be tough for them. For example: I've been in high school for two years. I need to learn more English and other things. When I finish school, I want to have a good job and education. But if my English isn't good, I can't be successful because in the USA, you need to speak English well. If I speak English well, I can go to college and be ready. Then I can be a lawyer or something else. Some people think students should finish in three years or less. They don't want students to waste time. They want them to work sooner, make money, and help their families or buy what they need.

{"text_id": "43E2BB02C59D", "output_essay": "Setting a good example is not the only way to affect others, but it is very important. People often copy what they see as good or bad. The most powerful influence comes from other people's actions because we decide if we want to do the same. Ads on TV or online are another influence. They can make us want to buy things or do certain activities because we see them a lot. Our brains get used to the idea and we might act without much thought. Also, things that happen on their own can sway us, whether they are common, rare, or out of our control, like everyday events.\n\nThe main influence is the example set by others. This can be good or bad, and we choose whether to follow it. A good example is when an older brother or sister does their homework, showing the younger ones that it's a good thing to do. Parents and grandparents also set good examples by teaching kids how to act. But there are bad examples too, like stealing. If a child sees a friend steal often, they might start stealing too, which is harmful for their future.\n\nAds are another strong influence. They often want to sell something, like a car. If we see the same ad many times, we might buy that car instead of another one. Ads can also encourage us to do things, like go to a concert. They don't always tell us to buy tickets, but we might get interested and go anyway. Political ads are different. They don't tell us to buy anything. They just want us to know about a party or candidate before an election.\n\nThings that happen naturally can influence us too. For example, a hurricane can make people leave their homes. Store sales can make us buy things. But the most important natural influence is life itself. We can't predict the future, so life is the biggest influence as it unfolds each day.\n\nThe three main influences are the examples we see from others, ads, and the natural events of life."}

But if our boss says we must finish by the end of the day, and we are working hard, then we will finish. If we are just playing, we won't finish on time. Take my mom, who paints for a living. She works with others, and they all have jobs to do. But not everyone does their part, and sometimes they have to rush to finish in one day.\n\nIf we work at McDonald's and need to make a McChicken but don't, we could get in trouble or lose our job. Like my dad and his friend, they had a side job. They had to organize a place and do something important by day's end. They went there, but the place was messy. They cleaned up instead of doing their main job, and their boss fired them.\n\nMy uncle had a weekend job but didn't finish. He took me to help, but he got distracted by his phone. I tried to get him to start working, but he didn't listen. He wanted to leave early, and we hadn't begun. Like when my mom asked me to clean the house. I agreed but got distracted by my phone. She warned me to finish before she came home at 4:00 p.m. Time flew, and I started cleaning too late.

If you are happy, have a good attitude, and stay positive, then things will go well for you. Take a waiter's job, for example. This job wants you to be nice to customers. But some people are not positive. These people might not do well in life. I also think being positive is important because it affects how others treat you. Say someone is rude to you at a restaurant. This makes you feel bad. Then you might be rude to someone else. It keeps going like this. However, if we are nice to everyone, then we will all be happy. There won't be fights.

{"text_id": "87263FC3308B", "output_essay": "SCHOOL VACATION\n\nSummer vacation is better than winter vacation. Some people go to another country or state in the United States because they don't like the cold; they like warm places. I don't agree with some teachers who say we should have school all year with a short 3-4 week break in the summer, a longer winter break, and a week off in the spring. But we already study for about 8-9 months; why do they want us to study more?\n\nIf they want a longer winter, how can we have fun? Winter has snow, it's very cold, and we can only stay inside. This can make us stressed. I like a longer summer break because we can play sports, visit the beach, and have barbecues (like carne asada).\n\nPlaying sports is healthy, and we can do it in the summer. We enjoy sports like soccer, baseball, and running in the street with friends. Soccer is a game we can play in the summer. You can join a team and play in a big league, meet new friends, and if you're good, maybe join a famous team like Barcelona, Galaxy, or Real Madrid. Playing sports is good for your health. You won't be staring at your phone, which can hurt your eyes. You'll be happier, less stressed, and stay fit instead of getting fat in bed. You can also learn new sports. If your friends know how to play, they can teach you. Once you learn, you'll feel good talking about it with your friends.\n\nAnother fun thing in the summer is going to the beach with your family. You can enjoy the sun, the sand, and watch sharks in the sea. Seeing the sunrise over the ocean is amazing. If you have money, you can go to countries with coconuts or palm trees, like Mexico. There, you can drink coconut water or relax under a palm tree. You'll forget about bad things like work, study, and problems for a while. That's why I want a long summer: to forget my worries and get ready for a new school year. Last summer, I had three months off. I went to different countries to enjoy the sea. I made sandcastles with my brother and ate lots of shellfish. I like shellfish because my dad said they make you strong with lots of vitamins. I didn't like them at first. But my dad said I had to eat them or I wouldn't get anything else to eat. So I tried them and now I love them. Whenever we go to the beach, my family orders shellfish at the hotel.\n\nBarbecue, or 'carne asada', is something else I do in the summer. To have a barbecue, you need clear weather because you cook outside. I can't do this in the winter because it's too cold. That's why I like a long summer. I can have many barbecues and share them with friends or family. We can also go to the park and cook there. It's great when my whole family comes over, and we share stories. When my grandpa talks, we all listen. He talks about his past and his hopes for our future. We can dance to any music we like. I can't forget these times because in winter, they're over.\n\nSummer is a time most people enjoy because you can do a lot, spend time with family and friends. In winter, you're stuck at home, watching TV, using your phone, or playing games like Fortnite. I don't like those things; I want to enjoy being young. When you're young, you should explore, make new friends, and you can't do that at home; you'd get bored without friends. That's why I want a long summer. If I only get 3-4 weeks, I can't do much, and I won't want to go back to school; I'll be bored. Summer is when we can have fun and get ready for winter because in winter, you can't work or travel. So summer is very important."}

They might be mean, like being rude or ignoring you. This makes them see you in a bad light. But if you're friendly and nice, they'll think you're good. They believe you're ready to work hard and do things right. This is important when you're trying to get a job. First thoughts stick, and I say this because nobody likes someone who's always down. If you seem down in a job interview, they probably won't hire you. When you meet someone new, will you be down or upbeat? Most will say upbeat. Why? Because they don't want to look silly. If you're down, you'll wish you weren't. People won't want to talk to you; they'll say bad things like 'That person's not nice' or 'They have a bad mood.' But if you're upbeat when you meet people, they'll like you. They'll want to talk more if you're nice to them. First meetings also often lead to talking about jobs. That's great because you can have a real, relaxed talk. Just answering questions isn't really talking. Talking is when you learn about each other and share what you enjoy.

It would be great if all areas had this option because some students really need it. Some students work to help pay for their family's bills and food. Balancing work and school is hard. It can make a student tired and hurt their performance in school. Even students who usually get good grades can get too stressed. They might quit school and work full time to support their family. But if they could finish school in three years, they might have a better chance to graduate and then work full time. Some students might graduate early to take a year off, which is okay too.

Even if you don't know how, it will be fun to try.\n\nNext, camping can teach you big lessons. It can show you that living outside is hard. You need to build your own place to sleep, start a fire to stay warm, and you can't use electricity to talk to someone. These hard things make you thankful that many people in the world live like this.\n\nLastly, you will do many fun things. You can walk in the woods to find food, or look for animals like a bunny, raccoon, or even a big brown bear if you're brave.\n\nAfter your fun adventure, you can sit with your family and tell scary stories that will make you all shiver. Or, if they don't like scary stories, they can talk about happy times they've had. And for more fun, you can eat s'mores made with cookies, marshmallows, and tasty chocolate. That sounds great, doesn't it?\n\nIf you've never camped before, you should try it. Camping will give you great times with your family, show you the wild, and teach you about camping life.

{"text_id": "8D00FE53EC71", "output_essay": "Should students pick a job when they start high school? Do you agree or disagree?\n\nI disagree because they are too young to pick a job as they start high school. A job needs a lot of responsibility, and they need to learn more before choosing a job path. To choose what you want to do for your whole life, you need to know a lot and be ready. I think that if students get good grades, like A, B, or C, and pass, they can think about a job in the 10th grade, but not in the 9th grade. So, I don't think students should come to high school and pick a job right away, especially since half of the 9th graders are failing.\n\nFirst, some students who start high school don't know about being responsible yet. A job is a big deal, usually for older students. By the 10th grade, if they pass English 10, they can pick a job and prepare for it. They can choose any job they like, such as nursing or fixing cars, and then study for it.\n\nSecond, if they are 16, they can pick a job, but if not, they can't. They are too young. Like me, I didn't get a chance. I wanted to be a nurse, but I couldn't. Now, I think I'll go to college to become a teacher, or I'm not sure because I also think about being famous, like acting in a movie. As a junior, I still don't know what job I want because we didn't get to study other things. I wish we had more choices in school, not just nursing, because not everyone gets a chance, even if they try.\n\nThird, I think they should talk to students about jobs before 10th grade and ask if they're ready for a job. But they are young and shouldn't have to choose so soon. If they are 16 or older, they should be allowed to pick a job, but if they're younger, they shouldn't. They should learn about jobs but not be pushed to pick one.\n\nIn my opinion, they shouldn't let students pick a job because they are too young and need to learn about being responsible. For example, my best friend, Generic_Name, is in 9th grade and knows about responsibility; she looks after her little brother and knows she wants to be a soccer player. She is good at soccer and is a nice and good friend. We need more 9th graders like her who know about being responsible. But there are 9th graders who don't even respect their teachers and families, which shows they don't know about being responsible yet. They should respect their teachers and families because that shows they are responsible. Some students who start high school don't respect others, even those in higher grades. That's why they shouldn't pick a job first; they need to show respect to their teachers, families, and themselves."}

Trying to be like someone else can make you look cool and popular. But, it can also make you lose sight of who you are and what you can do in this world. Most people pretend to be someone else to seem cool or to get more attention from friends. But not everyone does this for the same reason. Some people do it because they don't like themselves, their background, or how they were brought up. These people are often teased and laughed at because of where they're from, their clothes, or their religion. This makes them dislike themselves and who they are. It forces them to act like someone else so they can fit in where they couldn't before. Moreover, people shouldn't have to pretend to be someone else to be liked or to fit in. And they shouldn't hate themselves because others made fun of them. Everyone's life is worth more than anything else in the world. People should love and accept who they are and what they believe in. They shouldn't forget who they are and try to be someone else. Only you have the power to be you."}
{"text_id": "7B62DF12389F", "output_essay": "Self-esteem can help many students reach their goals. Later, they will feel more confident and be surprised when they think about their past. But first, students need to start at the beginning and build their confidence step by step. They should try new things in different parts of life because self-esteem will give them new experiences and challenges.\n\nFirst, to learn new things, students need self-esteem. Being confident helps students show who they are and be their best. Even if teachers praise students for work that isn't perfect, it will make them more confident. Then, many of their dreams will come true. When they see what they've done, they will feel proud. This is important for people and students everywhere. Being different is also important when students have self-esteem.\n\nSecond, self-esteem helps students feel good about what they have and become more confident. It lets them share their feelings, and sometimes doing well at something is the best way to feel good about themselves. This helps students talk to more classmates and share what they want. It also makes others want to be like them because being a good person is a good way to learn, and self-esteem will show them the right way in life.\n\nLast, self-esteem can help students by making them better at things, like talking to other students in class. Being helpful makes self-esteem stronger. People will be very happy with who they are. It also teaches students about what they've done in life so far. That's why being confident is good for students and others.\n\nIn conclusion, being confident or having self-esteem can give students many chances to reach their goals. Self-esteem is very important for many people and students. Also, being positive with others is good. So, be the best you can be with strong self-esteem."}

Students can use an extra year to get ready for college or to look for work. Some think differently, but they may not see that we're prepared for college after three years. We gain the experience and knowledge we need. Four years can be unfair to those who are ready to move on. Often, students work and study at the same time. This can lead to poor grades. They might work from 5:30 in the evening until 11:30 at night. Some of my friends struggle to graduate because work distracts them, and they start failing. We need the extra year to focus on important things like college and jobs. High school is there to get us ready for college. In three years, we learn plenty. We don't need four years. Of course, it's different for each student. It depends on whether they want to learn and succeed, or if they just want to waste time."}

Also, when meeting the family of someone I want to date, I need to be very respectful and kind. In life, we can sometimes fix bad first impressions, but it's hard because everyone has tough times or problems at home. We can turn bad times into better ones, though. At home, we need to act differently, especially around kids. When we are in public, we should be respectful to others.

But they couldn't give me more because we didn't have it, and there were many kids at home. So, I asked my neighbor, who owned a small coffee business, if I could work for him, drying the coffee and stirring it. He said yes. He paid me about 1 dollar a day. As a kid, with 1 dollar, you can buy lots of things like candy. I was so happy when I got paid, I even cried.\n\nIf I hadn't asked my neighbor for work, I wouldn't have gotten the job.\n\nI know a musician named Romeo Santos. He was in a group with three others. He was the main guy; he wrote the songs and sang lead. They were famous. Some liked them, some didn't. They were pretty good. I don't know what happened inside the group. Maybe Romeo Santos felt he was stuck in a routine. Maybe he wanted more money, didn't like the others, or saw he could do better alone. He left the group to go solo. He became very famous in Latin America. He's been making the best bachata for years. Bachata is a music style from the Dominican Republic. I don't know when it started or who started it. I think he wouldn't be who he is if he hadn't left the group. They might have been good together, but not as good as he is now.\n\nI think Ralph Waldo Emerson's words are true.\n\nSincerely,\n\nGeneric_Name."}

In Generic_City, this option is available, so students can graduate a year early. This might be a good or bad thing for your future. Think about going to college for a job you want, but things don't work out as you hoped. If you stay in high school for all four years, you might get a scholarship for college. Schools offer extra classes in the summer or during the year. These help students get enough credits to graduate early. If you're not doing well in school, it's best to stay for all four years. But if you're doing well and know what you want to do, finishing early could be good. You can start your life sooner, and we only live once. Staying in school for four years can lead to a great future. You can choose which colleges to apply to or start working right away. Some good jobs need a high school diploma. For a job that pays well, you might need extra classes. I suggest staying in high school for four years. This way, you can plan your career. People who graduate early often start working right away. I think you should finish high school in four years. But if you want to start early, you can. Just be careful not to rush too much."}
{"text_id": "62A77EDBF3AB", "output_essay": "I agree with Emerson because we should always be who we are. In our world, people often try to change others. Take this for example: 'I visit a friend who likes soccer. I don't like it, but I act like I do to make him happy.' This shows me being fake just to please someone else, and that's why I agree with Emerson that we should stay true to ourselves. \n\nWhen we pretend to be someone else, it makes us look bad. Others may think we have no life of our own. They believe we only live to make them happy. Some people act like someone else because they feel left out. They change their behavior, but this is not right. By being fake to get others to like them, they seem sad because they are not being true to themselves. \n\nThe most important reason I agree with Emerson is that people will always want us to be what they desire. They will try to change us, but we get to choose. We can pretend to be someone else or just be who we are. In the end, I believe we should be ourselves and not worry about what others think. We only have one life, and we should live it in the best way by being true to ourselves."}
{"text_id": "0C63B6A59CD3", "output_essay": "Many people say that if they don't try new things, they won't improve. Often, people don't realize what they can do until they try. For instance, Generic_Name didn't know she was good at swinging until she gave it a go. After that, she found out she was skilled and began teaching kids to swing. Now, those kids are teaching others. Some think they don't need to try what they know. But trying things they are good at can change who they are. It can help others find what they love and help them grow too. \n\nTrying new things helps people get better. When I was in middle school, I didn't like math. Starting high school, I wasn't sure if I'd do well. I didn't want to be in math class at first. But then I liked how my teacher taught. She taught me a lot. Sometimes, my friends needed help, and I helped them. This made me more patient. I got better by learning and helping others. Trying new things can help others find what they love. For example, my brother joined the army and found his passion there. He thought he wouldn't stay long, but after three months, he decided to stay. He came home happy, sharing stories about his training and missions. His stories made me want to join the army when I turn 18. I want to help the country that gave me and other immigrants hope. I know joining the army is risky, but it's about helping others. \n\nIn conclusion, trying what you know can show you what you love and help you grow. It's like trying new food without knowing if it's good for you. Finding new loves and growing is the best thing you can do. Sometimes, fear of failure stops people from trying."}

I believe that if we try again after making mistakes, we will improve. In this essay, I will talk more about this idea. 'Unless' lets us have a successful life without feeling the sting of past failures. In my geometry class, I got a bad grade on a test. I felt weak but at the same time strong, because I believed I could do better if I tried again. And I did better when I retook the test. So, never give up.\n\nFirst, if we always feel strong, we won't feel like we have failed. It doesn't matter what happened before. Just try again and believe in yourself, and you will get better.\n\nSecond, when I mess up, I don't give up. I try again with more energy. I don't feel useless or without hope. I work hard to improve. Like I mentioned, I made errors in school, but I corrected them by thinking 'unless'.\n\nThird, never give up. I've learned that people who have goals succeed. They reach their goals and they get better.\n\nTo end, I think that 'unless' and strength can make our lives happy. Don't dwell on past mistakes. Look forward to your future and think about what you can do to succeed and improve. This is why I don't agree with Emerson. Life isn't perfect. It has failures and errors.

This is what it means to have a positive attitude. And this is how you can do well. Why do we focus on being positive? Because it can change your life. Here's another way to think about it: 'Having a positive attitude is like fixing a flat tire. Without fixing it, you can't go anywhere.' In life, without a positive attitude, you can't succeed. To make it clearer, being positive is good for you. It helps you believe you can solve your problems. And that's right. You can do it because you think in a good way.

I think that technology can make life easier, but it can also cause problems. It can make people less social, sick, and lead to bad behavior.\n\nFirst, being social is important because it helps you make friends and get along with others. If you are friendly, you can have lots of friends and have fun, like going to movies or shopping.\n\nSecond, using technology too much can harm your health. For example, you might hurt your eyes or feel sad and frustrated. These issues are serious. Our eyes help us a lot, and if we hurt them, life gets hard. Feeling sad can also make you choose poorly, and you might even think about hurting yourself.\n\nThird, technology can make kids and teens act out. Playing games is popular and can be good or bad. It's good because it's fun and relaxing. But it can be bad if you get addicted. Some games make people angry, mean, and not care about others. This can lead to violence.\n\nAlso, technology can be helpful. We can read books online or look up facts. But I believe the bad things about technology are bigger than the good things.

They would feel sad, worn out, and many parents would be upset at the principal's office. They had plans for a great family trip. So, students should get a long summer break instead of just 1 or 2 weeks. This is because they will do better in school, summer is a great time to go outside, and it's healthy for them. \n\nThe first reason students need a long summer break is to do better in school and get higher grades. Many teens will use the break to improve their grades because they want to enjoy time with friends. They will work harder in school to enjoy their long break later. If they pass, they won't have to go to summer school for a month. Some students might not use their chances well, but summer gives them another shot to catch up and still have a month to enjoy and travel. \n\nThe second reason for a long summer break is that most students want it to go out, explore, and try new things. They can swim, travel, and relax. For example, they can visit beaches in their state or other countries. They like parties and want to have them when school's out so they can stay up late. They will enjoy nature's beauty in summer more than in a cold winter break. They will learn about life and cultures in one summer. They might see different ways of living and understand how school helps them reach their dreams, like getting a house or a car. \n\nThe third reason for a long summer break is that it's good for their health, both mind and body. Students can relax from school stress and problems. After a school year, many are grumpy, but a good break with new sights and fresh air can help them think clearly. Warm weather can make them happier and more comfortable. They can also get physically healthier by walking, running, biking, and drinking water. Many places open in summer for biking or walking, and parks are available for enjoying nature and resting. In summer, people go outside, which can bring peaceful moments. \n\nIn conclusion, a long summer break helps students finish the school year with great grades. It's also the time they're used to spending with family and friends. Lastly, summer helps some students feel healthier by giving them chances to exercise and find peace in good weather."}

I agree because your life looks better when you make your own choices and feel better about yourself. Your life looks better because it shows you are free. It shows you won't let others put you down and you will stand up for yourself when you need to. Choosing for yourself shows others that you are not just doing what they tell you. Your life will be better when you lead and don't just follow others.\n\nFirst, I believe everyone's life will be better because I saw a girl who never let others put her down. Her name was Generic_Name, and she knew what she had to do. She proved to those who wanted to change her that she could make it on her own, and she ended up very happy. If you stay true to yourself and don't worry about what others want you to be, your life will be great and full of success. Some people will try to push you to do bad things, but you must be strong and say, 'I am going my own way.' This shows you will be free, a good example, and have a great life.\n\nSecond, choosing for yourself tells a lot about you and others. Not everyone wants you to do well, so they will try to change you. Being your own person means making your own choices and not letting others control how you feel or who you are. Choose for yourself and show you can make it and do well in the American dream. Once, I met a boy who couldn't decide for himself. I told him, 'You can also be your own person and make your own choices.' He did it and felt very proud and lived his life fully.\n\nThird, being true to yourself makes you more confident and proud. When you feel proud, you won't listen to others who try to make you look bad. When I felt less proud, I would listen to others and not be true to myself. I would let others sway me and make poor choices. For example, when I started to be independent, I focused more, was more myself, and showed I didn't need others to define me. Not everyone can stand on their own and say they did well by themselves. Knowing you did something great makes you feel proud and shows others they can't bother you.\n\nIn conclusion, being true to yourself is a big success. You will show a lot of strength and freedom in the future. Making your own choices is hard for some, but if you can, it's a great ability in a world where people try to change you. Being proud in this way shows you're strong enough to be different and to speak up. Your life will be bright, and it will be the best thing you do and a great skill. Don't listen to others; go your own way, be yourself, and feel proud at the end of the day. I think this point is very strong because of my examples and details."}

If we don't do anything, we won't reach our goals. For instance, to be a doctor, you need to study a lot, go to school, and pay attention in class. If you just sit around, you waste time that could be used to achieve something. Successful people work very hard. They work, study, and keep busy. School is important. Going to high school every day matters. High school can be tough, but if you keep doing your work and hand in your homework, you'll get good grades. You need to study for big tests and smaller ones to do well. If you don't take part in class or miss school, you won't achieve anything. Hard work and staying busy can take you far. Jobs like lawyers, teachers, doctors, and police officers require constant activity. They are successful because they work hard every day. Watching TV and lying on the couch won't help you succeed. Going to school and doing activities will help you reach your goals, but you have to try. To lose weight, you need to eat healthily and exercise. Eating junk food won't help you lose weight.

Sometimes people think these things because they don't know much about you.\n\nI believe first thoughts are hard to change. People will share their opinions about you, about how you seem. Some might not say anything but will think it. Some people think you can change first thoughts, but I don't agree. Your first thoughts about someone will always be there, even if it's just in your mind. I think first thoughts will always be important, especially when you meet new people."}
{"text_id": "47925F54FD13", "output_essay": "Can you believe that 85% of people like to work in groups? The University of California says most people want to do their work with others. We are all different, with different skills and ways of acting. Some like to work in groups, and some like to work alone. What I mean is, it depends on the person. I like to work with others. It's good because it helps you get better at talking to people and it saves time.\n\nFirst, there are many good things about working in groups. It helps you talk better and feel more sure of yourself. For example, people in a group bring different knowledge and ideas. I remember when I moved to the United States, I was very shy. My English teacher told me to work with other students and say what I think. I was scared, but I did it. They listened to me carefully, and it made me feel good. I became more confident. Also, I like to work with others. When I have homework or need to study, I talk about it with some students. We share what we know. I listen to them because they might know things I don't. A person who works with others usually does better than someone who works alone.\n\nSecond, working with others is good because it saves time and effort. I think working together is better than working alone. This means people who work in a team help each other. They don't waste their strength. They often finish their work on time. This saves time. Teamwork is very important in life. For example, at my job, we think teamwork is key to getting things done. I work as a cashier at Whole Foods Market. My main job is to help customers. But if there are no customers, I help my coworkers, like those who stock shelves, work with produce, or clean. What I like about teamwork, especially on busy days like Saturday and Sunday, is that people from other areas come to help us bag groceries. This helps us finish our work faster and make our customers happy.\n\nIn conclusion, working in a group is good because it helps you talk to people better and feel more sure of yourself. When you work in a group, you share what you know and learn from others. I think working together is better than working alone. People who work in a team usually help each other. This saves time and effort. Working together is better than working alone!"}
{"text_id": "123ABDB6A15D", "output_essay": "Albert Schweitzer once said that the best way to influence others is by being a good example yourself. But some may ask if there are better ways. It's hard to set a good example because not everyone is affected by what you do or say. In this essay, I will talk about how people respond to influence, the kinds of personalities they have, and how they see each other. \n\nPeople respond to influence in ways that might seem strange, but it's true. Many people need help, but we don't see it because we're too focused on ourselves. We rarely try to understand what someone else is going through. We all have hard times and want to share our feelings, but fear of judgment or lack of trust can stop us. Those who can influence others feel great because they help themselves by helping others. They encourage people to share their experiences and move past their troubles. Talking about your own experiences can help many people relate. \n\nPersonalities are important because these days, people often don't value what others have done for them. They forget those who helped them share their problems with the world. Being kind is a powerful way to influence others because you truly want to help, and they can connect with you. For instance, many YouTubers share stories for views or pretend to be someone they're not. People might support them or not trust them. Over time, they become important, but fame can change them. They act differently because they want fame. Remember those who supported you and how they related to you, because your personality is what makes you stand out. \n\nHow we see others is a big problem today. People judge based on looks or actions. They judge because of how they were raised, but this is wrong. It stops them from getting to know others. How can people seek help if they're afraid to open up due to judgment? But they don't try to understand others. People like to judge and may think others are bad. If they want to influence, people might not connect with them because of how they treat others. They don't realize that the person they judge might be the one who can understand and help them the most. There are always different ways to help. \n\nIn conclusion, start by influencing yourself, and then help others connect with you through your actions. But don't expect anything from those who don't want to help. Expect the same from others. Today, anyone can be an influence, but not everyone will connect with your influence better than you can yourself. I agree with Albert Schweitzer. From my experience, I believe that being a good example will help me influence others in many ways too."}

Working to be a better person can support you when times are tough. But it's tough to get better if you don't work on your goals. For instance, I helped my uncle with roofing. He asked me to work on one side. I tried, but I made many mistakes. He showed me the right way, and I got better at it. Working and getting better is more useful than doing nothing and trying to get better. To get better in life, you can ask others for advice and learn more at school. Stay away from people who will pull you down. Keep working on getting better so you can chase your dreams and do something big in life. This can help others and yourself. In the end, if you want to get better or succeed in your goals, you can finish school early. Then start working on what you want to get better at. This way, you can learn more and help yourself."}

It also helps you find peace, get healthy, have better friendships, feel happy, and be satisfied. Our world is not perfect. It is hard for anyone to live a happy life. People work hard every day to reach their goals and be successful. Everyone has their own problems and challenges to deal with. To beat life's challenges, you must keep trying and not give up. Your attitude, or how you see things, is what pushes you forward. If you always think positively, believe in yourself, and share good vibes with others, you will reach your goals and be successful.\n\nWhen you fail or face hard times, it's important to stay positive and trust in your abilities. Successful people stay positive about their goals, even when things are tough. They don't let bad thoughts get to them. To be successful, you can't give up. You have to keep fighting, no matter what problems come your way. Everyone fails and makes mistakes. For example, if students don't study for a quiz, it's better to stay positive. If they think negatively, they get stressed, and this stops them from thinking clearly.\n\nThinking positively is the best thing because you see life in a better way. I believe in God and that everything happens for a reason. If something bad happens, it's because it wasn't meant for you. My mother complains about everything at home, and this negative thinking makes life hard. I think that's why she often gets sick. So, you should always think positively, believe in yourself, and never give up. Always believe that you can do what you set out to do.\n\nIn conclusion, your attitude is what matters. While skills help you in your career, attitude is the base. It's the main thing that builds your life, dreams, and achievements. It may sound too perfect, but we often choose our own sadness. That's why I decided to make a big change. I wanted to change who I am into who I want to be. Wishing not to be sad doesn't help if you don't do anything about it. You can't expect to have a dream that tells you what to do next. There are no easy answers or successes without effort. You can't have peace without being upset first, and you can't stop feeling pain without crying."}

It helps students because they can pick long careers and finish them faster. Finishing high school in three years is better. It gives you a year off. During this time, you can think about what to study in college. If you're not sure what job you want, you can use the break to decide on a college major. Starting college early lets you make more choices and find the best way for your work life. My brother, for example, wants to be a doctor. This takes 5 to 7 years of study. That's a long time. So, finishing high school in three years helped him start his career early and reach his work goals. Finishing high school early and going to college can help you start living on your own. You can work after school and help your parents pay for college. It's not just about finishing high school. You need to start making your life. Being responsible helps you become a grown-up. In the end, these three-year high school programs are a big chance for students who want to go to college sooner. If all high schools had these programs, more students could go to college.

But, it's not a good idea for students to finish high school early and go to college. This is because they have to go to school in the summer, they have too much work, and they need time to get ready for the future.\n\nFirst, students go to school in the summer. For example, some may go to school six days a week and only have one day off. So, they can't enjoy their summer break. This shows why it's not good for students to finish high school in three years and then go to college.\n\nNext, students have too much work. They have to study for tests and do their homework. Often, they might stay up late to get their work done. They are always busy with things like homework or studying. This shows the problems for students who finish high school in three years and then go to college.\n\nThird, students need time to get ready for the future. They need time to prepare for college and think about their future jobs. Some might want to spend more time with their family. This is another reason why finishing high school in three years and starting college right away is hard.\n\nIn summary, students need time to enjoy their summer, to rest instead of always doing homework or studying, and to think about their future.

But the first impression usually changes you the most. Anything new that happens to you can make you change. A first impression is like a warning, and the first time something affects you, it pushes you to get better or worse results. \n\nWhen something makes a big first impression, it tells you to do something. For example, if you're in class and forget your homework, your teacher will notice. They might say, 'Hey! Where is your homework?' If you say you forgot, this is when your teacher will tell you to remember next time. This is because you said you wouldn't do it, but your teacher wants you to. \n\nThe first time you feel pressure is when you're most likely to change. A study from last month says that new experiences can make us change. It doesn't matter if it changes your thoughts, your plans, or anything else; it will make you want to change. \n\nThe first time something happens, it can lead to good or bad results. It's up to you to choose. Either way, it can change you based on what you know. \n\nSo, first experiences can change us. It depends on what we need and how we react. If you try something new that's better than what you had, you'll want to keep using the new thing. This is a change that brings new ideas and things to use.

You won't think things like, 'I can't do it.' If I go to Generic_City for a holiday, I'll think, 'This will be the best holiday ever.' You should think the same way next year. Without a positive view, you won't enjoy your break. Don't think, 'This holiday will be bad.' That will only make it come true. \n\nAnother reason to be positive is to be happy.

Many teens want to work after school, play sports, or join in school activities.\n\nFirst, many students want to work after school to enjoy themselves or to save money for college. Often, they can't because their parents won't let them. I believe working as a teen helps you learn skills and figure out what you want to do later in life. Parents try to give everything, not realizing they won't always be there to help. They should let their kids try new things and be responsible.\n\nSecond, we often want to play sports after school, but too much homework gets in the way. Our parents tell us to finish homework before we can go out and play. That's why I think finishing high school in 3 years isn't good for us. We need to keep our minds and bodies active. But parents may not see that, and we can get depressed. This makes us do worse in school and act out.\n\nThird, we teens want to take part in school events and have fun. But we're usually too busy with online classes or homework. It's hard to find time for school clubs because of all the work or things our parents want us to do. One day, our parents might realize that too much school work wasn't the best for us.\n\nIn conclusion, too much school work can cause stress, lead to depression, or result in bad grades because it's too much to handle.

If you show up looking unprofessional, you won't make a good first impression. We all mess up sometimes when we meet new people or a potential boss. Maybe you acted in a way you thought was okay, or you said something you thought was fine but it wasn't.

You can't change your thoughts once you've had them, like your first thoughts about people. Changing your first impression is like changing a light bulb that still works. It doesn't make a difference. You've already made up your mind. You can't change what you've already thought. Some people think you can change your first impressions, but they are mistaken. How can you change what has already happened? For example, you might think a girl looks like she steals. Later, you might think she doesn't steal. Your first thought was she steals, but as you get to know her, you think differently. But your first thought will always be the same. It's like your first love. No matter what, that person was your first. To sum up, you can't change your first impression. It's already happened. If you can't change the past, you can't change your first impression."}

Being positive helps you do better and find peace inside, like having good health. For instance, my relationship with my girlfriend got much better, which made me happy and content. If people stay positive, believe in themselves, and share good vibes, they will get to where they want to be. I also wonder about my future. In five years, I think I'll be working at a big company in California, Hpath A/C. Then, I think about others. Will they do well in a store, or are they ready for the world outside, like I am?

This lets them start college or work a year sooner.\n\nBeing one year ahead of others is a big plus for reaching their dreams. It's smart for students to finish high school in three years. This way, students from other places who had to begin again can catch up. Also, being ahead by one year in college is a big plus.\n\nFirst, it helps students to finish high school in three years and start college early. This is because students from other places who had to start again can catch up and finish on time. For instance, Generic_Name, who moved to the U.S. from Mexico, should be in 10th grade by her age. But she doesn't speak English well, so she was put in 9th grade.\n\nGeneric_Name can join a program to finish high school in three years. This way, she can catch up and not do an extra year. The program also lets Generic_Name start college on time. Finishing high school in three years is smart. It helps students from other places who had to begin again.\n\nAlso, finishing high school early is good because being one year ahead in college or work is a big plus for many students. For example, Generic_Name wants to work for a year and then go to college. The program would help Generic_Name reach his goals faster. Finishing high school early is a big plus for students with goals like getting two college degrees. Schools should let students finish high school early. It's a big plus to be one year ahead.\n\nSome might say that students should stay in high school for all four years. They think students will learn more without too much stress. This point is valid because students might feel stressed with many classes and lots of school time. But, finishing school early can help students who don't want to stay in school too long. For example, Generic_Name doesn't like coming to school and wants to finish fast. Generic_Name can choose the program and finish school early. This way, he won't have to stay in school longer than he wants.\n\nIn conclusion, the program that lets students finish high school early is good for them. Students will do better with one year ahead to start college or work. Giving students from other places the chance to join this program will help them catch up and finish on time. Even though some think finishing high school in three years is bad because of the stress, it's a big plus for those who want to go to college and for people from other places who had to start over."}

They happen when we meet new people, look for a job, talk to someone, or just see someone for the first time. So, what is a first impression? It's the feeling we get the first time we meet someone, and it's very hard to change it later on. First, a first impression can be good or bad; it sticks in our mind. It makes us remember what we first thought about someone, like 'that person was mean,' or 'they were nice.' For example, I once saw a boy help an old woman cross the street in the park. Right then, I thought he was kind. The next day, I remembered him as kind because of what I saw before. It's tough to change this kind of thought. Another point is that when we hear bad things, we form a bad first impression and try to stay away. This makes it hard for us to understand the other side, and we can't change our first thought. Like in middle school, I had a classmate who always looked unhappy. No one knew why. We didn't try to be her friend, and neither did I.

It's because each morning is a chance to forget the bad things, like if you made a mistake on Monday or laughed at someone who tripped on Thursday. No matter what happened, take it as a lesson that not all days are the same. My second point is about my family. Without them, I wouldn't be here. I smile and stay positive for them. If I don't show I'm thankful, it's not fair. They might think they did something wrong. But really, we're the ones who should be showing we're thankful for them. My third point is to be true to yourself. If you are, you'll be surrounded by positive people. Don't worry about what others think. For example, if you see someone having a hard time, what do you do? Laugh, ignore them, or help? I would help because it's the right thing to do and it shows you're a positive person. That's important in life. Those are my three reasons for staying positive. Yours might be different, but I hope you can see how being positive works for me and that you can do it too. As I end this, think about what being positive means to you and how you can share it with others."}
{"text_id": "1EFFE819A2DC", "output_essay": "Emerson's idea about being yourself has been talked about by many. Some may not agree with Emerson, but his idea is right when it comes to being yourself because many people can like their jobs and their lives. Right now, 6 out of 10 people do not like their jobs because of what others say. For instance, my aunt does not like her job cleaning houses because her parents told her not to go to college and just work. She comes home tired and upset because she hates her job. This means if my aunt had not listened to her parents and picked a job she hates, she might not be so mad and tired all the time. It is very important to be yourself and choose for yourself. Many people in the world will try to change you and make you someone you're not. For example, some people lie about who they love because their family or friends won't accept them. On TV, you see a lot of bullying against gay people, and sometimes they kill themselves. This shows that people end their lives because they can't be happy living as someone they're not. People get tired of being pushed to change. To sum up, Emerson's idea is good for us. People can like their jobs more if they do what they enjoy. They can also be free to be themselves and have a good life. For these reasons, the best thing you can do in this world is to be yourself."}

This can be very hard to get past.\n\nChanging what someone thinks of you at first is hard. For instance, I can't change my first feeling or belief. Also, if I believe something first, I won't change it just because someone tells me to. I must trust myself to do well in life.\n\nBut sometimes, we need to make a good impression on certain people to get them to trust us. This is hard because we might not have the skills to impress them, and that's why we can't change what others think of us.\n\nThis issue affects many people. For example, people who don't like to speak in front of a group will find it even harder to talk or give a speech in public.\n\nIn the end, I totally believe that it's almost impossible to change impressions, and we have to live with this forever."}
{"text_id": "9BEB865D0B79", "output_essay": "Being negative, grumpy, and rude won't help you in life! Smiling when you're with others shows you're nice and have a good attitude. Think about it, no one likes to be around a person who ruins the mood and isn't fun, right? That's not how you make friends or get people to want to spend time with you.\n\nImagine you had a job or college interview. Would you get the job or be accepted if you were rude? When I had my Nursing Program interview last year, I dressed well, felt sure of myself, and was happy. I showed I really wanted to be there and cared about it. If I hadn't, they wouldn't have let me into the program. You only live once. In this country, you either fail or succeed. Some people fail because they can't talk nicely to others.\n\nSometimes at school, you might take a test and think you'll fail. You might tell your friends or even the teacher you'll fail. Then you do fail because you were so negative. Now you're upset because your grade will go down, and your parents will be unhappy with you for not doing well.\n\nIn conclusion, always be positive in life. Your attitude shows a lot about you. This is very important when you meet someone for the first time. You don't want to ruin that. Be positive at school and in interviews. Some people struggle because they can't get a good job. They need the government's help to pay their bills. This is often because they can't talk well. You have to really want something to get it; nothing is just given to you."}

So, I stand with those who do. Many people try to help others feel better. It's good to have more people feeling good in the world. Sometimes, people are mad for no reason. They don't see that they seem mean to others and make those around them feel bad. They should become nicer over time. If they don't, some people won't want to be near them because they are always in a bad mood. For example, once I went to eat with my family, and one manager was yelling. My mom tried to order, but he was mean. Another manager was kind and said he never gets mad at customers; he's always in a good mood. Everyone liked that and said they would love to come back every day. My family also thinks that being happy helps you do well in life. Another point is that you should be happy and smile when you meet people. Be respectful when someone talks to you. Stay away from people who are always in a bad mood. They think they look cool, but they don't. They are not nice, so you should always try to be in a good mood. Lastly, you should help people, including your family, feel better. Maybe your sister or cousin doesn't know that being in a good mood helps you succeed. You have to show others how to do it. Being in a good mood is very important. You need it everywhere, and it can make your life better. You will be a nicer person and have a brighter future. I hope most people will start to be in a good mood because it helps you do well in life. They should always support people who are in a good mood because it's good for you, your family, and everyone around you."}

Some people think it's tough to change how people see you for the first time. The things you go through can change how people see you for the first time. This is because everyone is different. One person might be friendly, another might be quiet, someone else might be funny, and another might be dull or full of energy. These traits shape how people see you at first. And it's not just people you meet. Your boss and coworkers also notice how you act at first. At work, you show how professional you are, like in a job interview or while doing your job. What you've done in life shows people what kind of person you are. For example, if you were in the army, people might guess that from how you look. Your experiences could be anything, like traveling the world or finishing college and high school. These things show who you are. How you look is very important. If you wear loose pants, a long shirt, have messy hair, or shoes with holes, people might think certain things about you. But looking good can change what they think. If I wear a pretty dress and nice black shoes, and my hair looks good, people might think, 'Where did she get that dress?' or 'Her hair looks nice today.' People make quick judgments based on how you look. Changing a first impression is not impossible. Some people believe you can change how people see you for the first time through what you've been through. In the future, what you go through will still change how people see you at first. That's just how life works; your experiences shape how people see you at first."}

You might want to study in college for a long time, handle family problems, or skip extra classes. Students should pick their own future paths. \n\nStudying in college for a long time is good for students who want to figure out their careers. Many students my age finish early to become nurses or doctors, which takes a lot of college time. I want to finish early to have more time for college. Jobs that need a higher degree often pay more to those who studied longer. \n\nAlso, family problems make some students finish early instead of quitting school. They might be expecting a baby or need to care for a sick relative. Some of my friends are becoming parents and need time to work and earn money for their child. My brother thought about summer school to help with our sick grandma when I was ten. Finishing early can give students time with family before they die. \n\nBesides, classes like art or music are not needed for most of us. We could leave school early or finish it early if we skip these classes. This is smart because it helps us finish school faster. \n\nLastly, finishing early matters to some because it lets us study longer in college or help our families. If I could, I would finish early to take care of my family. High schools should let us decide how we spend our time. You can do well just like others who finished high school early."}

Some people think it is tough to change your mind after you meet someone for the first time. The kind of experience you have can change your first thought. This is because everyone is different. Some people might be dull, shy, or funny. These traits shape the first thought you give others. How hard you try says a lot about the first thought you make. It is the best way to show you are a pro. The way you act around people is important. Sometimes people judge you by your looks or what you do. For example, at a job interview, the boss will watch how you act and move. The boss wants to make sure you fit the job well. At work, they want people who are kind to customers and have good manners. Every person's experience is different. If you finished high school and college, it might show the boss you have lived through good experiences. How you look is very important. You might wear dresses, pants, and dress well. People will always judge you and think many things about you. Looking great can change what they think. Once, I was at the mall in a blue dress, and people stared. They wondered why I was wearing a dress there. They judged me by my look without knowing where I came from. Wherever you go, people will have ideas about you just by your looks. Not everyone is bad because of their traits. You should meet the person and spend time with them. Looks can be deceiving. It's hard to change first thoughts because of the way you act.

This is because you will move ahead, reach your goals, and be able to talk in front of a class. Being true to yourself is key because you need to believe in yourself to keep going. For instance, picture having to give a talk. If you don't speak, you'll fail. But you're afraid to face the crowd because you think they won't like what you have to say. After an hour, you choose to step up. This shows you don't need to be perfect to achieve something and move on. In our world, even a bit of 'being yourself' helps when working for a big company. Before you get the job you want, you must go through an interview. Being real helps a lot because you must answer questions truthfully. That's when many get nervous. If they're too nervous, they won't answer well. This is bad. They might mess up and miss their chance. That's why being confident matters. If you're not, you won't realize what you've lost. Let's talk about students as an example. Many students in high school or college feel stressed. They don't like giving presentations. It's tough for them to share their thoughts in front of others. They worry their friends will judge them. This can make them less motivated. Having goals is also important, especially for the young. We should all have goals after high school or in college. Some goals need you to do things again and again or to be brave. Say you want to be a reporter. A reporter must talk to people and ask questions. This takes bravery and self-belief. Maybe if we all tried harder to trust in ourselves, we would achieve more."}

Do what makes you happy without letting others get in the way or try to change you.\n\nStaying true to yourself in this world is hard because you face challenges every day that try to alter who you are. Take parents, for instance. Some parents push their kids to pick a job they don't like just because it's the job the parents wanted but couldn't have. They forget that everyone has the right to make their own choices, to pick a job that excites them, feels right, and makes them proud of what they've done.\n\nYou'll meet many people who'll try to change you. Like with friends, when one of your so-called 'friends' tries to get you to do bad things or make poor choices because they do them too. If your friends teach you to smoke or steal from stores and it feels wrong, don't do it just to fit in. Don't let others lead you down a bad path if you know you're not like that. Be yourself; true friends will get that you don't want to do wrong and will like you for who you are.\n\nIn the end, being true to yourself despite many challenges is the biggest thing you can do in life, and not many people manage it. Being yourself means you're at ease with who you are, and you follow your heart without anyone else butting in. Don't let challenges shake up your core and who you want to be.

If someone starts a job thinking it will fail, this will make their work worse. A thing is more likely to do well and be helpful if the person making it thinks it will do well. Someone who thinks a project will fail won't try very hard. They will think that no matter how hard they try, the result won't change. This way of thinking is bad for getting things done because being negative makes the final thing worse. Being positive is very important to do a job well. Also, being positive helps people be brave. It can make people want to try new things because they hope for good results. People grow by trying new things with hope, and things turn out well when they stay hopeful all the way through.\n\nSome people think being positive doesn't help you succeed. They believe it gives false hope. They say it doesn't change whether you reach your goals. People who don't care or don't want to try are the ones who think this way. Others only believe in hard facts. They think about things in a clear way. But being positive is better because it pushes people to succeed. Not caring doesn't help you get anywhere because you won't take chances. Realistic people only think about facts and forget about being encouraged.\n\nEven though being realistic can be good sometimes, being positive is better. This is because hopeful people try harder, which means they do more. Also, people like to work with someone who is cheerful. It might be easy to think you can't change the future, but this is a very bad way to think. This bad feeling stops you from succeeding. You can't win without wanting to and having a good view of what's ahead. Hoping for the best can make you work hard and keep going. So, we can't ignore how important it is to think positively.

It's not easy to finish in three years. It means skipping ahead, learning more quickly, and not having time for all classes during the day. Finishing school in three years is not a good plan. Some teachers may think four years is too long. But we can't rush to let students finish in three years. Some students are very smart. They know all the answers to their homework and tests. But they can't just skip ahead to a higher grade. Every 9th grader expects to be in 12th grade for a full year. It's important to go through each grade. Students need to pass all their classes and the final test to be ready to graduate. Students and teachers spend four years going to classes every day. Students need time to do their homework well. I think students should take their time and not rush. They need to feel sure about their work. We don't need to finish in three years. It's hard to do. But teachers can help us pass our classes. They can give us extra work, help us after school, and make sure we come to class every day. If we miss a class, we might miss a test or homework. Some older students, over 21, would like to finish early. They want to get their diploma sooner. But students from other countries who don't speak English might find it hard. They need time to learn English. But it's up to each student if they want to finish early. Some have to because of their age. Schools should have programs for finishing in three years.

I also think that most students want a normal high school life. They want to take regular classes and finish in four years. High school is tough and requires hard work.

Without hard work, they can't get what they want. It's like solving a problem or making something; they need to try hard. This is true for students who want to finish school early and go to college.\n\nSecond, they need to be strict with themselves, which is very important. Being strict helps when someone feels like quitting. If they are strict, they won't quit easily. But without it, it's easy to stop trying. That's why everyone needs to be strict to reach their goals.\n\nThird, they should help others. They should give help to those who need it, and by doing this, both can do well in school.

There are good and bad things about finishing high school in three years. The good things are that you don't have to go to school for a fourth year, you can take a break, work, or start getting ready for college sooner. The bad things are that students might not have time to try new things, miss out on extra classes that help with college, and might have to take night or online classes. They also have less time to hang out with friends, have to work harder in those three years, and might not be able to play sports because they have too many classes. For example, if I finished high school in three years, I wouldn't have much time for friends and family. I would need to focus on passing my classes. After high school, I could work, rest, or start college. Finishing in four years is okay, but three years saves time. Most students finish in four years because they want more time for things like sports or being with friends. Students who finish in three years say it saves a lot of time. I think people should finish in three years because of the time it saves. Those who finish in three years are lucky. They get an extra year to think about their future or to work. Most students who finish in three years start applying to colleges and then take a break. A student can also finish college in three years. More than half of the students finish in three years because it is worth it. Starting college early has many benefits. For example, you can finish college early and start working or looking for jobs sooner. Finishing in three years is hard because you have to manage night classes or other things after school.

On good days, I still make mistakes, but fewer. How you look at things matters. If you focus on the good, you will feel better. But if you only see the bad, you will notice more problems. Your mood can change how you act with family, friends, at work, and with new people. If you are happy, others around you will feel happy too. Many jobs look for people with good attitudes. They want to know if you will fit in well. Being positive helps you get along with others and understand them. It also helps you make good choices. Even famous people can have bad attitudes sometimes. I have had bad moods in my life too. When I play sports and I'm in a bad mood, my teammates might feel the same. It's hard to focus, talk to friends, or make choices when you're upset. It's hard to see that you are the problem. I know I can have a really bad attitude and it has caused issues with my family and friends. To be successful, you should always try to be positive. With a positive attitude, you can think clearly and solve your problems. This good mood can help the world by making people care more about each other and the planet. Some people start the day in a bad mood but end up happy. The people around you can affect how you feel. If everyone is upset, you might feel upset too. The same goes for your mood affecting others. Pets, like dogs, can make you feel better. They reflect your mood. How you treat them shows in how they act with others. The same is true for how you treat your children. A bad attitude is not helpful. Being positive helps you see and fix problems. You can also help others or get help. If you're in a bad mood, try to change and be better every day.

Staying in school for four years is okay, but leaving early can be a better choice. The plan is smart. Some students stay the full four years, while others use the program to leave sooner.

It's simple, not bad, and a good choice if you want to get to college faster. The program shortens your high school time. High school is great for some but not for others. If you don't like high school, you can use the program to leave early. If you love school, you can stay the full four years. The program is there to make school easier and help students. Not every school has this program, but the ones that do are worth it because it's easy and helpful. Once you're done, you can graduate, leave school, go to college, start working, or study what you want and start a new life. Some students choose the military after the program. This is a good choice because it's simple and helps pay for college. It's better because you don't have to worry about money for college. But this help isn't free. You must work in the military for some years and you can study at a military base. You can also keep working in the military and serve your country. The program doesn't take up the whole summer. It's just for a part of it—two weeks, one month, or two months. And it's only for 3 or 4 hours a day. This is easier because after class, you can work, go to the park, sleep, or do anything else.

For example, if someone asks you to steal and you say NO, that's the right choice. When you're alone, no one can tell you what to do. You might need help sometimes, but be careful who you ask. Don't just pick someone who will lead you to trouble.

If you're with people who do illegal things and they get caught, the police might think you're part of it too, even if you're not. That's why it's important to pick your friends wisely. Sometimes we're friends with people because they get us, but don't let them make you do bad things. One bad choice can mess up your life.\n\nYou can be on your own without anyone bothering you.

Some people don't like changing their first thoughts; they want to understand the problem. But first thoughts can change as we go through life. A person can act differently with you later, and sticking to your first thoughts can lead to mistakes. Someone might act differently with you over time. Some say first thoughts don't shape their life or who they are, but they can push you to do unexpected things. Meeting someone for the first time can be a big deal in your life. Often, these first meetings set the stage for what comes next. A good friend once told me about someone he met four years ago. At first, he thought this person was very special, but later found out they were faking their interest. That's why we believe our views can change as we get to know someone better. This is why this idea is important. First thoughts can cause you to mess up. They are just opinions or feelings we always pay attention to. We might hurt someone without caring, and that's how we make many mistakes. Some popular people try to act professionally about their opinions of others. Many of us don't think about how our actions can hurt our families. Nowadays, not many people worry about hurting others. That's why we shouldn't trust first impressions too much. If someone impresses you, you might want to change your opinion about them. It's up to you to decide. Believing in first impressions can either inspire or upset you. That's why you might agree with this idea. But also, people who think we should change our first thoughts say so because everyone sees things differently. What matters is what kind of impressions you'll have, whether it's about a new friend or a pet. The mistake is to trust your first opinion of someone you don't know well. I've heard from many students about their experiences with people they just met. They tried to show how important first impressions are. Some didn't believe these students because they thought they didn't know enough, but they were just sharing their views."}

Think about having to stay at school past 2:30 pm to take more classes instead of having fun or joining groups. Imagine spending all your time in high school just studying and doing homework. Is this really good for a student? It's not good for students to finish high school in three years and start college or work a year early. \n\nFirst, we all know high school is a time to remember. Students go to school to learn, but also to have fun, make friends, and enjoy their high school days. Even grown-ups wish they could go back and have that fun again. How can students enjoy high school if they're always studying to graduate early? \n\nSecond, it seems easy to graduate from high school in three years, but it's hard. There's no easy way to succeed. To graduate, you need to pass twenty-two classes. Some schools also want you to take extra classes to graduate. If you try to finish in three years, you'll have a lot of work. You'll get more homework and less free time. Plus, you'll need to study during the summer. I don't think students will be free from stress then! \n\nThird, we need to know what 'learn' means. To learn is to slowly understand things by working, practicing, and getting used to them. But if students take too many math, science, or history classes at once, they're just studying to pass, not really learning. How can students learn if they spend ten hours at school and the rest doing homework? There's no point in finishing a year early. \n\nIn the end, the idea for students to finish high school in three years and start college or work early is not good. High school is a time you should not miss. Do things for yourself; don't be pushed by others. It's very hard to finish high school in three years. And learning well is the most important thing. Let knowledge come to you slowly. Don't hurry it. Be a normal high school student and enjoy the special time."}

First impressions matter a lot. They are like a life jacket that keeps you safe. You should always try to make a good first impression. I have learned from acting on stage that first impressions stick with people. They are hard to forget. When you meet someone for the first time, you should think carefully. Your actions and words can leave a lasting mark. It's like writing a story about yourself that others will read. Your genes play a big role in who you are. But how you act every day is also very important. When you talk to someone older, you share what you have learned. This could be from school, work, or your family. What do you think leaves the biggest mark? First impressions are tough to change. Have you ever tried to change how someone thinks of you? It's not easy. Helping others can leave a good impression. This is very important to remember. Some people think that first impressions don't matter much. But I disagree. As a teacher, I see that what you do and say can affect your life a lot. So, what do you think about first impressions? Are they hard to change? I think they are. And that's why we should always try to make a good one. Remember, it's not just about what you say or do.

This is a good idea because it lets students save money for college, take a break, and get better at managing their time.\n\nOne reason is that students can work for a year to save money for college. Some students want to pay for their own education instead of having their parents do it. Finishing high school early lets them work and save money. For example, if you want to be a teacher but don't have the money, you can finish high school in three years. Then, you can work for a year to save money. After that, you can pay for your own college education.\n\nAnother reason is that students can rest after they finish high school. Going to high school for four years can be very tiring. If they only go for three years, they can take a break. They won't have to get up early, take weekly tests, or worry about grades. For example, a friend finished high school in three years and then traveled for almost a year. She enjoyed it because she didn't have to think about school. Then she started college.\n\nA final reason is that students learn to manage their time well. With only three years to finish high school, they have to plan their time to do projects, study for tests, and finish homework. For instance, a student might have a science project due on Friday and a math test on the same day. He has to plan when to work on the project and when to study for the test. Learning to manage time in high school helps students later in life, like in college or at work.\n\nIn summary, finishing high school in three years can help students save money for college. It's also good for those who are tired of studying and want a break. They can finish early and take a year off before working or going to college. This experience also teaches them to be organized, which will help them in the future."}

I want to chase my dreams and succeed without feeling like I'm no one. I want to make it on my own. There will always be people who try to make you something you're not. For instance, imagine you want to be a firefighter, but you're made to be a mechanic instead. Some might like being mechanics, but others don't, especially if they're not good at it. People just want to follow their dreams and be who they wish to be without feeling they can't be true to themselves. Another point is dealing with people who don't support your life choices. I think you should surround yourself with people who accept you and what you choose to do, jobs included. If someone doesn't support you, it's best to keep them out of your life. Don't let them bring you down or make you doubt your decisions. Don't let them control you just because they think you're wrong. My final point is to think ahead and keep going. I'd rather live in a world where I can be who I want and just ignore any problems that come up. I want people to be proud of me for what I achieve, to say, 'You really did it, and you should be proud of yourself for getting this far and for growing into who you are.' Anyone can achieve things by being true to themselves. It doesn't matter if you're a police officer, dentist, doctor, teacher, or anything else—you can do it and feel good knowing you got there by believing in yourself.

{"text_id": "2A6C395EAC9A", "output_essay": "Schools that let students finish early are not as good as they seem. They can make life hard for students after they leave school. This might shock some people. They might think working hard to finish early means you're ready for life after school. But that's not true. I tell students to think hard before trying to finish in three years. They might change their minds. I believe four years of high school is better for everyone. The reasons are: choosing fun classes, not having to take extra classes, and having more time to plan for the future.\n\nFirst, choosing a fun class is exciting. It lets students pick something they're interested in. It's great to learn about what you like in high school for free. Some say you can learn on your own or go to college for a better education. I don't agree. Not everyone has the time, help, or money. College classes cost money. So, an extra year in high school can stop you from making a big mistake.\n\nThe second reason to stay in high school for four years is that it's easier. Why take more classes, study in summer, or at night? It's silly when you could be doing other things. I'd work in the summer, study at night for my classes, or hang out with friends. I could also spend time on a hobby. Taking too many classes can make you fail or stress you out.\n\nThe last reason to stay for four years is to have time to think about your future. This is very important. I've seen students struggle because they didn't plan for their future. Students who finish in three years often don't know what they want. They might not have money or chances to succeed. Some jobs need you to be eighteen, but these students are just sixteen. College is expensive, and not all families can pay. So students get into debt or leave college. And if you don't know what you want, you might do nothing for a year or two. Then you might give up on a better future for a job. That's why time is key when planning your future.\n\nTo end my point, if you can finish school early, think it over. Make sure it's what you really want and that you have a plan for after high school. The four years you get are valuable. Use them for free classes you like, less work, and to plan your future. That's why I think four years are better than three."}

I think we shouldn't judge someone or something as bad or strange at first. But you can usually change your mind. That's what happened to me. I have a story about this. On my second day of school, I met a girl and didn't like her. I thought she was mean and racist. We didn't speak during class. But then we had to work together on a project. As we talked about the project, I started to like her. She was kind, helpful, and gave good advice. Now she's my best friend. To sum up, you can almost always change a first impression. You might talk to the person and find things you share. This can help you change your mind. A first impression can be anything. But you can also change it. This is what I've learned.

They don't mean they're going to a different school. They want to work as soon as they can. But for those who really care, finishing high school in three years, including summer school, is perfect. School and graduation are a path we know how to follow. We just need a little push. Schools should let students pick the classes they really want. Every school says you need certain classes to graduate. But if you want to be a doctor, you should get classes that help with that. It's better to choose seven classes you're really into. It's not fair that hardworking students can fail because they miss one credit. Meanwhile, students who cheat all year can pass and graduate. Schools need to be stricter about this. Thanks."}

This judgment is based on how someone looks, including their hair and clothes. People often say that you need to meet someone twenty times to change your first opinion of them. I believe that first impressions are hard to change. This is because it takes a lot of time, it can make you feel less confident, and people usually stick to their first thoughts about someone.\n\nLet's talk about it being time-consuming. As I mentioned, you need to meet someone many times to change your first impression. This could take over a month. For example, when a boy likes a girl, his first impression is key. If he makes a bad first impression, he will need to meet her many times to change her mind. If he sees her once a day, it will take at least twenty days. This means he has wasted a lot of time trying to change how she sees him. So, I think first impressions are tough to change and can make life hard.\n\nNext, a bad first impression can make you lose confidence. After a bad start, you might think you're not good enough. For instance, when I tried out for my school's soccer team, I didn't do well at first. Even though I practiced a lot, I felt I wasn't good enough and didn't try out again. This shows how I gave up on joining the team.\n\nAlso, people usually stick to their first thoughts. This happens a lot when you meet someone new or at a job interview. For example, if someone is late to an interview, the interviewers might think they don't care about the job. They might not get hired because of being late. Another time, I met a guy who kept saying he was the best at everything. I didn't ask him to prove it; I just stopped talking to him. This shows that people often stick to their first impression.\n\nSome people think first impressions should be changed because everyone makes mistakes and deserves a second chance. Like in soccer tryouts, a player might start poorly but should get more chances to show their skills.\n\nI don't agree because there's a lot of competition. In tryouts, only twenty-two players make the team, so there aren't many chances. Also, in life, we don't always get a second chance.\n\nIn conclusion, first impressions are hard to change. So, people should work on making a good first impression."}

If you do, you will be ahead of others. To graduate early, you must plan how to get enough credits. You could ask your teachers for help or consider night school. It's a chance for students to do more than just enjoy high school. For instance, I want to avoid stress and not worry about my classes. However, it's about giving students the option to finish early or with their classmates. Students need to think about graduation to prepare for college. You should find ways to succeed after high school. Think about your plans after you graduate. In the end, finishing high school in three years can be a good idea. If you're ready to try, you need to find ways to get the credits you need to graduate."}

You will make mistakes, but that's part of life; you learn from them.\n\nIn the end, I agree with this statement. Don't let others pick your future or make big choices for you.

At work, I meet many people with different ideas, but I don't talk back much. I'd rather stay modest and not copy others because that's not me. Some have compared me to their daughter, saying, 'Oh no, please don't say that.' It made me feel weird, but the woman wasn't mean. Being me is great, even when I meet people who are mean, rude, or don't care. I won't let anyone tell me what I can or can't do in this world with so much racism. If someone tries to ruin my dreams, I'll ignore them because they're bad for my future. Being modest around nice people is a win too. I don't like it when people say I should be like someone else because of how they act or look. That's just judging. What's really bad is how racist people can be. Like when they say, 'Oh, she's a Hispanic little girl; she shouldn't be in politics,' which is my job. You'll always find rude people everywhere. If you were me, wouldn't mean words hurt you?

You can't force someone to change their mind about another person right away. They might change their mind after talking for a while. But a first impression happens right at the start. People wonder why we have first impressions. It's because the person doesn't really know you yet. Don't let first impressions upset you. They are just what someone thinks and does at first. First impressions often help relationships grow. They can make people step out of their safe space. Some people might be friendly, mean, chatty, or very kind when you meet them.

One key achievement is finishing high school or college.

Another good point is that you can start your own business, which can help you earn more money. You can also hire people to work for you, and if they don't do a good job, you can let them go and hire others who are better. The more good people you hire, the more people will know about your business.\n\nBut, the main thing is to just be yourself. Don't let others run your life or tell you what to do. If you do, you might not succeed, and you probably won't get your dream job, house, or car.

{"text_id": "999F3229AC57", "output_essay": "People often say that you can't change a first impression. This is true because once you form an opinion, it's hard to change it. A first impression is like a stamp from meeting someone or seeing something. It sticks with you. I believe this because once you form an opinion, you can't really change it. \n\nThe first thing that happens when you form an impression is that you use your senses. You might see, hear, smell, taste, or touch something. This makes your brain think of things that aren't there. Feelings come from how you react to people or things. Your body might feel something, like a touch. Your mind helps you remember things you've seen before. When you see someone or something again, you remember them and form an opinion. \n\nThe second part of forming an impression is about your traits, like how you change or get better because of what happens to you. You need to think before you do something to make a good impression. Sometimes, people make a bad impression because they think of something from the past and compare it to the person they're meeting. They make up an image in their head. \n\nWhen something impresses you, it's because it's familiar or someone looks nice. It's like looking at a photo from the past. It reminds you of something, and that creates an impression. Once you react to something, you can't change it. It can make someone look good or bad, but you can't fix what you've already thought. \n\nIn conclusion, I think people should think before they act. Our brains make us remember past actions, and we create an image in our minds. How we react to meeting someone is based on comparing them to our past images. So, I believe that an impression is something you can't change because you can't go back and fix the past."}

When they need to help their families, they pick a three-year high school plan. They don't have enough time for schoolwork. Many of these students want to work and support their families with money. They feel like quitting school to work and make money. But, they can't pick their own classes. So, they have to take classes in the summer or at night and can't study what they like. Four years in school helps you get a better job and life. It gets you ready for college or university. It teaches you about life and helps you believe in yourself. You can reach your goals and be proud of your hard work. Students who fail a class can take summer school to pass. This is a plus of staying in school for four years. They can also get extra help from teachers after school. But, students who only go to school in the summer or at night find it harder. They don't have much time to talk about lessons and figure things out. They have to work harder and get stressed to understand and finish their work on time. They don't have extra time like after school. In the end, anyone who wants to reach their goals will work hard to do it.

Some people believe once you make a first impression, it can't be changed. I will share my view and what others think about changing first impressions.\n\nI think you can change your first impressions. It depends on who you meet. For instance, imagine you're going on a date with a girl you've only talked to on the phone. You plan the perfect date, but you get nervous, say something wrong, and she leaves. You might think it's over, but it's not. You should text her, say sorry, explain you were nervous, and ask for another date. If she says yes, you've changed your first impression. I've changed first impressions myself. Once, a girl asked me why I looked mad. I was surprised because I'm usually happy. After we talked more, she saw I was happy, kind, and nice. This shows it's possible to change how someone sees you at first.\n\nOthers think differently. They believe if you ruin your first impression, you can't fix it. You should just move on. But I don't give up easily. People shouldn't quit just because they made a mistake the first time. You can try again. I almost gave up on someone I liked, but I didn't. I tried again, and it worked out. She became my girlfriend. Someone told me she liked me, but I thought she was too good for me. I tried to act differently, but it didn't work. Luckily, she knew me and gave me another chance. We've been together for over a year now. But not everyone is so lucky to get a second chance.\n\nIn conclusion, I still think you can change your first impressions. It also depends on the other person. Even if you mess up at first, don't give up. I hope this makes people who don't believe in changing first impressions think again."}

It's important to be positive yourself and to help others be positive too. Being positive can help you get a good job. Bosses don't want to hire someone who is negative. They look for people who are upbeat, who smile, and who make others feel good. This makes people loyal to them. Also, being positive can help you make friends. How you act towards others usually affects how they treat you. If you give off good vibes, you can make someone's day. This helps them feel good and think, 'I can do it.' This way, they do well in life and don't focus on the bad things from their past. Being sad and negative is not how you succeed in life. So, I think being positive is the key to doing well. In my community, if more people were positive, it would help others get jobs and get along. Success would come easier. It's not just about being positive for yourself.

Even if they know what is right, in a group, they prefer to hear everyone's ideas. Moreover, being independent takes you further; it's more than just success. When you are sure and understand things well, you are in the middle of the action. This is why you are fast or do well on a project. Finally, independent people are full of surprises.

But, this plan isn't right for everyone. I think there are many reasons why it might not work for all students. Some students skip school a lot. When they do, they miss out on key lessons. The issue is that some students don't take school seriously and don't care about it. Others have jobs after school. It's hard for them to take extra classes or do more things at school because of work. This plan doesn't fit them. In the summer, they can't join in because they have jobs and can't take time off. But for some students, it's a great idea. They have enough time to study and can help others when needed. Finishing school in three years is a choice, but it's not necessary for everyone. I believe it's better to finish high school in four years. This gives us time to learn and prepare for what comes next. We are young grown-ups. Any young woman or man can be great at their studies. It doesn't matter what their skin color is or where they come from. The key is to keep learning in college and to become a good person with a bright future."}
{"text_id": "00E3943E1CBC", "output_essay": "Many people talk about whether high schools should let students finish in three years instead of four. Some think this is a smart way to finish school. They say it helps students get ready for life after high school and gives them more time to plan their careers. I think students should be able to finish high school in three years because it gives them extra time to plan for their jobs, it makes them work hard for the future, and it frees them from high school stress once they're done. \n\nOne reason to finish in three years is the extra time. Choosing a career takes a lot of time. It's not just picking any job. You need to know how much it costs and find the best school for it. One year is a lot of time if you use it well. If you can't afford college, you can work for a year and save money for school. There are many things you can do with this time. For example, if college isn't for you, you can start working right away. \n\nThe second reason is that finishing in three years means you have to work hard. This means taking more classes, maybe in the summer or after school. Sometimes, you can't take fun classes. Making tough choices takes effort. You need to want to show you can face any challenge. These challenges get you ready for life after high school. Real life isn't as easy as in the movies. Everyone starts from zero, and only the smart and hardworking people make it. \n\nThe last reason is that finishing early means no more high school stress. Stress is a big problem for teens, leading to bad choices like dropping out. A study by the University of Virginia found that 2 out of 10 students drop out each year. \n\nIn conclusion, it's better to finish high school in three years. It helps students with their future and gets them ready for what comes next. We need to understand how important learning is to move past our challenges."}

We know that people can change how they look. In the end, anyone can change. They just need support and time. There's a saying in Spanish, 'don't judge a book by its cover without knowing what's inside.'\n\nCan first impressions be changed? I believe they can. But we get many ideas about someone from their looks, actions, and clothes. I've met people who changed the way I first saw them. It took time, but they did it. I'm an example too. When I meet new people, they think I'm unfriendly because I don't answer their questions. It's not because I'm rude. I'm just shy and don't like talking to strangers.\n\nBut these people don't think I can become more talkative. I can, as I get to know them. Like I said, I'm shy. So, everyone can change their first impression. It just takes time.\n\nAnyone can change their looks with help and time. If no one tells them to change, they might not do it. It also depends on where they are. For example, I'm shy. If I'm around talkative people who ignore me, how can I change what they think of me? Yes, I can change, but I'll need more time because they don't help me. If people avoid someone who wants to change, that person might not change. That's why some think change is impossible. But I believe everyone can change their looks. Sometimes they need help, other times they just need time.\n\nCan someone change their looks on their own? Yes, they can. They need to decide to change and work hard. I'm an example. People, even family, stay away because I'm quiet. That's when you know you need to change on your own. No one will help if you push them away. Even though I knew I had to change, it was tough because I was used to being quiet. If you want to change, notice your surroundings and step out of them. That's the best way to change, I think.\n\nIn the end, you'll change and realize looks don't matter. You can change even if people judge you. If they don't think you can change, don't worry. A big change will come. Life is full of surprises. When you think you can't change, something or someone will help you. So, I think you can change your looks if you decide to.

This is because they learn more, save money, and have time to think about their jobs in the future.\n\nOne reason I think students should go to high school for four years is to learn more. Students who go for four years might understand better and get into college easier. They might be more ready for college than those who go for three years. My brother went to high school for three years and had a hard time in college. He had to study extra because he didn't remember what he learned. I need to study a lot to pass my tests. If you go to school for three years, you might need extra classes in the summer or at night. This can be hard and make it tough to focus on final exams.\n\nAnother reason to go to high school for four years is to save money. If you go for four years, you can take more classes and get credits. Some students know what job they want. So they can take classes in high school that will help in college. In the last year, they can work and save money. They might borrow less money for college. College costs a lot, and not everyone can pay for it. But if you take important classes in high school, you can save money.\n\nThe last reason to go to high school for four years is to have time to choose a career. It was hard for me to choose a job. But my fourth year in high school gave me time to think. I took classes like art and music. They helped me see that I might want to be a painter. Many students find out what they are good at in their last year. The last year lets you get more credits and decide what to study later.\n\nAs you can see, going to high school for four years might be better. You can save money, learn more, and have time to think about your future job. Going to school for four years has many benefits. That's why I think students should go for the full four years."}

He took her to the U.S., adopted her, and she went to school. She got a nursing degree, had many school and job offers, and chose a good job. She built a place for kids who couldn't afford medical care. She married a man who wanted her to change, but she didn't. Later, she married a man who supported her. She helped many people and didn't change who she was. Her adoptive father was proud. She went back to Mexico with gifts, food, and drinks for the needy.

Life offers a lot, and you shouldn't waste it by being negative. When you grow up and look for a job, being positive at work is important.\n\nFirst, in your last year of high school, you think about finishing and getting your diploma. You must go to school with a good mood and be ready to work hard all year. It can be hard and stressful, but staying positive makes it worth it. If you show a project in class, a good mood shows you worked hard and did your homework. When you meet someone new, being positive makes them feel at ease and open to talk. Sometimes, teachers ask students to help at events for extra credit. A positive student can earn credit and more.\n\nNext, being positive is very important for the future. It helps you see the good things and make good choices. We all want to do well and have a good life, so we need to stay positive. When you meet people who can help you, you must make a good first impression. Being positive shows respect and energy.\n\nFinally, when you grow up and enter the job world, staying positive is important. Companies want responsible, hardworking, and respectful people. You show these qualities by being positive. In a job interview, smile and be respectful. This shows you are right for the job and work well.

She thinks being a flight attendant is not good for me. Even if my mom doesn't like my choice, I will still go for it. I will try to make her understand. This job is my passion. I don't want to make others happy if it means I'm not happy. That can be upsetting. Also, if you are true to yourself, people will like and respect you for who you are.\n\nNext, accept yourself. I have seen Muslim girls at my school change how they dress and act after coming to America. They do this because of what others say. I don't think that's right. People should make their own choices. It doesn't matter how hard it is or what others say. People will always try to make you feel bad, even when you're doing well. Being true to yourself is the best thing you can do.\n\nSome people think you need to be like others to fit in. But do you really need to? I don't think so. Everyone is different. When you do what makes you happy, not just to please others, that's a big success. Being true to yourself also means you'll meet people who really like you for who you are.\n\nIn conclusion, I strongly believe that being true to yourself is the best thing you can do. It makes you happy and you accept who you are. It can be tough, but it's not impossible."}

More schools should have this three-year option because it helps students remember their lessons better.\n\nThe main reason the three-year option is good is that it saves time. High school students need to know how to use their time well to succeed. The three-year plan helps students not waste time. They can finish high school faster and start college or a job a year sooner.\n\nStudents in the three-year plan also remember what they learn better. They don't have a long break like summer vacation. Their classes go one after the other. This means they don't forget things easily. Teachers also don't have to spend as much time going over old lessons.\n\nBut the three-year plan isn't perfect. Students who go to school for four years have more time to save money for college.\n\nIn the end, the three-year plan is better than the four-year plan.

When we meet someone new, we quickly decide how we feel about them. These first feelings stick with us and are hard to change. We all make up our minds fast. In today's fast-paced world, we often ignore strangers. In the past, people wrote letters to those they missed. Writing took a long time. It could take over a week for a letter to arrive. Receiving a letter was exciting and surprising. But now, with smartphones, we can talk to friends or family in an instant. The magic of waiting for a message is gone. Often, we only see what people choose to show us. We don't really try to get to know them. People hide their true selves. We don't see the real person. Over time, seeing someone often becomes normal. We remember our first impression of them. We all judge others when we meet them. We think about their looks. I do this too. If we like someone, we think they are better than they are. If we don't like someone, we focus on their bad points. This is about personal attraction. In the end, it's true that first impressions are hard to change. We can't really know someone without spending time with them. We meet new people and quickly form opinions. Even when we hear more about them later, our first opinion usually doesn't change."}

Nothing makes you happier than making new friends. This is why you should always be yourself and not pretend to be someone else.

If they are negative, they might worry about not getting into any college. But if they are positive, they will feel more confident.\n\nHere's why being negative is bad: it gets you nowhere.

Students just need to study in the summer and at night. Joining these programs can make life easier. When one student graduates early, others often follow because they want to finish early too. If you want to finish fast, this is one way. It takes three years. The school's programs can help students finish quickly. They just need to go to summer school and pass one class each summer. They can also choose night school, but it costs a bit. After deciding, they can pick summer or night school to finish early. If students work at night and want to study, they should pick summer school. Some students want to study in the summer or at night, but their parents say no. The school has these programs for any student who wants them. The school hopes everyone joins to have more chances to graduate early. But not all students want to join. The school has programs for finishing high school in three years. Students can graduate early by taking classes in the summer or at night.

It's clear that success comes with a positive attitude and thoughts. People with a positive attitude do great things. The secret to doing well is to stay positive, as it helps people meet their goals and have great thoughts.\n\nBeing positive makes me strong and helps me think well, even when others say negative things to me. Once, in my physics class, a boy asked me why I failed my test, and I felt bad. Maybe I didn't study enough or didn't get the material. But I didn't answer him. Instead, I thought: I will study, try hard, and pass next time. My aim was to pass the test and show I could. So, I studied a lot at home and during other classes when I could. One day while studying, I told myself, 'I will pass, and I will do well in my grade.'\n\nOn Wednesday night, I looked at myself in the mirror and saw someone who could pass that test. The next day, I took the test thinking I would pass. On Friday, my teacher said I passed. I was so happy that my positive thinking helped me reach my goal. I know that to do well in life, you need to stay positive to reach your goals.\n\nAlso, being positive makes people have great thoughts. In my English class, we had to write a poem. A classmate wanted to write about 'Roses in Pain.' We all liked the idea, so we each wrote our part. Then we put it all together. I suggested making it romantic. The group liked it, and we wrote about Jonas and Maria who loved each other but couldn't be together because her mother was rich and he was poor. Our teacher loved our poem and said we did a great job with a good attitude. Our great ideas and positive thinking got us an A+ on the project.

This is because in college, a teacher might go over things that a high school teacher already taught. They might also talk about things that are linked to what was taught in high school. For example, in history class, a teacher might talk about 'The American Colonization' or something related to it. A student should join the program if they are happy with the steps they need to follow. This is important because they have to go to high school and sometimes work. When they get home, they need to do homework or other things. Some students also go to the gym or play sports. A student might leave high school to work for different reasons. They might want to work, need to support their family, not have their parents in the United States and live with other family members, and need to help both their family here and their parents back in their home country.

It's hard to work with people who are negative. They often act mean, shout, and are difficult to work with. They don't help with team tasks. You can find these people everywhere. For example, in school, students do projects or work in teams. Often, one person with a bad attitude can make things hard for everyone. Even negative people know that working with positive people is easier. Positive people make better leaders because they are more patient when explaining or teaching. Usually, negative people don't like how positive people act. Being too positive can be annoying, so it's important not to go too far. Negative thinkers keep their bad outlook on life. This can make their minds foggy and stop them from wanting to do things. Staying positive is important for trying hard and reaching your goals. Some people like to test themselves, which is good.

Or change your feelings about something after seeing it for the first time? When you meet someone new or see a show without knowing what to expect, it can be tough to change your first thoughts. I really think this is true because we always remember our first impressions. Even if we get another chance, it's hard to feel or think differently about what happened. For instance, trying to give someone a fresh start can feel weird. The first impression sticks in your mind and doesn't really change. First impressions are always a surprise. You shouldn't expect too much from someone or something new. There's an equal chance you'll be impressed or not. My second point is that if you do give someone another chance, you might feel or think differently. But this can make you feel strange. I believe it's best to stay away from this. My final point is that first impressions are usually right. They let you know what to expect from someone or something for a while. This can help you decide if you should keep going with the situation or not. Still, first impressions can be tough. You could give someone another chance, and it might be better.

We live in a world influenced by celebrities. Just because you like a character in a movie doesn't mean you have to copy them. They are there to show how your choices might look to others and how they affect everyone, including family and friends. Being yourself also lets others know your thoughts, abilities, and how you deal with things. \n\nThe second benefit is that you can choose what you like. For instance, playing a sport you love, wearing clothes that are comfy, and doing things that show who you are and how you feel. When you do things without others telling you, it shows you don't rely on their opinions, which is great. It shows you matter in this world with your own ideas. You'll see how fun and happy life is when you do things that interest you, not others. \n\nThe third benefit of being yourself is that you can chase a dream and make it happen, no matter how tough it is. Anything is possible if you really want it. Take the man who started Kentucky Fried Chicken. He failed many times and lost loved ones. He tried different jobs but always failed.

But I don't think it's a good idea for students to graduate early. Their brains aren't fully ready, and they may not know what to do next. One problem is that graduating early can crush their dreams sooner. They miss out on experiences that others get by graduating later. They only aimed to graduate early, but then they're lost about what comes next. So, they might waste the next year partying instead of staying on track. Another point is that staying in high school longer makes students wiser and more ready for life after school. They learn more about the real world in four years than in three. Graduating early can also hurt their confidence. They may struggle to choose their next steps. Summer classes should help students catch up, not let them finish early and disrupt the school system and their dreams. For instance, picture a 17-year-old girl who works hard in school and doesn't have time for friends. If she graduates early, she might just party and not care about her future. But an 18-year-old who has fun and learns for four years will know what to do after graduation. Both students go to the same school and learn the same things, but their experiences are different.

It won't take you where you want to go.\n\nDoing well, or finishing something important, won't happen alone. It will take time with a team or family to help. Some people tried to do things alone and failed. Then they worked with friends. Now they have done well with their team. I think the best way to get better or do well is to work with others. If we work with a team, we can plan and finish everything on time.\n\nThe best success is when a team works together. If team members need help, helping each other will let them reach their goals and do well. Many people like to work with a team. Fewer people don't want to work with others. They will hurt themselves by not working with a team. I want to work with a team because you can finish things easily with your team.\n\nI don't like to work alone because if I don't know something, I can ask my team for help. I think it's a good idea to work with others. If you fail alone, it can cause big problems because you made a mistake you can't fix alone. With a team, it would be safer and easier to handle."}

It's not a good idea to let high school students finish in three years. This would put too much pressure on them, give them less time to improve their grades, and they would miss a year of fun and learning in high school. \n\nFirst, high school students will feel a lot of pressure. They have to do many things in a short time. Usually, students do homework, classwork, and projects. But this three-year plan will need more time because it squeezes four years of work into three. This can hurt their health. Too much pressure can cause stress, not enough sleep, and that's bad for anyone. \n\nSecond, students will have less time to get better grades, and good grades are very important for college. High schools have four years for a reason. Think about it: students in this three-year plan have less time to do well. If they don't, it's not worth it. They might finish high school in three years with bad grades. It's better to take four years and have more chances to improve them. \n\nNext, students will miss out on a year of fun in high school. High school is a key time in our lives. After high school, life gets harder and you have more responsibilities. Students should enjoy this time and think about the fun they could miss by finishing early. Why rush to leave high school? \n\nIn conclusion, schools shouldn't offer programs that let students finish in three years. Students might end up with bad grades, feel too much pressure, and miss out on high school fun. It's smarter for students to spend four years in high school. This way, they can relax more and enjoy their time there."}

Everyone acts differently or makes friends in their own way. Sometimes, people try to seem nice when you first meet them, but you might think differently as you get to know them better. The first impression is key, but a bad first impression doesn't always mean the person is bad. First impressions can change if people are nice, do their job well, and work hard.\n\nWhen you meet someone new, your feelings can shift. Some people are nice, while others are not. Take your first day of school, for example. You met many other students. You might have thought the student next to you was rude, but later you might change your mind. The main idea is that everyone should get another chance because we can't make final judgments. Also, the other person is making judgments about you too. They might not want to give you a chance because of their first impression. We shouldn't treat others in ways we wouldn't like to be treated. First impressions can change if you are always nice.\n\nFirst impressions can be different. People who do their job well usually make good impressions. If you didn't hand in your first homework on time, your teacher might think you're not careful. But even careful people mess up sometimes. Maybe you did your homework but left it at home or took the wrong folder. Over the year, you'll have more chances to show your teacher you're careful by handing in work on time. No one is perfect; we all mess up sometimes, and it doesn't make us bad or careless. First impressions can change if you show you're careful.\n\nThe way you think about someone when you first meet can change. Sometimes people try to do their best, and we call them hard workers. For instance, when you first work in groups at school, you'll think something about your classmates based on their work. What if one didn't help at all? You'd probably think badly of them and not want to work with them again. But if you have to work with them again and they do great, you might change your mind. Maybe they had problems or felt sick before. People can change; a first impression isn't always right. First impressions can change if people work hard and try to get along well.\n\nYour first thoughts about someone can change. Everyone should get another chance because we all make mistakes. You can start with a bad opinion of someone and change your mind later. Or you might start with a good opinion and change it later.

They think change is a good way to do well in life. I agree with the saying; I believe that being myself in a world that is always trying to make me something else is the greatest success. This is true because being yourself means you are honest, confident, and people like you for who you really are, not for someone you are pretending to be.\n\nFirst, I think being honest all the time means being yourself. Honesty lets you stay true to who you are. Being honest is good because people believe what you say. If you do something good, they might do the same. Some people lie to look better to others. This is bad because lies will always come back to hurt you. I think if people really enjoy being with you, they will forgive your mistakes. It's like when you meet someone new and tell them about yourself.\n\nSecond, being confident in who you are means being yourself. People think changing themselves can erase the past or change how they acted before. They think changing how they look can change how they treated others. But many change because they were hurt and don't want to remember bad times. Others are happy with who they are and don't want to change because they feel confident.\n\nLast, people will like you for being yourself and not for trying to be something else. People respond to you based on how you act. If you are real with others, they will trust you. People like those who are true to themselves and how they treat others. If you hide who you are, others might not believe you, even when you are honest. But if you are yourself and honest, they will trust you more.\n\nAs you can see, I agree with the saying because that's what I believe. I feel that being yourself in a world that tries to change you is a success. Often, people think they want to change for the better. Life can be tough, and you change because of it; it makes you stronger. I believe staying the same is a good way to be happy with what you did right before. That's why being yourself is a success."}

{"text_id": "BCD439F8FE86", "output_essay": "I am happy to share my thoughts on whether high school should last 3 years or 4 years before college. Let's first look at the 4-year high school plan. Most high school students struggle with the 4-year term. High school classes are set up so that most students can finish in 3 years. They still have time to take extra classes that they don't really need. Because of this, I believe it's better for students to go to high school for 3 years instead of 4. They can use the extra year to work and save money for college. They can get full-time jobs to pay for their basic needs in college. Not every parent can support their child after high school. Many students are in this situation. They have to work hard. Many students work after school, which helps them. Not every student can grasp everything taught in class. Some need extra time to catch up. If they are in high school for 4 years, it's harder for them. They have to work after school and can't stay up late to study. They might fall behind, which is sad. But with only 3 years in high school, students know they have less time. If they work, they'll try to work less and focus more on school. They know they have a full year to work after high school. During that year, they can work full-time to earn money for college. I hope the people in charge will consider this. It would help us high school students a lot. I also want to mention summer school. In the summer, when school is out, not all students stay around. Some travel abroad with their families. Summer is a popular time for travel. But not everyone goes; many do. If schools offer summer classes, it helps students finish early or redo failed classes. But they should remember that not all students will be around. This is important to think about, even if students are in school for just 3 years."}

You must do your best on the worksheet. Take your belongings, for example. Sometimes you need to buy your own car, house, or start a business. The best thing you can do is work hard. To get the best results, you should be kind to everyone at work, especially your boss. If you want to start a business, like a library, restaurant, or store, you must do it on your own. No one will help you. You decide how your business runs and how much money you spend on it. Usually, you have one job. But sometimes you might have two if you want more money.

Students who finish early often don't learn as well as those who stay for four years. They might not remember all that is taught and will miss extra classes. I think it's a mistake to say students should finish in three years to start work or college early. If they stay for four years, they will learn more, have fun as young people, and look at different jobs they might like to do. \n\nFirst, students who stay longer usually learn more. They can take extra or harder classes that can help their grades. For example, my friend Generic_Name thought about finishing early. But she stayed because she saw the good in taking hard classes in high school. She got help from teachers and friends instead of having a hard time with them in college. It's better to take these classes in high school than to worry about them in college. \n\nSecond, students who are in high school for four years often have more fun. They hang out, make friends, and do activities. My friends and I meet every day at school and do things together after school too. We go to birthday parties and just enjoy life. If I were working or in college, I might not be able to do this. Some colleges have early bedtimes, or I might not get time off from work. So, finishing school early can make things hard. \n\nThird, students can look at different jobs they might like. For instance, Generic_Name wanted to finish early to be a vet. But a teacher told her to think about other jobs first. She stayed in high school and found out she likes medical care. She learned she could look at more jobs in college after graduating. \n\nSome people say it's good for young people to finish school early. They can start working and not depend on their parents. They also say these students can start their careers in college when they are young. But I and others don't agree. Staying for four years means more learning, fun, and job choices. \n\nIn conclusion, I don't think students should finish school early. It can be too stressful and hard. Plus, if students stay for four years, they learn more, have more fun, and can think about more jobs they might want to do."}

First impressions happen when you see or meet someone new and decide what you think about them. They shape how others view you. This is key when you're trying to get a job. Also, your clothes can make people like or not like you. And the way you talk to others matters too. My first point is that first impressions make people see you in a certain way. If you do something wrong when you meet someone, they might not like you. They'll think you're a bad person because of that one mistake. You can't make them change their minds about you. They might also get the wrong idea about who you are. Pretending to be someone else makes you seem dishonest and disappointing to them. My second point is about clothes. What you wear affects how others see you and feel about you. Nice clothes can give a good impression. If you wear a suit or dress, people might think you're wealthy or responsible. But if you look messy, they might think you're poor and not responsible. My third point is about jobs. Show your boss you're good at your job to keep it. If you do something wrong on the first day, your boss might not like you and could fire you. Be kind and do your job well. If you need help, ask your boss. My last point is about how you talk to people. If you shout or swear, others will think you're rude. Always be polite and don't swear in public. To get people to like you, say nice things and make them feel good. Be careful with your words and stay out of trouble. In the end, first impressions can't be changed.

Memories of time spent with family and friends can make a person kinder. This depends on how those times were. People think bad things can get better with time. But I feel that no one can change our feelings. We might change our minds, but not our feelings. For example, if the smartest person gets an A+ and I get an F, I might think, 'They got an A+ because they're smart.' But I would still feel bad because I could have tried harder. There are many ways to look at a problem. We all have different beliefs and ways to solve problems. I believe you can't change how you see someone because it's a special feeling that makes each person unique."}

When someone gets a second chance, they can show their true self. \n\nIt's normal for people to forgive and forget, no matter what someone has done. People often feel strongly when their friends or family are involved. Forgiving someone makes a person feel good. Even if it's hard to forgive when someone does something very bad, over time, people usually do forgive and give another chance. \n\nPeople say that with time or the right influence, anyone can change. Many believe you can't change a first impression. But time spent together, willingness to forgive, and our natural ability to forgive show that first impressions can be changed.

I've met people who didn't like me because of what their friends told them. But after we talked, they understood I was nice. For instance, we used to play soccer in the park and just say hi. One time, I noticed a kid was alone, so I asked him to have dinner with my family at my house. Later, I caught him taking $20 from my wallet. I confronted him and he said, 'I'm sorry, I need the money for my brother's school lunch; we don't have much money.' I felt bad and gave him $40 because I could tell he was telling the truth. Three days later, he gave me the money back. He said, 'I found a job. The extra $20 you gave me helped me buy a haircut and look better. It helped me get back on my feet.' We became best friends after that, even though he tried to steal from me. He had a good reason. This shows that I first thought he was a thief, but then I thought about his situation. I realized I might have done the same thing. So, I decided not to be too quick to judge him."}

Everyone might want to be a top model. But it's hard. We only see their beauty because that's what we care about. We don't try to look beyond what they show us. And you know what? We fall for it.

Students work hard in high school and even take classes in the summer. This hard work lets them finish early and start college sooner. They also have a better chance to get into college because they finished early. Plus, students will have more time for their future goals. Students often ask, 'What will I do next?' Most want to achieve more than they already have. Some work very hard to finish high school early so they can go to college right away. Others want to leave high school quickly. They also want to show their families they can achieve more. Students work hard and make sacrifices, but they get to finish high school before others. This means they can start college with less stress, knowing they finished high school quickly. People who finish high school early are ahead when applying to college. Some colleges like that you finished early with good grades. You can also apply to college before others from your school. This gives you a better chance of getting in. That's why I think finishing high school in three years is good. It gives you more time to plan and an edge over others. You also don't have to spend extra time in high school wondering about your future. Thank you for reading this."}
{"text_id": "BE4E0C8866E3", "output_essay": "First impressions are hard to change. People often say that it's tough to change how you feel at first. To change your mind, you need to start by being positive about yourself. I think this is true because we can be very stubborn about our first thoughts. Some people can change how they think by being positive and in control, while others might copy what someone else does. First, some people change their thoughts by staying positive and in control. They change when they do good things and feel good about themselves. For example, when people have faith in themselves, they can think differently. Believing in yourself can make you feel better. Also, we can show a new side of ourselves by trying to make a good impression. Changing impressions is hard. But if we try not to make strong first impressions, life could be easier for everyone. We could all have a better life and more chances to succeed. Next, some people copy what others do. They do this because they want to make a good impression. For instance, my best friend follows my lead because we both want good things for each other. Also, if a friend tells you to do your homework every day to get good grades, they want the best for you. This shows that not all friends want to help you make a good impression. To live better, we should listen to good advice. This can help us improve and show a new side of ourselves. Still, some might say that you can change a first impression. Everyone thinks and comes up with ideas differently. Some might say that changing how we think is a big problem. Many people don't try hard enough to change their thoughts for the right reasons. I believe that first impressions are hard to change because they can make life harder. This shows that changing how we think might be one of the easiest problems to solve. First impressions are not always the hardest thing to understand and change. In conclusion, many people think first impressions are hard to change. Others say that changing how we feel is the biggest challenge. For some, first impressions will always be the hardest to change. When people feel stuck, they can change by following good advice. Some people make life hard by giving bad advice. Others think first impressions are very important. But when a family member struggles with first impressions, you try to help them feel more positive. Also, people will be thankful when you help them do what's best for their life."}

Being positive doesn't promise you'll succeed; it's very important to work hard for what you want. Being positive is not the same as being successful. Not everyone can keep being positive. The real way to do well is to work hard for your goals. Stay focused, and you'll do well. Also, be true to yourself.

Also, if students leave high school early, they won't learn as much. For example, if they don't focus in class, they won't learn. This means they won't know how to do their homework and will have trouble in class. Another thing is that college costs money. If students aren't ready for college, they will have a hard time. Some students think about working right after high school. I don't think this is a good idea. They aren't ready for a job and don't know what to do. For instance, a student can't do classwork without learning it first, unless they are very smart and don't need a teacher. This is true for jobs too. Without knowing about the job, you can't do it unless you are really good at it. To sum up, I believe it's a bad idea for students to finish high school early and go to college or start working.

It shows you that chances in life come only once. You must treat others well with a positive way of thinking. This is needed to do well. Being positive is needed everywhere you go. It can help you find a good job. To do well, you must think good thoughts. This makes you think, 'To do well, I must stay positive.'

But it's tough to stay positive. Often, something makes us think it will be too hard and we'll fail. For example, taking the hardest class and worrying about failing it. Many people expect the worst. They think they might fail and have to repeat the year or miss out on college. But worrying like this is a waste of time. We should study and use our time well. Even if we fail, it's okay. We can learn from failure. I didn't always understand this, but now I think I'm learning how to. My dad used to say, 'A negative attitude leads to failure.' I remember feeling unsure about moving to this country. I knew nothing about it or the language. I was afraid and thought I couldn't learn English. At first, I didn't go to school and just worked with my mom's friends, learning a few words. Later, I needed a different job. I searched online and got an interview. I hoped to find Spanish-speaking coworkers. But there weren't any. I felt scared and thought about leaving. I called my dad. He said, 'Son, you have to try. Remember your successes, like winning a drawing contest when you thought you were the worst.' His words made sense. A positive approach leads to good things, while a negative one leads to failure. If you think you won't win, pass a test, or get a job, you're setting yourself up to fail. We need these experiences to learn and grow. Everyone has doubts, like not being the best in sports or the smartest. But I went to the interview with a smile. A week later, I got the job. It was my first big step in the USA. I faced my fears. I still have a lot to learn about staying positive, but I know it's worth it."}
{"text_id": "7DE7664D8F20", "output_essay": "It's hard to be yourself when the world wants you to be something else. First, we should be who we are; we can't just change to fit what others want. But it's tough to act like someone we're not used to. I think our personality shows what kind of person we are.\n\nRalph Waldo Emerson once wrote, 'To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.' When you're with people who act the same and you're different, they'll try to make you act like them because they're being told what to do. It's never easy to stay true to yourself. People will always try to change you. But if we keep being ourselves, no one can change who we are.\n\nI agree with Emerson about being ourselves. We can be anything we want, no matter what others think. No one else can choose who we are or how we live. It's our life, and we choose what to do with it. We can't be just like others. If we were, we wouldn't see their true selves. They would be faking it. To really know someone, they have to be real. It's important if they are honest, share their real feelings, and not just say what others tell them. They should show what they like and don't like.\n\nSo, when you meet someone for the first time, you get a first impression. But we shouldn't judge them just on that. We need to learn about them. We've all met someone serious, who doesn't like certain things, and we think we won't be friends. But if we don't spend time with them, we won't really know them. Our first ideas about them can change as we get to know them better. The person you didn't like at first could become a great friend. That's why we should be free to be ourselves and share our feelings without anyone telling us what to do. This helps us understand different people better.\n\nIn conclusion, being in a world that wants to change and control you is bad for everyone. We wouldn't know what others truly feel or think. That's why we all need to be free to be ourselves. We won't be happy if someone else controls us. The happiness we show won't be real; it will be fake, made by the person in control. So, everyone should be free and be the way they want, with people they're comfortable with."}

There are several ways a first impression can change, like getting new shoes, falling in love, or eating the same food over and over again. \n\nGetting new shoes can change what people first think of us. When someone shops for shoes, they might find a pair that looks nice. They buy the shoes because they like how they look. But if they wear the shoes often, they might start to like them less. If they wear the shoes for many months and then get a new pair, they won't think the old shoes are as special anymore. The new shoes will be more interesting to them. \n\nSometimes, people fall in love even if they don't know each other well. It's better to know someone's personality before loving them. If someone has a bad personality and another person falls in love with them, the love might be selfish. They might love the person for what they can get from them. Once they really get to know each other, their feelings can change. Love can turn to hate. Not everyone loves someone right away; some people don't like others at first. But this can change if they spend time together and learn about each other. The best way to really know someone is by spending time with them. \n\nThe first time you try a food, it might taste great. Some people always want to try new foods because they get bored of the same taste. No one wants to eat the same food for months. At first, they might love a food, but then they don't enjoy it as much because they've had it too much. People usually want to try new foods after they get tired of eating the same things. \n\nA first impression can't stay the same forever. Something will always change it. For example, liking something can change when a new thing comes along and takes its place. \n\nWhat we think about things can move from one to another. Lots of things can grab our attention at first. What we think about things keeps changing as we find new things and forget the old ones. Our thoughts always move to new things.

{"text_id": "0513BFE67A44", "output_essay": "First impressions stick in our minds and are hard to change. People often say that the first impression is key because it shows who you are. I don't think first impressions are that hard to change. Nothing is set in stone. It can take a while to know if a first impression was correct. For example, I met someone at school two years ago. She spoke my language. I was happy to meet her, but she didn't seem happy. She just looked at me and didn't speak. I thought she was unfriendly and calm. The next day, I was alone in the cafeteria and she asked me to sit with her. Later, when I moved to a building near hers, she walked with me to school every day and helped me learn how things worked there. Now she's one of my best friends. I was wrong about her at first. On the other hand, I had a great first impression of another friend. I thought she was smart and kind. Once, my art teacher praised my drawing of a boat at sea. I was proud because I'm not good at drawing. My friend offered to help me finish it quickly. I agreed, but she messed up my drawing by coloring the sea black. It was clear she did it on purpose because she was jealous. She hadn't drawn anything and the teacher had complimented my work. These two stories show why it's not good to judge people only by first impressions. First impressions aren't just about people. They can be about places or things too. For example, I had to leave my old job for a new one with better pay and chances to learn. My first day was tough. I had to remember many codes for fruits and vegetables as a cashier. I thought the job would be too hard and I wouldn't make friends like before. I was sad and let down, but then I thought I might be wrong. I needed to learn more and practice. The other workers were helpful. Remembering the codes wasn't so hard. My view of the job started to change. I learned to give myself and others a second chance. Some people think the first impression is just the image you show to others. They say it can't be changed, but over time, people can change their minds. Actions and skills can make people forget their first impression of someone. If you want to change what people first thought of you, you have to change. In the end, changing a first impression is not impossible. If you're trying to change what others first thought of you, be patient. Time will show them they were wrong. Believing in yourself and doing your best is the way to change a bad first impression."}

But, students who don't speak English as their first language find it hard. Schools in Afghanistan and America are very different. For instance, if an English teacher in Afghanistan can't teach well, how can we learn? This problem isn't just for Afghan students. Students from other places have the same trouble. If they finish school in three years, they might not get into college. So, if students want to finish early, they need to work hard, act right, and take extra classes in summer or at night. They must learn English well first. Then they can finish high school with good grades and get into top colleges. This is my own story: when I first came to America, I didn't understand English. I only knew 'Hi,' 'Bye,' and 'No speaking English.' Now, I laugh when I think of those words. Look at me now; I've learned many new words and how to talk well, and much more. Why? Because some schools offer extra help like summer school or night classes. I took summer classes and stayed after school for help. This helped me a lot. I am very happy to live in America. I am proud to be a student at Generic_School. I love all my teachers who have guided and supported me. They have helped me so much. I am graduating this year, 2020, and I plan to go to college after.

Everyone wants to be happy, so they should have a positive attitude. For example, when you wake up, you decide if your day will be happy or sad. You can start your day with good actions or by being thankful for what you have. A positive attitude also makes things easier. You don't need to spend time on negative thoughts or fixing problems. Another example is dealing with frustration at school or work. You should remember that everything in life has two sides.\n\nIn life, you can do what you want. If you want to dance, draw, or sing, just do it. Don't listen to others who say you can't. People might make it hard to do what you love, but stay positive and keep doing it. Be smart. For a school quiz, study and believe that you will pass. When it rains, remember that flowers need rain. Look for the good in everything. Don't worry too much. Wait and see the good that comes from your problems. Live each day as if it's your last because you never know what will happen. When life is tough, keep a positive attitude. Attitude is key because it shapes how you live. Some people may not agree with me, and that's fine. They can think what they want, but I won't change my beliefs because of them. We need people who bring peace and positivity into our lives.\n\nAnother example is when you face many problems and feel trapped. Keep a positive attitude, look at your problems, and find something good. Nothing is easy, but positivity makes it better.

But, some students who leave school in three years have problems. They don't know what to do next. These students might not get the job they want because they are not sure what to do.

I think there's always someone who wants to change you. I believe if you stay true to yourself and don't change for others, you'll have more friends. Trying to be someone else won't get you as many friends as being real will. Plus, being true to yourself makes you feel good and proud for not changing for others. For instance, I had a friend who was nice and fun. But after summer, she changed because of a new friend. She lost her old friends because she wasn't real anymore. She only kept the new friend who changed her. I also agree with Emerson because some people will try to change who you are and how you act. A nice person I knew changed after making new friends in high school. His new friends made him act differently. Another point is that people will push you to be someone you're not. This is a problem for many. They change to fit in with others. I knew someone who changed friend groups and stopped talking to us because the new group made her. If you let people change you, it's not good and nothing good comes from it. But if you stay true to yourself, good things will happen. You'll feel proud and happy that you didn't change.

It's easy to forget first impressions but hard to remember them.\n\nFirst, some people think that first impressions can't be changed, but they're wrong. I can always change how I look. For instance, if I sell everything at my restaurant today, I'll be very happy because I made more money than yesterday. But if I didn't sell anything, I'd feel different; I might be sad, worried, or angry. That's why I believe my look changes every day.\n\nNext, it's not hard to change first impressions because my feelings can change fast. I can be sad now and happy later. This is why I believe first impressions can be changed. Also, looks can trick you. I might look like a good person when I help the homeless, build schools, and give money to poor kids. But they don't know that I'm not good in my town; I drink alcohol and use drugs. That's why I say first impressions can be false.\n\nLastly, I show people I'm good when I'm not. I can pretend. For example, Generic_Name and I are friends, but I like Generic_Name's girlfriend and I want them to break up. So, I'm not really a friend. That's why I disagree with the statement. We must understand that first impressions are easy to change.\n\nIn conclusion, some think first impressions are hard to change, but I don't think they're hard to forget because some people pretend to be something they're not.

They work very hard and always do the right thing. They don't waste time smoking or ignoring their work and tests. These students aim to get into a good college and study what they have planned.

For example, a person's smile can show if they care about cleanliness and if they are tidy. First impressions matter in job interviews, when meeting others, and on first dates.\n\nFirst, consider a job interview. It's key to make a great first impression to get the job. The clothes someone wears can show how serious they are. If they come in dirty clothes and messy shoes, and act rudely, the interviewer will think they don't care about the job. Some may ask, 'What if they can't afford nice clothes?' But if they really want the job, they will try their best to impress.\n\nNext, when meeting new people, a simple act can tell you much about them. A big, warm hug might show someone is friendly. But a mean look or word can show rudeness. Some friendly people might turn out rude later. Yet, many stay nice as you get to know them.\n\nLastly, on a first date, people work hard to impress. They might tell jokes to seem funny or be polite to seem interesting. Some worry, 'What if they're lying?' But not everyone is dishonest. Most try to be themselves.\n\nIn conclusion, first impressions help us decide who to get to know. They are key in job interviews, making friends, and dating.

They show what someone thought of you when they first met you, whether it's bad or good. I really think that after the first impression, you need to spend time with the person to really know them and decide if you want them in your life or not.\n\nSome people say that first impressions are hard to change because they just stick. For example, if someone thinks badly of you when they first meet you, they might keep thinking that way. Or if they think you're a bad person, they might be careful to stay safe. When you meet someone new and they seem bad, you might choose not to see them again. Later, you might hear from others that the person is mean, and you're happy you stayed away.\n\nBut what if a friend told you bad things about someone you haven't met? You would have a bad idea of someone you don't know. Then, if you meet the person and they are actually nice and amazing, you would regret thinking badly of them because of what your friend said. You find out your friend's reason for not liking them was silly.

If students are okay with their courses, and if they've learned enough after three years of high school, then yes, I think some could leave high school a year early to start working. To me, the best choice is the usual four-year high school. It's better for a student to apply to these. Three years is hard work, and having an extra year will give them more time to improve their weak spots. Going from a four-year high school to a three-year college isn't a good move. It's better to finish high school in three years because you get more time to get help. Students should join the programs if they think it's the right kind of support for them. For instance, six years or more is good because you get more time to study for exams and pass classes. It's fine to spend two or three years in high school. It's not just about passing exams; it's best to finish with your class. Students might not pick extra courses they like because they want to have the chance to choose them. This is because classes give you points, and it's not always the best choice to pick extra courses. Some schools have these programs or sports like soccer, golf, and hockey, which can help students. If students are okay with their courses, and if they've learned enough in three years, then yes, I think some could leave high school early to work. Starting college or a job a year early is smart because it lets the student follow a normal path. But going from a four-year high school to a three-year college isn't good.

Finishing early can help them do both. If they can't finish early, they might quit school because they need money. If they finish early and get a diploma, they can find a better job because they have that diploma. Or, they might not like school but still want to finish.\n\nNext, students from other countries often miss their home and culture.

Be patient, and eventually, the doubters will see your success and have nothing to say. Sometimes, school doesn't teach you about life, like not just being a worker but being your own boss. This is because the government needs workers for their businesses, like banks and stores. That's when you should think positively and work for others, so one day, you can be the boss."}
{"text_id": "2CCFDD86A250", "output_essay": "Staying true to yourself in a world that often wants to change you is a big win. You can choose to be someone else and be who you wish to be. Not everyone gets to see the world in their own way and avoid being changed into something they're not. For instance, imagine you live with your family and nothing seems to change. They don't let you be yourself, or you feel out of place. You move to a new country and find that this new place offers you more chances than before. Sometimes, trying to fit into a world that wants to change you isn't good because you might start doing harmful things. This could happen whether you're a good person or not. There's always a dark side to the world that becomes clear if you do harmful things like using drugs, hurting others, or drinking too much, or if you have family problems and no one to talk to. It's a mix of good and bad, and it also depends on the person. Some people don't care much about the world. But I believe that being true to yourself in a world full of different chances helps you see new possibilities. Things that seem impossible might look doable, and you can share this with others. Wanting to be someone else is okay if you're positive. You see yourself doing well and following your dreams, no matter where you are. It's about how people view the world and act. You reach your goals by doing the right things. Let's say you want to be a nurse, but your parents say it's too expensive. You still want to reach your goal, and many people offer you the chance to be who you want to be. Living in a world that tries to make you better and gives you many ways to show it, like through study, sharing your skills, doing good things, and being yourself, is valuable."}

I believe that the best thing a person can do is to be themselves. No matter where they come from or what they believe, people should not try to be what others expect. If everyone understands how great it is to be themselves, they will be less sad and more happy. This will give them confidence, and they will start to accept and respect each other.\n\nBeing yourself makes you less sad and more happy because being what you really want to be brings joy. You won't worry about what others think of your looks, actions, or desires. You will feel sure about every part of yourself.\n\nWhen you accept someone, you feel good about who they are and you respect them. If people are themselves and respect that, they will respect others too. When someone understands how you feel, they will respect you because they might have felt the same way.\n\nMy cousin Generic_Name used to do what others expected. One day he didn't want to anymore, but he was scared of what they would say. His mother told him not to worry. She said if he was himself, everyone would see how cool and funny he is. He listened, and since then, everyone respects Generic_Name for who he truly is: a good friend, a cool person, and a good student.\n\nTrying to be what others want is not a good idea and it's not worth it. When everyone realizes that being 'yourself' is one of the best things, society will get better. People will accept and respect themselves and others, and everyone will be happier and more confident.\n\nIt's clear that being you is the best thing you can do for yourself.

At first, a first impression can be good or bad, but it can change. How? Let's imagine it's a good impression, like a crush. You're at the mall and you see someone. Your heart beats fast. You want to get their number to talk to them. But what if you find out they don't want a serious relationship? You see them kissing and hanging out with different people. Then, you will start to think differently. Your heart won't feel the same way it did before. Your first impression changes. There are many kinds of impressions, like good or bad ones. It's important to understand them. Sometimes we get confused by what we feel and what we see, and we can lose track of ourselves. It's important to know what impression you will get and what you will give. You don't want to make a bad impression on someone you might like. But it's really good to make great impressions so that people won't speak badly of you, and you will seem like a good person. Keep trying to make good impressions so that people will want to be around you and you can make more friends. But remember, making a good impression isn't always the best, and making good impressions isn't always right. But yes, impressions can change. It just depends on the impression you give and the one you get."}

Others think first impressions show who people really are. I don't agree. Sometimes, people make a bad first impression, but that's not who they are. Other times, people seem great at first, but they're not. That's why I think first impressions don't matter. People might act different when they meet someone new. Maybe they were having a bad day, or maybe you didn't like each other at first. But now, you could be best friends.\n\nPeople often act different when you meet them. Why? They might be scared to show who they are right away. They need time to trust someone new. That's why they might seem different at first. Or they try to look good on purpose. For example, I act serious when I meet new people. But when I trust them, I show my real self. That changes the first impression I made. That's one reason I think first impressions can change.\n\nMaybe the person you met was having a bad day. We can't always tell if someone's day is good or bad. But you can sometimes see it in their face or eyes. Like when you meet someone new at school and they don't seem nice. Later, you become friends and learn they were having a bad day. That shows first impressions can change.\n\nOr maybe you didn't like someone at first and they didn't like you. But over time, they can surprise you. They can show you that first impressions don't last because they don't show who someone really is. Like with my best friend. We didn't like each other at first. But then we found out we have a lot in common. That's when I learned first impressions can change.\n\nIf you thought first impressions couldn't change, I hope I've made you see they can. They don't always show someone's true self. They might not be good at first, but they can get better. When you meet someone new, you'll get many first impressions. Don't worry if they're not good.

{"text_id": "135E08DB7D61", "output_essay": "I think it's a smart move for students to finish high school in three years and then go to college. Some students take extra classes in the summer to finish early. They talk to their advisors and say, 'I need to take all my classes to finish early.' This gives them more time to study or retake tests if they fail. Finishing in three years is a good thing. Taking extra classes that aren't required isn't helpful because they don't help you finish faster. You might end up spending more years in school, which isn't a good thing. Most students don't take these extra classes in the summer. If teachers make it possible to finish in less time, it's better for the students. They can graduate sooner. Taking summer classes helps because it shortens the time in school. In college, the amount of time you need to study depends on what you want to do for a job. If you move to a different school, make sure to take the classes you need to graduate. If they put you in extra classes, it's not good. You'll end up taking longer to finish. If you need to, you can talk to the head of the school and offer to pay for the classes you need in the summer. Online classes are also a good choice. You have to pass all your classes to graduate. Students have to work hard to finish school and go to college. If you're not going to college, you can start working right away. You don't need college if you can't afford it or if you're done studying. Students like to finish quickly and not take three years. It's better for everyone. They don't spend extra time studying. They just finish and go to college. College is great because it leads to a good job and more money. With a high school diploma, it's easier to find a job. It's better for students because they won't have trouble finding work."}

But people were spreading stories that she had fought with another girl. Then, a boy came to sit with her during lunch. They talked a lot and became best friends. After that, everyone in school let her try again to fit in.\n\nThis shows that we can change or forget first impressions.\n\nWe should let people change how we see them by getting to know them and giving them another chance.\n\nIt's very important to get to know someone. Often, we judge by how someone looks, and that's tough. Think about a girl who is always late to work because she has to walk there. She doesn't have a car. No one knows her struggle. If you knew, you could help her or understand her better. Or picture going to a job interview. People might judge you by how you look. But you work hard, you're smart, and you care a lot. You've tried many times to get the job. But the hiring people only look at your appearance, not your skills. This is sad. They miss out on people who really want to work hard. That's why we shouldn't judge someone without knowing them.\n\nGiving second chances means letting people show their true selves. Sometimes, a first impression is just bad luck. Imagine being on a TV show. You're nervous and you don't do well. But the judges let you try again. Being nervous can hide what you can really do.\n\nSometimes, people act fake to impress others. This doesn't always work. Two friends, Generic_Name and Generic_Name, stopped talking because one was being fake. One day, Generic_Name decided to give Generic_Name another chance. Things have been good since then. Giving second chances is key in life because people can change. As time passes, people change. That's why first impressions aren't always right.\n\nI don't agree that first impressions last forever. I believe we can change or forget them. We can do this by giving people a second chance. This lets them show their true self. And by getting to know someone before we judge them."}
{"text_id": "548849B47D8C", "output_essay": "High school is the last four years of school before college. Some schools let students finish high school in three years instead of four. Finishing in three years might seem great, but it means more work each term. Students who do this often have to take classes in the summer or at night. They might not get to choose fun classes either.\n\nStaying for the full four years is better, even if it takes longer. The last year of high school is usually easy. You often relax in class, depending on the class you have. With the four-year plan, you can pick different fun classes. In the last year, you just need to pass your classes to get your credits. Seniors, or students in their last year, get special treatment. For example, they can skip ahead in the lunch line.\n\nThree years of high school might sound good, but it means taking different classes. You might not get to pick your classes. You may also have to go to school in the summer or stay longer after school.\n\nIn the end, if your school lets you finish high school in three years, I suggest taking four years. If you finish in three years, you might be too young to work full-time, which can be tough. But if you're going to college, focus on your studies and don't worry about work."}
{"text_id": "9E59DA563201", "output_essay": "I have to say I don't agree with you that first impressions are almost impossible to change. I think it's hard to hide how you act, and acting badly can make people think poorly of you. But if you show a bad side to someone, it can help you see how to get better and keep a good relationship with them. Even though first impressions can really affect some people in job interviews, and people often get nervous and don't connect well, this doesn't mean you can't change what they think of you. Showing how you've improved at your job will help.\n\nFirst, I really think that impressions are just a small part of what people think about your personality. They show how you acted before. People who stay around you will keep thinking this way in the future. Impressions can label you in many ways. For example, when Generic_Name interviewed his new worker, Generic_Name, he was very happy and talked a lot. But now he has changed. He is very quiet and not as happy as he was.\n\nSecond, from what I know, people always make quick guesses about each other. It's like when a police officer stops you; what do I first think about the officer? I might think they will arrest me or put me in jail, even though I'm just going to get a ticket for breaking the rules. This shows my first guess was wrong.\n\nAlso, first impressions don't show who you really are. When you meet someone, you can't know their personality right away because everyone is different. Your first impression is just what you see, not the real person. For me, I used to just say \"hi\" or \"what's up\" to my teachers or older people. But I learned it's better to use the right words to be more polite. Now my teachers are proud of me because they see I've changed.\n\nIn conclusion, an impression is not just what you see; it's also a judgment. People make these judgments when they meet you for the first time. How you behave is a big part of this, and it can be seen as good or bad. I truly believe people can change their actions in every way."}

{"text_id": "5328DB744353", "output_essay": "Some schools are not sure if it's good for students to finish school early. Many people think that finishing in three years is bad. They say that staying in school for four years is better because students learn more and can figure out what job they want after college. First, students who are in high school for four years learn more. They finish all the needed classes and can take extra ones they like. Being in school clubs helps them get new skills and learn to speak up. Some students join groups that help others at school. They meet lots of people and get better at many things. They might even get college credits for this. Also, students from other countries or those learning English might need more time to get better at English before they finish school. High school teachers are there to help these students learn faster. The second point is that students can find out what job they want. They can pick classes that match their job goals. For example, if they like Marketing, they can take special Marketing classes. Schools have meetings where students can talk to college people about jobs. Counselors give a lot of help with skills, grades, where to live, how much school costs, and scholarships. This helps students pick the right job for their future. Even though students can finish school in three years, they might feel too much pressure. But they can save a year to do other things, like start college early, get used to college life, work, and make money for college costs. However, these students might not have enough experience and could be unsure about their job in college. They might not have thought about it enough, which could waste time later on. In the end, students should finish school in four years. They get help from more people at school, learn from different classes, get better at talking to people, and use these skills for their job or life. They also won't waste time looking for the right job with the help of counselors and teachers. In short, finishing school in four years is good because it gives students more chances for their future jobs."}

Many believe that first impressions show how a person acts. When you have lived with something, you can't change it because it stays with you. First impressions are hard to change because they are part of you, they stick with you, and you make them yourself.\n\nFirst, first impressions are part of you. For example, if you live in a nice place, you will become nice, and that niceness stays with you. Your first impression is how you act. Also, if you grow up in a family that likes peace and talks about problems calmly, you will act well and earn respect. It's hard for someone to change their first impression.\n\nAlso, first impressions grow with you. For example, if you have always known something, you won't leave it or change it. It's hard to change what you've always known. The first thing you know stays with you. For instance, if you have had dogs since you were young, and your dad asks you to give them up, would you? No, because you love your dogs a lot, just like how first impressions grow with you.\n\nThe main point is that you make your first impressions, not anyone else. For example, when you make your own impression, it's hard to change because it is deep in your heart. When you make something yourself, it's hard to change or get rid of, just like first impressions.\n\nSome say that first impressions can change. They think impressions change if you move and see life differently. This might be true. But if you stay in one place, your first impression won't change. It's hard to change because you will always remember it.\n\nIn summary, first impressions are hard to change because they are part of you, stick with you, and you make them yourself. They are part of you. For example, living in a nice place makes you nice. First impressions grow with you. For example, you won't change what you've always known.

Some are upbeat, while others are not. Those with a good attitude are winners because they make strong, good choices for themselves.\n\nFor example, they can choose to travel, learn for a successful future, and make wise decisions to improve their lives. A good attitude helps people see their worth and gives them hope to be someone special.\n\nAlso, people with a good attitude can tell right from wrong. For instance, if two students at our school fight and someone with a good attitude sees it, they can figure out who is wrong while staying positive. People with bad attitudes don't care about right or wrong because they might act like the fighting students. This is why having a good attitude is like sunlight in your life; it makes your personality shine.\n\nSo, people with a good attitude will know how important it is to respect others and themselves. For example, if a student is positive at school, they will respect everyone. It doesn't matter if others are negative; a positive person will still respect them. They don't compare themselves to negative people. Even if someone says mean things to them, they don't mind because they know themselves well.\n\nMoreover, people with a good attitude can always help others. For instance, if a positive person is walking and sees someone who needs food but can't pay for it, they will ask, \"Why are you sitting here alone?\" The person might say, \"I have no one, I'm alone and hungry. I asked for a dollar for food, but no one helped.\" The positive person will then say, \"Don't worry about food; come with me.\" They will take the needy person to the store and buy them plenty of food. The person who was helped will be very thankful. This is how positive people show their character to the world. I completely agree with such nice and respectful people."}

No one likes to be around someone who is always negative. But we like people who smile, tell jokes, and help us forget our worries. Being positive helps us make friends and cheer up others. I've seen that friendly people are often positive and do well in their social lives.\n\nNext, being positive changes how we feel at work. Many of us don't like our jobs because they stress us out. But if you're positive, work isn't as bad. Let's look at a simple example. Imagine someone who is late to work because he didn't set his alarm or got stuck in traffic. He starts his day stressed. But a person who sets his alarm early or leaves home early to beat traffic has time to get ready. This positive person gets along better with coworkers and the boss.

Now, I'm happy I can do what I want. \n\nSecond, when you're true to yourself, you don't live in fear of others judging you for wanting to be different. Don't be scared to be happy. Change what you want and show who you really are. Be different in a good way. If you want to sing or dance in the street, do it. If you love art, go for it. For instance, a friend of mine lives with his parents. His dad made him study what he didn't want to. He's scared because he can't do what he loves. He wants to be an artist, but his dad wants him to be a lawyer and work with him. \n\nOn the other hand, if you don't be yourself when you can, you'll regret it because you can't always be yourself. I say this because some friends regret not taking their chances. For example, my cousin wanted to be a doctor, but his mom pushed him to be a singer. Now, he regrets not taking the chance to be a doctor. My mom tried to do the same to me, but I followed my heart, and now I do what I want, in a good way. \n\nIn conclusion, I agree with the idea of being yourself no matter what others say. If you don't try to enjoy life, you'll never know what it's like to be yourself. Just be yourself, and you'll see the difference."}
{"text_id": "97EC9FB7C355", "output_essay": "Some schools let high school students finish in three years instead of the usual four years. To do this, students must take online classes in the summer and evening classes too. This means they start college and work a year early.\n\nI think making students finish faster than needed is not fair to them or their future. It makes the student not fully ready for real-life work. A student who chooses this way spends less time on hobbies because they are always studying. Students should finish high school or college in the normal four years, not by rushing to finish sooner.\n\nStudents who choose this fast program are not being fair to themselves or their future. It might be okay for a few, but most will not benefit. It could even hurt their chances of doing well in the future. There is a set way to graduate, and there should not be another way. It should be slow and natural. We should not rush just to be faster than others. Going to school every day and following the routine teaches discipline, how to manage time, and how to be patient. A normal school life makes a student a better person than rushing into life's details.\n\nA student who rushes graduation is not ready for the real world.\n\nStudents should move into their jobs with a clear plan. If they rush, they miss the chance to grow. Students who are not ready and then go to college are not helped. They are not mentally ready and their basic skills are weak.\n\nStudents should also do hobbies because it helps them grow. But if they are taking online classes, regular classes, and evening classes, they will have no time for hobbies. A student's life should be balanced with both school and hobbies. School, sports, and fun activities teach a lot. Finding the right balance is very hard for students who finish high school in three years.\n\nSome might say finishing high school in three years saves a year. They can use that year for college or to decide what job they like. This can give students a clearer idea of what they want to do.\n\nBut I still think students should finish high school in four years as planned. They are given this time for a reason. It takes this long for a student to move from high school to college and then to work. Every student is different. Some can handle school and life well and do great in college and beyond. But others need more help and attention. So there should be a standard system with no shortcuts. The only way to graduate high school should be the four-year program."}

Being positive makes you look like a great person, pushes you to do good, and helps you find friends who care about you.\n\nBeing positive makes you look like a good person because you share good vibes with everyone. When I go out, I always try to stay positive so people think I am nice. When I go to events and meet positive people, it makes me happy. But meeting people with bad attitudes makes me want to leave. Some might say that being negative is fine because nobody cares. But your friends and family do notice. Your attitude shows them if they want to spend time with you or not.\n\nThinking about being positive can push you to do good things. I've met angry people who do nothing and happy people who are ready to help. I try to have good days. Good days make me feel like doing more. Some might not think being positive helps. But if they tried it, I think it would change their lives.\n\nFriends may leave, but if you're positive, you'll find friends who care. I've seen people who don't care about their attitude lose friends. It happened to me, but I learned and changed. Now, I tell others to stay positive so they don't lose friends like I did. Some think that friends might use you if you're too positive. But positive people know how to handle that.\n\nThese are the reasons why I think being positive is very important for success in life."}

But some think you can change how others first see you.\n\nFirst, you can't change first impressions because they matter in jobs. When you go for a job interview, the boss looks at how you dress and act. This decides if you get the job. For instance, I once applied to Pancho Villa Mexican Restaurant. Generic_Name interviewed me. I wore a white shirt, red tie, and black shoes. Generic_Name gave me a job as a server. Later, I became an assistant manager.\n\nSecond, people remember you by your first impression. When I moved cities, people knew me for my soccer skills. They saw me play once and were impressed. They talked about me, my three languages, and my soccer. Good first impressions can make you popular.\n\nStill, some say you can change first impressions. They think we can grow and fix our mistakes. I don't agree. Whether good or bad, your first impression sticks with people. That's how they first met you.

{"text_id": "3C818D5455E0", "output_essay": "Being true to yourself in a world that always tries to change you might be the toughest thing today. People often try to convince others to think differently. I think staying true to who you are is key because then no one can change your real self. You can share your own ideas with others. Being true to yourself also makes you different, and you can be happy by following your own thoughts.\n\nFirst, your own ideas can influence others. There are many people with many thoughts, but your ideas can help, especially in a tough spot when even smart people are stuck. Some may not like your ideas, but if you try them, they might work and others could be swayed by your thinking! For instance, my 10-year-old sister figured out how to open a jam jar we couldn't. She suggested using a pair of rubber gloves for grip. It sounded strange, but it worked! Now we use gloves to open tight jars. Things aren't always what they seem!\n\nAlso, being yourself makes you special. We all have our own ways of thinking, dressing, talking, and showing who we are. It's about whether we are being true to ourselves. We can show our uniqueness by doing our own thing. Just following others can be plain. But being different and using your own ideas can be amazing! People might even like you more for being different and want to copy your style. For example, Rolls Royce made a future car, the 2035 model, that looks like their old cars but drives itself. Don't think being yourself will make people dislike you; your ideas might impress them!\n\nLastly, we find joy by living our own way. Sometimes we feel unhappy, like something is missing. Have you felt that? Even if we're doing well and getting good grades, something can feel off. It might be because we followed someone else's advice and changed our minds. Listening to others and not doing what makes us happy won't help us. We should always do what brings us joy and not change our thoughts just because someone says so. For example, I regret taking an art class my friend suggested. It's a nice class, but I don't like it because it wasn't my choice. I learned to never just go with what others say and to do what makes me happy.\n\nIn conclusion, being yourself has many benefits. Even though it's hard because people try to influence us, being yourself is the best way to live a happy life. We can inspire others with our thoughts, be unique by being ourselves, and be happy by following our own ideas. Knowing this, we see that being ourselves is good for us.

Some think being yourself in the world is not real.\n\nI believe that 'To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment' can lower your self-esteem, weaken trust with friends, and make you more jealous.\n\nFirst, I think that people who always try to be something they're not will lose confidence. You should believe in yourself before you worry about what others think of your success. Your excitement for doing things will also drop. Many people succeed by being true to themselves. If we think that being ourselves will always lower our confidence, we are wrong. Also, it's important to build confidence before we care about others' opinions. Everyone can do something special.\n\nSecond, I think that people who feel that being themselves will always change them into something else will hurt their friendships. Everyone acts differently and has different skills. In fact, some people lie, which can hide who we really are. Not being real can cause problems with friends. This is because not everyone is honest about what they have done.\n\nThirdly, I think that being yourself, which the world will always try to change, is a big achievement and will make people more jealous. Jealousy will not go away because people will stop trusting themselves and start comparing to others. They will think that what others have done is the main goal, which will make them more jealous. But, people can't live always feeling jealous of others.\n\nFor these reasons, people should believe in themselves by not being jealous, by gaining confidence, and by being better friends. Being who we are is the best thing we can do, and this will help us succeed and be happy."}

The future is hard, and only your family can support you. If you have money problems, your family is the only one who will help you.\n\nBut, it's not good to always be alone because having help can give you more chances. For example, it's easier to finish school or get a job if you have support. It's good to be your own person, have a job, and pay for things like your car. When you're on your own, you don't need anyone else; you just count on yourself. Having a job and a car shows you're responsible. Still, getting help while you become independent is helpful. In the United States, it's easier to finish school and get better jobs if you work.\n\nLater, when you get married, you'll need a good job to take care of your family. It's good to be on your own, but you should also keep in touch with others. You need a car to go to work, especially if it's far. Without a car, life would be hard for you and your family, including your kids.\n\nSome people think being on your own is good, but others don't because you might need help and no one will be there. In the future, people will care only about themselves. If you're in trouble, they won't help; only your family or your mom and brother will. If you ask someone else, they might say no, but your family will always say yes. I don't agree with being completely on your own because with family, things are easier.

We should be able to finish school in three years. This way, we can finish school quicker, have more time, and be more true to ourselves.\n\nFirst, finishing school faster means we have more time for ourselves. We will have time to enjoy with friends or just relax alone. Having a whole year to ourselves would be great. We could do many fun things or try different jobs.\n\nSecond, with only three years of high school, we will have time to work and save money for college. We can also look for the best college. For me, working for a year before starting college is easier and saves money.\n\nThird, by being more true to ourselves, I mean we will grow up. We will understand what is good and bad. After a year off, we will see that school is important. Right now, many are not ready for college or anything else. If you're unsure about college after high school, it's fine to take time to decide. You can work instead. So, I think all students should finish high school in three years, not four.\n\nIn conclusion, high school should be three years, not four. Finishing early is great. Everyone wants more free time and to be true to themselves.\n\nI'll share a short story about school in my country. In Albania, school is tough but only lasts three years, and there's no SOL.

Remember what Ralph Waldo Emerson said, 'To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.' This saying is important because it will change your life. These words are true because being yourself is a big win. If not, everyone would be alike, and you would be happy. First, being yourself is a big win. For example, if people expect you to go to college and you don't want to, you might feel you're wrong. But people will like you for who you are. It's hard to act like someone else. Being yourself is great, especially when it's hard. Second, if everyone were the same, there would be no new styles or ideas. For example, if everyone dressed the same, no new styles would come up. If we all thought the same, there would be no new ideas. The world would have all the same things. Being different is key, even if it seems strange. Lastly, you'll be happy when you are true to yourself. For example, if you chase your own dreams and not what others want, you'll be glad. When you're happy with who you are, don't let others say you're wrong. You won't get sad when you're happy. Even if it's tough, look for ways to be happy. It's true that others' choices can give you a new view. But being yourself matters more. It's hard to fake being someone else.

My mom is a funny person who is always happy and talks a lot. Once, at her job, I heard someone say, 'Ugh, she's annoying.' My mom heard it but ignored it and kept working.\n\nAnother reason I agree is that it's annoying when people try to make you change. I'm very shy and don't make friends easily, and that's okay. Since I was young, I've been this way. In school, I met someone who judged me because I liked being alone. She said I had to be more outgoing to be her friend. I didn't want to change just to fit in, and I found her demand silly.\n\nMy final reason is that you don't want fake friends. In my second year of high school, I tried out for the soccer team and met a girl. She's now my best friend and has always been the same, even with adults. She's funny and kind with my mom, my uncle, me, and even strangers. Some girls act one way with adults and another with friends. That's not right.\n\nIn conclusion, don't let anyone change you.

Views can hurt us and the people we care about, often without us realizing it. I strongly believe that first views can be changed. A view is just what we think about something. For example, when someone sees a new car, they might say, 'Wow!' because they like it. But if they see an old car from the '80s, they might not like it as much. However, both cars have four wheels and can get you places. The new car might seem better, but that's not always true. Old cars were made with safety in mind, and people used to care a lot about that. Also, some think we can't change our views. I don't agree. I've changed my views before, and it has helped me and others. Once, my dad took me to a meeting with his friends. I thought I wouldn't like it because they were much older. But when I went, they were kind, and we had fun. This showed me that we can choose to change our views. People say it's hard to change your views, but if we don't, it can lead to good or bad results. Sometimes, we don't think about how our views affect others. If you get a simple gift from one family member and a new car from another, you might get more excited about the car. This could make the first person feel bad, especially if they can't afford to give you a car. But we can change how we react to show we appreciate both gifts. Finally, why should we care about changing our views? Because they are more than just thoughts. They show who we are and can inspire others.

Finishing school early lets students work or go to college sooner. I'd like to finish quickly to start working or attend college.

But we all make mistakes. It's important to learn from them. Ask yourself if you were nice to others and what you learned. I'll share my story. My family had money troubles and every day was hard. We hoped for better days, but they didn't come, and I lost hope. But my family stayed happy and hopeful. My dad said, \"Never lose hope. Your hard work will pay off, and being positive is key to success.\"\n\nSometimes life's challenges happen for a reason. Don't give up and stay positive.\n\nTo be positive, look for the good in life. There's a saying, \"Where there's a will, there's a way.\" Here's an example. A guy named Generic_Name was handsome but mean. He never worked because his parents gave him everything. But then his parents' business failed, and they got sick. Generic_Name had to take care of them. He struggled, but when he got his life together, his parents had died. He was sad but also happy because he learned to be responsible. He changed from being a bully to working, studying, helping others, and starting a business. This story shows how his life and attitude changed. To be successful, always be positive.\n\nIn conclusion, to stay positive, focus on the good things in life. Positive thinking and attitude lead to success. So, stay positive, never give up, and keep hope. Be the best you can be by being positive and kind to others."}

If you want to go to college but are negative, people will see you don't try hard. They won't want to help you. But if you're positive, people will want to help you succeed.

If students take extra classes in the summer, they might miss out on time with friends and family. They could also get distracted from their sports if they play on a team outside of school. High school offers chances that college or jobs don't. For instance, more students can play sports in high school than in college. In college, you have to be very good to play sports, and not many get to do it. It's better to teach students skills in high school that will help them in college and in jobs. These skills can also help them get college credits cheaply. Students who work right after high school might earn money for one more year. But this doesn't matter much. Staying in high school for the full four years gives a better education. This can lead to better jobs and higher pay later. I think it's better to graduate in four years instead of three.

This lets them start working on their job goals sooner. It's smart for schools to have ways to help students finish early. It's pointless for students to stay in school if they have finished all their classes already. Finishing high school a year early can be good for students. They can use the extra year to make money or begin their jobs. For instance, a student who can't afford college can use the extra year to make money. Students get more time to plan their futures. Colleges will be impressed if a student finishes school early. It might be tough and stressful for some students to graduate early, but I think it's worth it. You get an extra year to do what you want. Schools should let students decide if they want to spend four years or three years in high school. I believe spending four years in high school isn't useful when you don't need all those classes. It's a waste of time to learn things that won't help us later. Schools shouldn't force students to take extra classes just to finish with everyone else. It's better to have an extra year to plan your future than to sit in class not caring about what you're learning. I think it's pointless to stay in school when you've finished all your classes.

{"text_id": "8279A3CD5E68", "output_essay": "Should students finish high school early? Many 17-year-olds do graduate early. Some are tired or bored of school. But most think it's a good idea to work hard for a year. They want to pay their bills or save for college. Yet, this isn't the best choice. Students shouldn't finish high school early. They won't speed up their life, learn more, or plan their future well.\n\nFirst, students often want to finish high school quickly. They should understand that things take time. Why rush? Students should stay in high school for four years. This way, they can think about what they want to study in college. Choosing a college major isn't easy. For instance, one student wanted to be an engineer. Later, he found a hobby he loved more. He wasn't sure what to study or where to go to college. The four years in high school help students make good choices for their future. They can decide without regretting it later.\n\nNext, students can learn more. Every day, they learn new things from their teachers. This is good for college, where the work is harder. If they learn well in high school, they'll do fine in college.\n\nStudents also use high school to plan. It's good to know what you want for your future. They can look for scholarships if they don't have enough money for college. They can also plan by not spending too much. College in the U.S. is costly. High school helps students grow up. They become more responsible. They know what they need to do well in life.\n\nIn conclusion, students should not rush through high school. Learning from teachers every day is good. Being organized and planning ahead is important for the career you choose. You'll do well if you take your time. Don't make quick choices you might regret."}
{"text_id": "686788B2673C", "output_essay": "Some people might think that going to school for four years is not as good as three years. I believe four years is the best choice for me. But some students want three years because they have other plans and want to finish school quickly. Reasons to choose four years over three include: no summer break in the three-year plan; learning too fast means you might forget quickly; and you can't choose extra classes you might like to take.\n\nSome schools have a three-year plan. It helps people who need to finish school early. It's a good way to get a High School Diploma for those who want to do something else. For example, it's good for people who want to join the ARMY, work for a year to save money for college, or for those who failed a year in High School or Middle School.\n\nFirst, everyone enjoys summer break, but you can't have it if you're in the three-year plan. You have to go to school in the summer. This can be very stressful; you get tired and can't play sports because you're busy studying. I wouldn't choose this plan because I wouldn't have time with my family. Imagine your family is going on a trip and you can't join because of summer school. Also, the normal four-year school gives us about two months and a few extra days off every year, which is nicer.\n\nAlso, not everyone can learn fast and remember everything. It's hard. For example, if you learn something important early on, you might forget it by the end because it was too much too fast. Then, you have to look at your notes again and try to learn it without a teacher's help. But with four years, I think students can learn well and remember because they have more time to go over things until they really get it.\n\nLastly, you can't take extra classes you choose in the three-year plan, which I think are important. These classes let you learn new languages, like Spanish or French. You learn about their cultures too. If you're learning Spanish, you're not just learning words; you're learning about a big culture in the USA. Also, you can take art classes, which are great because you learn about famous artists and why art matters.\n\nIn the end, four years of school is still the best for everyone. The three-year plan is for those with different goals or who want to finish something early, like graduating. But the three-year plan means missing out on things like sports, breaks, and family time. Still, the three-year plan has chances that the four-year plan doesn't offer."}

I notice he is always nice to his customers. People leave his shop liking him. My uncle stays positive, even when he's sad. He shows his good attitude to everyone.

Once, at the park, my friends and I met a girl named Generic_Name. She was mean and not nice at all. She was rude, and no one wanted to be her friend. We told our teacher, and she said that if the girl keeps being mean, she won't have a good life. I felt bad for her. Maybe she thought attitude didn't matter, like I did.

Some people think this is bad because students have to take extra classes in the summer or at night. But I think it's good. It lets students get experience sooner, plan better for the future, and spend more time on things they love. First, getting experience early is helpful. It can help students get jobs or make future plans. For example, I watched kids at a kindergarten in my first year of high school. Then, I had to babysit my cousin when his parents were away. Because I had experience with kids, I wasn't worried. I had a good time with my cousin. Second, students might get better at planning. They have to handle many classes, study, and do activities after school. They learn to make good schedules and not waste time. This helps them know what they want to do later. Once, I was bored in the summer and did nothing all day. I decided to plan my days. Some plans didn't work, but I learned from them. I had a useful summer and got better at making plans. Third, finishing school early gives students more time for their interests. It's hard to study and prepare for a job at the same time. But with an extra year, they can focus on their goals. In Japan, I finished my homework early and had free time. I liked English, so I started learning it before school taught it. When I moved to the U.S., my English helped me in school and to talk to others. In conclusion, finishing high school in three years has many benefits. Students can get experience early, plan better, and have more time for their interests. So, it's a good idea for students to finish early and start college or work sooner."}

Since moving here, I've stopped trying. I don't want to go to school, I don't work hard in class, and I don't talk to people. I hardly have any friends; they're all back in my old town. I have a job here, which is good. I work at McDonald's on Route 1. They pay me at least 9 dollars an hour. I get on well with the people I work with. Sometimes we argue, but usually, we're okay.

I know life has ups and downs that can make you mad or upset. But it's important to stay positive and strong. Life involves everyone. It's better to see yourself doing well in life sooner than later because life is short. Now is the time to be an adult, to have children with your wife at home, or wherever you are. As a family leader, you must be positive, not just to your family but to others too. Other people are not the cause of your bad mood. Think about how you act with them. Here's an example: a coworker was taking pictures recently. I don't know why. I went to say hello. He told me angrily to 'Get out of here.' I thought he was having a bad time. I said, 'No problem,' not knowing why he was rude to me. The point is, we don't always know when others are having a tough time or feeling bad. These moments can make them act negatively.

{"text_id": "C2BECF203889", "output_essay": "I suggest that students follow the usual four-year high school plan instead of the new three-year option the school is offering. The three-year option has many downsides. First, you must stay late at school to take extra classes to finish on time. If you work in the evenings, you might have to skip work to go to class. Also, you can't choose extra classes that interest you. These classes could help you learn about different jobs, like plumbing or computer work. Plus, you will be so busy that you won't be able to focus in your morning classes. If you go with the usual four-year plan, you can learn at an easier pace. You will also have more time to get ready for college or other plans after high school. So, I think it's better to stay with the four-year plan. Students who do this feel less stressed and have more free time than those who try to finish in three years. Some students want to finish high school fast, so they pick the three-year plan.

We might be treated unfairly because of what we like, our dreams, or who we are. For example, if you want to be a singer, you are being true to yourself and chasing your dream. But if people treat you unfairly because of your religion, like if you're Catholic or Christian, or because of your race, they might not accept you. They could think you're less important, and that makes it hard to be yourself.\n\nSome people really want to help us, but others just act nice. They might use us, lie to us, or hurt us. They could replace us with someone they think is stronger or 'better.' In the worst cases, this hate can lead to being hurt or even killed.\n\nHow we look is another thing that can stop us from showing who we are. The clothes we wear show our style and how we want others to see us. But this can make people laugh at us, which makes it hard to be happy with ourselves.

Finishing high school in three years is a good way to graduate early. But it's hard because of family issues, schoolwork, and health. For family money problems, you might need to help your mom or dad with bills. You need cash for things like soccer shoes and your future dreams. Dreams like getting a car, a computer, going to college, or saving for an emergency. In school, you'll have lots of tests because you're only taking the classes you need to finish in three years. You'll get projects to do at the start of the year. Projects are big, and you might only get a few days to finish them. That's not much time. To graduate early, you have to pass 6 big tests at once, with 7 classes and no extra classes. At home, you might need to look after your little brothers or sisters or old grandparents. If you're the oldest kid at home, you have to do a lot. You also need to stay healthy. If you want to work, study, and have friends, you must look after yourself. I don't agree with fast programs. Not because they're bad, but because every student has their own family, work, or school issues. I believe in the program because it worked for my friend. She was the first friend I made here.

If a single word tries to define you, don't let it get to you too much, or you'll be trapped and won't be able to get out.

No matter how many diplomas you have, if you're not nice to others, you're not really doing well. Being successful isn't just about money. It's also about how you act towards others.

Some people don't care about positive or negative things. They don't think others can affect their mood. Don't let bad feelings into your life. Many people are sad, which feels like a sickness. They feel trapped in darkness and don't try to be happy. You must love yourself. That's the most important thing. Happy people have benefits: they can get good jobs because they seem organized and love their work. Some people write down bad thoughts and throw them away. This helps them feel important. Being happy is key because it makes you feel sure of yourself. You don't worry about what others think. Your own joy is what matters.\n\nYou can get past any problem. You might think you have too many problems. But being positive makes them easier to handle. You can break down any barrier. Stand up to problems and fight. Don't quit because you are strong and full of energy. It's okay if you fail at first. You can try again until you succeed. No one is perfect. Everyone makes mistakes. But that doesn't mean you should quit. Many successful people didn't quit. They didn't care what others said. They have great lives. People often focus on the bad in you. They want to see you fail. But if you want to do well, you must push through any barrier, no matter what.\n\nIn conclusion, I think being happy and positive is the secret to doing well in life. It helps you encourage others, feel joy, and overcome problems."}
{"text_id": "6E1BF9DFCB4B", "output_essay": "Thinking positively is a great way to get ahead in life. If you don't have a job, your business is struggling, there's trouble in your family, or you're trying to move past something, you need to be tough and keep thinking positively. I think that people can do whatever they set their minds to. For instance, my parents always said to reach for the stars because you can do anything if you think positively. When you run into a problem and say to yourself that you can do it instead of can't, you can reach any goal you have in this world. When I was a young teen, I faced a hard time, but I kept telling myself that I could make it, that things would get better if I didn't quit. At 13, I was scared of high places, but when my family went to KD, I joined my older brother and sister on the Drop Tower. I was scared, but I rode it because I told myself that I CAN do it. People who always say 'I can't' are often scared to try new things. But we only live once. Do you want to spend your life in fear, or with a positive outlook? Will you change 'can't' to 'I can'? If you take 'can't' apart, you get 'can not,' right? So, before you say you can't do something, always think 'can.' Give it a go. Don't be negative. Enjoy life and face every challenge with 'I CAN DO THIS!' or 'I WILL DO THIS!' because you can achieve anything you work hard for."}

Some people who are racist bother others who are different in race, religion, or sexuality. At work, some coworkers can be mean and make you do extra work. While many bosses make sure everyone is treated well, some agree with the bad treatment of those who are different. Still, there are more kind people than mean ones today, and people have many different styles. Why do some people get so angry at others that they hurt children and teenagers? It's wrong. But now, we have laws and groups that protect us from such harm. Sometimes, people are mean because they are jealous of those who are different but also smart, happy, and thankful. People might dislike others who are different for many reasons. For example, immigrants who come here for a better life often face hate and racism. Some people would rather harm them than respect them or ignore them. They might be angry because the immigrants are doing well. Like Donald Trump, who doesn't like immigrants or Latinos and wants to build a big wall. But society won't change for the worse just to please racist people. We should respect everyone, no matter where they're from or their culture. In this country, we can speak freely about our sexuality, religion, and culture, even if some don't like it. There will always be someone who disagrees, but that's okay. Being positive is good for you and makes you happiest, no matter what others think. People with different religions, sexualities, or cultures should do what makes them happy. Thanks to our rights and Emerson's words, being true to yourself is a big achievement. Start each day with a positive outlook. This can lead to success and might teach those who dislike differences to stop hating just because people are different."}

People all over the world talk about someone who meets all their goals, not because they are always positive. Sometimes, we have days when everything seems to go wrong, and we feel like giving up is the only choice. But, our success depends on how much effort we put into our goals. There are several ways to be successful: never give up, do your best, and believe in yourself.\n\nFirst, never give up. Many people fail and see bad results, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't try again. Always stay positive.\n\nSecond, do your best. Many people think they should set limits, but you can push yourself and make sure you do all you can.\n\nLast, believe in yourself. You need to believe in yourself in everything you do.\n\nIn conclusion, life is not just about our attitude or how we handle bad news. Success is about controlling what we do. I don't agree that attitude is everything because I think success is about working hard. For me, my success in classes is about my effort, not my attitude."}

Because my parents were often not at home, and my sister was too busy to help me with my homework. She had her own chores and schoolwork. I had to learn on my own and push myself to become who I am today.\n\nI agree with the writer Ralph Waldo Emerson when he says, 'To be yourself in a world that is always trying to change you is the biggest success.' Being true to yourself can take you to amazing places. You don't need to change who you are just to make someone like you or to get a job. In this world, some people won't be happy to see you succeed. They will dislike you, talk badly about you, and treat you unfairly. A Latino rapper once said, 'Haters fall, we rise.' This quote means a lot to me. In high school, people disliked me because I got good grades, was friendly, and was true to myself. They wanted to see me fail. They said mean things to me. At one point, I was doing badly in school and had bad relationships with others. This was because I was trying to stand up for myself, but it all went wrong. When 10th grade began, things changed for me. I got good grades, passed my classes, and now I'm graduating early. I've achieved things that those who disliked me didn't want to see. I did this with faith in God and in myself, with confidence, and by being true to myself.\n\nBeing true to yourself is the secret to success. Being told to be someone else is not helpful. It can push us into bad situations that we may regret forever. It's better to be a leader than a follower."}

An eleventh grader who has been in the same school for three years might have to move if their parents decide to change states. Then, they would have one more year to graduate from high school. On the other hand, if a student is doing well and their parents don't want to move, they can stay and finish high school. And if you're in twelfth grade, just focus on finishing.

If I didn't, people would say bad things to my mom. She had roles in the church like reading the Bible and leading groups. So, I always wore a dress and couldn't wear makeup or anything they didn't like. It was tough for me. Another point is about being different. I don't mean how you look. Parents often say we need to get good grades and graduate. Yes, finishing school matters, but so does our mental health. If your younger brother gets only A's or B+'s, some parents might favor him. But we're all different. We don't think, act, or have the same skills. Also, nowadays, some people end their lives because they're not accepted for who they are. This includes people with different sexualities. Mean words can push someone to do something serious. We shouldn't judge others. We should let people be who they want to be. It's not our business if someone is different. Just be who you are; it's what makes you happy. We all mess up sometimes, and that's okay.

When a person does well and meets their school goals, it is a good thing. It is impressive to complete high school in three years and then start college or a job. The first thing I would say is that the student needs to think positively. If they do, they can stay on track and finish school in three years. Then they can be happy with their family, like brothers, sisters, uncles, and cousins. Graduating is a happy event. I think that students should finish school in three years. In our world today, people expect students to be a certain way. But I believe if everyone were the same, life would be dull. We should all be our unique selves.

Some people agree that four years are better than three. \n\nWhen I started high school, I wanted to finish in four years. This would give me plenty of time to do everything. If I failed a class, I could retake it. I wanted extra time to retake any classes or tests I needed to graduate with my friends. The thought of failing and not graduating on time is scary. It's bad. Starting high school, you aim to pass all your classes and tests and graduate on time. \n\nStudents use summer school and night classes to earn credits. In my second year, I took summer school for algebra. It was easier because I only had to focus on one class, not many. This felt less stressful. \n\nMy friends took night classes. They said it was like summer school, but at a different time. Summer and night classes are good because they give you time to pass and earn credits. This also means you can take more fun classes later. \n\nBeing in high school for four years lets you enjoy high school life. You get to join in school spirit activities like football games, pep rallies, homecoming, and prom. It's a great feeling. You feel like you're part of your school's family. After high school, you can't live that life anymore. You have to grow up. \n\nMost people think three years are better than four because it's quicker. But high school will always feel quick, even in four years. I hope future students will choose to stay for four years.

Attitude is important for handling life's hard times. People often ask why being positive matters and why problems happen. Keeping a good attitude helps you find answers and stay hopeful. Being negative can stop you from moving ahead and doing well in life. It's very important to keep the good part of your attitude, especially when you have troubles. If you lose this hopefulness, you might face more problems and forget what you're trying to do with your life. We should always feel good about ourselves, keep our good attitude, and never lose it. If we lose it, we might not get it back. Our attitude is important for solving each problem we meet and for using the tools we have. For example, if you want a better job, you need to keep a good attitude and be ready to solve any problem. Without focus and a hopeful way of thinking, you won't get the job you want. A good attitude can open many chances in life, so don't give up. When you have a problem, deal with it and then move on. If you don't, the problem might become too much to handle. To do well in life, stay sharp, keep a good attitude, and go after what you want. If you ignore the problem, it can grow into a bigger one. Focus on the good, not the bad. No matter what others say, having a good attitude is important. Some people might agree, but others might say that being positive doesn't help. But with a good attitude, you can beat life's hard times and keep going the right way. Some people wonder how to get away from life's problems. The way to do it is by keeping a good attitude, which can guide you out of tough spots. Just stay sharp."}

It's true that a good attitude works well because others see you as special, nice, and just a regular person. When lots of people think you are special, some keep their good attitudes for a long time. We try to keep doing the right things, but sometimes we act nicely for a reason. For example, if we're in a bad mood and our parents ask us to do chores, we might not listen, argue, or shout at them, which is rude and wrong. But if we're happy, we'll listen to our parents, do the chores well, and they'll think we're special for listening to them and others in the area. If you're a nice person, you'll show kindness and respect to others. This becomes part of how you think. If you have a bad attitude, you might not help good people when they need it. But with a good attitude, even if you're busy and bump into someone, you'll help them and say sorry, which is the right thing to do. You can choose what kind of nice person you want to be. To be a good and normal person, many will choose the right attitude. Some might not choose to do the right thing and be different, but they need to learn how to be a good person. People can be happy or unhappy, and these feelings can make life hard for many. We can do things like normal people, like shopping, going to movies, parks, and other places where you can be a good, regular person. In the end, having an attitude that makes others think you're special, nice, and normal all add up to a good attitude. This encourages young people to learn about how they act. We know a good attitude is important for success. The way we act is important because it affects how we treat people who don't know this yet.

If someone doesn't pay attention to you when you're talking, like if they text or listen to something else, or if they cut you off, they are probably always rude.

For example, students who don't get money from their parents need to work. This program is great for them. Working and saving for a year is good. You don't have to ask your parents for college money. When you work, you reach your goal to pay for college yourself. Finishing a year early means you meet your goals.

I think it's best to finish school in three years or less. Many people need to start working and support their families quickly. Others want to finish early because of the jobs they want. Also, teenagers will have more free time if they graduate from high school sooner. Many people study and work at the same time because they need money for themselves or to help their families. For example, I work at Don Eladio's Cantina as a server. I work five days a week. But I don't have enough time for both school and work. I manage, but it's tough, and I don't earn enough money for basic things because I only work part-time. So, I want to finish school fast. Some students need to finish high school quickly because they want to go to college for a long time. They take hard classes like medicine, science, astronomy, psychology, and more. These classes take a lot of study time. If you want a higher degree, like becoming a doctor, you need many years of college. For example, becoming a doctor takes at least 4-6 years of classes. So, finishing school fast is necessary. On the other hand, some students want to graduate early to start other things young, like sports, music, or becoming an artist or writer. For example, when I graduate, I want to be a mechanic, a soccer player, or an artist. I will have the time to do it. Some people think four years in high school are needed for a person to grow properly. But they are wrong. You can learn everything and graduate in three years with the same good things and more free time. Also, when you graduate, you will have time to work or become a professional faster. In conclusion, graduating early is best if you're short on time, need to work and help your family, or want to start your dreams younger."}
{"text_id": "7995F136F3D6", "output_essay": "Having a positive mindset is not something everyone has, and many people think that only those born with it can succeed in life. They don't realize that success comes from keeping a positive attitude. Everyone starts with this ability, but not all grow it. I believe a positive attitude is essential for success. If you swap negative thoughts for positive ones, you can change your life. A good attitude is needed for success. 'Think positive, get positive results; think negative, get negative results.' If you know about the law of attraction, you understand this. If not, here are two examples. Imagine you want to join the tennis team but think you can't because of bad grades. So, you don't try to improve and give up. You didn't want it enough to try. Now, imagine you really want to join the team, but your grades are low. You ask your teachers how to do better and work hard on homework and classwork. After two weeks, your grades are better. You apply for the team and get accepted! Now you must practice for next month's game. This shows how a negative or positive mindset affects you, and why a positive attitude leads to success. Success and a positive mindset are hard to get because there will always be things or people trying to stop you. But if you want to succeed, you can't give up. You must be ready to do what's needed. Having positive and motivating people around helps with success. It can come from friends or strangers, not just family. But in the end, you are the key to your own success. You may have noticed that all successful people share a positive mindset. To succeed, you need a strong positive mindset. Attitude is crucial for success. Without a positive and strong attitude, you can't succeed. Many successful people have shown this. It's tough, but not impossible."}

You need to take extra classes in the summer to get better grades and move ahead. But getting your diploma this way won't be easy; there's a lot to do. The usual four-year program helps students a lot. It makes sense for those who can handle a three-year program. Some students want to finish school early so they can have an extra year to do other things. This can save time and reduce stress. \n\nFinishing high school is the first step to becoming an adult. Many students don't have parents to live with and must take care of themselves. Sometimes, life makes you want to change things. After high school, they can use their time to apply to colleges and for scholarships. I think students can manage these programs because they need to work hard in school to finish early. They should start thinking about college and what they need to do. \n\nStudents who do a three-year high school skip one year. After finishing, they can get a job to help pay for college. They can pay for their education themselves. If students choose three-year programs, I think they will take their studies more seriously. One big plus of having your high school diploma is getting better jobs. It feels good to graduate and be successful. If you work hard, your diploma will mean a lot to you one day. \n\nFinally, school can be very stressful with so much happening. You start to think about your future, and this makes you value your education more. The stress comes from the responsibility of learning. Some students' parents will be proud, but social media can add stress. Many students are tough; they don't worry about much. If students take a three-year high school program, nothing will stop them from learning. When they go to college, it won't be too hard for them. They understand things quickly, better than adults. \n\nI believe this program is very good for students in three-year programs, and I support the school. Other schools around the world should stop using the four-year programs. If students want a three-year high school and college education, they can make more money than those who don't finish high school."}

This could be a good choice to think about with other options. This choice gives all students more time to take classes that could really help them do better. Students might take some classes in summer or at night. In short, finishing school in three years could be quicker than taking four years. The best choice might be to finish high school in three years and get help to start college the next year.\n\nIn my opinion, I would think about finishing high school in three years instead of four because I think it would be good for me to finish early. It would be a great chance to get ready and do many good things that will make more sense as I go through college. Most of all, I think my knowledge will be stronger because I will be ready to grow my knowledge and skills. All these are good ideas because we will have enough time to get ready, to have enough time for what we want to do, and to choose what we really want to study.\n\nHaving enough time to get ready might cause some problems, because we all have different ideas. This means that while some high school students want to graduate and get their diploma, not everyone knows what they want to do after high school. Some students are ready for college, but they might not be ready for their chosen field. We must get help in high school to know what we need to do to learn more and get ready for college.\n\nHaving enough time to choose what we want to do after high school is a better way to think about our future and our goals. Everyone knows that some students want to work instead of study. We all know what is best for us. Some students work for a while after high school to make money and keep studying while deciding what they want to study.\n\nChoosing what we really want to study is important. Everyone in high school is excited and nervous in the last year, looking forward to college. But, we might get confused about the career or course we picked. As time goes on, we might not like the career and stop studying. The point is that before starting college, we need to know what we like to study and what is best for us to learn for the future after we finish our career or course.\n\nIn conclusion, the idea of finishing high school in three years is a good one. Graduating early could be good for our future. It helps us get ready and keep studying, and to be ready for what we want to do. It also lets us grow our knowledge after finishing our career, in both high school and college. Before going to college, we must get help to figure out what we want to be and study before any problems come up, and to keep studying and reach our goals and dreams without any problems."}

A good attitude can make it easier to get along with people like friends, family, or coworkers. Some people get fired because they are rude to other workers. But, there will always be people who don't like how others act. Having a good attitude is helpful because when you have a job interview, bosses look at how you do things and how you talk. For example, in jobs where you talk to customers, you need to be nice. This is why it's good to have a good attitude at work. It's also good to be positive in life. When you hang out with friends, being nice helps you meet new people and start important projects. In the end, I think that attitude is very important for getting a job or making friends.

It doesn't matter. He's not to blame for his feelings; he didn't choose them on purpose. It doesn't matter if you're rich or not; we're all equal. Having 'special chances' in life doesn't make you better than anyone else. Being an individual means you don't have to be what others want. You are who you choose to be. No one should say, 'Show me what you can do or who you are.' You are who you are, and you should keep trying your best. Many people will be mean or disagree with you, but you should stay true to yourself. For instance, stay positive. If you face a tough problem, think positively. People can say what they want, but they don't know what you want. Also, your family is important. They show you how to live in the 'real world.' They should guide you on how to be, how to act, and what to believe. They might tell you if you should care about what others say or if you should live your own life.

It's hard to forget these first thoughts. You might think, 'That person seems mean' or 'I won't be friends with them.' We've all had thoughts like these at some point. In my life, I've met people who I thought I should stay away from because of their looks. I would judge them without knowing them, deciding if they seemed nice or not. But after spending time with them, I often found they were nicer than I expected. I was wrong about my feelings. First impressions always happen, and they warn me if someone might be good or bad. Friends often tell me they don't like someone they just met because of a look or because they didn't talk much. But remember, new people might be shy or quiet. It doesn't mean they don't like you. Try to understand them before you judge. For example, I once smelled a hair conditioner in a store and didn't like it. But my mom said to try it anyway. It turned out to be the best for my hair, and I still use it. Just because you don't like how something seems doesn't mean it's bad. Always give things a chance. First impressions can be good or bad. They can change for the better, like when you end up liking someone you thought you wouldn't. Or when a product you doubted works well for you. But they can also be bad, like when you think a quiet person doesn't want to talk to you. Eighty percent of people think first impressions are hard to change because they don't really know the person yet. It's normal to have good or bad thoughts about someone new. But you can't be sure until you get to know them. You might find out they are nice and want to be friends, or that they are helpful when you thought they weren't. First impressions are always there.

Students who do this often have to take classes in the summer or at night and might not be able to choose extra classes. Finishing high school in three years is smart because it can open up more chances for them. For instance, if you are the oldest kid in your family, you can help out more, especially if you have a single mom who needs to buy food by herself.

I don't mind, but I wish I could save more. Then, when I get a good job, I can take care of her completely. Another reason why finishing school early is good is that you can start your life's work young. If you want to be a doctor and you finish school at 17, you have a whole life to not only be a doctor but to do anything you want.

This will help them get better at English, improve their skills, and prepare them for college and jobs. After high school, getting ready for college is a different challenge. It's not easy for those who can't pay for college because it costs a lot. The four years can help make their thinking stronger and sharper. For example, students can pay for college with the money they earn from sports they played in high school, like football, soccer, and baseball.

You can't go back and change a first impression because they might treat you the same. Also, first impressions can show who you are.

Doing this every morning is something I can't forget. I think first impressions are nearly impossible to change because the first thing you learn is easy to remember and hard to forget. Early experiences are often seen as important, so people pay more attention to them.\n\nThe first thing you learn is easy to remember and hard to forget. When you are young or just woke up, your mind doesn't have many worries. It's like a blank page, which helps you keep first impressions. This clearness makes it almost impossible to change these impressions because they fill your thoughts.\n\nThe first thing people hear, see, or do often grabs their attention and sticks in their memory easily. I think what is important is usually shown first. For instance, in a race, the one who starts the fastest at the beginning usually has the best chance to win. They might still lose, but it's often the early leader who wins because of the lead they got at the start.\n\nIn conclusion, I want to stress how important first impressions are and how hard they are to change. From my time on the school wrestling team, I've seen that my opponent always tries his hardest in the first round to make the second round easier. If he makes me tired in the first round, I'm too weak to fight well or do my best."}

It can help you get a job, make friends, and show you are doing well. To do well, you need to keep thinking positively. This is key because it shows who you are. For instance, if you find a job as a cashier, you should be nice to customers. If you are not nice, they may tell your boss, and you could lose your job. But if you are always nice, a customer might tell your boss something good about you. This could get you more money or help you move up at work. Thinking positively can make you do better in life. How you live also affects your attitude. We don't know why someone might be negative. We don't know what they need or why they act that way. But we can say more about someone who is positive. They seem happy with what they have. They don't seem to worry. We can say many nice things about them. Why? Because they are positive. Worrying all the time can make your attitude worse. But being positive can help you reach your goals. Being positive can also help you with problems, like at school. If someone in the hallway wants to fight, being positive is good because you try to ignore them. If you are negative, you might fight and get in trouble for not controlling yourself. With a positive outlook, we can be successful. I think being positive is the key to doing well in life. Without it, you can't do well if you are always worried, stressed, or negative. We must learn to manage how we feel. If we don't try, we won't do well. Life is hard without a positive outlook. If we look for the good in bad times, we will not just get by, but we will do well. All you need to do is keep a positive attitude."}

It helps you become who you want to be. Say you want to be a nurse, and it's tough. With a positive view, you find ways to study and succeed. Positive people see more chances in life. They show others how to see things in a good light, not a bad one. For example, if someone always thinks they can't do things well, you can show them how to do it right. A good attitude leads to success. What does a positive person do? They fix things and don't give up, even when others say they can't. They find ways to get what they want. To be successful, be positive in all you do. Don't listen to negative talk. Try another way if something is hard. With a bad attitude, you miss chances and it's hard to get what you want. Your attitude shows others who you are and how you behave. I believe a good attitude is the key to success. It helps you make the best choices in whatever you want to do."}

My sister finished high school in three years because she's very smart. She took extra classes in the summer and skipped the optional ones. She passed all her classes and now she's working and enjoying life because she's done with college. Should students try to finish high school early? I think it's a great idea. You get a year to plan your future. It's better because as teenagers, we don't work. We just focus on school. Our parents take care of us, so we can use that time to do big things. For example, we can take summer classes instead of wasting time. This way, we can finish high school early. If you wait the full four years, it gets harder because you're older and might need to work too. Working and going to school at the same time is hard. You have homework and maybe a full-time job. It's stressful. It's better to finish school with your parents' help. Planning to do high school in three years is a smart choice. Some people think four years is better, but they're wrong. If you do it in three years, you get more chances. You can finish college early, start working, and plan your future. In the end, things will be easier.

We people don't like to wait; we like things quickly. The good news for us students is that we don't have to wait. We can finish early if we want. We know some classes are needed to finish school. But some classes are not needed. They just keep us from finishing. Most of us want to finish school now. So why not skip the classes we don't need? Many students have a career in mind. If you finish school early, you get a whole year to work on your career instead of taking classes you don't need. I think that's a good deal, even if it means working harder. Think about being 17 in 11th grade. You go to school for a math class you need to graduate. But if you took that class last year, you wouldn't have this problem. You could be working on your career now. By 18, you would be further along in making your dreams real. That's one less year of school.

Many high school students are grown-up enough to live on their own. Plus, starting college early is a smart move for a student's job future and making money sooner. A student who takes extra classes in summer or at night is working hard for his future and wants to keep getting better.\n\nFirst, lots of high school students are grown-up enough to live by themselves.

When you are honest, people will like you and they won't say bad things about you. But, some people might be mean. \n\nLet me give you an example: if one student hits another and you tell a grown-up, the hitter will get in trouble, and you will have been honest. Then, the student who was hit might become your friend, but the hitter won't because you told on them. \n\nHere's another example: if you see someone taking money from someone else's pocket and you point it out, the thief might not like you, but others will want to be your friend because you were honest.

At the end of the day, only you know who you really are. You should never feel bad about it or change just to fit in.\n\nTo be yourself, you must first know who you are, and you shouldn't feel bad about it. Knowing what you want to do fills a part of you that others shouldn't control. Doing what makes you happy should be a part of who you are. Don't stop doing what brings you joy for anyone or anything. Whether it's a job or a hobby, joy makes you whole. Others may try to spoil it, but if you love it, don't let them. Choose what you do; do what you love and what brings you joy. That's what makes you unique.\n\nI believe you should always trust in your own abilities. Without trust in yourself, someone's words can hurt you and change how you act in a bad way. Always believe in yourself. There will be doubters, but you must show you're strong and different. Being modest shows you're not like others. Many people are not modest, and that's what the world pushes them to be: full of themselves and fake. Stay modest, no matter how rich you get; it shouldn't change who you are.\n\nPeople will try to change you because they don't want to see you do well. Ignore them and listen to your own heart. Staying true to yourself in those times shows your strength. Only you can make yourself better. Keep a positive outlook. Bring positivity to the world, and the world will respond in kind. Often, they want to see you upset and at your worst, talking about someone who doesn't matter to you. Being true to yourself is the best thing you can do in life.\n\nPeople enter and leave our lives all the time. Only a few will impact your future.

{"text_id": "47CA31054C81", "output_essay": "The lesson I taught young kids is about bullying. I talked about why bullying matters. It matters because kids can help each other, stop it, and not bully others themselves.\n\nOne thing I would teach the kids is to help each other. If they help someone, that person won't feel sad. Talk to them and check if they're okay. Make sure they feel safe. Helping someone is one of the nicest things you can do.\n\nStopping bullying is important. If you don't bully, you won't fight with others. If you see bullying, tell the person to stop. If they don't stop, get a teacher. By doing this, you'll make friends. You'll be the person everyone likes and trusts. Stopping a bully can make a big difference.\n\nDon't bully others. Think about how you'd feel if someone bullied you. If you bully, others might bully you back. Always treat people how you want to be treated. Imagine being in their place and how bullying feels. If you're a bully, other kids won't like you.\n\nThese are my three points about bullying. This is what I would teach the young kids at school."}

But trying to fit into this world also gives you many chances to meet people who change often and help you grow. This growth helps you become a skilled worker, grow up, and learn what you need or how tough you have to be. It's important to know how active you are in these situations.\n\nHaving the chance to try different things and learn what you need means that if you stay active or choose a new path, you will learn a lot. This is good for you because choosing to be active and follow your own choices is important. By trying new things and learning, you show yourself that you can try new things or keep being active, which is good for your future. When you choose, you will know or have learned enough to make the best choice.\n\nBeing active all the time gets you ready for your future or anything else that might come your way. You learn to think about your mistakes and fix them. This makes sure nothing bad affects you because your personality helps you decide what you will be in the future. Many parts of this are important for you. Part of life is being able to change your own future and who you are as time goes on. This helps you grow and think more like a grown-up. But it's key to know how you will deal with these things, how you will be as an adult, and what your future will be like. All these questions have one answer: 'yourself.' If you like being active and ready for new things in your life, things that will change you in a good way, then you are doing well.\n\nThere are many chances to show who you are and learn from them. Take what you really want to be or what inspires you to be a person. Chances are all around the world, and being able to change your mind and choose is part of being you. It's also about choosing what you aim to be. Your ability to think and inspire others with your choices is key. To grow as a skilled worker and learn about the chances in front of you is the best way to learn about yourself.\n\nStudents think that having the chance to learn while doing different things will help you get what you need. It keeps you active and ready for anything, whether it's for your choices, your future, or something else. You have the chance to show who you are, learn from it, take what you need, and also choose what you want to do in the end. This means that when you are always active and when you learn from every experience, you make your own final choices and fix mistakes to become very skilled as a person. Talking about this with friends, family, teachers, or anyone else to share ideas and learn from someone who is different from you is good. It helps you understand how you grow and how you act in those situations."}
{"text_id": "85408CA46C97", "output_essay": "I believe it's a smart move to finish high school in three years instead of four. If you work hard, get good grades, and pass all the required tests, you can help those who feel like giving up after one failure. Some schools let students finish in three years by taking extra classes in the summer or after school. This great idea lets students get their high school diploma sooner so they can start college early, get their ideal job, build a strong reputation, and be successful. Students who do well from the start of high school can finish by their junior year. School is where everyone, young or old, can decide their future and learn to reach their goals. We should take this chance to learn and avoid being lazy, which will help us succeed in life. Graduating early means a student can start college and work at the same time, without worrying about extra classes. Those who finish high school sooner can take a year off, work, save money, get ready for college, travel, visit their home country, and make their dreams come true, making their families proud. If we want success and to stop waking up early for school, we need to work harder. Failing once doesn't mean we should stop trying. To achieve our goals, we must put in the effort because just dreaming won't make it happen. We must take care of our grades and test scores to graduate early. Finishing high school in three years is better because it lets us start our careers sooner and take more interesting college classes. In the 90s, high schools didn't offer a three-year graduation option unless you finished all your classes early. But now, we all have the chance to do it. We can't just wait for it; we have to work for it."}
{"text_id": "7D82E6C4B46A", "output_essay": "It's not always the same. Some people think that the first impression can't be changed. I believe that the first impression can change when others see you looking nice, doing good things, and having a positive way of acting. Often, people are not what they look like. This might be because of where they are or who they are with. They might act differently to make a new impression. Usually, people don't show who they really are. They might act a certain way for work or because they don't have time. For example, some workers in stores can't talk to customers because of work. Next, what you do shows who you are. But your actions don't always show the real you. Many people in the city might seem mean but are really nice and do good things. How you look doesn't matter as much as what you do for others. I think doing good things can change how some people think about you. Doing good things can help you make new friends and feel more sure of yourself. Having a good way of acting is important too. People use a good way of acting to show who they are. Sometimes, skill can fix a bad first impression, but your way of acting can change over time or because of other people. Some people need to act well for their job. For example, waiters need to be nice to serve customers. Also, some stores don't let workers talk to people for different reasons. Your way of acting can also change with how you feel. If you have a bad or tiring day, you might act differently. A good idea is to try to act well and do good things. Then you will make a good impression on others. In the end, if you want to change a bad first impression, you can do it when others see you looking good, doing good things, and acting in a positive way. It's not always the same. Some people think that the first impression can't be changed."}
{"text_id": "A87ECDDAE5A1", "output_essay": "Ralph Waldo Emerson once wrote, \"To be yourself in a world that is always trying to change you is the best thing you can do.\" I really agree with Emerson's words, and here's why. You get one life, and it's yours. Would you want to end it with regrets? Would you like someone else to control how you live? I think most people wouldn't like that. It's your life, after all. We grow up in a world full of chances. From a young age, we dream about what we want to become. Remember, no one can decide for you what you can be, unless you let them. Everyone wants to succeed and be who they wish to be. But it takes a lot of work and willpower. We know it's tough, and there will always be challenges when you try to succeed. That's just how life is. There might be one big challenge that tries to knock you down. It could be a person, a place, or a thing. This challenge might push you to become something you're not, and you might feel like giving up. That's what Emerson was talking about. Many famous people say they had others trying to pull them down. But they stayed strong and didn't let anyone control their lives. What matters is not how hard you fall, but how you get up and keep going. Be the person you've always wanted to be. In the end, we are all flawed. We always have been and always will be. Not everyone is good. There is bad in the world, and there always will be. That's why it's said to live life fully and appreciate what you have. If you think about Emerson's words and what I've shared in this essay, I'm sure you can be very successful and happy. That's why I strongly believe in what Emerson said."}

In this essay, I will explain why I think it's not good to let others decide for us. If we do, we won't be happy. Being happy is very important. We should not let others change us because we will not feel good. Be yourself and don't let anyone tell you what to do if you don't agree. First, if you let someone control you, you might end up doing bad things. They won't care if you feel bad. They just want to use you. You will be the one who feels bad in the end. When you meet someone, tell them what you like and don't like right away. Remember this: 'Making others happy instead of yourself is not a big success.' Second, I had a friend in Australia named Generic_Name. She was always quiet. At school, some girls always hung around her. Generic_Name was scared, so she did what they wanted to avoid a fight. People laughed at her, and she got less respect. This shows why we need to tell the truth when we need to. It's tough when you're in trouble and only you can fix it. Speak up early, not late. Some people think it's good to always please others, but it's not. In the end, work on being happier and better without others telling you what to do. If not, you won't be happy. Just be yourself, so you can be successful in the future."}

{"text_id": "130FF3CB379E", "output_essay": "I agree with Emerson's idea that being unique is important because it makes you different from others. For instance, if others try to change how you walk, talk, and behave, they are controlling you. They are saying who you can and can't be. Picture a world where everyone is the same; it would be dull. Everyone would look and act the same. But each person is unique in many ways. I had a friend who was going to meet his girlfriend's parents. He wanted to act like someone he wasn't to impress them. I told him to just be polite and be himself. I faced a similar situation when meeting a girl's parents. I thought about changing my style to impress them. Instead, I chose to be myself, and they liked me for it. You can change your clothes and look, but you can't change your true self. Even if the world tries to change you, deep down, you stay the same. Your personality is what makes you stand out. It's something you can't really change, no matter how hard you try. Your personality lets you be yourself even when the world wants you to be different. This brings us back to what Emerson said. Emerson's words about being yourself are inspiring and modest. So, I agree with his statement that 'To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.' This is because being yourself is what makes you stand out from everyone else."}

Many teens get into trouble with drugs; they use drugs because they think it's fun. If you are someone who stays out of trouble, you should be proud—that's a big deal.\n\nFirst, right now, we live in a world where terrible things happen. For instance, some teens have chosen to shoot in schools and have killed many students. We need to watch our kids more because we don't know who their friends are at school. We don't want our child to hurt another family. We must make sure our child gets a good education so they don't do bad things.\n\nSecond, many teens use drugs because they think it's fun, but it's not. This shows they are not getting a good education. If they were, they wouldn't use drugs. Drugs harm your health; they stop you from thinking about good things, and you might do something bad. This is a serious problem because if we don't stop it, it will get even worse.\n\nAlso, if you are someone who stays out of trouble, you should be proud—that's an achievement to be noticed. Not many teens are well-educated these days, and when people see you are different, they are surprised. You should keep it up and try to help other kids who are struggling. If people see you are a good kid, they will admire you. They will say nice things and respect you.\n\nIn conclusion, right now, we live in a terrible world where bad things happen. For example, teens choose to shoot in schools, killing many students. Also, students who get into drugs don't care about their education. We must work to change this; we want them to value their education more. There are kids who think differently; they know what's good for them and they focus on their education."}

So, we all need a best friend to support our choices and help us find success. \n\nIn the end, I want to say that no one can do anything without help from family and friends.

Imagine it's your first day at a new job, and you meet your boss. He will look at how you act. If you make a really bad impression, he will think poorly of you. He might not hire you because of this bad impression. It's important to always make a good impression. This is because when you see nice people who are well-educated, you think highly of them. You expect them to be smart. It's true, you can try to change a first impression, but it's very hard. People quickly make up their minds about you. If you do bad things, they will judge you. They will think you are not a good person. But, it's not good to make a good impression at first and then change later. You should be true to yourself and others. That's why I agree with this idea. I think everyone thinks differently but can do just as much. You are in charge of your actions and how people see you. But you should think about what happens if you make a bad impression at first. I think it's very hard to change this. People make up their minds about you based on what they see the first time. They don't know you yet. You have the power to make a good impression on the world.

Imagine you meet someone and they like you right away. They want to see you again. But if you act differently the next time, they might feel something is off. That's why being yourself is important. It helps you make a strong connection that people will remember. Once, I liked a girl and we started dating. But I made a big mistake. We were about to break up because she was going to college. The last night we were together, I met another girl but didn't tell her. Later, I confessed over a text. She was upset and blocked me everywhere. Months later, I asked to meet her. We did, but things felt strange. She had changed. She said she'd been with many guys since our breakup. I left her there and haven't spoken to her since. First impressions are lasting. They shape how people see you. Your first impression should be honest and kind. Make them remember you and want to meet you again. You can't let them down. I've seen people miss out on jobs or relationships because of bad first impressions. You need to be energetic and true to yourself. My best friend liked a girl but froze when he tried to talk to her. She walked away. He's not good at talking to girls. I told him to be himself and make a good impression. He had nothing to lose. The next day, he talked to her and it worked.

Studies show that we can't forget the first impression we have of someone or something. It's like trying to forget a big event in our lives, such as our first job or first trip. There are two main reasons why first impressions stick with us and why they might not.\n\nFirst, we usually can't forget our first impression of someone. To remember something is to keep it in our minds. This is true for everyone and depends on how much the first impression affected us. Usually, first impressions are very hard to forget. But sometimes, if something is very important and has a big impact on our daily lives, we might not remember it.\n\nAlso, we might forget a first impression if we are very distracted or if a new, stronger impression comes along. For example, a student who does well in school got an F on a test. She didn't care about the test or the F because a family member had an accident and was in the hospital. She was only worried about her family member. This shows that a new, stronger impression can make us forget the first one.\n\nHowever, some people think first impressions are easy to forget. They say if we stop thinking about it, we will forget it. Some people agree, but others don't because they know it will stay in their minds if they think about it again. They believe the only way to forget a first impression is to stop thinking about it. They think this is very hard to do, so they stand by their opinion.\n\nIn conclusion, remembering something forever might not be good. First impressions are hard to forget, but we can try not to think about them. One way is to have a new, better impression that takes over the old one. People say the best way to forget a first impression is to stop thinking about it. They feel strongly about this. It is true that first impressions are hard to change, and this will remain true until we find a better way to forget them."}

For example, I had trouble in a math class because I didn't get the lessons, and my grade fell to an F. But I chose to stay after school for help with what we were learning. This made me work harder. It taught me to rely on myself and made me proud. Sometimes, it's good to look at the big picture to get where you want to go. I raised my grade to an A and was proud, knowing that I could do even the toughest things that others found easy.\n\nReaching higher goals is a big deal. Once, I had to show a history project in class, and I was very shy about it. I didn't do well because I spoke too softly, and people couldn't hear me. But I learned to be less shy and to speak up so everyone could hear me clearly.\n\nIn conclusion, some might say that setting low goals and hitting them is better because they are lazy and don't want to push themselves.

No one should feel bad about their religion, culture, style, or self-expression because others are too selfish to appreciate them. Sometimes you have to hold your head high and not be scared to be yourself. It might take time, but people will always say negative things. You just have to ignore them.

I had never seen you before, so all I knew was that you were supposed to help me at school. My family life was hard then, and the stress kept piling up. It was too much for me to handle by myself. I needed help from someone, so I went to the guidance office. That's where Generic_Name and I first met. I seemed like a kid with problems, and she seemed like hope on a bad day. She made me feel better in a way I hadn't felt before, so I wanted to thank her. I tried to see her eight times, but each time, the head of guidance said she was out for treatment and would be back soon. I hoped to see her when she returned. But I never knew that the first time I met her would be the last. The school later said that Generic_Name had died from cancer. All the students were asked to come to her funeral. I went with her family and many students. We all shared stories about how Generic_Name had helped us. She even took in a student with a tough family situation, which could have cost her job if found out. Generic_Name showed us all that you don't have to face things alone. Meeting someone new can leave a lasting mark on you. I strongly believe that first impressions can't be changed. They can lead to big things like helping students get out of a bad home or getting a scholarship to college. A first impression can touch everyone, whether you talk for years or just meet once.

We shouldn't judge by looks alone. I didn't like someone who is now my friend. I judged him by his looks and speech. He acted fake at first. But then he showed his real self.

Some students may find a job boring or not exciting anymore. Also, they might see a different job they like more and want to try it, even if they don't stay long. They might keep looking for new jobs, which makes it hard to decide what job is best. Some students get bored quickly, lose interest, and have less fun. They can't focus and there are many reasons they might want to quit a job and look for another. Some students know what they want, but others feel lost and stuck. That's why young students should not pick a job path. They still don't know what they want. Even if they think they do, they might not stick with it. They can change. Young students have their whole lives ahead. They are like babies, still learning to think, feel, and dream. They might expect things to happen one way, but life can be tough. It's not always easy to handle problems. They still think life is like a fairy tale. Some don't take a job seriously and think it's just fun because they are young and don't think things through.

{"text_id": "A18AABF41A28", "output_essay": "Why should students join after-school clubs or sports? Many students wonder about this. I'm here to tell you why it's a good idea. After-school activities are very helpful. They give you chances to work out, learn new stuff, and meet people. Students should do these activities because they are good for your health, your brain, and your social life. When you play sports, you move your body. You have to work out often and eat well if you play sports. This makes you stronger. Being on a sports team means you might lift weights. This can make you healthier. You will feel better and more relaxed if you play sports. This is why I think students should do after-school activities. You can learn new things. You might pick something you don't know much about. Trying a new thing can show you if you like it. If you find something you enjoy, you can get really good at it. You will know more things. Learning can help you understand the world better. This is why I say students should try new activities. I know some students don't want to join these activities. It can seem hard. But try to find something fun. You can meet people. You can make friends who like what you like. This is why I think students should get involved in after-school activities. It's good for students to do an activity outside of class. It helps them learn, get healthy, and make friends. I really think students should join after-school activities."}

I think it's fine to ask either many people or just one person for advice. Remember what everyone said before you start doing something or before you start writing.

{"text_id": "E4D1075A87C1", "output_essay": "I agree with Ralph Waldo Emerson's words: \"Being true to yourself in a world that always tries to change you is the biggest success.\" But in life, you face many choices that can lead to good or bad outcomes. You must be strong and wise, and stick to your goals and who you want to be. For instance, five years ago, my brother and I moved to America. Our family wanted us to study to make something of ourselves. Our dad gave us the chance to go to school. But on the first day, my brother made friends who were a bad influence. He started skipping school with them. The school called our dad every day about my brother not being there. Our dad asked him why he was missing school. My brother lied, saying he was just late from the bathroom. Our dad was doubtful but didn't confront him. Then, a teacher called our dad. She was puzzled why I was at school every day but my brother wasn't. She told our dad my brother had missed six days and asked if he was sick. Our dad repeated my brother's bathroom excuse. He was upset about the lie. The teacher also said I was working hard and had passed a big test. Later, at home, our dad was mad and asked my brother why he wasn't going to school. My brother didn't answer and stormed off to our room. The next day, he went to our aunt's house because he didn't like being questioned. I stayed in school, working toward a better job and life. I truly believe in being yourself, as Emerson said. It's key to being a good person and can lead to opportunities. If you lose your job, people or companies who know you will want to help. They might offer you work or suggest you to other good companies. That's why I stand by what Emerson said."}

I think it's a great idea for schools to let students learn this way. \n\nGoing to class in person can be hard. Teachers have limited time to teach and they may hurry you.

Online classes are easier. You can finish your work early in the morning. This way, you have more free time. \n\nBeing in class with others can be distracting. There's always something that can take your attention away. At home, you won't have this problem. Online classes let you work in peace. \n\nMore schools should offer distance learning.

Another student might do art and learn about computers as their activities. This can help them find out what they like and might lead to better jobs in the future. When you start high school, you should pay attention to school and your grades. You should also pick a good after-school activity. This helps you understand what work you might like and enjoy later on. But if a student doesn't pick any after-school activity, they won't know what to do when they're older. They might not get a good job because they didn't do any activities in high school. In the end, students should do after-school activities.

Their main goal is to make the community and city safe. I believe curfews help keep teenagers out of trouble and safe. Curfews are good for teenagers because they protect them from being robbed at night. We know that many robberies happen at night and often hurt teenagers. The new city curfews will protect teenagers from these robberies. Also, curfews can stop teenagers from getting into car crashes. Many crashes happen at night because drivers are tired or drunk. A government study found that over 70% of crashes at night are because the driver is drunk, tired, or can't see well. Curfews will save teenagers from crashes that happen mostly at night. Another point is that many places like bars and clubs are open at night. Teenagers may want to go there for fun, but it's dangerous. They might drink or smoke, get drunk, and not know what they're doing. They could drive home drunk and cause a crash, maybe even killing someone. In conclusion, the city curfew keeps our city and teenagers safe. It lowers the number of crashes and robberies that happen at night. We should back the city council's new plan to keep our children, brothers, sisters, and friends safe. Let's all support this curfew."}

There are a few reasons why it is a good thing and why it might not be so good. \n\nOne reason to pick a career early is that you get a lot of time to think about what you want to do later, what you hope to get from that job, and learn about the good and bad points, and the dangers of it. Another reason is that you can start practicing for the job you want early, maybe make some money while you practice, and get a lot of experience when you are still young. This can help you make fewer mistakes at work, understand your job well, and feel more sure of yourself. \n\nBut, it might not be a good idea because if you focus too much on the job you want, you might not spend enough time on other school subjects.

We learn about old wars and events, but why not learn more about what we want to do for work? Why study things we don't care about? I think students should pick what they want to learn. For instance, if someone wants to be a lawyer, why do they need to know about WWI or shapes in math? How will knowing about old times help them be a good lawyer? I agree that English is useful because it teaches us to write and spell. That will help in the future. Spanish is also good if they meet someone who can't speak English. So, yes, it's useful. My point is, schools shouldn't make us learn all these subjects or take certain classes to finish school. We should get to pick what we want to learn and the job we want.

My second reason is that sports can keep people away from drugs. Being healthy and having fun with sports is a good way to avoid drugs. Drugs can harm your body, teeth, and lungs.

Do you think people don't change their first impression of you? Some experts believe it's hard to change. What's your view? It's common, but do you agree? There are good and bad sides to this. For instance, you can guess who someone is just by looking at them. I do it too. I see someone and think, 'Yuck, they're not nice.' But it's fine to be honest. You haven't met them, so why judge by looks? Yet, they might be just as you guessed. It's your view, and you decide when to see them for who they are. Others might see them differently, and that's fine. I don't agree with judging by first looks. People talk about 'love at first sight,' but is it real? I believe people can change. Maybe you can help them change. It's wrong to make someone feel bad. People can get better or worse. We might judge someone who's just having a tough day. Meet someone and learn about them before you decide. That's what I think is best. We all have our own views. But don't judge a book by its cover. We learned this as kids. As adults, we might think badly of someone. It's like finding a dirty book and not wanting to read it. But then you read it, and it's your favorite. Or a last-minute trip becomes the best ever. To end, I think it's better to know someone than just watch them from a distance. People might misunderstand and think you don't like them. But can we change our first opinion of someone? We won't know until we try. I'm trying to open eyes and make a change. I might look unfriendly, but it's just how I look. People stare and make me feel bad. That's why I don't judge. I don't know what someone is going through. Sometimes, it's nice to just pat them on the back or smile and say hi."}
{"text_id": "87FA671E75FE", "output_essay": "Some schools let high school students finish in three years instead of the usual four years. Three years of high school is hard and doesn't give students enough time to learn a lot. So, schools should stick to the four-year high school plan. High school is where students learn a lot about their future and the world. The three-year plan makes them too busy and stressed to learn about these things. Students in this program may want to finish early and go to college, but they won't have time to prepare for college. College is different from high school. Without enough study time, they will feel lost and may spend more money on college. Also, if they have classes after school or in the summer, they won't have time to talk to others, make friends, or play sports. They will miss out on learning about the world, which is a key part of high school. Family and friends are very important. They are important to me, and I try to spend time with them. Once in college, I'll be busy with work and homework. Students in the three-year program won't have time for family and friends. For example, I went to Ethiopia with my friends last summer. We saw beautiful cities and had fun. I wouldn't have these memories if I were in the three-year program. When I'm older, I want to share my high school stories with my kids, like my dad did. But with the three-year program, I wouldn't have good stories to tell. Elective classes are fun and useful. I took autotech and learned to fix cars. Now, I can fix my car or know how much it should cost. Students in the three-year program won't learn these things. Electives are not just fun. They can help you find a career. But the three-year program makes it hard to find a career. It's three hard years just to feel lost in college. Some people think high school students should be busy and stressed with a three-year program. But that's not right. Too much stress can make students upset or worse. A four-year high school is better and healthier for students. Three years of high school is hard and doesn't give students enough time to learn. College is different from high school. Without enough study time, they will feel lost. A four-year high school is better and healthier for students."}

They learn to bring what they need for their activities. Being responsible is important. Without it, people can lose their homes and money. They might end up living on the streets and asking others for help. It's good to be responsible to avoid problems. Second, students can learn new skills like cooking or drawing. Some might use these skills to make money when they grow up. They could become famous artists or chefs because they started learning in school. Third, students will grow up faster. Some are in school because they want a job soon. They take their learning seriously and don't just play. Some people think kids only want fun, but kids will be serious sometimes, especially if they want a job later. Fourth, students can make more friends by joining activities. For example, if PROPER_NAME has no friends, he can join a club. He talks about what he likes and soon makes friends. It's easy to make friends in a club. Just share what you like and you might find others who like the same things. Fifth, students should do what they love. If they don't like the activities, they won't join. Letting kids do what they enjoy is good for them. If you stop them, it could hurt their future. Some kids who can't do what they love might not get jobs and could end up in bad situations. Finally, kids should do activities they love. This helps them in the future, keeps them happy, keeps them out of trouble, and protects their future families."}

You can fail or succeed in different parts of life, such as work, school, and relationships. There are many ways to win or lose in life.\n\nFirst, at work, you might not do well, but you can get better by working hard and helping others. You can help strangers or your boss to show you can do well.\n\nFor example, at my job, I was not doing well. Everyone said I was lazy. But I worked hard and my boss finally said, 'You have done well, Generic_Name. You are working well.'\n\nSecond, at school, you can do poorly or do well. Many students fail subjects like English, History, Math, or Science. Some classes are tough, like the SOL tests. They test what you learned all year. But if you study, you can pass the SOL.\n\nFor example, last year in school, I didn't study for the SOL and failed two. But then I studied hard and passed them. I was proud because failing showed me I could do better next time.\n\nThird, in relationships, you might break up and feel bad at first. But if you break up again, you might feel free. You won't waste time on the relationship. Instead, you can play games, hang out with friends, and go to parties. A friend had a bad girlfriend who yelled at him. He tried to break up but couldn't. The second time, she agreed, and he was happy. He said, 'Freedom at last.' Now he can play games, hang out, and party. He feels free.\n\nIn conclusion, I agree with Churchill that failing is important for success. Failing can lead to winning in jobs, schools, and relationships. There are many ways to win or lose. Which will you pick?"}

Not everyone can do this. It depends on how big their thumb is. I don't use this talent much. It's just something I do sometimes. Also, I found this talent by chance and not many people have it. The first time I found out I could bend my thumb back, I was at home reading a book. When I finished a chapter, I got bored. I looked at my fingers and saw my thumb was smaller than most. I moved it around and when I pushed it to the back of my hand, I saw it was something my friends and others couldn't do. That's how I found my thumb talent. It's useful in a few ways. When people are nervous, they often play with their hands. When I'm nervous, I bend my thumb back to keep my mind off it. It also helps me think when I'm stuck on a test question. Others with this talent might use it differently. It's not a common skill. Most people have other skills, like doing flips. It's rare because not many people can bend their thumb like this. For me, it was easy because my thumb is small. Smaller thumbs bend easier than big ones. Not many people have small thumbs. To sum up, this skill is rare and useful for some things. You get it by moving your thumb. Most people have other talents. This skill is easy for people who can move their fingers in certain ways. Not many have this skill, so it's rare.

{"text_id": "27A2E22A4634", "output_essay": "Some people think it's best to teach kids at home, but most people say it's better to send them to school for their growth. I believe sending kids to school is the right choice. Going to school is good because it keeps students motivated. Learning from home isn't as good because it's easier to cheat, there's less chance to make friends, and kids need to be very motivated on their own.\n\nOne of the main benefits of school is that it helps kids get better at making friends. Kids learn to socialize by talking and working with their teachers and other students. They meet others from different backgrounds and learn about new ways of life, beliefs, and even simple things like clothes and talking.\n\nAlso, schools often test students and give them homework. This helps them grow and prepares them for a tough world. Schools want to be the best, and this pushes students to do well. They get to show how much they've learned and how hard they work.\n\nHowever, homeschooling has some good points too. Kids might understand things better because they get all the attention. They might also feel more at ease learning with their family around. But they might not meet new people or make friends. Plus, not all parents have the time to teach their kids. That's why it's better for kids to go to school where they can be watched over and taught well.\n\nIn the end, both ways have good points, but going to school helps a student succeed more in life. Homeschooling might lead to a lower level of learning, and the student might not be ready for the real world. School also helps students become stronger and share more with others, and it improves how they get along with people."}

Everyone makes mistakes; no one is perfect. Think about when you first learned to walk. It was tough. You fell down, but you got up and tried again. Tying your shoes might have been hard. Maybe someone helped you, but you kept trying until you could do it well. Driving a car isn't easy. You must learn to control it and use the gas and brake carefully. Trying new things is hard, but don't quit. You must learn and improve. Believe in yourself and keep going, especially if you enjoy it. Maybe you saw your parents cook and wanted to try. Your first try wasn't great, but you did well the next time. You succeeded because you didn't stop trying. All your friends have dogs. You play with them and decided to get one. Your dog was messy at first, but you trained it, and it learned to listen. Starting at a new school is scary. But think about the new people, classes, and chances you'll find. If you fail at first, it doesn't mean you always will. Keep trying. You'll face challenges, but overcoming them shows you're not a quitter. If you fail a test and fix your mistakes, you'll improve. When there's a problem, ask for help. If it's with a friend, talk to them or someone you trust. If it's about school, talk to a teacher. It's okay to ask for help. It's better to solve a problem than let it grow. I believe that \"A problem is a chance for you to do your best\" tells us there's always good and bad.

Schools should not push students to pick a career too soon. This is because students might change their minds in high school. If they do, they won't have other options because they were too focused on one career. Also, choosing a career too soon can be too much for them. They should not have to make such big decisions so early. These decisions will affect their future. Studies show that if young students pick a career too soon, they might end up in a job they don't like. Some people think choosing early is good because it prepares them for the future. It does help them get ready for the job they want. But this is not always right. Young students should try different careers before they pick one for their future. They should explore many jobs and take classes in different fields. Then, in their last years of high school, they can pick classes they are good at. Choosing a career early can stress students out and hurt their minds. It's a big decision. Some students can't handle the pressure of picking a career so young. They should take more time to decide, not just one year. Even if early choices can help, students might still change their minds. If it's too late, they are stuck learning about a job they no longer want. Studies show that young students don't know what they want in life. When asked, they often guess. Young students should not have to make big life choices. They are not ready. Think about when you were young. Did you really know? Often, we grow up and realize our early choices were not right. No one knows what they want until they find something they love. They should not have to pick it on a piece of paper. In conclusion, high school students should not have to make choices so early.

Everyone is unique, even if they are from the same country, group, or family. But one thing we all share is our love for food. We may like different foods, but we all enjoy eating. This leads to my point: even though we love food, there are some foods we shouldn't eat too much. That's why I think we should change what schools serve for lunch. I believe this because it's healthier, it helps us choose better, and it keeps us in shape and looking good.\n\nFirst, eating healthy is great for our health. When we eat well, our bodies work well. This means we won't get sick as much because our bodies can fight germs and bacteria. Doctors say this is very important, especially for young people.\n\nNext, eating well helps us make smarter choices. Good food is good for our bodies and our minds. When we are healthy, our brains work better. We think more clearly. If school lunches are healthier, I think students will do better in school. They will get better grades, join in more in class, and ask questions. They will do more and feel proud of what they achieve. Eating healthy can become a good habit and help students in the future too.\n\nLastly, eating healthy helps us look and feel fit. Foods like vegetables, eggs, and milk have proteins that we need, especially when we exercise. School lunches often have too much meat and fat. We need some fat, but too much is bad. I watched a film about people who were very overweight and sad. They had a hard time doing simple things. It took them more than six months to lose weight. They worked out for many hours every day and had a tough time. One man in the film lost his family because he was too overweight to do anything. But after a lot of exercise, he lost weight and got his family back. They all said they became overweight because of bad eating habits. They didn't know it was a problem until it was too late.\n\nSo, even if it's just school lunch, eating too much can lead to being overweight. We have school five days a week, so it's important.\n\nIn conclusion, I think changing the school lunch menu is a good idea. My three reasons are that it's healthier, it helps us make better choices, and it keeps us in shape. Healthy food is good for our body and mind. It also helps us think clearly, make good life decisions, and be happy. Eating healthy is part of a healthy life, and we should all try to eat well."}

But we actually create our own personalities because we are independent, responsible, and grown-up. We are independent, which is the first reason we create our own personalities.

This shows they are responsible. They are not just responsible at work or school but at home too. This means they are creating their own personality. Lastly, creating your own personality means you are grown-up. For example, if your friends are doing something wrong and you don't want to join, you need to be grown-up enough to leave.

They don't understand the lessons. One solution is to hire live online teachers. These teachers can answer questions right away.\n\nTo help teachers with too many questions, schools could make a virtual helper. This helper could answer easy questions for students.\n\nWith these ideas, students would learn better and get more help from teachers.\n\nSchools with online classes should also have group discussions after lessons. This helps students remember what they learned.\n\nSchools should give students extra practice, like a short quiz, after a lesson. If they don't do well, the quiz can show them what to study more.\n\nWhen a student goes back to school, the teacher should ask if he has questions about the online lessons.\n\nSo, what if online school isn't good for students? What are the bad parts? What should schools do to stop the bad parts?\n\nWell, online school is usually good and it prepares us for the future.

{"text_id": "C27C72D6E208", "output_essay": "\"Be yourself, there are no tricks,\" Kobe Bryant once said. You can shape who you are, whether it's good or bad; it's up to you. This has its own rewards: you will discover what you love, be with the right people, and have no regrets in the end.\n\nYou will discover what you love. It's tough to find what you love, so start looking early. \"If you find something you love to do, you won't feel like you're working,\" Kobe Bryant said. To discover your love, you must be true to yourself. Many people don't find what they love. \"If you hate waking up to go to work, do something else. I was lucky to find what I love,\" he said. And if you pick a path just because your friends do, good luck. They may enjoy their work, but you might end up tired and unhappy. Everyone has their own space; yours may not look like mine, but you should enjoy what you do in your own space.\n\nFind role models and be one. Once you know what you love, it's easy to find role models or inspiration. My role models have changed, but my love for basketball stays strong. I liked basketball, but started to lose interest until I learned about Kobe Bryant. He made me love basketball again. Now, I love everything about it: the smell of the ball, the bounce sounds, and the feel of the ball. I learned a lot from Kobe's playing and his life outside the game. Now, I encourage kids to practice their skills.\n\nHaving regrets is terrible. If you chase someone else's dream or path without knowing it's wrong, you'll regret it when you stop working. You'll wish you had followed your own dreams and built your own identity. \"I have no regrets. I gave my all every day, so now that I'm retired, I have no regrets,\" Kobe Bryant said. Find what you love, be the best at it, and you'll have no regrets when the day ends.\n\nSome say you need role models to work hard; I think so too. But it's useless to seek role models if you don't know what you're looking for. Be yourself; you'll find what you love, get the role models you need, and end with no regrets. Go and create your own identity."}

It means you shouldn't decide what someone or something is like just by how they look. Getting advice and learning from others is important in life. It's good to learn from people who are willing to share and who you can trust. \n\nWhen you learn from someone, it stops you from making the same mistakes. It might even stop you from making a mistake in the first place. Older people often give better advice because they've faced harder problems. You should listen to someone who knows what they're talking about and who you believe in. For instance, my dad knows a lot about soccer because he's played since he was young. He gives me soccer tips. I listen to him because I trust him. Trusting someone helps you do well in life. It also helps you learn, and that's why learning matters. \n\nTalking to people is very useful because they mean what they say. You could look things up online, but is it as good as talking to a real person? The internet doesn't have personal experiences you can connect with. That's why people give better advice than the internet. For example, I was nervous about a test. I looked up how to calm down. The internet said to sleep well and eat right. That's good advice. But I had already studied, so my dad told me to stop thinking about the test. That helped more. In the end, you choose whether to listen to people or not. \n\nBeing able to listen and share is great. But you need to know how to use these skills. So, I want to ask you, what skill would you like to have?"}

It's important to always act positive because it can help you succeed. You can act happy even when you're sad, but you might be hiding how you really feel. If you're always happy, some friends might ask if you're okay. They may think you're hiding real problems that you don't want to talk about.\n\nIf you always seem happy, it might be because you're worried or scared to share your problems with someone. Always being cheerful can make you lose friends who worry about you. But, if you keep a good attitude, you might help others deal with their problems. You can teach them how to stay positive like you. When you meet someone who is not happy, try to help them be more positive.\n\nI have noticed that some people don't show their true feelings. They do this so others won't worry about them.\n\nI have watched people, including friends, hide their emotions. They don't want to deal with their problems. Instead, they choose to stay positive all day.\n\nConclusion: This essay talked about how acting positive can hide worry or fear. It also talked about how it can change friendships with others who might be having a tough day and could use some cheering up."}

Students and their families should pick which after-school activities they want to join. If they choose, they can spend more time outside, learn new stuff, and make new friends. \n\nI think students should pick their after-school activities because they can be outside more and learn new things. It's good for students to be outside instead of always being indoors. When I was a freshman, I looked for activities to join because I was always inside. I joined a program that helped me get into good colleges. I worked hard and got some college offers. I was happy about these offers because they meant I had a good future. I took the UCLA college form and showed it to my parents. They were very proud because I would be the first in our family to go to college. \n\nAnother reason students should choose their own after-school activities is to make new friends. We all need friends to grow. At the Boys and Girls Club, I met a girl named Generic_Name. She was friendly and liked to talk to many students, but she talked to me the most. I also made friends with other kids there. A boy named Generic_Name asked me to play soccer with them. After the game, we spent some time together and then went home.

Experience isn't always needed if people work hard and try their best at work.\n\nThe first thing to think about is that most workers don't have the needed experience at the start. But they can learn and improve. You get experience by practicing, working hard, and being known for good work. Also, some people learn fast. For example, when I was 15, I didn't know how to work in a restaurant. I had never worked before. But when I got the chance to work, I learned to cook chicken in one day.\n\nAnother point is that a good attitude and hard work make a good worker. People with a good attitude often feel and do positive things. They try to get better jobs. The best thing is a good attitude. It opens up new chances in life.

In my classes, some students don't want to learn. They talk loud and bother everyone. For example, in science, I can't focus because some students are noisy and cause trouble. My teacher tries to stop them and ends up not teaching. We waste time and don't learn. But with video calls, I wouldn't get distracted and would learn more. If students had classes on video calls, they wouldn't have to worry about bad weather. My little brother walks to school at 7 am. When it's very cold, he can't breathe well.

It's better to set goals we can reach and keep moving forward. After we meet a small goal, we can make a new one and keep going. Trying for big goals and not making it can make us sad and hopeless.\n\nFirst, it's better to set small goals because we can make new ones after finishing one. This helps us do more things quickly and feel good about ourselves. For example, imagine finishing one big goal in two years. In the same time, we could finish five or six small goals, or even more, that take months or weeks. Aiming low isn't always bad; some things can only be done by thinking small. Small goals can make us feel good and encourage us to do better.\n\nAlso, not reaching a goal we've worked on for years can have big effects. We might feel so let down that we don't want to try anymore. Imagine someone trying to get into a top college. He works hard, saves money, and studies a lot, but doesn't get in. He might give up and end up with nothing. This is what can happen with big goals: aim high and you either win or lose, with no in-between. Some say failure is okay because we can learn from it.

You have six minutes to get to your next class, and you usually have four classes each day. In middle school and high school, bells tell us if we're late or when class is over.

Sometimes lockers get stuck, or they're too far from your class. Or you might talk with friends and be late. Being late is bad because it affects your attendance record. If you're late a lot, you might have to stay in during lunch or after school. Teachers are okay if you're late in the first two weeks because you might get lost.

You have more tasks, more to think about, and more duties. In elementary school, you may have two or three classes. In middle school, you have seven classes. This means you have to be more responsible. You need to bring the right supplies for each class, arrive on time, and do all your homework to get good grades. Responsibility is a big deal. Everyone has duties, and they matter a lot. In elementary school, you can take breaks. You can go outside, play with friends, and enjoy sports. But in middle school, you don't get these breaks. You only have fun during your 30-minute lunch. Then you go back to class to work. You can't talk much to your friends. We skip breaks so we can learn more. In elementary school, your report card has numbers: 1 and 2 are bad, 3 is okay, and 4 is good.

Teenagers need to pay attention to the time so they can get home when they should. Being outside for too long, especially at night, can lead to bad situations.\n\nA curfew also keeps teenagers away from dangerous people who might steal, shoot, break into homes, or kidnap. Often, these crimes happen late at night. A curfew can protect young people from these dangers. It's not worth risking your future by staying out late with older people who might be up to no good.\n\nTeenagers who drive should remember that police can stop them for speeding, having an old license plate, or being out past curfew.

It can help them avoid getting arrested. High school brings a lot of responsibilities, and getting into trouble with the law can hurt your future. For example, if you have a criminal record, it might be hard to get a job later on. Keeping a clean record can help you get the job you want.

Being out late can lead to bad influences, like drinking, smoking, or small crimes like stealing or vandalism. But a curfew helps by setting a time to be indoors, which can help teenagers act more responsibly."}
{"text_id": "5E276DFCDABC", "output_essay": "As time goes by, many things change. However, this does not mean that education should change. Education is very important for everyone around the world. Some places let high school students finish school in three years instead of four. Should this be allowed? I don't think it's a good idea. Even if it's just one year less, students need that time. It helps them learn more and get more experience. They can use the extra year to get ready for college or to start working. I believe education is too important to change, especially when it has worked well for so long. \n\nNot learning enough can be a big problem for students. If they lose a year, it can hurt those who learn slowly. Everyone is different, and not everyone learns fast. Those who need more time should get it. Going to school for fewer years won't help students find out what they want to study in college. It also won't teach them about life and how to get ready for it. I think not learning enough can lead to bad things in the real world. \n\nThere are bad effects if students graduate in three years. They won't have to do as much as those who take four years. Learning a lot is important to make life better. It's bad if someone doesn't take enough time to get ready after high school. They won't learn how hard it is to achieve big goals. They will be unprepared. I think this is bad because they are not working hard to achieve something. They are choosing the easy way to finish high school. \n\nHaving less time to graduate can change a student's life a lot. Students who finish in three years will be less ready than those who take four years. This will affect them when they go to college. They will feel unprepared, and that's bad. If they work instead of going to college, they won't know what they need for a real job. It will be hard for them to adjust. They will be upset because they haven't learned enough. This will affect their life. I think you need to study more to avoid these problems. \n\nNot everyone agrees with finishing high school in three years. Some may think it's good, but I don't. Education is very important and will stay that way. Education is not just for people; it helps society and the economy grow. Some people don't understand that education is for their future too. I think it's better to finish high school in four years. \n\nSome places are letting students finish high school in three years. We need to think about what this means for learning. These programs could have bad effects. They could change a person's future. In the end, it's not a good idea. Education is important and shouldn't change. It has helped people grow over time. We shouldn't try to change it just because some think it's best. Imagine life without education. It would be bad, right? Education is the most important thing for us. So why let these programs happen? I think high school should last four years, not three."}

I will talk about planning your work, having one main idea, and checking your work. Writing well is important for everyone. That's why I want to show you how to write something well.\n\nFirst, it's very important to plan your work. I will explain why planning helps you. You should always plan. This is because if you don't plan, you might not have many ideas for your writing. But if you plan, you will have lots of ideas.\n\nThat's why you should plan before you start writing.\n\nNext, you need one main idea. When you write, you need this main idea. It helps you find things to write that will make the reader interested. To write well, you need to make the reader want to know more. They will keep reading your story. That's why the main idea is key when you write. Every piece you write should have one main idea.\n\nLast, you need to check your work. When you check, look for words that are wrong. This is the time to make letters big at the start of sentences. You also need to write with good grammar. You have to make sentences the right way and use punctuation. That's why you check your work after writing it.\n\nI am teaching writing because it's important to know how to plan your work, have a main idea, and check your work. Writing well matters in life.

Your parents might say you can't go outside, but hiding the truth is worse. Don't let anyone bully you; that's not good. You might not want to be friends with someone and that could hurt their feelings. But you should still tell them the truth. Just explain why without being mean. Never make fun of someone just because you can. We know what's right. You decide how to act, not anyone else, except your parents. Always tell your teacher the truth. They can help you a lot. Lying can get you into more trouble. But being honest can mean less trouble. That's how honesty works; it's useful. If you're stressed and say something mean by accident, be honest.

{"text_id": "2986E2782AA3", "output_essay": "Schools need to manage how much students do after-school activities. This is because they know if students are doing well or having trouble with their schoolwork. Many students want to join different activities to get praise, even if they are not doing well in school. Doing many activities can be fun and help make friends. But it can also mean less time for studying, not doing homework, and losing interest in school subjects. Schools should let students do only one activity so they can have enough time to study.\n\nOne reason schools need to manage this is that some students don't have time to study because they do too many activities. They may start to like studying less because they enjoy these activities more. For example, I have a friend in high school who is not doing well in school because he does sports, music, and drama. These take up a lot of his time. I once had to choose between going to practice or a study group. I chose the study group because I know what's more important.\n\nAnother reason is that some students don't do their homework because they are too busy with activities. They come home tired from practice. My cousin plays basketball and often falls asleep without eating because he's so tired. Then he asks for help with his homework in the morning, which he should have done earlier.\n\nThe last reason is that some students stop caring about their school subjects because they do too many activities. They have fun and forget about school. Schools should help them care about school more. I know having many activities is hard but fun, and you meet new people. But you might stop caring about school because you think about the activities too much.\n\nFor these reasons, schools really need to manage how much students do after-school activities. This is especially true for those who want to do a lot. Schools should not let students do whatever they want. They should help students plan their time. Students should also listen to the school because it helps them. It also depends on the students to know what is most important to them."}

For example, the Great Depression was a big event in America. Students should learn about what happened before they were born. They should know about the things that made America what it is now.\n\nThe Great Depression was a tough time in the United States. It started when lots of banks failed, and people lost their money. People panicked, many lost their homes, the stock market fell, and lots of people had no jobs. When some banks closed, more did the same all over the U.S. It was a hard time for people trying to survive without enough money for rent, food, or insurance.\n\nBefore we were born, many Americans didn't know about big events that changed history. These include coal mining and making steel. Three industries wanted to make money. They had workers do dangerous jobs to grow their businesses. People bought these materials to make their factories bigger. These materials were expensive and helped the industries grow.\n\nHistory is important to talk about. It looks at changes in the past, like wars America was in, the stock market going up and down, and banks closing. For example, in World War II, America faced tough times. Countries like Germany and Japan fought against America, which led to D-Day. The worst part of WWII was when America used nuclear bombs on Japan. America also went after the enemy leader, but he killed himself when he found out American forces were coming.\n\nStudents should learn history to understand past events. They might wonder about what happened, and history can give answers. This knowledge might make them want to talk about America's past with others, like family or friends. If they don't know history well, students might get confused or have wrong ideas about America's past. This could change what they believe when they find out the real facts.\n\nIn conclusion, I would teach students history. This way, they can learn about big events in America before they were born. They will understand American history better."}

Parents would be glad to have a curfew to keep their kids inside at risky times. They would be happy because it helps avoid trouble, drugs, and bad influences. Teens might not like it because they think it messes with their life and privacy. But it's not up to them. We often hear news about teens dying over drugs and money. Curfews could help keep them safe. It's fair to parents but maybe not to teens. The idea of breaking the law might scare some teens. They might fear going to jail for something serious.\n\nOn school nights, teens usually don't stay out late because of school or work the next day.

These small details can change your view completely. Your first impression changes when you get to know the person better. You might have liked them at first, but the real person shows up over time. First impressions don't show you everything. How you see people can change a lot. It depends on what you want and like in people, like their thoughts, actions, or how they speak. Your impression changes when you notice something new in them, like what they do, how they speak, or what they think. It's about what you want to hear, see, and learn. People are not always what we think they are. I've had friends who argued with me over one thing I said. So, first impressions always change. A first impression can be good or bad. You might meet someone at a bad time, and they seem bad. But later, you might realize they're not like that. It was just a bad time. Maybe it wasn't the best time to meet them? If you don't talk to them much, a bad first impression can stick. You can also think too well of the wrong people. You see them as good friends, but they're not. Time spent with them can change that. I've had many friends and good impressions of people that were wrong. Like meeting someone at a party who seems cool, but later they get drunk and cause trouble. Personality is very important. It shows who you're talking to and spending time with. It can change your first impression. Personality shows how a person acts with others, including me. Are they thankful? I learn about them from how they react to others and what they do for me. Personality shows the truth about people. When I met my best friend, he seemed like a rich kid who only cared about money. But when we played soccer together and took the bus, I saw he was a good person. He thought of others first. He became my best friend for seven years. I'm grateful for everything he did for me. In the end, first impressions change. That will always be true for me. You can't know someone from just one talk. When you want to find the best in people, take your time.

This way, they can do their schoolwork or homework first, and then do the activity they like. They can be more organized and work on their own without the school's help. For instance, if you have no homework when you have your activity, you can go to it. If there is homework and you have an activity after school, you can plan to do the homework the night before. Or you can finish it during school if there is time. You can also do it in the morning. This helps you not to mix up schoolwork with your activities. You can find ways that work best for you.\n\nAnother reason is that if schools make the schedule for activities, it might not fit you. Sometimes a set schedule is good, but not always.

Students know what schoolwork they need to do. They can set goals and find time for activities after school. Parents also know their kids' schedules and what they need to do. So, families can work out plans together without stress. These are the reasons why I agree with this idea."}
{"text_id": "6DE1E67740FD", "output_essay": "When kids start elementary school, they often dream about who they want to be when they grow up. As they move on to high school, they choose classes that will help them in their future job. After high school, some go to college or university, while others start working. If you start working, your boss will want to know if you have worked or volunteered before. They will also look at your high school classes. This helps you start your job. But I think starting a job when you're young is not a good idea.\n\nOne problem with working young is it's hard to get a job. If you apply and get an interview, that's important. But if you have no work or volunteer experience, you might not get the job. I think it's better for students to volunteer. This way, they get experience and meet graduation needs.\n\nAnother issue is being on time and responsible. If your job is far from home and you have no way to get there, you could lose your job. If you nap before work and sleep too long, you'll be late and could get fired. For example, I struggle to turn in my schoolwork on time. If I can't do that, how can I be on time for a job? Students should practice being responsible. They can do chores, go to sports practice on time, and do homework.\n\nThe last problem is taking the right classes. In high school, you might need extra classes or online classes to get into a good college. This is important because college teaches you for four more years before you start your job. For example, my cousin studied for six years and now has a good job as a bank accountant.\n\nIn conclusion, I think students should go to college after high school. Get your degree, then start your job. And don't forget to have fun. You don't want too many responsibilities at 18, right? Thanks for reading my reasons why it's not good to start working too young."}

The famous artist Michelangelo once said, \"The real danger for most of us is not aiming too high and missing, but aiming too low and hitting the target.\" I agree with Michelangelo. Today, we often think we're not good enough. We set easy goals because we don't trust ourselves to do better. We meet our goal and think this is the end: this is all I can do. But how do you know that? We should trust ourselves more. We should believe we can do the impossible. Even if we fail, we shouldn't be ashamed. We should see failure as a lesson, learn from it, move on, try again, and believe we can do it. \n\nFor me, I set easy goals in the past because I didn't trust myself to do more. In middle school, I never tried harder classes because I didn't believe in myself. I thought, \"I'm not smart enough for that class.\" But how could I know without trying? Last year, as a sophomore, I chose to aim higher and take a harder class, Honors English. I asked my teacher if it was a silly idea to take this class. She told me to go for it, so I did. On my first day in Honors English, I was scared and thought I would quit the class. But as time went on, I became more confident. The class was not as hard as I thought. Now I am a junior and I plan to take two AP classes next year with a lot of confidence. I really agree with Michelangelo: don't set easy goals or low standards. Believe in yourself that you can do more. This is not the end. Believe you can go much farther."}
{"text_id": "DD1D7CBCEE67", "output_essay": "As a teen, I think it's a good idea for some schools to let students learn from home using the internet or video calls. This is because some students don't have time to go to school. For example, I learned more at home because I can work after my classes and make more money to pay my bills. I have more time to do things at home or play soccer with my friends. I also have more time to study and watch videos. Taking all my classes online is better for me. It gives me more time with my family and friends, and I can play video games with my cousin. Since I need to work to pay for my room, online classes are more helpful for me. Starting with this idea, I think it's better because I have more time to study and pass my classes. I can study more at home. I can work more and make money before studying. It also helps me graduate. I think if you want to take an online class, it's better for you because you have more time to do what you want. For example, if I want to go to the mall after my class, I can, or if I want to work many hours, I can do that too. In conclusion, I think it's better if some schools offer the choice to learn at home or at school because it helps you more."}
{"text_id": "257A7BC3927D", "output_essay": "Last year, my best friend's parents took him out of school and taught him at home. He had to stay home and take online classes to finish his tenth-grade classes. But when my best friend returned to school for eleventh grade, it seemed like he hadn't learned much. For instance, after coming back, he spent a lot of time on homework, was very lazy, and didn't talk much. It was as if he hadn't learned anything and the online classes had set him back. This is why I believe that students should not take classes at home. They need to learn quickly, they can't ask as many questions as they can in a classroom, and staying at home without moving around makes them lazy.\n\nLearning quickly can slow down the learning process. It makes students want to finish their work quickly, not to learn. It also makes them think too fast, which can slow down learning because they're not sure if they understand. Learning quickly can make students rush through things, which might affect their future. It can also hurt how they talk to other people.\n\nAnother reason students should not take online classes is that they can't ask teachers for help as easily. Online programs have good teachers, but they can't help like classroom teachers. Classroom teachers can stay extra time to help students, but online teachers just teach the lesson and go. Classroom teachers can also help with other subjects. This helps students understand and learn better than if they were alone at home.\n\nThe biggest reason is that it makes students lazy. Taking online classes means they sit and learn without moving, which makes them lazy. It also affects their effort and how they handle difficult tasks. So, it makes them less responsible. This can really affect how they live and their future.\n\nSome might say that online classes can give students a better degree and more family time. However, they won't understand the subjects as well as they would in a classroom. It also changes their personalities by making them lazy and not active. So, students should not take classes at home but should go to school and learn in a classroom."}

It shows you that problems are not a waste of time. A problem changes some people because they don't want to be the same as before. They will learn from their mistakes or from others.\n\nFirst, a problem can change your life; you can do many things without anyone stopping you. It makes you see that problems don't help you move forward, and it also helps you do good things. If you want to be something and you have many problems and act the same, then you won't do good things. Always think about what's best for you.\n\nNext, people learn from mistakes and understand that constant problems don't help them reach their goals. Some even change their attitude or who they are because they want the best for themselves.\n\nPeople see their mistakes and what they did wrong, so they change and don't repeat them. They will decide not to do it again if they want the best for themselves and their family. Problems teach you not to cause trouble for no reason. You should learn from mistakes, even if it's not your fault. Know what you did so you can improve.\n\nAlso, people want to be themselves, mind their own business, and achieve their personal goals without problems. Maybe you will face problems, but not like before. This helps you understand what's good for you. People always want the best for themselves and to be themselves.\n\nFinally, problems will always be part of life, but if you want to change and do good things, then stay true to yourself. Don't let things upset you because if they do, you won't do your best. Problems will show you what you did wrong. You can change that one problem and just do the best for you and others.\n\n\"A problem is a chance for you to do your best,\" means a problem shows you what's wrong and now you know what to do for the best. Change and do good things. It also reminds you not to repeat mistakes and just do your best. Problems give you a chance to fix things and do as well as you can."}

{"text_id": "3B62370779A1", "output_essay": "Is learning online through video calls better than going to a regular school? I don't think so, and here are three reasons why. First, a student can only learn from and speak with the teacher. Second, a student can leave anytime because no one is there to stop them. Third, a student can cheat on tests, quizzes, and exams without the school knowing if it's true or not. That's why I believe online learning and video calls are not good options.\n\nA student in online classes only hears the teacher and misses other students' ideas. They might be too scared to ask questions or talk to the teacher. They can't get help from anyone but the teacher. If the teacher is mean or teaches too fast or slow, the student might not understand. The teacher could upset the student without realizing it. The student might just leave the computer. This is a benefit you lose with online learning.\n\nA student can stop learning whenever they want. They don't have to stay for a set number of hours like they do in regular school.\n\nA student can do anything because no one is watching them. For example, they could be on their phone or have other websites open, and the teacher wouldn't know. They can take their computer anywhere, like to a fast-food place or library, and the teacher can't control them. The most a teacher can do online is report the problem to the school. This problem doesn't happen in regular schools.\n\nA student can cheat easily online. They might cheat on homework, quizzes, or tests. For instance, a student might get help from a friend or family member during a test to pass and help their family. Cheating can happen in many ways. It might seem helpful, but it's always wrong. This is another thing that can happen in online learning but not in regular schools.\n\nThese are my reasons against online school. It has some good points, but I think it shouldn't be used unless there's no other choice. You can cheat, go anywhere, and only talk to the teacher. That's why I believe we shouldn't replace regular school with online classes or video calls."}

Once more, your family is busy doing things, and you are at home with nothing to do. This has happened to many people who don't do any after-school activities. I think all students should do at least one after-school activity. It helps them meet new friends, find a hobby they love, and gives them something to do. \n\nIf you want to make new friends, after-school activities are a good choice. It's easier to become friends with people who like the same things as you. You will find it easy to talk to someone in the same club because you both like the club's topic. Doing the same thing and being in the same place makes you want to talk to others. At swim practice, I talk to the people swimming with me because we are together for a long time. This is how I made new friends outside of school. I also hang out with them outside of swimming. Making new friends is just one good thing about after-school activities, but there are more. \n\nIt's hard to find out what you love if you don't try new things. You might find out you love robots when you join a robotics club. If you find something you love doing, your life will be more fun and full. It can also help you know what job you want in the future. People like to work in jobs that match their interests. So, knowing what you love early on makes it easy to choose a job. My dad signed me up for theatre, and I was nervous at first. I am shy and didn't think I'd like being on stage. But I loved it and went to theatre camp for three more years. I also started piano lessons thinking it would be boring. But I was good at it and liked making music for my family and friends to enjoy. After-school activities help you find what you love and give you things to do. \n\nDoing an after-school activity is a good way to spend your time. Many students waste time online or watching TV because they're bored. It's bad to find out your child watched TV for hours. An activity gives them something to think about or do. When I'm not busy, I play the piano. It's a good way to spend extra time, and I like it. When I'm not at swim practice, I feel like I have too much time. But I have other activities like math team or piano lessons. These stop me from feeling very bored. These are a few reasons why students should do after-school activities. They have many benefits. \n\nIn the end, students should do after-school activities. They are a good use of time, help you find what you love, and let you make new friends. Every student should pick one activity because of the many good things it brings. Suddenly, you remember today was the first day of track practice. You quickly call a friend to pick you up and take you back to school. When they get there, you jump into their car and wait to get back to school. Once there, you rush to the track. You're lucky because the coach just started with stretches. You put down your bag and stretch with the team. During practice, you laugh with a new friend you met because you joined the track team."}

John Lubbock said, \"You make your character what you decide.\" Character traits are key because they define a person. No one else can pick them for us, but they can be shaped.

They mess up, and that's okay. If we could pick our traits, there would be no mistakes or problems. Problems teach us lessons. We feel mad, sad, and angry, and that's part of life. If we picked our traits, we'd all be the same, with the best genes, and life would be boring. DNA is another reason we don't pick our traits. It decides things like hair and eye color. We inherit our genes, and this continues over time. Scientists have found that we inherit character traits, not pick them. Research also shows this. For years, scientists have seen that you can't pick to have green eyes if both your parents have brown. Even if you could, it would cost a lot. Most people wouldn't be able to pay for it. A baby in the womb can't pick their traits. DNA decides this. Now, technology might let us pick how a child looks, but it's very costly. Still, you can't pick your traits.

You can fail at many things, like not doing your homework, not doing well at a job, or failing a test. First, homework is key to success. You might choose to skip your homework and learn from that mistake. Homework can be hard because there is a lot to do. But if you know the topic, you will be okay. Failing helps you learn from the trouble that comes from doing your homework or not doing it. You need to see that taking action always leads to results. Next, having a job means facing hard things. You might fail, but that can help you succeed later. You might find a task at work that is too hard to do alone. You can ask for help to understand it better. At work, they keep track of failures and successes. By not giving up when you fail, you can do well at your job. Don't take on things that are too much for you alone. Finally, you can fail a test if you don't study. This teaches you that not studying has bad results. In life, studying helps you pass tests. Tests are often needed. For example, at my school, we have tests on our homework. It's hard, but by studying, I got a good grade. If you're stuck on a test question, it doesn't mean you've failed. In my class, twenty-five percent of people failed a test. But they went home and studied a lot for the next one so they wouldn't fail again. They didn't give up after failing once. By making these choices, you can learn from your errors and try your best. No matter how often you fail, you can always try to succeed. There is always a way to turn your failures into success."}

If you fall because of someone, you learn a big lesson about why you failed, what you thought was right or wrong, and why you did it. Failure seems like a tough word because many people rush into things without thinking. Failure can teach us a lot and help us understand the real world better. People often don't realize how their past actions can affect them. They don't think about their life, how they will change, or their health. Staying healthy is key because we need to think about what we eat, drink, and other things that could harm us. We all grow and mess up, facing failure often; there's much in life we can change. Stay positive; you can reach your dreams. Everyone has different qualities; they say good or bad things about others. The knowledge you get from failing is something you can't replace. It helps you think, improve, and do bigger things. Growing is good because it shows us the tough times we face. It's important for everyone to be open because keeping everything inside is not healthy, even when failing. Keep a positive attitude; we are growing and want a good life without problems because a closed heart won't help. When you understand what the real world needs, it's hard. You work hard alone without anyone to help. It's okay to keep failing until you clear your mind. Failing teaches you a lot, even if it leads to a journey you don't like. It's easier with help from friends or parents. They can ease your stress or sadness and save you from a hard journey that's bad for you. Your parents have what you need because they raised you. They don't want you to fail or even think about it. They want you to do well, plan for the future, and believe in yourself. But in reality, you should keep things simple and show what you can do. Once you act, you can't go back. If you regret it, you have to deal with it alone because it was your choice. Think before you act, or you'll make poor choices.

Boxing helps me in school and in life. It teaches me to work hard for what I want and to give my all in everything I do. In school, I wasn't the top student, but boxing taught me not to give up. When I got lower grades, I worked harder. I studied a lot until I understood what I missed. Then I would retake the test and aim for the best score. Boxing gives me the drive to try my hardest. It also makes me feel good. When I'm sad or having a tough day, boxing is how I show my feelings. You can't just 'play' at boxing like other sports. It's hard. You have to train a lot, give up time, and deal with pain. This shows that hard work is for anyone who really wants something. Some people take the easy way, but it's not about the prize at the end. It's about the effort you put in to be your best. Boxing has shown me that with time and effort, I can achieve anything. I want to work hard and get better in my own way. What does 'giving 100%' mean? It means not eating junk food after training for hours. It means getting up early and working out before others. There's a saying, 'Rest at the end, not in the middle.' Some people quit when it gets tough or takes too long. But athletes don't sleep much because they don't want to miss their chance to be great. They work hard to get good. That's what I want in my life. It will be hard and take time, but it's worth it. Boxing shows me to work as hard as I can and always give my full effort.

But if you hurry and fail, you must keep going and not quit. Some might think they can reach their goals without effort. But in life, you have to work hard to get anything because nothing comes easy; you have to work for it.\n\nFirst, being down-to-earth is very helpful. If you are, many people will like you. And if you want a job, being down-to-earth can make them more likely to hire you. This quality will help you in school and in working hard to meet your goals and other things in life.\n\nHowever, hurrying to meet your goals won't help you succeed. For me, and others, life is about the right timing. If you want to be someone, it will take time and effort. Life is tough, but that doesn't mean you stop trying or give up. You have to work for many things in life.\n\nLastly, some might say they can meet their goals without effort. But you have to work to get things because no one will give you a job if you don't try or do what you should. Young people often say this, but they don't understand life after school. They don't really know what they're saying because they think life won't change.\n\nFor these reasons, I agree with Michelangelo because life depends on how you behave. If you are truly down-to-earth, your dreams will likely happen. But if you are arrogant, it's hard for your dreams to come true. Life is about achieving; no one gets things without hard work."}

They think there are better ways to say it. I agree with Michelangelo because his saying is smart. It warns us about a big danger we face, tells us to aim high, and teaches an important life lesson. \n\nThe first reason I agree with Michelangelo is that his words make me think about being humble when going after a goal. Being humble is key because it makes a person more liked and wanted in places like work, school, and church. \n\nThe second reason I agree is that to reach a goal, a person must work hard and give up things. They should keep their struggles private so no one can judge their work or choices. Some people cheat to reach goals and might succeed, but later, bad things happen to them as payback for not working hard. \n\nThe third reason I agree is that Michelangelo's saying is a life lesson that makes people stop and think. Life is about reaching goals and getting past hard times. Trying hard means you're more likely to win. If you give up early, you won't achieve much. \n\nAs I've said, I believe you should always do your best, never quit, do your own work, and work hard for what you want.

They will find it helpful because they will have more time to do homework and work. This means they will be less stressed. It could also change how they meet and talk to people. \n\nWith online classes, students will talk more with their teacher. If they need help, the teacher can give them more time.

It can spoil surprises, put you in danger, and hurt your good name. \n\nFirst, being honest can spoil a surprise. No one likes it when a fun surprise is ruined because someone told the truth. Surprises can make people happy. They can turn a bad day or a sad birthday around. If someone asks about your plans and you tell them about a surprise, it ruins the fun. This is bad for the people who planned the surprise too. For example, if you tell someone about their own surprise birthday party, it won't be exciting anymore. The other people who helped plan it will be sad because the surprise is gone. \n\nAlso, lying can keep you safe from danger. We should not tell our private information to strangers. If a bad person asks for secret information, telling them can make you less safe. For example, if you give someone your personal details, they might use them in a bad way. They could put them on the internet or tell a dangerous person. Then, someone might try to rob you or take you away because they know where you live. \n\nLastly, the truth can damage how people see you. When you tell someone the truth, they might use it to hurt you. Friends might stop talking to you. Some might dislike you or even hate you. Imagine you like someone in your class but it's a secret.

But, it also feels like they don't trust me to follow a simple rule like a curfew. Curfews can be too controlling in young people's lives. For example, some teenagers just want to enjoy themselves and spend time with friends. Sometimes, making it a rule is not necessary.

Maybe that's what made Duke Ellington come up with his saying! \n\nWhat did Duke Ellington mean, and why did he say it? Perhaps he was facing tough times. I think he meant that working hard made him successful. For instance, imagine a student who comes home with lots of homework. He wants to rest before starting. His mom tells him to do it right away. But he says no and goes to sleep. When he wakes up, he hasn't done his work. What happens to him? He might fail the year. So maybe Duke Ellington worked hard as a teen and saw others who didn't and aren't doing well now. \n\nWho or what inspired him? I guess his skill in music did. He's known for his smooth, calming jazz. How does he create it? Through hard work. As I mentioned before, he must have worked hard. Even as a legend, he's not perfect. He makes mistakes too. But he doesn't quit, and I think he's right not to. Quitting gets you nowhere. That's what made him great. If he had quit, he wouldn't be the star he is today. He chose music, worked at it, and quickly became the best jazz musician in America. \n\nIn conclusion, I believe he shared that quote because he faced challenges, worked hard, kept going, and had inspiration. That's what made him the top jazz musician in America."}

Last year, at my private school, I felt lost. The people I thought were friends were not real. They only cared about themselves. They called me 'shy girl' because I was quiet. When you're new, you feel out of place. I thought, 'This isn't my school.' I needed a real friend to be kind and say, 'It's going to be okay,' or 'I'm here for you.' I cried a lot.

Being positive is important to succeed. Doing good things opens doors to success. There is a lot of pain and hard times in the world. To get through life, we need good actions to beat the challenges. Being positive brings love, blessings, and success.\n\nBeing positive makes people like us. TV ads don't just make us happy. They want us to buy things. No one uses dirty clothes in ads.

To have a happy life, we choose partners who will be good with us and our kids.\n\nActing well draws people to us and makes us strong. President Agyekum Kuffour of Ghana won his people's hearts.

Respecting others, like parents and teachers, is very valuable. Disrespecting people leads to problems. We should be positive to rise in life. I watched a movie about two sisters. The older one was rude to her parents and didn't help at home. The younger one was kind. The kind sister married a nice man. The rude sister had bad marriages.

It makes us stand out, brings peace, love, blessings, and success. To avoid trouble, we should be positive. It's free to be nice. True friendships are very important.

Also, they won't die or have car accidents when there are gangs and drunk people around. This will lead to fewer deaths in the city. It will help us all agree on something to make our city better.\n\nFirst, without a curfew, teens we know might get into drug deals and gun fights. They might join gangs to make money or impress friends. They could hurt others by selling drugs or being part of shootings. A curfew could stop this. It would keep them safe and make our city safer. It would help many people, like parents who have trouble with their kids.

They could be walking at night and someone might take or hurt them. I think we should keep them off the streets to prevent this. I've seen people in my area taken because they were out all night; this needs to change. Also, someone might want to hurt them badly. Teens could be taken even when they are out partying. There are many ways this could happen. We need to follow the curfew law to protect our kids.\n\nThird, there are gangs and drunk drivers out late.

Winston Churchill, a famous leader, once said that success is about not giving up, even if you fail many times. I believe this is true, and here's why I think so: \n\nMy first reason is that if someone fails and doesn't want to try again, they will probably keep failing. Let's say my friend stopped caring about her tests after failing. She would never pass because she wouldn't be working to get better. Many people give up or don't want to try again after failing. This is why they don't succeed. You must keep trying to reach your goals, and if you fail, you can always try again. This is a big part of why I agree with Churchill: trying again helps you succeed. \n\nMy second reason is that you can be better prepared when you try something again. For example, you can look at your first test to see your mistakes and learn from them. Or, you can study more if you didn't study enough before. Being better prepared can help you understand the questions better and fix your past errors. \n\nSome people might not think that success is about failing and still being excited to try again. They might say this because they tried and still didn't succeed. But these people should remember to stay excited and confident when they take tests. I don't think it's good to take a test when you're mad or not interested. If you think you will fail or just want to finish quickly, that's bad. You shouldn't feel rushed or worried when taking a test. People who are hopeful and confident usually do better. \n\nI agree with Winston Churchill's idea that success is about not giving up, even after failing many times. One reason I agree is that if you don't try to get better or try again, you won't improve. Another reason is that you can be more ready for a test by studying more or learning from mistakes.

If they are out later than this, they will get in trouble. Some people think this is good because it lets parents have more control. But, it might make teenagers feel like they don't have enough freedom. This could make them act out more. First, with a curfew, teenagers might feel they can't hang out with friends or be outside enough. For example, they can't go to a movie that starts at 9:30 p.m. on a school night. They would miss it because it ends after they need to be home. Also, teenagers don't like being told what to do. They want to be free and have fun, and they often don't listen to their parents. If they have a curfew, they might ignore it just like they do with other rules. They act this way because they're not grown up enough to understand that parents want to keep them safe. Plus, some teenagers don't like being at home. They might stay out late. They might have problems with their parents or just be bored at home. They look for fun things to do somewhere else. For example, a teenager who doesn't have a TV might go out to find something fun to do. No matter why, they will try to stay out late even if there is a curfew.

It's normal to feel sad and alone, but trying to be happy is the best thing you can do.\n\nTake my experience, for instance. I went through a breakup at 13. I didn't know how to deal with my feelings, and it was awful. I really liked this boy, and he ended things with me. I still don't know why he dated me for such a short time. I may never understand, and maybe that's okay. Was I upset? Yes. Did I hide at home to avoid seeing him? Yes. It was tough, but then I chose to be happy with myself and to get out more instead of staying sad in my room over a boy who wasn't worth it. Now, I'm much happier and I've discovered who I am.\n\nAnother time, after my ex and I split, I lost my closest friends. It felt like I was completely alone. Despite feeling broken and like the world was against me, I decided to stay positive.

For example, when I was a freshman, I was too young and not grown-up enough to choose what career to study in college. As students grow, they often change their minds about what is right and wrong. Plus, some students, when they start high school, still act like kids and don't understand their responsibilities. Next, students should not choose a career because they are not ready. For example, many students don't know what career to study and might end up not liking it. Some schools have special programs to get ready for college. Also, normal classes can help you think about what you might want to do. In the end, some high schools have programs or clubs that can help you get ready for the career you want to study. They can help you figure out if you like it. But, choosing a career in high school can help you get ready for college. However, sometimes students don't go to college and they should not be forced to choose a career."}

Imagine you see someone with a heavy bag and you help them. This is a small kind act, but it's still helpful. Simple words like 'thank you,' 'bye,' 'you're welcome,' 'good morning,' 'good afternoon,' and 'good night' can make someone feel good. For instance, saying 'thank you' when you buy something shows the person you value their work. They work all day, and your words can make them happy. You can be kind by picking up litter. You don't have to do it to get attention. It can make you feel good too. Listening to your teacher is another way to be kind. If you ignore your teacher, they might think you don't care about school. If a friend is sad, you can smile at them, talk to them, and ask what's wrong. This is being kind. You should also avoid using bad words anywhere. If you keep using them, it's hard to stop. Helping someone who is bullied is another kind act. Stand up for them, talk to them so they don't feel alone, and tell an adult about the bullying."}

Also, learning at home means you don't have to walk, take a bus, or go somewhere else. Your classroom can be right down the hall. This way, you can learn at the best speed for you. Learning at home means you can learn things without the noise and trouble of a regular classroom. You can work as fast or slow as you need, without other students slowing you down. It's also easier because you just wake up, go to your computer, and start learning. You don't have to walk to a bus stop and wait in bad weather, which is not a good way to start learning. Being able to talk to a teacher by yourself and ask questions is very helpful. You also get time to try different ways to understand the topic. If you can't go to school, you should be able to learn faster than others and still get an education. Getting an education is important. But how you learn is what really matters. Learning from a distance is good because it gives you control over your time, how fast you learn, and it understands that not everyone does well in a regular classroom. It's the best way to do well in your studies."}

People share their life stories and these stories show their traits. It's hard to pick your own traits. How you were raised as a child affects your traits. As a teenager, you start to learn who you really are through life's events. If we could just pick our traits, many people wouldn't be who they claim to be. Sad events can change how people think and shape their personality. Still, some might pick their traits if nothing pushed them to be a certain way. But picking traits can be risky. Trying to be someone you're not can cause problems. It feels strange to act like someone else. How you were raised shows in your traits. This is because of how you were taught to live every day. For example, people raised on a farm will act differently than those who pick their traits. They've learned to behave in certain ways. Your childhood has a big effect on who you become.

The school menu will change to a new and healthier lunch. I think changing the school cafeteria menu is a really good idea.\n\nStudents can try new foods. For example, I get really scared to try something new because what if I don't like it? I get very worried about trying new things, especially food. But, I end up really liking the food and choose it again. Also, many students are bored of eating the same food every day without any change. Cafeteria workers may be bored of making the same food every day and might like trying something new for students. Some students get upset and annoyed because they eat the same thing every day and the school does not change the food.\n\nStudents will want to eat the cafeteria food more if it changes. Students will actually get food and not go hungry because some students don't eat when they don't like the current choices. Also, students won't leave school to buy food. When students go out, they sometimes come back late, or they skip and don't come back to school. If the school menu changes and gets better and healthier, students may not skip and will stay in school, ready for their next class.\n\nWhile some people think changing the school lunch menu is a good idea, others say it is a bad idea because the change can remove students' favorite foods. Even though this might be true, we need to think about things like offering healthier foods for students. If students eat healthier, they can be more active and not be sleepy in class, and actually pay attention because they are not that tired. Students will also be more alert and focused on what they are doing in school. Eating healthier can help students pay attention and not miss any lessons or work.\n\nI think the school lunch menu change will change the way kids eat. Students will want to eat in the school cafeteria more. Also, students can try new food and see if they like it. The school should change the school lunch menu because it will give students a great chance to try new foods and also make them healthy, full of energy, and happy.

Only 5% of students finish school in three years instead of four. A survey shows that most don't know what to do after they graduate. In high school, students are not mature enough to make big choices. So, they end up unsure about their future. High school is tough. It's hard for students to finish early. They must cram four years of work into three. This means summer school, extra classes after school, and night classes. They will be very busy and won't have time for a job or to relax. Being busy all the time can lead to stress. Stress is bad for students. It hurts their grades and stops them from being calm and happy. Graduating early is hard and not needed. It doesn't let students grow up fully, gives them too much work, and causes stress.\n\nThe usual four years in high school let students grow up properly. They get physically and mentally stronger. They learn about life and what they want for their future. They learn what is good and bad, what they can do well, and how to use their skills. Most young people don't know what they want to be when they grow up. After high school, they must start living on their own. They are not kids anymore. They must make big choices, like going to college, getting a job, or even becoming President. Thinking about the future is hard. It's even harder if you have to decide too soon. It's easy to dream, but students must be realistic. Education should help students find out who they are. They must use what they learn in real life after school.\n\nMost students choose not to finish high school early. It's hard to do four years of work in less time. It's more stressful. Students say that graduating early means working all the time, even on holidays. As Frida Kahlo said, \"Life isn't a race; there is time for everything.\" If you can finish in four years, why rush? High school is important. It's where you find out who you are. You shouldn't have too much homework and stress. Students should enjoy life, learn from mistakes, and have fun. If they are always studying, how can they work to make money? How can they enjoy time with family and friends if they are never free? School is not a race. You can take your time.\n\nExperts say stress is a big problem for young people. It can cause health issues, lack of sleep, and even lead to suicide. Students shouldn't have to deal with so much stress. They should go at their own pace and enjoy school. Learning should be fun, not harmful.\n\nFor these reasons, letting students graduate early can do more harm than good. High school students should learn and grow the best they can. But they should also enjoy being young. They are not adults yet. They should have time for fun and making memories. They shouldn't rush into big life choices if they're not ready. They also shouldn't have to deal with the stress of too much work. School is important, but it should be balanced. It shouldn't be the only thing in your life. Remember, life isn't a race. You have time to do everything. You can make mistakes, learn, and try again. You can do what you want because you have time. But you only live once."}

On tough school days, you can ask a friend how to deal with your problems. When buying something, you can ask friends where to find the cheapest one. Having many friends to ask means getting many ideas.\n\nWhy is it good to ask many people? You get lots of ideas from them.

It's also good to ask many people if they've done something like a driving test. They can tell you how to start the car or what road signs mean. If you ask just one person, they may not remember.\n\nAsking many people for advice is useful. When you have a problem, you need different views. This helps you make better choices.

A person might not be sure if the job they like now is the one they will like later. While they study, they might find new jobs they like more. For example, someone wants to be a scientist but then sees how engineers work and wants to be an engineer instead. People can change their minds like this. Second, there are bad choices. You might pick a job because your friend did. But if you're not as good at it, you won't do as well as your friend. You might end up asking yourself, 'Why did I pick this job?

For example, when I work at Chipotle, I need to be excited with the customers so they want to come back and spend more money at Chipotle. Also, being excited with the customers is good because sometimes they give me a tip, and I think being excited makes my work easier because everyone helps each other. When I started at Chipotle, I did not know what to do and they taught me my job. \n\nNext, being excited in school can help me. For example, if I get a 59 on a test and my teacher sees that I am excited and study hard, my teacher might let me take the test again or do a project to get a better score in the class. If I am excited, my teacher might give me extra chances and I can pass the class with a good grade. Being excited can give me more chances, like to play a sport. \n\nAlso, if I am excited, traveling becomes easier.

Trouble can come from anywhere, but if you're in a good mood, it happens less. If you're nice, why would anyone want to start trouble with you? There was a guy who was always angry and mean. He got into fights because people didn't like him. If he had been kind, he wouldn't have had those problems. Being nice helps you stay calm in any situation. It makes you a better person and keeps you out of trouble. So, it's always good to be nice."}
{"text_id": "C1219EAAC5BF", "output_essay": "It's smart to ask for advice from more than one person. People are different and might not have the best answer. Sometimes, someone might try to trick you. If you don't like someone's advice, look for another person who you think has a better answer. It's better to get many ideas from different people than just one idea from one person. You can't be sure how things will turn out. If everyone agrees, then their advice is probably good. If you like their idea, go with it. You should mostly ask your friends, family, or relatives for advice. They know you well and understand what you need. Don't ask strangers for help. They don't know you and might not be able to help. Plus, they could be dangerous. The next day, something bad could happen, and your parents would be worried. The kind of advice you need also matters. If it's a simple thing and you know who to ask, that's good. They might know the answer. If it's a tough problem and you're not sure who to ask, start with your parents. They know a lot about you and might have the answer. When you get advice from different people, you can combine it all. That's why it's good to get advice from many people, not just one. You should also talk about your problem in detail. Explain everything you're trying to say. If you don't, the people trying to help might get confused. They might feel bad if they can't help. But they could suggest someone else who can help you."}
{"text_id": "441D491C3F2B", "output_essay": "Yes, I think it's a good idea for students to pick a career early. My first reason is that students can figure out what they want to do after high school. They can be ready and focus on their goals. They can plan for their future. High schools offer many classes that help students pick a career early. I think it's not good to wait too long to choose a career. If you start early, you will have more options later. You will also understand what the job is like if you choose it.\n\nMy second reason is that waiting until the last year of high school to pick a career is not wise. If you wait too long, you might have to rush your decision. You might not know about all the different jobs you could do. That's why I think students should start thinking about careers when they are young. They could even start in middle school. This way, they can try different jobs in high school. If they don't like a job, they can change their mind. For example, if you want to be a doctor, you can find out if you like it before high school. Students are often expected to know what job they want by the time they start high school. This helps them get ready to study for that job.\n\nI agree that students should know what job they want when they start high school. It gives them a plan. Choosing a career early can make them excited and work hard to reach their goal. If you don't know what job you want, maybe you didn't take the right classes. Students who choose early can be successful. They will learn a lot and have many ideas when they study for the job they dream of."}

First, I like Tech Engineering because it is fun. For example, you can control robots with a remote. You can also use machines like 3D printers to make things like a ball on the computer and then print it. Being a Tech Engineer is exciting because you see a lot of new things that might be important in the future. Second, Tech Engineering is an interesting job. For example, people in this job might find out secrets that others don't know yet. They wait until the right time to tell people. Engineers can also make new things, like cars that float and blankets you can't see. Third, Tech Engineering is a job where you can be very creative. You can make your own technology or robots. You can also learn to get into other technologies, like computers, phones, and bank accounts, if the boss says it's okay. In the end, I want to be a Tech Engineer because it is fun and interesting.

My friend Generic_Name was one of them. He needed three more credits to graduate when he had to quit. His mom was sick, and they couldn't pay for their home. He had to work full-time. But with online classes, he can now study from home after work and earn his diploma. Also, it's not just work that stops people from finishing school. Some girls become mothers while trying to get a diploma. They need to care for their child and can't go to school. But with online classes, they can finish their education from home.

Also, a lot of kids do sports or other things outside of school. They might not join in school sports but could do ballet, dance, swim, or box. There are many activities to choose from, and trying to do these with school work and school clubs can be too much for students. This might make them do worse in one or more areas. We should also think about those who don't like sports or aren't good at them. I think that sports and school clubs after classes should not be forced on anyone.

Life can be tough, but we learn from every mistake. This is because we are not perfect. If someone fails or succeeds in life, they shouldn't give up. We should always try to get what we want in life.

You shouldn't judge something just by how it looks.\n\nSome food is healthy, and some is not. But schools can choose to serve healthy food that makes kids happy. They can offer many kinds of food like chicken, beef, salads, rice and beans, and fruits. And it's not just about the food. Schools should also give out milk and water to drink.\n\nKids might discover their favorite food by trying what the school serves. So, I think schools should change their lunch menus.

Choose a side on this topic. Give reasons and clear examples to back up your thoughts.\n\nI think Churchill is right about mistakes being important for success. I think this because what he says makes sense. You can't succeed without making mistakes; you won't always be correct. Churchill means that to win in life or anything else, you will make lots of mistakes; you won't always make the right choices.\n\nFor instance, if you dream of becoming an FBI agent or anything else, you will mess up a lot. You will mess up because you won't get everything right away. People are new at things; they have to learn everything before they can win at life. They have to be shown how to do the job or anything else. Making mistakes is key; you will keep trying over and over.\n\nI also agree with Churchill because some people always want to be correct. That's not how it works. Some people want things their way and to be right, but that's not possible. You will be wrong sometimes. You will make mistakes and feel bad, but that's normal. If you mess up, it doesn't mean you've lost in life. You will keep trying to reach success, and that's the right approach.\n\nAnother reason I agree is that Churchill understands what he's talking about. He probably made many mistakes too. He knows why he made that statement; he has his reasons and beliefs, just like everyone else. Mistakes do play a big part in getting to success because you won't always make the right calls. You have to work very hard to win at life. This is why I agree with Winston Churchill. These are my reasons and my examples for agreeing with him."}

Others prefer home because they feel shy or want to do things their way. This is sad because they might not do well or feel sure of themselves in a regular school.\n\nKids can learn at their own speed at home. They can pause the lesson and work through parts they don't get. This is great because lots of kids need extra help. They won't feel as rushed because the teacher isn't pushing them to learn everything fast. The big challenge for students is to keep up, especially if they find it hard. This can make them more stressed than being in a regular school.\n\nLearning from home is peaceful because there are no other kids to bother you or distract you. You can focus better and understand more. This helps you stay on track and finish work quickly. At home, you can take as long as you need for any task because you do it online or with video calls. You'll feel more relaxed doing your work this way.\n\nStill, many kids like regular school because they don't want to feel alone and they want to talk to others. That's a big reason they go. Whether they choose regular school or home learning depends on the kid. It's not a big deal which one they pick. It's about where they focus best. Regular schools have lots of fun activities, but home learning doesn't have group activities.\n\nI choose home learning because you can focus more, there are no distractions, and you have more time. Some people don't like it because they think regular school is better for making friends and seeing different views. But going to regular school isn't a big deal because you can make friends to support you and chat with. Learning from home prepares you for anything.

When you think, 'I want to be a doctor or engineer,' you think about how it will help you later and if you like that idea. If you want to go your own way, you must really want to fight for your dreams. For example, if I want to be a criminal investigator, I need to go down that road and really want it.

When kids stay out late, they can get into trouble with their parents or the law.

Many famous people have made mistakes and failed. But they didn't give up. They tried again. This is how we got things like cell phones, cars, computers, and safe homes. You might need to try many times at things you're not good at to find what you are good at. Failing doesn't just mean you keep trying the same thing and then quit. It also means trying different things to discover your talents. For example, you might want to be a doctor, but find it too hard. So, you become a nurse instead. Sometimes, you have to try and fail to find what you really can do well. To be good or the best at something, you must practice. If you want to be the best, you need to keep practicing and improving. I sew, and I like it, but it was tough at first. I would hurt myself with the needle and couldn't do hard things. I couldn't use a sewing machine either. All those times I tried a new thing and failed were part of learning. But now, I can sew anything, and I'm making my own clothes brand. This happened because I kept practicing, even when I failed. Some people don't chase their dreams because they're afraid to fail. When they fail, they don't stand up and try again. They don't aim high. They choose the simple path. These people will never know what could have been if they had chased their dreams. They will always wonder, 'What if?' Churchill was right; we need to fail to succeed and to find what we do best."}

Summer projects should be made by teachers because they get students ready for next year, they help students learn more, and students find them more interesting, even if some might disagree with me.\n\nFirst, projects made by teachers get students ready for next year. They cover many subjects that will be useful in the next grade and in the future. For example, my little sister was about to start third grade this year. Her second-grade teacher gave her a math packet to prepare her for third grade. It had lots of math problems. She took it everywhere and worked on the problems every day. Now she can multiply and divide big numbers. She even asks my dad to make up math problems for her.\n\nAlso, students learn more with a topic given to them than one they pick themselves. When students get a topic, they research a lot. They learn facts and find lots of information. They use many websites and resources to help with their topic. This also gets them ready for the next school year. They have a better chance to do well in life. They get knowledge by looking up information about their topics. Students learn a lot, and this knowledge stays with them.\n\nLastly, students are more interested in topics they are given. They pay more attention to a topic from their teacher. For instance, when students can write about anything, they often don't know how to start or what to write about. Sometimes they don't write at all. But with a given topic, they start writing their ideas right away. They keep writing because they find it interesting. They want to learn and work hard on their projects. In the summer, they have more time, so they work more on their projects. They find them interesting and work hard on them.\n\nIn conclusion, summer projects should be made by teachers, not students. This helps students do well in life. With a teacher's project, they enjoy many benefits. They don't write about boring things but interesting ones they learn from. Students do better with a topic from their teacher than one they pick. So, schools should always give students projects made by teachers during their breaks. This way, students are more likely to be ready for their classes next year."}

When you ask many people for their thoughts, you get different views. This helps you because you can make better decisions, see the good and bad points of someone's suggestion, and feel sure about your choice. \n\nAsking several people for their thoughts helps you choose wisely. About half of all people make the right decision this way. My dad once shared a story with me. He had a problem and asked many people what to do. He explained how this helped him do the right thing. The point is, asking a few people for help leads to better decisions. \n\nGetting advice from various people lets you weigh the good and bad of what they say. When you compare advice, you see the strengths and weaknesses. This can show you where advice might be wrong. Around the world, 75% of people have made bad choices, but 25% avoided this by getting advice from many sources. My mom is one of the lucky ones. She used to only listen to her friend Generic_Name. But once, she talked to her teacher about a family problem that wouldn't go away. Her teacher pointed out that her friend's advice was bad.

It's smart to look at the good and bad of advice, and I suggest you do it too. \n\nLastly, getting different opinions makes you feel confident. \n\nFeeling sure about your actions means you won't regret them. Confidence comes from hard work. When you get advice from several people and work hard on your problems, you become sure of yourself. About 65% of confidence comes from asking others for help. A confident person doesn't regret their choices or doubt themselves. \n\nThere's a big difference between someone who gets advice from one person and someone who hears many opinions. Asking several people for advice is useful. It helps you make the right choice, see the good and bad of advice, and feel confident. So, I urge you to ask many people for help.

You can handle a bad day because you choose how to respond to things, with friends or family. You can choose to be happy, even when things go wrong, and keep a good attitude. Have you seen that grown-ups can be grumpy too? This is because everyone has feelings. But being grumpy doesn't mean they are mean or have a perfect life. It doesn't mean they don't argue with their parents or friends. Making friends can be hard because fights can lead to rough days. When you have a rough day, it's not right to be grumpy with others just because you're having trouble with your partner. Being grumpy can happen out of the blue, so when you're having a rough day, try to manage it. You don't have to let it get to you. You can choose to have a great day and not be mean to people who did nothing wrong. If you need to let out your feelings, talk to the person who caused your bad day. How many people do you think are grumpy? Maybe about 75% of people are grumpy because their parents didn't teach them good manners. But over time, you can become the kindest person ever. Many hope that fewer people will be grumpy because a world full of rudeness isn't good. Do you know why there are so many rude people? It's because the parents from the past didn't teach their kids respect and manners. We want the world to be a place where we don't have to deal with rudeness, at home or at school. Also, we should treat others how we want to be treated. If you treat someone badly, they might do the same to you, and you'll see how bad it feels. Why act nicely?

For example, if someone is sad or having a hard time, you can cheer them up by being nice. You can ask how they are or offer to help them. By being nice, we can spread happiness.

This is good because we can make new friends and learn about them and their culture. Kindness keeps going around in a circle. It keeps going and never stops. This is good because if kindness stopped, things would not be good.\n\nIn conclusion, these are ways kindness can show that people are good.\n\nKindness can make the world a better place.

But they should first focus on meeting high school needs, like the Standards of Learning (SOL) and getting the right credits, instead of picking a job too soon. \n\nConclusion:\n\nThese three points show why I don't agree that students should pick a career before starting high school. They are too young to know what job they want. They need to get credits and take classes that will help them choose a job later. I don't agree with this idea because it puts too much pressure on young students. They have enough time to think and finish high school. Students need time to think about their choices while getting ready for the future in high school, not in college. This means thinking about the classes they need and the credits they must earn for the job they want later."}

It can make someone feel better if they are having a hard time. You don't need to do big things to be kind. You can show kindness in simple ways during your day without even knowing it. Holding a door open, saying nice things about someone's clothes, or helping a parent are kind things to do.\n\nBeing kind means being nice to everyone, no matter their race, beliefs, who they love, or how old they are. Kindness is for all. No one should leave out people who are different. Accepting people as they are is a kind thing to do. It makes people feel more at ease with others and themselves.\n\nBeing friendly and polite can make others feel better. If someone is upset because they did not do well on a test, cheering them up is kind. Being cheerful with others can help build a grown-up and happy way of thinking. Cheerfulness helps a lot with being kind. At the end of the day, the kindness you give will come back to you.\n\nA long time ago, a Greek storyteller named Aesop said, \"No kind act, no matter how small, is ever wasted.\" Like Aesop said, the kind things we do for others will spread.\n\nKindness and cheerfulness can change everyone by helping us understand each other better and grow as people. In the end, small kind things can encourage anyone to be a good person and bring out the best in others."}

It's important for students to get a good education, no matter if they go to school in person or online. Schools should think about how students can learn best. But schools should not let students take classes from home because students may not take their learning seriously, they could get distracted easily, and they might not learn well.\n\nMany students don't care much about their lives, especially their education. If schools let them stay home, students might not finish their work on time. Without an adult to remind them, they may not think education is important. They could waste time at home because teachers are not there to keep them on track.\n\nThere are lots of things at home that can distract students. Phones can take their attention away. Students might text friends or use social media during online classes. They could also leave the house too much and miss their online classes. Being alone at home can make them feel bored and tired. This might make them want to go out more, which means they get distracted a lot.\n\nLearning is important, but online classes might not help students learn well. They need teachers to show them what to do. Without a teacher, they could get lost and not know what to do next. If they don't understand the lessons, they might not learn anything. This could make them know less because they are not learning.\n\nSome people think taking classes from home is good, but this isn't always true.

In swim class, you feel proud. No one makes you feel bad if you mess up. Even if a move is hard, you end up feeling like you can do anything. My favorite move is jumping off the diving board and finding a comfortable position.\n\nMy second reason is about holding your breath. It's tough for me because I have asthma and need my inhaler. When I started swimming, I was scared. But my coach, Generic_Name, told me to never give up. So I tried, and holding my breath for 10 seconds made me very happy.\n\nMy third reason is that shy people can swim in private areas. This is good for swimmers like me.

No matter how tough the problem is, try hard to fix it. Don't lose hope because it's tough or no one helps you. Your family is there to support you.

They are older and have more experience. \n\nDon't let others make you feel bad because you are strong and smart. Don't get mad about what people say about you. Instead, face your problems and trust yourself. Deal with your issues, and let your mind grow. Then, when a new problem comes, you can fix it easily. For example, if you start a company and a big problem comes up, the leader has to fix it, or the company might fail. Some problems are small, and some are big. Everyone has problems, even kids, so if you're having a hard time, don't quit. You can handle a problem without knowing it. Sometimes problems can make you sad. For example, if your girlfriend cheats on you and you don't know what to do, you can ask your parents or someone you trust for help. Some problems are about family, like being sad because a family member died. You can rest for a few days, then tell your parents how you feel, and they will help you get through it.

For example, if teenagers are out late, they could be taken by strangers. It's not safe for them to be out alone at night. This is why a curfew can be a good thing for young people.\n\nNext, curfews can make the community safer. Curfews are a way to keep teenagers from getting into trouble. With a curfew, they must be home before 10 pm. For instance, teenagers need to get up early, so they need to sleep early. This is a good thing about having a curfew. Another good thing is that teenagers learn they can't break the law.\n\nLastly, teenagers get more sleep with a curfew. Curfews help young people in many ways. One way is by making sure they are home before the curfew begins. For example, teenagers will take the curfew seriously and will follow the law. Curfews are good for young people.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe curfews should be used everywhere to keep teenagers safe. Curfews help keep teenagers from getting into trouble and away from danger."}

He says, 'Success is moving from one failure to another without losing your excitement,' and this is true. Many people today chase money, not real success. It's not hard to make money or become famous, but it is hard to be truly successful. People often realize what success means too late, but they still try to be successful. Those who keep trying despite failures do it because they don't want to quit. Yes, it's hard to be successful all the time; you must work hard and keep trying. Life isn't easy; we must work hard for what we want. For example, when I try to succeed and work hard toward my goal, I face many failures but stay excited. If you lose that excitement, then you've really failed and given up. The key idea is to stay hopeful and excited, even when you fail. Churchill, the Prime Minister, is mostly right. Some people quit when they're not successful, but if they remember his words, they might keep hoping to succeed someday. Reading Churchill's words has taught me a lot. It's given me hope and shown me it's okay to try and fail. No matter what, keep trying to succeed and stay excited."}

It would be wrong to limit how many activities students can do. This is because some students want to get more from their school. Some students take college classes in high school to make getting into college easier. Others need sports and clubs so they don't get too stressed with homework. Students from families with less money use these activities to get noticed by colleges. Some have to work very hard to have a chance at college. They might get into their dream college by doing these activities for many years. Letting students choose their activities teaches them to be responsible. As adults, no one will tell them how to manage their time. It's better to learn this now than later. Schools should help students get ready for adult life. The best way to learn is by doing. I am a student who plays sports after school. When I started football, I cared about it a lot. But then my grades got worse. I decided not to go to practice on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Instead, I stayed with my teachers to get better grades. This helped me learn to manage my time. This is an important skill for everyone. Some students may not realize they need to change. They might need help or limits on their activities. But schools should not have to do this. Schools care about all students. If a student starts to ignore their main classes, it should be the parents' job to help. When my grades got worse, my mom helped me. Now I am doing better. In the end, students should answer for their choices. If they start to do poorly, they should fix it. If they can't, it's up to the parents, not the school. Learning to manage time early on helps students in the future. When they are adults, no one else will help them."}

There are more reasons why we shouldn't force students to join activities.\n\nThe principal made this rule, but students who don't want to join will get in trouble. Too much trouble can hurt their lives and grades. Students should choose what they like. For example, they may need to stay late for an activity but can't. Extracurricular activities can be fun for hanging out with friends. But if you can't join, it makes students upset. I wouldn't join because I have no time after school. Students get upset when teachers make them do things they don't want to.\n\nAll schools in Generic City have good and bad rules. They don't let you do what you want, and you can get in trouble for skipping activities. Students often don't have time or don't think activities are important. They might also be scared of being bullied. There are many reasons why we shouldn't force students to join activities. If a student chooses a sport like soccer, they could get hurt. People get bored listening to the teacher. They can get distracted and then get in trouble for talking. Teachers can be too strict; they get mad over small things like chewing gum in class.\n\nTeachers should make fun activities so students can enjoy time with friends. Some students are too lazy to think about joining activities. People have different opinions; not everyone thinks the same. The county should make more exciting activities so students can learn and see that activities can be good. Students might seem distracted, but maybe they just don't know how to do something in the activity. That's why I don't agree with the principal's decision."}

No one likes to copy someone else's qualities because it doesn't show their real self. I like having many qualities instead of copying others. When I think about being different, I can be myself around others. I always tell myself that 'Different is good.' This idea makes me feel special and shows that my qualities are okay. It's good to have different qualities from others, and it's okay if some qualities are the same as many people's.\n\nBeing honest can do a lot of good for everyone.

Businesses will hire you because you are truthful and customers will like you. You will encourage others in your town to be honest just by being truthful yourself.

People won't respect you, and you won't be trusted. You won't find a good job. That's why you should always be honest. It will bring you the opposite of all the bad things that come with lying. Another thing is that being honest makes you feel good, while lying makes you feel bad. If you did something wrong and try to hide it with a lie, you'll be afraid that people will find out.

This is because the company needs people who are skilled, and the bosses have to make sure of this. It makes sense for bosses to look for workers with experience. Without it, bosses struggle. They have to always check if the work is done right or tell the worker what to do. Bosses must make sure that the workers they want are reliable and on time. This matters for the company. Everything must be right for the customers. They need workers who are hardworking and skilled. This is how the company gets more business because customers notice the quality. But, bosses have to pick the right people with the right experience. It's also important for bosses and the company that the worker is nice to customers. Bosses should think about this when hiring. If a worker is rude to people, the company can suffer. The blame goes to the bosses because they chose that worker. That's why bosses must be sure to hire the right person with the right traits. Bosses should carefully choose the most experienced person. In conclusion, bosses should ask the worker about the company's work and see if they fit the job.

To start a club, a student needs at least six other students to join and one adult to watch over them. The club must have a meeting place and a schedule. Otherwise, many clubs might want to use the computer lab at the same time, but only one can use it. When you start a club, it must fit into a category like science, sports, office, or play. Before a club begins, an office club must decide what category the new club fits into. They check if it's okay, if it needs equipment, and other things. They also pick where the club will meet.

Help the kid who is being bullied. If you can't stop the bully, tell a teacher. Some people like being kind, but others don't. People who aren't kind are not nice. But most people like being kind because it's the right thing to do. It's good to treat others well. So, the young kids should always try to be kind to everyone."}

This is a reason students may not like sports. Teachers think sports help students do better in school. This isn't always true. Some students don't play sports and still get good grades. \n\nBeing made to play a sport can cause students to not want to go to school. If this happens, it's bad for the school. Students might leave for other schools. Then, the first school might lose too many students. Teachers might not want to teach if there are not enough students. The school could then have a hard time keeping teachers. Also, if everyone works on the yearbook, selling it is useless. The students who made it won't buy it. They'll just tell their parents about it. Then, parents won't buy it either. They would only buy it to keep as a memory. \n\nTeachers should let students who like sports play them. They should let other students enjoy school too. If students like studying, they should study. Making students do things they hate can make them hate school. Even students who loved school might start to hate it. This can upset teachers. A teacher might try to talk to a student who doesn't care. This can make the teacher very upset and even cry. \n\nIn the end, if a school makes students do things they don't want to, it might lose them.

If they decide early, they can get a job soon after finishing school and start earning money while they're still young. They can also study more and work part-time. With early earnings, they can plan to buy a house, cars, help their family, or start a business.\n\nI'm 19 and still in high school. It's tough because I don't know what job I want. I worry about paying rent and car bills. I go to school and work part-time, which makes it hard to focus on choosing a career.\n\nIf young people pick a career in high school, it's good. They can try a job and if they don't like it, they can switch. They have time for their parents' support. If they're older, like 21, parents might not help as much. My dad said he'd help me through high school, but after that, I'd have to work and study on my own. I want to find a career and keep studying, even at night, because education is key for a good job later.\n\nParents should ask their kids what they want to be. Kids dream because they see what adults do. Sometimes parents say no because of their own limits. This can crush kids' dreams. But if parents support their dreams, kids can achieve them.\n\nChoosing a career early helps students stay on track. Teachers can then help them learn about that job. College will be easier for them.\n\nI ask friends about their career plans, and some don't like school. They'd rather work right away, like in construction, for quick money. But then they find the work too hard. I wonder if they thought about how a career could make life easier. If not, they now face the results of not studying.\n\nGetting a career can be hard. Many students want to study but can't afford it. They work and pay for their journey to the U.S. That's why some stop studying; they think work matters more than school. But school is more important. It teaches about jobs, and graduates can earn well because of their degree and knowledge.\n\nIn the U.S., there are chances for Hispanic students to find careers and learn English. But many come just to work and miss these chances. If they saw the U.S. differently, not just for jobs, many could be very successful.\n\nEducation is vital. It lets us learn, become teachers, educate our kids, and help them follow their dreams. Or we can find a job we know well and enjoy life with family and friends.\n\nChoosing a career you love is crucial. If you don't, you might be unhappy. Sometimes parents choose for their kids, which can lead to a life of discomfort in a disliked job.\n\nI think it's great for students to pick a career in high school. School teaches us a lot. It prepares us to be skilled workers and good people in the future."}

Without it, we wouldn't know what we know today. Summer projects for students should be made by teachers. They can focus on special topics, show students what they will learn next year, and help students think about their future jobs. But some people don't agree. They say students should make their own projects. They should make something that is good for them or that they like. For example, Albert Einstein was very smart. He worked hard to learn more every day. He is famous for making the formula for a nuclear bomb. But there are other ideas to think about. First, students can learn about special topics. When teachers give you a project, it is easy because you know what to do. Having a clear topic makes it easier to find information. These projects are simple, easy to make, and good for learning. It might take time, but having a topic to focus on is better than not knowing where to start. Also, students can learn what they will study in the next year. Summer projects can get students ready for the next grades, like 9, 10, 11, and 12. These projects can give students a head start. They can learn things that will help them with schoolwork all year. Scientists say we forget a little bit of what we know every day if we don't learn something new. Last, students can think about what jobs they might like. Doing a project can help students find what they love. In summer projects, they might find new things they like while they learn about science, technology, history, or books. In the end, summer projects for students should be made by teachers. They help students learn in a focused way, show them what they will study next year, and help them think about jobs.

Some think we pick our own ways of acting, but really, the people we spend time with, like family and friends, shape us. First, family has a huge effect on how we act. For example, if someone has happy parents, or mean or negative cousins or older brothers or sisters, they can change how that person acts. This means family will always affect our ways of acting, especially the older members. Family is key in forming how we act. Next, friends also change us a lot. If a person's friend is rude and acts out, it might make that person do the same. But if a friend is a good student and likes sports, it might make that person act better. This shows that friends change us a lot because we are with them so much, at school or just to have fun. Clearly, friends change us the most. Our ways of acting come from family and friends. Family affects us because they are always there, and older brothers, sisters, or cousins can change younger ones. Friends change us too because we are always with them.

First, I reached my goals by aiming low. This might be true for everyone, but not all succeed this way. Some fail. I found success by aiming low and did well. I want to help others do the same because I'm smart like Michelangelo. I want to encourage them. This can help everyone; you can handle things better. I want to stay focused, never quit, and this is what I do to succeed by aiming low. His words have helped me a lot. Second, aiming low cuts down your risk. You get more time and less stress. Take it easy and you'll feel better. You won't feel trapped. You should look for low-risk ways to reach your goals. This means less risk, more time, and less worry. Also, I don't overthink because it wastes time and is hard. Third, you must be honest, as he said about the danger of not aiming high enough. Lying is bad and can be caught. You might not know if something is true or false. Lying is a big risk and not being honest can mess with your feelings. Michelangelo, a great artist, always told the truth. He was kind, never did bad things, and didn't hurt others. With this proof, I still stand by his words because starting with low goals and reaching them is a good way to begin. It's a smart way to start. He was always honest, which lowers risk. I want to support and care for others. I aim to be a genius like him, go beyond his achievements, and be smart.

{"text_id": "6E3ED4DB9512", "output_essay": "Some people think that failing is bad. I think it's good. Failing means you are learning from your mistakes. If you don't fail, you won't succeed in anything in life. I have failed many times. This is how I improve at what I'm doing. I agree with Winston: to succeed, you must learn how to succeed. Learn about what you want. Look at how others do it and why. Take it step by step until you understand. For example, to learn to ride a bike, you need to know the bike well. You start with training wheels. Then you remove one side and learn to balance. Do the same with the other side. As you get better, you won't need them. Without training wheels, it gets easier as you practice and know the bike more. To reach your goals, you have to fail, even when you think you've made it. There will always be something blocking your way. The most successful people failed many times to get where they are. From mistakes, you learn what to do and what not to do. Like me, I want to fix cars. To improve, I need to work on a car I don't mind messing up. I learn what each part does and how it works with the car. Taking out the engine is hard, but I can do it. I remove all the fluids and unplug the battery so the check engine light doesn't come on. I do everything step by step. If I skip a step, it causes problems later. Once, I didn't know how to remove a part from a car. I had to look it up on my phone. I found out what to do, what size tool I needed, and how to take it off. To succeed, learn from your mistakes. It's not easy, but you can do it. Some people think success comes from luck. It doesn't. Maybe for a few, but not for most. That's why I think failing is good for later success. Falling and failing help you do better and reach your goals. No dream is too small. If you work hard, you will make it. To start a business, you have to fail. From failing, your business will grow and earn more money over time. Failure isn't bad. You just have to learn from it, improve, and keep going.

If you are honest, you will live a normal life without lies. For example, if you lie in a job interview, it won't end well. If you keep lying, you won't get the job. Lying to others is like lying to yourself. Be honest with your friends, family, and those who support you. If you want to say a lie, don't say it. Think twice. Do your best and don't live with lies.

When I was a freshman, I was surprised to learn about graduating in three years. I wanted to do it, and so did my friends. But later, I saw the value in using all four years of high school. The three-year program is not meant to harm. It can help you start a business early or go to college sooner. You could even travel in the fourth year. You might meet someone who can help you start a business. In the end, the program has good and bad points. It depends on what you want for your future. I would choose the regular four years. But that's just me. What I think doesn't matter to you. What you decide is up to you. Everyone has their own plan, and you won't know how it works until you try."}

Take the Wandy story. A new worker who knows nothing can ask for help to understand their job. This also shows which job fits them best.\n\nSome people like to work alone, and I see why. There are smart people who can think of ideas by themselves. Like Mr. Bill Gates, who made a computer on his own. But working alone can be lonely. There's no one to help if you're stuck, and hard problems can take a long time to solve.\n\nStill, working in a group is good. It's fun and helps create great ideas and get a lot done. But some group members might talk about others. You need to be strong and not let criticism hurt you. That's why some people choose to work alone to avoid problems. In Generic City, people from different places might not understand each other. This can cause mix-ups and make people feel they are being talked about.\n\nChoosing to work in a group or alone is up to the person. Groups can work faster with experienced people. You must be committed and strong in a group, especially when the boss wants things done fast. But working alone has its ups and downs. If a boss needs work quickly, doing it alone might cause errors because of the hurry.\n\nBoth ways are good in their own right because at work, you should do what helps. Do what makes people happy and stay away from what confuses them. Everyone should do their best and support each other to achieve their goals. Working alone can be right for those who don't need others and want to concentrate. Some people like quiet to work. That's why they prefer being alone. In this, I agree with both ways."}
{"text_id": "58C6CE6B0BBB", "output_essay": "Most schools in the United States have sports teams and clubs. Students who join these teams or clubs often have more work to do every day. Schools need to watch these students closely because they might get too much work from these activities or might not do their schoolwork because they are busy with these activities. \n\nThe extra work students do for their clubs or teams can be hard and tiring. They feel this every day. Even students who are used to this schedule can find it hard because people need to rest after being active all day. A student who is in many activities might get tired. They might not feel tired right away, but their body will show that it is tired after a while. For example, a student who plays soccer and is in the band has to go to all the practices. If both have practice at the same time, the student has to choose which one to go to and then catch up with the other. This can be very stressful. Also, if a team travels for a game or a band performs in the city, they might come home late. This means students have less time to study or sleep. In the end, these extra things they do can make their schoolwork worse. \n\nStudents join many school activities to get more experience. They do this to make their school records better for the future. But they might focus too much on these activities and forget about their schoolwork, like homework and studying for tests. They might not do their homework because they are doing activities, or they might have to go to an event with their club or team. They might be hurting their own education by doing this. \n\nIn conclusion, schools should help students who join many teams or clubs because they might have too much work. Schools should also think about what kind of student wants to join. Some students can do many activities and still get good grades. Schools should also control what activities students can join."}
{"text_id": "BCBD15D06539", "output_essay": "If we had curfews, teenagers walking on the streets at night would stay out of trouble. I agree with this idea. I am in high school, and I think that teenagers often get into trouble because they don't plan ahead. Most teenagers like to be out late at night when fewer adults or older people are around. Curfews can also teach teenagers to be responsible. At night, it is dark and hard to see, which can lead to teenagers getting into fights or facing danger. On August 20, 2018, I looked up information about teenagers and curfews in Kids' Time. The article said that curfews help keep teenagers away from crime, danger, and bad influences. Curfews also help teenagers do well in school by making sure they study and finish their work on time. They help teenagers keep a regular sleep schedule too. Without curfews, many teenagers would get into a lot of trouble and break the law. Curfews can save the lives of young people because they won't be out walking or driving alone late at night. They won't be in the wrong place at the wrong time. In the end, curfews teach young people to manage their time well. This keeps them safe at home. Teenagers need curfews for their everyday life. I say this because I am a teenager too. One night, I didn't have a curfew. I was out with friends and there was a test the next day. I failed because I stayed out too late and didn't study. Curfews protect teenagers from friends who might cause trouble. Not having a curfew as a teenager is risky at night. People get hurt or break the law often. So, bad things could happen in the future. Curfews help keep teenagers safe from trouble and harm."}
{"text_id": "A63329FD7076", "output_essay": "I think curfews do not stop teenagers from getting into trouble. The city council should not even talk about this. It's not fair to make this a rule. After all, 10 pm is just a number. I have several reasons why this rule is not good for teenagers. First, teenagers are between 13 and 19 years old. Those who are 13-15 are often in middle school. Their parents likely do not let them go out late anyway. High school students are 15-19 years old. They start to choose for themselves, learn to drive, and get ready for adult life. At this stage, parents should trust them to go out and come back at a time they agree on, even if it's after 10 pm. There are many reasons they might be late. They might have sports after school. A practice or game can run late. It's not the teenager's fault. They might have to travel to another school for a game. They often take the bus, which takes time. Jobs are another reason teenagers might be out late. A teenager's work hours can change. One day they might work until 9 pm, another day until the store closes. If their boss asks them to work late, it's not their fault. They might need the job or the money. In the end, I still believe teenagers should not be punished by the law for staying out past 10 pm. It's not fair to make this a rule for them. Teenagers are almost adults and should decide for themselves when to come home."}

It's important because we can learn from mistakes, guess what might happen if we do something, and it can teach young people lessons.\n\nPeople often make mistakes and sometimes learn from them. For example, when my brother was learning to drive, he drove too fast and missed a stop sign. My parents made him wait to drive again until he could stop right. When I started to learn, I remembered what happened to my brother. I didn't make the same mistake, so I got better.\n\nTalking about your past can help others later on. I want to be a doctor, and my aunt is one. I asked her how she did it. She told me it took three years of medical school and she had trouble remembering things. She wrote notes in her book to help her study. I plan to do the same when I go to medical school.\n\nIt can also teach young people lessons.

{"text_id": "3005AB9238DC", "output_essay": "Would a city be better off with a teen curfew? First, teens can be a bad influence on each other. It's important to say that violence might not go down a lot, nor will the poor choices teens make every day. But, a curfew could help them get more sleep. This would mean many teens wouldn't be sleepy in school. It's not sure that teens will go to bed right at 10 p.m. But, a curfew could mean less teen violence at night and fewer bad things happening after dark. This includes avoiding kidnappings or fights with adults. Adults can be involved in more serious crimes like being in gangs or other illegal activities. Second, this rule would help parents. Many parents go to bed early because they have to get up for work. Worrying about their kids being out late can stress them out. It's key to know that kids shouldn't be out past 10 p.m. if this rule is in place. But, if they are with an adult, they wouldn't be breaking the rule. Sometimes, emergencies happen and families need to be together. If kids can't go out at night and something bad happens, it wouldn't be good for them to be home alone. The curfew could make things better in society. If teens aren't as free to do whatever they want, maybe there would be less violence and bad choices. Teens would also be safer in many ways. When the city council starts this rule, security will get better and stricter. If they find a teen out after curfew, the teen would get a small punishment. This makes sure teens know they must follow the new rule. To end, this law would help the city in many ways. It would cut down on violence and help teens get to bed early so they're not tired for school. Once the rule starts, it's likely that teens would be safer at night."}

From his words, we learn that it's better to be busy. Today, you live in a time where machines do a lot for you. They make your food and clothes and provide ways to get around, like cars, planes, trains, motorcycles, bikes, and boats. This might seem like you don't have to do much. But you still need to learn, follow your passions, take care of your family, play sports you love, walk, spend time with loved ones, and chase your dreams. Machines can't dream for you. Small things that make you happy are still important. Some people think being busy means only working for money. It's true, you need a job and money to live. But being busy should also mean doing what you love, not just working for money. Money alone won't make you successful. I believe success is about being alive, having love, family, and happiness. Now, let's talk about doing nothing. It might seem nice to stay in bed, use your phone, or watch movies all day. But doing nothing can lead to bad results, not just with money. Your personal life and health can suffer. I won't list all the things you might miss out on by being idle. There are too many. It's okay to rest and take breaks, but being idle every day won't help you find yourself. So, I say doing nothing is not a choice. You decide. If you're idle, you won't be happy for long.

This is a smart idea, but not everyone agrees. I am unsure if I support it or not. Everyone wants more free time for their jobs. I want to share my thoughts on learning online with video calls. I think it's both good and not so good, so I'll give two examples. A student doesn't need to go to school but can learn from home online. I think this is great because they can do other things like cook, watch TV, or clean. You can even learn while driving; this app is very useful. Doing things at home is helpful. You can also watch your kids. But I think you shouldn't study for more than an hour this way. Then you have more time for yourself. Most people want to learn this way to save time. But I don't think it's a great idea because you might not really understand. For example, if you ask 'How do I do this?' and get an answer, you might still be confused. You haven't learned anything. So, what do we get from online video learning? I believe it's both bad and good. Bad because you might not learn much, and good because it gives you more time. Parents like this method because it gives them time for their own activities. But for kids who don't study, they must go to school. Kids can be lazy, and if they use this app, it's not good. I- WHAT HAPPENS TO KIDS WHO STAY HOME AND USE THIS METHOD - The kid gets lazy - They don't do much - They might gain weight Note: There are no BENEFITS for kids II- WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS FOR PARENTS - More time - Time with your kids and spouse - Maybe very free - Free - Can work III- WHAT HAPPENS TO PARENTS WHO USE THIS METHOD First, they can't really understand the lessons. - They learn nothing - They don't study at home - Time just passes IV CONCLUSION Making this method is smart, but not everyone should use it. In my view, it's not good for kids. It's for parents who work and are busy with their families. I don't agree with online or video call learning for students."}

If you fail at the same thing many times, you will understand your mistakes. Failing a lot can help you succeed. If you fail, keep your excitement for what you want to achieve. You also need to know what you want to become. Failing makes you stronger in that area. I think Churchill was right. You have to fail at least once to succeed.\n\nFailing a lot can help you succeed. This is because each time you fail, you get a chance to get better. It doesn't matter if you fail many times. The important thing is to learn from each failure. Think about failing once and not learning from it. If you get another chance, you will fail again. This is because you didn't look at what went wrong before. In short, you can succeed after failing if you look at your mistakes and try to do better next time.\n\nWhen you fail, don't lose your excitement. Excitement helps you become who you want to be. You can't get anything done without it. It drives you to work. Imagine if workers didn't care about their jobs or if students didn't care about their classes. The workers wouldn't do their jobs well. They might keep failing because they don't care anymore. Students who don't care about their classes would also keep failing. They wouldn't pass because they lost the will to succeed.\n\nYou need to know what you want to become. When you fail, you get better at it.

Just because you fail once doesn't mean you can't win. You have to try again and keep your excitement.\n\nIn conclusion, failing gives you a chance to be a better person. But you must stay excited. Without excitement, you might keep failing. If you keep trying and learn from your mistakes, you can be a better person. You will work hard for what you want.

Lying can be useful in many cases. Take parents, for example. They can't always tell their kids the truth. If a child dresses up, a parent can't say they look bad. They must say the child looks like the character they're pretending to be. Also, when you go out with friends or other couples, you can't tell them they don't look good. You have to say nice things. Some people think telling the truth helps others improve or do better. Friends often want to know what you really think, and it can help them. Maybe their clothes don't match, or there's something off about their look. Telling the truth can stop them from feeling silly later. What if someone's shirt shows a cartoon character they like?

I tell myself it's better not to think about time, but how to stay away from all that's happening in the world. Sadly, we try to split apart or keep a distance from others in ways that are really just judging. We're not perfect, of course, but these days, too many people want to be better than the next person. This might be because of their religion, how much money they have, or the bad education they got as kids. I'm talking about everyone when I say 'people.' Even young kids, like 4 years old, might judge others without meaning to. I believe we act this way because we choose to. After we evolved and thousands of years passed, we began to meet other humans and were shaped by our first impressions. This is where we started our path to today, to what we are and what we chose to be as a society. The start of writing led to religion and other ways to show the world, and anyone out there in space, that humans are different from other species and even from each other. This might be through cave paintings or wall drawings. But this is only when we talk about spiritual or cultural differences, not just judgment. It's more than first looks. I'm not just focusing on how you look but on who you are and everything you bring with you. This is our way of thinking, and it will be hard to change. To be kind to the people alive now and those to come, we won't be able to ignore our religious or racial differences with others. Maybe it's because that's how our parents taught us and how their generation was raised. To be clear, I agree; we are really good at judging others and trying to make ourselves look better no matter what. We don't care about our spiritual energy and how we should treat each other anymore. In the end, the system we live in is global, and until science can tell us where we come from and who we really are, we will stay in the same place with the same thoughts."}

Teachers sometimes take extra classes to get points they need to teach.\n\nConclusion\n\nStudents should learn more, and there are ways to do this. But without finishing high school or getting a diploma, college is hard. Students have four years to get credits and graduate from high school with a good degree. In some places, people expect you to do well, but it's not the same as having a diploma. For GED classes, you have to pay to learn and get a degree if you don't have a high school diploma. In some schools, students finish at 15 years old. By then, they have time to think about college or what they want in the future. Everyone makes different choices."}
{"text_id": "EAFFC084F3D3", "output_essay": "I don't agree with the head of the school's choice, and here's why. First, we shouldn't have to join in if we don't want to. Second, we can choose for ourselves instead of letting an adult choose for us. For example, if someone uses your address to get a free hoodie without asking, they are choosing for you. But if they ask and you say no, you are choosing not to share your address. This is like school. If an adult tells you to do something you don't want to, then don't do it unless it's good for you. Our head of the school said all students must do one after-school activity. This means they are making us stay late and do things besides our homework or projects. Some students have sports outside of school. If I have to stay for an activity, I might miss my football game. Missing it could mean I won't show my skills to the coaches. So, I might not get to join a football team outside of school. Sometimes you have to do what you're told. Even though I don't like others making choices for me, since the head of the school says we must do an after-school activity, we should do it. I'll join an activity until I'm not interested anymore. It's just one activity, so it shouldn't be too hard. But I still don't agree with the head of the school about after-school activities. Some students might think it's okay because they need to improve their grades. But the only club that helps with grades is the homework club. Since the head of the school doesn't count that as an after-school activity, you might as well go to that club anyway."}

But it might be a good idea for them to be home by 10 p.m. on school nights and by midnight on weekends. This way, they could stay out of trouble, get enough sleep, and do better with their homework. Young people often don't think about what could go wrong if they stay out too late. They could get in trouble with their parents or even the police. I know this because when I was thirteen, I stayed out until 1:00 a.m. and got in trouble. Since then, I make sure to be home on time. If teenagers had to be home by 10 p.m. on school nights and by midnight on weekends, they might sleep more. Everyone needs at least eight hours of sleep for good health. But many young people only sleep for five hours because they stay out late. I see students at my school who are very tired or sleep in class. They miss what the teacher says, and that could be on a test. Some even have car accidents because they're too tired. If they had to be home earlier, they would probably go to bed earlier too. Teenagers also need time to study for tests. But some go out and drink, or say they'll study later and then don't. Those who don't have a time to be home often don't study. They know they won't get in trouble. But studying is important to pass tests and classes. If they had to be home at a certain time, they wouldn't go out so late and would have time to study. Teenagers should have a time to be home on school nights and weekends. It would help them stay out of trouble, do better in school, and be healthier. Even if they don't like the idea, it's better for everyone."}

If not, then learning at home might be the best choice for you. You can still ask questions and maybe finish school faster. Some people might say that going to school is better. But when you drive or take the bus, you could get into a car crash. If you learn at home, you're more likely to be safe.\n\nFirst, learning at home doesn't mean you can't ask questions. If you're watching a video and don't get something, you can call to ask about it. If the class is live online, you don't even need to call. You can just ask the teacher right away, and they will help you understand, just like at school.\n\nSecond, if you go to school, you have to do all twelve years, unless you work extra hard to get all the credits you need. But if you learn at home, you can finish your work quicker. This means you can start on next year's lessons sooner. So, you can finish early and graduate before the twelve years are up.\n\nIn conclusion, learning at home is a smart choice. You don't have to worry about asking questions; it's easy, just like at school, but you're at home. You also don't have to be in school for as long. You can get your work done faster and graduate sooner."}

For example, students can take summer classes to skip extra classes and finish early. But some people think that students who stay for four years learn more, work, and save money for college. In four years, students can try new things and figure out what they want to do. Counselors are talking about if students ready to finish high school in three years should go to college or start working early. A student who finishes in three years can get a good job and save money for college. After working, the student needs to focus on school to reach their goals. My brother finished in three years; he studied hard every day at home and school. He only took the classes he needed and went to summer school. After he finished, he worked for a year to save money because he has big dreams and always tries new things to avoid failing. Many students need to finish in four years because not all are ready to finish early. Some need to learn more. Many students take extra classes because they want to learn more, find the classes hard, or want a better diploma. In four years, students have time to get good grades and learn more about the job they want. It's important for students to learn not to quit the first time; trying again is key to success. My cousin chose to finish in four years because she wanted to try new things and learn more. She gets good grades but stayed an extra year in high school to learn more about her chosen career. She is smart because she studies and works to reach her goals. Anyone who chooses to finish in three or four years is making a smart choice because each student is different. Many students choose to finish in three years because they think it's smart to start college or work and save money for their dreams a year early. Those who choose to finish in four years think it's better because they can get ready, get good grades, and learn more to pick the best job for them.

The place you live can push you to do good or bad things. If you live in a bad area and make friends there, they might lead you to make bad choices and get in trouble with the law. If you live in a nice area, you're less likely to be led astray. How people treat you is also important. If they are mean to you or bully you, you might become very sad, think about harming yourself, or quit school. In the end, your character is often shaped by others or by where you live. Once your character is set, it can still change easily. When you're with friends, you might try to copy them. Where you are can push you to do right or wrong.

You would feel stressed and maybe unhappy with yourself. I think when people face hard times, they often need help from others. Also, I think many need support from family, friends, or someone they trust.\n\nAlso, many people have mental health issues. In the past, people didn't take these seriously. But now, they do. For example, I think being positive is good for people with mental health issues.

Adding an after-school activity is like adding another ball to juggle. I know after-school activities can be good. They can help you find new hobbies and make friends. But many students can't stay after school because they are too busy. I don't agree with the principal that all students must join an after-school activity. Some students are busy and don't have time. Others do things outside of school. It would also make the school spend more money on these activities. \n\nOne reason I don't agree with staying after school is that many students can't because they are busy with other things. Some have jobs or need to look after brothers or sisters. This stops them from staying after school. If the principal makes them stay, they could lose their jobs and the trust of their bosses and parents. Staying after school could also make students more stressed. This could hurt their health and make them do worse in school. Parents wouldn't want this. They wouldn't want their kids to risk their jobs, duties, or health for an extra activity they are too busy for. \n\nLike the busy students, some can't join an after-school activity because they already do other things.

These programs often meet every day. Many students are in more than one activity and don't have time for more. \n\nStaying after school for an activity would also cost the school more money. The school would need to pay for more activities and equipment. They would need teachers and coaches to help. These teachers would need extra pay for their time.

Some students are busy, others do things outside of school, and it would cost the school more money.

Or you might want to tell your girlfriend or friends your address if you are having a party and they need to know where to go. I understand that having a time to be home can keep teenagers safe from trouble. But there are other things to think about. Some people don't like it when others try to control young people too much. Also, you shouldn't tell people you don't know where you live. This could be dangerous and they might try to hurt you."}
{"text_id": "B5A95EA12C6B", "output_essay": "I believe that technology is good because it saves time. People can look for things on the internet or open a website on their phone, iPad, or any other device they use. Technology is also great for everyday things like emergencies or school work. It lets us talk to others without speaking. This helps us stay close to family and friends. That's why I think technology is very important to have and use all the time.\n\nMy first reason is that we need technology for emergencies. Why do we need our phones in an emergency? If a family member gets hurt and needs help, you might be the only one who can help them. You can use your phone to call 911 or call your insurance if you have a car accident. If someone is in the hospital, you can call someone to stay with them. This lets you go home to rest or do other things.\n\nMy second reason is that technology helps with school work. If someone doesn't know how to do their work, they can look up the answers on their phone. This saves time and helps them finish their work. Also, you can use technology to help others with their school work. This saves them time and helps them turn in their work on time.\n\nMy last reason is that technology helps us talk a lot with others. For example, it's important to tell your parents where you are and when you'll come back. If you don't, they might worry and call you or even call 911. If you travel to another country, it's important to keep in touch with your family. You can update them on how you are or just send a text to make them feel better.\n\nIn conclusion, having technology is very important. It helps in many ways, like in emergencies, with school work, or talking a lot with others. Technology helps us stay connected with people far away. It has changed a lot, but it has changed to make our lives and how we talk to others better."}

I think being positive is important because people will be nice to you, good things will happen to you, you will find more work, and you will make new friends. \n\nMy first point is that being positive means people will be kind to you. For example, you could help someone carry their bags, give them a ride, or just talk to them nicely. \n\nMy second point is that good things will happen if you stay positive. You could give money to help others. If you see something bad, speak up. Doing good will make you feel good and bring more good into your life. \n\nMy third point is that being positive can help you get more jobs. For example, be positive in a job interview. This makes the person interviewing you want to hire you. If you get the job, be nice to customers and say nice things. This could lead to tips and good comments. \n\nMy last point is that being positive helps you meet new people. When you meet someone, show them you are positive and nice. People usually don't like being around someone who is negative. You want to make good friends or start good relationships. \n\nIn conclusion, being positive is important. It makes people treat you well, brings good things into your life, helps you find more jobs, and helps you make new friends. Being positive helps you succeed more than being negative. In the future, being positive will help you be without stress."}
{"text_id": "C671BB7889B4", "output_essay": "\"Do you think it's a good idea for students to pick a job path early?\" Some think it's smart for students to know their future job early to get a head start. Others say it's not smart because they might change their minds later. I believe picking a job early helps students get ready for college, reduces stress later, and gives them a plan for the future.\n\nFirst, picking a job early helps students get ready for college. For example, students won't be lost in college if they've already studied something similar in high school. If a student doesn't know what they're doing, college will be hard. It's also important to choose a job early so students know what to expect and don't panic.\n\nSecond, students won't change their minds often if they pick a job early. They know what to do because they prepared when they were young. As they grow up, they won't worry about not liking their job if they liked it as kids. People worry too much about their future when they don't have a plan. Having a plan or a backup can help a lot.\n\nThird, young students who pick a job can become more skilled and achieve more later. For example, if you want to be a singer, start with singing lessons. High schools sometimes offer arts classes to help you improve before college. Even though college is different, you'll be ready with your teachers' help.\n\nSome disagree with choosing a job early because students might want to change later. A child's parents might push for a job the child doesn't like, which can be a big problem. But, changing plans can be okay. Taking a break to figure out what they want, not what their parents want, can be good. This shows why it's good to pick a job early, so you know what's best for you.\n\nPicking a job early is better for students to have a plan for the future. So, teachers and parents, if you want your child to have a good goal and future, let them pick their job early and start planning!"}

What others think can change how you act, for better or worse. Sometimes, what people say can help you in your situation. This can lead to you making good choices and becoming a better person. If someone gives you a very bad idea, do the opposite. Make good choices that are good for you and others. This is a good way to decide what to do based on what others think. \n\nAnother reason to get many opinions is that it can help you think of new ideas. I don't focus on this much, but what people say can change how you think. You might start to have new thoughts about things. This could lead to a good idea, like raising money for a cause or helping others. This is an important way that other people's thoughts can help you make good choices. \n\nA third reason is that what you hear from others can inspire them too.

{"text_id": "9314D1638985", "output_essay": "Character traits are the ways people act. We can pick up traits from our family and friends, but we don't have to be just like them. Everyone can pick their own traits because each person is unique. People are different in how they act and behave. Some people are shy, while others like to talk and meet new people. For instance, young kids often feel shy around strangers. Parents usually don't like it when their kids are shy because they complain and don't want to talk to others. But at home, these same kids can be very lively and have a lot of fun. As kids get older, they start to be less shy. They talk more and make friends. Kids learn good behavior from their parents. At home, parents teach them to be polite, like saying 'please' and 'thank you,' to greet others, and to share. Parents want their kids to be kind, but sometimes kids don't listen. A kid might fight over toys instead of sharing. This might happen because they are young or going through a certain phase. When kids get older, they act in new ways. They learn and start to see things differently. They go from acting like kids to acting more grown-up, like teenagers. Teenagers often want to do things by themselves. They might not always listen to their parents. They make their own choices and decide how they want to live. For example, they might want to drive alone or wear the clothes they like. In the end, people pick their own traits no matter their age, how they were brought up, or what they were taught. Our traits are not just made by things we can't control. We decide how to behave, what to do, and what not to do. People can change over time but still pick their own traits. We don't have to act like the people around us."}
{"text_id": "B16454E74A66", "output_essay": "Is it better to finish high school in three years instead of four? In this essay, I will say that finishing high school in three years is better and easier. You get an extra year to do something that can help you later on. We don't all have to be the smartest. To reach our goals, we just need to work hard and want it enough.\n\nFirst, an extra year means you can work harder. You can start working a lot. Then you will have money for college in the future. Your parents won't have to worry about whether you go to college. They also won't have to worry about having enough money to help you save for your things. College is very expensive and takes a lot of work.\n\nSecond, starting school with good grades makes everything turn out well. Students can join the military or go to college a year early. Doing things when you are young is better. Young people usually don't have many responsibilities at home. So, they don't have much to worry about. They just need to know that school is most important.\n\nThird, I once knew a boy in Brazil named Generic_Name. He was very poor and sometimes didn't have food for his brothers and sisters. But he was smart and had big dreams. He wanted to make a lot of money and buy his sick mother a house. She had cancer and couldn't work. She felt bad because her older son had to work to feed the family. Generic_Name said, \"I am going to be someone incredible in life, I will succeed.\" That gave him the energy to work hard and finish high school a year early. Family can make us thankful people.\n\nSome people think finishing high school in three years is the same as four years. But they are wrong. If you finish early, it's because you worked hard for good grades. It's not the same. In the end, try to do all you can. Then no one can tell you what to do. Keep moving forward for better results. Not trying won't make us successful."}

In my opinion, you can change the impression based on what you do or want to do. So, what you do at your job, in high school, and with your family can change the impression people have of you.\n\nFirst, I think that when I reach my dreams, people's views of me can change. For example, when I finish high school, my mom will have the biggest change in how she sees me. So, by achieving my dreams, people's views of me can change.\n\nSecond, I think that if I stay positive, I can change things in my life, and these changes will be the main thing people notice about me. For example, if I work out and get in shape, that will be the best thing people see. Also, if you stay positive, you can go after what you want.\n\nThird, some things never change how people see you. For example, when I had to move to the U.S.A. and leave my sisters back home, it was a very sad time. Sometimes I think about how I felt when I left my sisters, and it was so sad. These are things that I know won't change in my life.\n\nIn conclusion, some impressions are very hard to change. When you reach your goals or dreams, those impressions become very important.

{"text_id": "B3B472695BE1", "output_essay": "Why do people think that having problems is bad? I think that facing a problem is a chance for you to get up and try a different way. When you have a problem, you can learn from what you did wrong. You can also see what did not work and ask for help from someone who has done well, to find a better way to help you. You can also watch and think about what people who have done well before did. Learning from your mistakes by watching people who have done well is not bad. It's a chance to start over, knowing that the way you tried before did not work. You also know what to do differently before you try again. For example, you might have a hard project. You need to keep trying, even if you make mistakes, to really understand it. If you mess up in a relationship, it does not mean you have to end it. You can fix the problems, try to get better, and learn from what happened. At some point, you will face a hard time that makes you try over and over. This is a time to think and decide how to do better than before. When you have a problem, you should not worry by yourself; ask for help from someone who has had the same problem. Their advice can be very helpful. For example, scientists make mistakes but keep trying until they get good results. Math teachers may have hard questions, but they keep working on them until they get the right answer. We all have problems every day, but we do not give up. We keep going until we fix the problem, no matter how long it takes. When you have a problem, it's your chance to do well by asking for help and learning from your mistakes. Often, when students work on a project from their teachers, they may not be sure if they are doing it right. How can you know if you are on the right path if you have not asked the teacher or someone who has done well? I agree that a problem is a chance to do well because it lets you ask for help from friends or to learn from your mistakes and watch others. It's important to talk to a friend or someone you trust about your hard times and how they can help and make you feel better. By not making the same mistakes, you can learn and find answers to your problems."}

People who are not very confident often feel shy and nervous around 'good-looking guys or pretty girls' or feel better around 'less good-looking guys or not pretty girls.' Sadly, we live in a world that tells us how we should act or what we should do to fit in. Over the past few years, we've been stuck in a loop. This means we always do what others think is best for us. We also act differently around people we think are great or better than us. Why do we always do what others think is right? It's become normal. Some people are scared to tell their parents they don't like the opposite sex. People from poorer backgrounds don't want to say their parents work in construction or clean bathrooms. Why does this happen? Is it because we live in a world where we have to act a certain way to be liked? It's funny but true, we've all felt ashamed or afraid to say or do things not because they're bad, but because 'it's not the right thing to say, what will others think?'. Why do some people still think they're less important or put others above themselves? A guy who thinks he's not good-looking won't talk to a pretty girl. Do you know why? It's because of the word 'pretty'; he sees himself as less important and many thoughts fill his head. I feel sad about this, but it's the harsh world we live in; we're afraid to be rejected or just 'be ourselves'.

I remember when I was in a bad mood and went to school; I talked back to the teacher and was disrespectful, which got me suspended. That happened because I was rude. Since then, I always start my day in a good mood. Please do the same—it's not worth fighting or arguing. Just be happy and don't let anyone spoil your day. Being positive can help you get more chances in life, like getting a job, moving up in your career, or making new friends when you get coffee at Starbucks. A good mood might help you find a new partner and make your life better. You could start a YouTube channel to tell everyone how good it is to be positive and not mean.

{"text_id": "47D079795DB3", "output_essay": "I don't agree with Michelangelo's idea because it's not just about aiming too high and missing, or aiming too low and hitting the target. It's about how a person thinks and plans to reach their goals. Some people find that setting a goal and working towards it always helps them. I think this is true because it has worked for me before, and I felt happy when I reached my goal. Not everyone who aims low will hit their target. Some may aim high and still get what they want. It's all about what's in their mind. If you want something, you must believe in yourself and work hard to get it. Just sitting around won't help you succeed; you need to take action and give it your all. Not everyone who aims low will reach their goal. I've always aimed high and still got what I wanted. It's all about what a person wants to do. My grandma used to tell me to focus on what I want and go for it, even when it's tough. I still remember her words whenever I want something. People can aim high and still succeed. Once, in a competition, I was last. I told myself to focus and I could be first. When I really focused on winning, I passed everyone and won. It's about setting your mind on a goal and then reaching it. If you want to achieve something, believe you can do it. People say that if you focus on something, you can reach your goal by working hard. If you're stuck, just concentrate and you'll get there. In conclusion, not everyone who aims low will succeed. Some may aim high and still get what they want. It's all about believing in yourself and working towards your goal. But sometimes, people aim too low and still succeed. I've done it before, and so have my friends and family. It's partly luck when you aim low and still reach your goal. Aiming too low might work, but it's a 50/50 chance. However, aiming too high can sometimes mean you don't make it."}

He once told us about getting a nail in his foot. He still has a mark from it, and it's ugly. I believe it's useful to learn from what others have gone through. It can make you wiser. For instance, at school, your teacher knows a lot about the subject they teach. They can tell you about what they know. Sharing what we've done with others is also good because it encourages us to do more. I learned to ride a bike from a friend who had been biking for three years. He knew a lot about it.

We have to write seven prompts every day. Each prompt has five paragraphs. We must finish them all. Getting my phone made me a faster typer. The keyboard is the same on phones and computers. This makes my work easier. New phone users struggle with the keyboard at first. It's hard to find the keys on a new phone. But it gets easier over time. I had trouble when I first got my phone. I had never used one before. But after five years, I can type without looking. This skill helps me finish schoolwork quickly. I will use it in the future for work or other tasks. It's a useful skill for me and others. Typing is easy to learn with practice. My mom gets annoyed by the sound of my fast typing. While others may have different skills, I believe everyone should learn to type. It's useful for important tasks. I enjoy typing, even though it can make my back and neck hurt. It's easier than writing on paper. Computers help with spelling, which is harder on paper."}
{"text_id": "89E2F67589C1", "output_essay": "Do you think that three years of school is enough to learn everything? I believe high school should last three years. Students should be able to graduate after three years because they have to go to summer school, night classes, or they might not get to choose extra classes they want to take. A three-year high school plan means teenagers don't get free time. They can't take extra classes they like. They must stick to the main subjects. This makes them stressed and stops them from doing their best. They also don't get to do volunteer work or join clubs like other students. This could make it hard for them to get into a good college. They might lose friends and not use social media because they're too busy with school. If high school is only three years, students will have to take classes in the summer and at night. They won't have a real summer break. They'll be busy all year without rest. They'll be stressed. To go to night classes, they need to find a way to get there. If they drive, they'll spend more on gas. Paying teachers for extra hours will cost more too. Some teachers might not want to work longer. This could mean hiring new teachers. Making high school three years could cost a lot and make life harder for students. Some students can't finish four years of high school. Maybe they don't have all the credits or test scores they need. But having only three years of school might seem good, it's still as much work as four years. Since four years is easier and more common, it's the better choice."}

Or they might pretend to be someone else to get you to like them. They often don't get a second chance to fix their mistakes when they meet you for the first time. For example, imagine you're going to meet your girlfriend's parents. You drive to her house, telling yourself to stay calm. But it's normal to feel nervous because you don't know what her parents are like. You might decide to act tough to impress them. But it's not good to pretend to be someone you're not. It only hurts you. When you arrive, you should shake her dad's hand and say hello. Boys often get nervous and might stutter. That's okay. They just want to make a good first impression because they care about their girlfriends. They want to get along with her parents. But parents sometimes judge too quickly based on clothes or behavior. They should take time to know the person. He might be very nice. The main point is not to judge someone on the first meeting. If you do, you might miss out on knowing who they really are. They could even become part of your family. Parents often think they're always right. And they can be. But they can also be wrong, especially when they judge their children's friends too quickly. They should try to know these friends better. They might be great people.

{"text_id": "0CE342F791B1", "output_essay": "\"'Be Yourself'\"\n\nBeing yourself is very important for everyone's life path. Some people think hiding who you are can change your life. But really, being yourself lets you show off your skills and be more creative. It's the best way to share what you know, say what you think, and be confident.\n\nFirst, when people use what they know at work or school, they can move up in life. For example, smart students can get a scholarship from the government. This is big because it gives them a reason to work hard every day. It also helps them get jobs and make more money. Smart people often do well at work.\n\nSecond, saying what you think can shape the next few years. For instance, at 18, you can vote and help decide what's best for the country. This is key for America's future. Also, you can do small things to help everyone. Some blame the government for many shootings at schools or in public. That's why many want to change gun laws in the country. This could mean fewer shootings and deaths from guns in America.\n\nThird, if you've never failed, you haven't tried enough. You need to trust yourself and aim for new things. Sometimes, you have to take chances to reach your dreams. This might mean working extra or students getting more help after school. This matters because it makes people proud. You should also be confident, help others, respect them, and be honest. It's hard to be alone or when things aren't going well. A better environment comes from this.\n\nLastly, being yourself is the best way to show your talent, share your views, and show the world what you're made of. Some think not being yourself is bad for your life path. But really, being yourself means sharing all you know. Be yourself, have fun, and enjoy all the great things life has."}

This is because for many, it's their first job. They haven't worked before. So, they can't have experience. Businesses should first look for someone eager to work. They should be responsible, honest, and hardworking. Some people have experience but are not good workers. They don't enjoy their work or aren't responsible. Employers can watch a new worker for a while to see if they do a good job. You can't tell if someone has talent if they haven't tried. Or if no one lets them try. While learning, a new worker could have a boss who guides them and checks their work. Many people want jobs but can't get them because they lack experience. Employers always want experienced people. But I think they should really look for responsibility in new workers. If someone is responsible, on time, and honest, they can be great at their job. Some experienced people are not responsible. They come late and don't do their work well. Some can't try new jobs because employers won't hire them without experience. But many are excellent workers without experience. When they want to work, they pick things up quickly. Employers could have another worker show them what to do. Most people work well and learn quickly. I think employers should give a chance to those without experience. They should watch them for a while to see how they do. If they are responsible and honest, they could be good workers. This way, more people could get jobs. It helps both the employer and the worker. Some people have experience but don't take their jobs seriously. Employers don't want that."}

People should pay attention to what matters most because they need to work hard and keep practicing. One should not quit too soon without trying their best in life and for their future.\n\nThe first reason is that a person needs to work at something to get used to it and do well at their job. For example, Generic_Name was a kid who worked in the summer. He worked at a tech company. His first day was tough because he didn't know the computer program or how to code. But after a few weeks, he began to understand the program and got better with the tech. He improved every week and thought about how to get even better.\n\nThe second reason is that a person needs to think about their life goal. For instance, Generic_Name was unsure about his future. He decided to set a goal as he thought about what to do next. He was smart, but he didn't know much about life until he worked on getting good grades. He also wanted to go to college for a better life. He dreamed of working at a business company. After learning about the company, he became the new boss.\n\nThe third reason is that a person must practice to succeed in life. For example, Generic_Name wanted to join a video game contest, but he wasn't good at games, so he practiced for the contest. After a week, he asked a friend for advice. The friend told him to practice the basics first. He worked hard for the contest, didn't quit, and won the last game.\n\nFinally, Thomas Jefferson said, 'Decide never to be lazy... it's amazing what can be done if we're always working.' If you need to do something, you should start right away. Also, people should know that practicing makes you better, and they can do great things. If you try and don't quit, you won't have regrets in life."}

I would like to learn from home so I don't have to rush my work. If I have housework, I can just do it after.\n\nAlso, learning from home means you won't have to put up with noisy classmates. They can make it hard to hear the teacher. At home, it's quiet. No one will disturb you. You can focus on your work. You might finish your work quicker and have more time to relax.\n\nThis is why I think learning from home is good for students! It would also keep teachers from talking too much. Sometimes they talk so much that students fall asleep.\n\nI really believe schools should let us learn from home more. You might even finish school early, get your diploma, start a job, earn money, and do something great with your life. You never know.\""}

Even a simple thing like picking up books can make them feel good. Another example is when someone is made fun of for their skin color.

Lastly, if someone is having a tough day, you can make a difference by talking to them. Ask them about their home or school. Share happy memories. This can make them smile.

If others always guide you, you might find it hard to know what is good or bad or how to do things alone. You might start to think less of yourself. Also, you won't know how to solve your own problems.\n\nI think people who always follow others have more problems. They have problems because experts and leaders do everything for them, and they don't try to do things alone. Some people struggle at work because they don't get it. For example, if someone always saves you from trouble, you'll keep making the same mistakes. You won't care. This means someone is helping you, but they shouldn't because you're not learning.\n\nAlso, I think this is why people can't tell right from wrong. They've been saved so many times that they've lost track. Sometimes, those who lead can lead you the wrong way, and you might make bad choices. If you're always led, you won't know how to make it on your own and will get lost. For example, choosing between going to work or staying home is easy if you decide for yourself. But it's hard if you don't make your own choices.\n\nThis is another reason they lose self-respect. When others solve their problems and do things for them, they start to feel helpless. They feel worthless. They stop trying because they think someone else will do it. For example, if a teacher gives you the answers, you won't want to try because the teacher makes it too easy. You see no point in trying. This can make you lazy.\n\nSo, people who choose for themselves won't have these problems. They won't be confused about what they're doing, what's right or wrong, or feel bad about themselves. They won't know how to fix their own problems. They will learn from their mistakes and do better in life. They will benefit from making their own choices."}

It helps you learn more about what you want to do later, you can get help from teachers, and you can join clubs and other activities. These four years will really help you later on.\n\nFirst, learning more about what you want to do after high school is key. High schools often let you try things during or after school. This is a good way to get experience in what interests you. In your last year, you can check out colleges. This helps you get ready for what comes next.\n\nSecond, you can get help from teachers or other school workers during high school. If you're doing poorly in a class or need help with anything, just ask. It's important to get help when you need it. If you don't, it could hurt your future. Teachers can help you after school if you're having trouble. Always ask for help when you need it.\n\nLastly, you can do extra things in high school, like join clubs or do activities after school. Being in a club can help you figure out what you like and might want to do later. Doing things like community events after school is good for the community and looks good for you too. If you like sports, going to games can give you more experience. So, doing things after school is good for you.\n\nIn summary, finishing high school is important.

Every day, some teenagers die because they harm themselves. They feel alone and think no one is there to help. There are mean people in the world. There are bad people who are not nice. We don't need people who make us feel bad or sad. Some people do not help others who need it. They should be nicer, but they were taught to be mean by their families. Some people can't stop the bad feelings inside. But many people are nice and will help those who need it. Did you know that 95% of teens get help from grown-ups? Grown-ups are wise and can handle tough situations. Some may not help because they don't know how to be kind. But help is not just for those who are in trouble. Imagine if you met a homeless person who needed five dollars and you felt sorry for him. If you had five dollars, you could help. That's what we need more of in our lives.

When you face a problem, your brain learns how to fix it. You won't find it hard the next time. Another way is that solving problems helps you succeed in life. You move past one problem and go to the next. You show people you can do hard work. The third reason I will talk about is that problems help you do better in the future. A problem is a good way to show your skills for these reasons. Let's talk about learning first. When you see something new or a problem, your brain starts to learn. If you see it again, you will know it. As you learn, you start slow and then get faster because your brain knows what to do. You learn new things and skills. You also show others what you have learned. You see other people's skills and learn from them. This helps you with other problems and makes you do better in life. Learning makes your brain stronger and smarter. This helps you do many things and have a good life. The second reason is doing well in life. When you show your skills, you can find jobs or other things you like. Bosses will see your skills and know how you can help them. If you have the right skills, hard things won't be hard for you. If you get a job and show your skills, you might get a better job and earn more money. You can also help others with your skills. When you do well, you can talk about what you have done. You learn new skills and get better at the ones you have. This is why you should always try your best at work or at home. It helps you later in life and your brain learns more. The last reason is doing harder things in the future. When you do hard things, they get easier because your brain knows what to do. You start to do even harder things that need more skills. It won't be easy, but you will know what to do. You learn new things and skills. You help others with their problems. Hard things become easy because you keep doing them and learning. Bosses will notice you and see how you can help their company. Hard work helps you in life. For example, if your tire pops, you can fix it fast because you've practiced. Your brain works fast because of your skills. These are the reasons why a problem is a good way to show your skills. Learning, doing well in life, and doing harder things are all important. They help you think and react fast. They show your skills and why you try hard in everything. If you make a mistake, you have to fix it. But if you try your best, you have a good chance of doing well. I hope you agree with me. Show people what you can do. Try your best with problems so you can get good jobs and succeed in life."}

They will feel too much pressure because there are so many job choices. Students will start to ignore their schoolwork as they try to pick a career that seems good for them right now. They don't see the problems this can cause.\n\nAnother reason why students should not pick a career in high school is that there are many different jobs out there. Some are good, and some are not right for everyone. A girl might want to work in building things, and a boy might want to work in making clothes, but schools may not listen. Most regular schools don't pay attention to what students want and make them take classes for jobs they don't like. Most students are not ready for this big decision. My last point is that students should not be pushed by teachers and grown-ups to pick a career so young. They are still kids. How can a student enjoy high school, play sports, or have fun in after-school clubs if they have to start thinking about a career so soon? But, it is also true that finding a career you love when you are young can make life easier."}

Curfews help keep teenagers safe. This is because many of them are out on the streets. They get distracted and do things like go to parties or use illegal drugs. I think having a curfew is a good idea. It can stop teenagers from getting into trouble. Sometimes teenagers at a party might think, 'What am I doing here? Why am I doing things that could get me into trouble?' They could end up in jail, have problems, or even die. It's sad to see teenagers mess up their lives. But if a teenager wants to focus on his life and stay away from bad things, it's important. By having a curfew, teenagers can pay attention to their lives and school. This will help them behave better and improve their lives a lot. As you get older, you think about the mistakes you've made. Having a curfew on weekdays and weekends keeps teenagers safe. It stops them from being influenced by bad things.\n\nIn conclusion, having a curfew on weekdays and weekends will help teenagers do better in life.

{"text_id": "2B63A9B12B5B", "output_essay": "Winston Churchill, a past leader of Britain, once said, \"Success is about moving from one failure to another without losing your excitement.\" I think he's right because trying to succeed always involves failing, and you can learn from those failures. Failing isn't always a bad thing; it can teach you what you did wrong. If you stop trying, you won't get anywhere, and you'll miss the chance to succeed.\n\nMy first reason is that people don't realize that if they quit after failing and don't try to fix their mistakes, they'll start quitting more easily the next time they fail. Quitting can also make a person go from being confident to being unsure of themselves. Even though some people think quitting is the best choice when it's hard to succeed, it can actually hurt your life.\n\nMy second reason is that learning from failures can make you better at understanding your mistakes. Learning from what went wrong not only makes you better but can also lead to new opportunities. Trying to succeed and failing is like learning to ride a bike. A kid gets a bike, tries to ride, falls and hurts his knee, cries, gets mad, but keeps trying to ride again and again until he can do it without falling.\n\nMy third and last reason is that people who keep trying after failing and then succeed are more likely to solve other problems later. Success can make you feel good and push you to do more. The more problems you solve, the better you get at it. Success can bring many good things, like a better job, a better way of thinking, or a new start. Quitting won't make you happy; it will just make you sad.\n\nTo conclude, I believe quitting should never be an option. People need to know that to succeed, they must go through failures and learn from them. Quitting won't help you succeed; it will just make your problems worse. No matter how often you fail, those who don't quit will always find better ways to fix their mistakes and learn from them to get better at solving problems."}

If not, they might hurt someone or themselves. Doing fun things can help them relax. They can spend time with friends or family to feel better. If they don't relax, they will stay upset and won't change. Changing a bad mood is hard. On the other hand, someone with a good mood will probably have a good future.

But, when they do this, many can't take extra classes they choose. If they want to start college or a job a year early, this is good for them. But, their high school learning might not cover everything. Finishing high school in three years has good and bad points.\n\nIf students plan to finish in three years, they can start college early, work and save money for college, take a year off before college, or start working early. For instance, some students work and study at the same time and get tired. Finishing early can help them. They can work for a year, take a break from school, and feel less stressed when they start college. This break can clear their minds and help them decide on their future.\n\nStill, taking all needed classes in three years can stress them out, especially if they work too. A break can help, but the stress before might affect them. Also, missing out on extra classes they choose could hurt their learning. What if their college major needs classes they missed? They might have to pay more or work harder in college to reach their goals.\n\nBased on the points made, I think students should finish high school in three years. Even if it's stressful, a year off can really help them and their choices for the future. If I were a student with this chance, I would go for it. I would work hard and do what's needed to reach my goal. We know that to get our dreams or goals, we have to make sacrifices, give our best, work hard, and never quit. Working hard for three years, taking a break, and then going back to our goals is a smart way to plan our lives."}

Take this example: if you break a jar of honey and tell your mom it was you, she will be upset because she has to clean it up. But if you find someone's credit card and return it, that's a good thing because it doesn't belong to you. I personally believe that being honest is very important. Lying is wrong, and sometimes you can even end up in jail for it. But when you're honest, you can get rewards. For instance, the police offer money for information when they're looking for someone. Some people think honesty is bad because it can hurt others. But honesty is useful in many ways. You need to be honest when you're getting a job, especially during the interview. Your honesty shapes who you are. If you're honest, you're seen as a good person. But if you lie, people might think you're not good. Being honest is better because then people can trust you, unlike those who lie."}

There are many choices in life, but if others decide for us, we can't have our own way of being. This isn't right because everyone should be free to do good things that help us reach our goals.\n\nSecond, being myself makes me feel free. I think this leads to a better life because I like doing good things, such as finishing school, which is one of my goals. It's important for me to become a better person and help people who need it. Not everyone wants to help for good reasons; some have hidden reasons. So, we learn not to trust everyone. They might not always mean well.\n\nThird, if we are free, the world can be different because everyone can make their own choices and be themselves. Also, when we are not under pressure, we can think more clearly before we do anything. If we have time, we can think about how our choices might change our lives. People think in different ways, and sometimes they are wrong. That's why we must decide for ourselves what is best to support our own way of being.\n\nIn conclusion, thank you for the great idea of being ourselves in this wonderful world. I believe being ourselves will help us be amazing people because I am sure we will make good choices in our lives. It's great for us to have good lives now and in the future too.\n\nSincerely,\n\nGeneric_Name"}

So, we work hard to copy them until we either succeed or give up. Did you know that in the U.S., there are more famous people than poor people? \n\nPeople think we choose our qualities because we are all different. We all have our own thoughts and qualities. For instance, I am very different from my mom; she gets upset easily and yells a lot. I am the opposite; I am quiet and don't like to yell. Sometimes we change when we learn a lesson or something big happens. Like how my mom changed after she and my dad split up. She is much calmer now and doesn't get upset easily. \n\nThe people we admire influence our qualities, and we do our best to imitate them. For example, I look up to my dad because he never gets upset. Since I moved to the U.S., he has never yelled at me, even when I've made big mistakes. Once, I was playing a game on my PS4 and got so upset that I broke my controller. My dad just watched and told me to calm down. He didn't get mad. Another dad might have punished me for breaking the controller. \n\nWe are motivated by famous people because they are well-known and do good things. Everyone has thought about being famous at some point. Some famous people help those who are less fortunate.

This is why people act nice and polite when they meet someone for the first time.\n\nFirst, I want to say that people are very careful when they meet someone new. They know it's hard, or even impossible, to change the first impression. For example, when I met my friend Generic_Name, I thought he was mean and rude. But I was wrong. He is actually very polite and respectful. Even though I know he is a good person, I can't forget how he acted when we first met. That's how I'll remember him.\n\nNext, I think how a person behaves also makes an impression. Like when a classmate was late to our group talk. I thought, 'I don't want to work with someone who is not on time; he seems careless.' Later, I learned he was late because he missed his bus stop and had to walk. I now know he is responsible and focused on his work. But I will still remember him as the one who was late. That's why I think people are careful with what they say and do when they first meet someone.\n\nSome might say that the first impression isn't very important. You shouldn't judge a book by its cover, they say. I agree, but you do remember the book by its cover. That's why I'm careful with my words and actions.

Second, thinking positively usually leads to good things happening. But some people don't agree. They say that even if you are positive, bad things can still happen.

The day before, everyone was very excited. But then, the release was put off for more than five days. This made people upset, sad, and some even stopped playing the game. This shows how the delay let people down. Another story is about my grandfather. He is very kind and not selfish. He tells me and my cousins about his young days. He worked hard for his family and went to school at the same time. Even though he didn't have much time for homework, he stayed positive. He believed he could have a better future. Now, he is a good man. His life is better, and his two daughters and three sons help him. They are not rich, but they live well because they work hard. This is just like how he worked for his parents. People should stay positive because it can lead to good things. There is a saying, 'Good things come to those who wait.' It means being patient and positive is important for success. But some people don't believe this because they have had bad experiences. They used to be hopeful but lost hope when things didn't go well. They gave up too soon. It's important to know that life doesn't always give us what we want right away. But if we are patient and stay positive, better chances can come. For instance, some people who lost their parents and had to take care of themselves still try for a better life by staying positive.

{"text_id": "0582CA46C6C9", "output_essay": "Hello, my name is Generic_Name. I don't agree that first impressions are almost impossible to change. I believe we can change many things in our lives if we find the right way to improve. Everyone lives their life differently. Some people care a lot about their looks and themselves. But no one is perfect, and we all make mistakes. These mistakes can make us feel like we can't be better. But that's not true. Here are some reasons why I disagree and how we can change a first impression if we mess up.\n\nFirst, imagine you're a student who always gets bad grades. Your teacher keeps telling you to pay attention but then stops. If you decide to change and learn how to be a good student, you can get really good grades and feel good about yourself. You need to listen in class, do your homework, and ask for help if you're confused. Your teacher will see you're trying hard, and you'll be proud that you changed what she thought of you.\n\nSecond, if you're new at a school and you don't talk to anyone, people might think you don't like them. You can change this. Join groups like sports, theater, or dance to meet people. This shows you do like them and want to make friends.\n\nThird, if you're young and working, but your coworkers think you're too young to work well, you can prove them wrong. Show them that you can do anything you want. Being young doesn't limit what you can do.\n\nFirst impressions can be changed, anytime, no matter what. You can be a better person anywhere.

He felt dumb because he could not understand what the teacher was saying. But he did not stop trying. He worked hard in school and got better at math. Now he is a math teacher. He tells me to never stop trying and to believe in myself.\n\nSecond, I want to say that success is hard to achieve. If we want to succeed, we must expect many hard times. But if we stay hopeful and positive, we will make it one day. If we do well, we can show others how to keep going. We might inspire someone. For instance, I failed my driving test two times. But I did not quit. I knew getting my license would be hard. After lessons and practice with my parents, I passed on my third try. I was very happy and proud that I kept trying.\n\nThird, I want to say that failure teaches us important things we will always remember.\n\nThese experiences are good for us. We can share them and encourage people who quit too soon or think they can't succeed after one failure. We should never stop trying. Success won't come to us; we have to go after it. We need success; it doesn't need us.\n\nIn conclusion, I agree that success is about not giving up, even when we fail. First, because quitters don't succeed. Second, because success is not easy.

{"text_id": "ACACA780CD37", "output_essay": "I think that working in a group is a good way to finish work faster and more easily than doing it by yourself. But sometimes it can cause problems. For example, if there are four people in a group and only one or two are really working, then the work won't get done as well as if everyone was helping. Even so, I still think group work is good. If there are four or more things to do, each person can do one thing. Or if there are more things to do, two people can work on each thing together. This is why I think groups help us finish things faster. \n\nWorking alone can also be a good way to get things done because you can do it just how you like and at your own speed. But there are downsides to working alone. You might get distracted and not move forward with the work, or you might not do it at all. Still, I think people can finish their work alone if they don't get distracted and keep their focus. Also, when you work alone, you don't have to wait for others. These are my thoughts on working by yourself. \n\nWhether people work in groups or alone, they can finish their work in their own way. It all depends on how much they want to work and get things done. If they stay away from distractions and want to work, they can get their work done on time. I think that people in a group can finish faster because there are more people to do the work. But those who work alone might take longer because they don't have help. So, I think working in a group is better because you can finish faster than working alone. \n\nIn conclusion, I think working in a group is much better than working alone. There are more people to help with the work, and group members can finish faster. People working alone don't have this help and may take more time. In groups, people can share the work, and everyone has their own part to do. This makes finishing work much faster.

That takes up my whole day. Many others feel the same.\n\nThe biggest reason is personal time. When can students relax or enjoy their hobbies? With these activities, there's no time left.

But they can't because they have a lot of work like homework, quizzes, and tests. They study late until they understand everything, sometimes until after midnight. Online classes let students record the lessons, which they can't do at school.

You know your goals and can reach them. Everyone has dreams and can make their life better. A good attitude is the secret to success. It's all about how you think. If you believe in your work, you can get a great job. It's great to see that anyone can reach their goals. You don't need to be rich or famous to do a lot. In the end, a good attitude is enough. Never stop trying and stay positive. If someone doesn't like your work, it's okay. With a positive mind, you can do more than you think. Some people don't get the same chances but still do their best."}

Playing different sports and keeping my grades high will give me more chances to do well. I will have more options and won't have to work too hard to be successful later on. For instance, I once met a girl named Generic_Name. She told me that she joined many clubs and played sports like track, volleyball, and basketball in middle and high school. This helped her get the credits she needed to graduate. Without focusing on school and joining clubs, she wouldn't have had enough credits. Everyone needs to make sure they have enough credits to graduate. This makes it easier to get a job and be successful. Generic_Name had to keep her grades up to play sports. If she didn't, she couldn't join clubs or sports. This would have made it harder for her to get credits and graduate. It would also make finding a job tougher. We should focus on what we need over what we want to succeed without too much trouble. But we should also chase what we want. I also want to learn to play other band instruments because it's fun. You get to try new things. When I was in 6th grade, I was in a band. I played the trumpet. We went on trips and played in different places. It was fun, but I had to practice a lot to play the right notes at concerts."}

Many students might not have time for these activities because they need to help at home. They might need to carry heavy things, go shopping for clothes, wash those clothes, and more. They may also need to look after their brothers, sisters, or grandparents. Some might need to stay late at school to catch up on missed work. Students often get a lot of homework, which they have to finish on time. Those in harder classes may have even more homework. Some homework can be tough and take a long time to understand and do. So, they might stay up late to get their homework done, missing out on sleep they need. In the end, students may be too busy with home duties or homework to do after-school activities.

{"text_id": "BFA6508E8DB2", "output_essay": "When you were in school, did you ever wish for someone older and smart to guide you? Someone to give you advice when you needed it? Someone who wouldn't laugh at you when you had a problem? Someone who could listen? Someone close to your age who could get you and have the same issues? I did. In 6th grade, I had no one to help me with schoolwork except the teacher. I struggled with English and had no one to turn to for help. No one seemed to understand me. I wanted a peer to help, someone who had faced what I was facing, but I was alone. An older student, who has been through it all, could be that wise helper who gets you and shows kindness. They could help you face the future and tough challenges. It's good to have someone who has already been through your grade to help you. Older students helping younger ones is good for many reasons. They have more experience, they can learn from each other, and they can help each other with problems. It's good for both sides. Older students can be more supportive because they know more. They've been where you are. A junior or senior helping a freshman or sophomore would be good, right? They have the experience. Younger students could learn what they need for the future, which classes to take for their career, and how to pass them. They could also learn about future classes and subjects. If they're unsure about their career, older students could give career advice. But older students benefit too. They can learn how younger students act and find ways to help them without causing problems. Learning from each other is better than just one learning from the other. A younger student can learn a lot from an older one, especially in tough subjects like math. If a teacher or classmate can't help, an older student might. They've probably been confused before too. And sometimes, a younger student might know about a subject an older student doesn't. They can help each other. Like in middle school, you might take classes that continue in high school. If a younger student has taken that class, they can give advice to an older student who's taking it now, and vice versa. I think getting help from someone close to your age who's been in your shoes can be really helpful. Eventually, younger students will become the older ones. They'll need to learn how to help the next group of younger students. They'll have to remember what their older peers taught them. They'll need to pay attention to how they acted and behaved. They'll have to follow their older peers' example and give advice on classes and more. They'll still learn from their older peers. Having an older, wiser person to help is great, like a senior helping a freshman. They're different but can still get along and learn from each other. They can talk about the future, attitudes, and give advice. Older students will learn about the younger ones and see how things have changed over time. Younger students need to learn from them to avoid trouble and get ready for a tough future. Older students helping younger ones is good for both. I wish I had this help in school. Even though older students can learn from younger ones, the younger ones learn more from the older ones. They both help each other."}

The first reason is that if I were homeschooled and stuck on a question, I wouldn't get it. This is because the internet doesn't really teach me. I would just look up the answer and copy it. Another reason not to homeschool is what if a student can't do a math problem? They would need a teacher's help, not just a video. I would rather ask a teacher. The third reason is that homeschoolers spend 2 or 3 hours on the computer for each lesson. This is bad for our brains. They aren't really learning. All students should go to a real school, not homeschool. This is because they don't learn from a computer. They need a real teacher's help.

{"text_id": "9130571B0792", "output_essay": "There was a great artist named Michelangelo. He did many amazing things for the art world. He once said, \"The greater danger for most of us is not aiming too high and missing, but aiming too low and hitting our target.\" Do you agree with this? I do. The quote means that if you don't try your hardest but still reach your goal, you're fooling yourself by not doing your best. But that's not the only reason I agree with Michelangelo. I'll give you three examples to show why I think he's right.\n\nMy first example is about trying out for a soccer team. In ninth grade, we had tryouts. I was excited but not prepared. I went to the field and followed the coaches' directions. The tryouts lasted three days. I tried but made mistakes because I hadn't practiced. In the end, I didn't make the team. After that school year, I practiced all summer. When tenth grade started, I was ready for the tryouts in March. This time, after the three days, I made the team because I aimed high, just like Michelangelo said.\n\nThe second example is about a math final in eighth grade. I wasn't ready and guessed on the whole test because I chose not to study. I got my results and had just enough points to retake it. I used this chance to study hard. On the day of the retake, I did well and felt good about it. Later, I got a score of 478. I was proud of my hard work. I aimed high and didn't miss, just as Michelangelo said.\n\nMy last example is about a soccer game. I love Real Madrid. In 2010, they lost in the semifinals. It was sad, but it led to changes. The team president brought in new players and a manager. With the new team, we started winning. We made it to the semifinals again and won 4-1, a big improvement from the previous 2-1 loss. This win took us to the finals. We played well, especially in the first half. The team had aimed for better and it showed.\n\nIn conclusion, I strongly agree with Michelangelo's quote. I gave three reasons why you should too. First, with my soccer tryouts, I failed without practice but then succeeded with hard work. Next, with my math final, I failed without studying but then passed with a high score after working hard. Lastly, my favorite soccer team lost but then won with new players and better practice. They aimed high and it paid off. Michelangelo was right. Aiming too low and hitting the target is not as good as aiming high, even if you miss. Thank you for reading my essay. Goodbye."}

But it can also make people feel bad. Telling the truth is important, especially with the police or in court. It's a good way to show who you are. In court, people should tell the truth. This is also true for police work. But always being honest can hurt feelings. For example, if you tell someone their new haircut isn't nice, they might feel sad. Or if you say someone's clothes don't look good, they might be upset. But that's what being honest is about. In other cases, it's very important to be honest when sharing your thoughts or opinions. Can we be honest without making others feel bad? Yes, we can. One way is to stay calm and choose your words carefully. For instance, if a friend is upset, you can wait for the right moment to speak honestly. This can make your friend feel better. These are some ways to be honest without upsetting others."}

Should we decide things for ourselves, or should we ask for advice from experts on big issues in life? We should trust ourselves, make our own choices, and also ask experts for advice on big issues. This is because we won't always have others to help us, and we must ask experts about big issues. Everyone is unique and should choose for themselves, thinking about whether to trust themselves or ask experts about big life issues. Sometimes, people forget the importance of self-reliance and what matters in life, and we only live once. As some people grow old, they may not be as strong as before. For example, older people who didn't trust themselves and made bad choices, or didn't ask experts for advice, may regret what they should have done. We can encourage others to trust themselves and to get advice from experts so they don't make bad choices. Also, they should listen to their own gut feelings and ideas. Why? We should trust our gut feelings and ideas when working or doing something we like, such as creating a new product or making a business choice. If we don't make smart choices, trust ourselves, or ask experts for advice, then others might think it's okay to do the same, and they will regret it too. Everyone is equal but thinks differently about trusting themselves and asking experts for help to succeed. We shouldn't listen to people who didn't reach their goals. This is good advice because sometimes we don't believe in ourselves, think positively, and end up doing what others want, which isn't right. However, we should also ask for advice to learn how to trust ourselves, make smart choices, and make a difference, becoming leaders if we want. We should trust ourselves, but asking experts for help can guide us in life and help us trust our gut feelings and ideas, and choose wisely. Everyone needs help to encourage those who trust their own hard work and skills, as they need to listen to their gut feelings and ideas. People who trust their gut feelings and ideas can also succeed. If we don't trust ourselves, we won't be able to work and show others how to live successfully. Those who trust themselves see it as important to listen to their gut feelings or ideas. And deciding for ourselves or asking experts for advice is a personal choice. Everyone has the chance to make choices for their future. We all live once, and we are all different. But don't listen to people who made bad choices and didn't ask experts for advice; they regret it. Also, we should listen to our own gut feelings and ideas. Why? We should know our gut feelings and ideas when working or doing something we want, like making a unique product or a business choice. It's good to ask for advice, but not if we don't decide for ourselves; don't follow what others decide. We should decide for ourselves. We should understand self-reliance and how to succeed, and if we don't, others can help. If we are open to it, we can learn from those who know about self-reliance. If most people who trust themselves and ask experts for advice can succeed, others can also trust themselves to succeed and not give up on their dreams."}

You don't have to hurry. Bad weather can slow you down too. If it snows, you might need to warm up your car. If you walk, you might get too hot or too cold. Second, students don't have to go to school when they're sick. Schools say to stay home to stop germs from spreading. With online classes, you can still learn without making others sick. Missing school is hard because you fall behind. Online students are lucky. They can study from bed when they're ill. If they miss a test, they can take it later.

Running can make you feel like giving up, feel bad about yourself, and get so mad that you want to react badly if someone says you're not good. But winning races makes you very happy and proud of your hard work. Track can also cause pain and sleepless nights, making you wonder why this is happening to you.

'Students can benefit from taking classes at home.' Yes, it's helpful. For example, students who can't go to a regular high school in the morning. This could be girls who have to look after a baby or young men who work full-time to support their family. It's a great idea for those who want a high school diploma but can't go to school in the morning. In conclusion, some schools let students learn from home and give them online videos. Students can benefit from taking classes at home. I think learning from home is a great chance for students who can't go to school at the usual time. It lets them study from home."}
{"text_id": "60EAF2CDEB66", "output_essay": "In this essay, we will talk about curfews for teenagers. A city council is thinking about starting a 10 P.M. curfew on weekdays and a midnight curfew on weekends for teenagers. This means teenagers cannot be on the street after these times without breaking the law. People have different views on this curfew. Some believe it will keep teenagers from getting into trouble. But some teenagers still go missing or get hurt at night. They might hang out at places that are open late, like clubs or bars. There, they could be around alcohol and drugs, which can cause big problems and trouble.\n\nOthers think a curfew is not fair and limits young people's freedom. They say everyone should decide how to use their time. A curfew stops teenagers from doing simple things like getting chicken nuggets from McDonald's after 10 P.M. They compare this curfew to one in North Korea. They say it will make more people break the law.\n\nI believe curfews can help parents and teenagers stay safe and avoid trouble. Some teenagers face dangers at night like robbery, harm from strangers, or kidnapping. This can lead to more teens going missing and more accidents. But I also think the curfew law is too harsh. It cuts into teenagers' free time. While it makes them safer, there are other ways to protect them. For instance, we could have more police officers at night. They could patrol and act quickly to prevent accidents. We could make the curfew later, like 11 P.M. on weekdays and 1 A.M. on weekends. We can also teach teenagers and parents how to stay safe at night, what to watch out for, and how to defend themselves.\n\nIn conclusion, I think a curfew can help keep teenagers safe and out of trouble. But it's not the only way. It's very important to protect teenagers and everyone else at night when they are outside."}

We should pick them because we shape who we are, we make our own choices, and it helps us decide things.\n\nWe can always grow and shape who we are. We have the right to pick what we want. It doesn't matter if our character is good or bad, we can still change ourselves without others telling us what to do. Sometimes, what we see around us doesn't really help.\n\nI had to make choices on my own, without copying others. For me, it's better to make my own future because I picked it. I feel more ready, and I learned from it. Copying others doesn't always help us think about what we truly want.\n\nMy parents are old, and they can't work like before. I chose to help them. I go to school in the morning, and work in the afternoon. The work is hard, but it helps me decide what I want for my future.\n\nPicking our character traits makes us better. It shapes our future and makes us take charge. Some people think our character is made by things we can't control, but they're wrong. Not everything we do comes from other things around us. I hope in the future, people will keep picking their own character traits and not just be changed by other things."}

This is because you can feel at ease with yourself, reach your goals quicker than if you just followed the rules, and deal with other people's judgments. The writer said, \"Being true to yourself in a world that always wants to change you is the best thing you can do.\" Even if society has problems, you can still be what you want to be. \n\nWhen you are yourself in front of others, you might feel more at ease with them. Let's talk about nervousness. Many people feel it, and so do I. If you act naturally around others, you might stop feeling so nervous. For instance, when I met my girlfriend, she didn't talk much. She was silent because she was scared I would criticize her. But as we got to know each other, she became less anxious. Now we spend time together every day and share our feelings. Also, you can make more friends. It might be scary to be yourself, but it's different with friends than with strangers. With friends, being yourself is more enjoyable. They might like what you like. You won't know until you try to make friends. \n\nBeing yourself can also help you achieve your goals. Look at comedians. They are funny and make you laugh a lot. They didn't get funny by hiding who they are. They don't care about judgments. They just want to make people laugh. Comedians work hard to entertain others. They enjoy their own jokes and love making others laugh. Kevin Hart earns a lot of money by making people laugh. You might not get over your fears right away, but you won't improve if you don't show your true self. \n\nJudgment can cause a lot of problems. People might treat you badly or say mean things when you're not around. Judgment can lead to things that hurt our society. For example, some people don't understand me when I speak or write because of my grammar. They compare me to TV characters. But I don't let it bother me. Judgment can make you feel very sad or even worse. But I don't let what people say affect me. It's much better to stay with your friends and be yourself. \n\nBeing yourself can lead to many good things in life: feeling at ease with others, reaching your goals, or dealing with judgment. But none of this will happen if you don't stay true to yourself. As the writer said, \"Being true to yourself in a world that always wants to change you is the best thing you can do.\" You'll never know what could happen unless you are yourself. So be yourself and see what happens."}

She could have lived longer if she had eaten better. She didn't try to eat better and died from a heart attack. That's why I think schools should serve healthier food to make sure students eat right. \n\nSome say schools shouldn't change their menu to a healthy one because it might make students sick when they switch from regular to healthy food. Most students like junk food more than healthy food, so they might not want the change. They might not want to eat healthy or care about their eating habits; they just want to eat what tastes good to them. \n\nBut I think all schools should have a healthy menu. It will help students focus and listen better in their classes. Many students do care about their health, like football players who need to eat right. Cheerleaders also want to eat healthy to stay in shape so they can fit into their uniforms. Students who eat well don't get sick as much. \n\nAnother reason schools should serve different food at lunch is for students' health. This includes helping with their weight and growth. Sometimes, doctors tell students to eat lots of veggies and fruits because they have important vitamins. \n\nIn the end, I think all schools should start serving healthier food.

I believe our character is mostly shaped by things we can't control. Other people try to use us. They can make us angry, sad, or happy. In my life, people have tested my patience and also tried to make me feel better. I've seen many examples of how our character is shaped by others or by certain situations. Feelings like sadness, worry, overthinking, and joy can all push us to develop new parts of who we are.\n\nOur feelings can lead to new character traits. How we react to things or people shows a lot about us. Sometimes, I react to things I don't like, like when my dad asks me to do something I don't want to do. My reaction starts to form a new part of my character. But character traits can be positive too. For example, when I scored three goals in a soccer game, my family and friends cheered for me. Every new experience adds to who we are.\n\nFeelings and character traits are related but different. A feeling can lead to a character trait. A character trait is a part of you that lasts, while a feeling is temporary. For instance, feeling mad because someone took your book is different from always being careful with your books because someone might take them. A character trait stays with you. I think this happens because of influences we can't control."}

But staying at that job stopped my life from going bad. I believe we do more when we keep busy with work, helping out, and jobs.\n\nFirst, we do more because we work hard. Without work, we can't pay bills, take care of ourselves, or eat. None of this would happen. Some think work is easy. But it's really tough. I've seen people suffer from it. Like last week, I saw a man crying while working in the rain. I asked him why. He said he had no family or home. It showed me work can hurt. But he kept going. If we keep busy, the world gets better.\n\nSecond, we can help out to do more. We don't need money to help. I help my parents and school when they need it. It shows I care and want to help those who need it. Helping is good. If we don't help others, we're not doing right. We should keep doing things, like helping, treating everyone the same, and being positive. These small things help us succeed.\n\nThird, some think jobs are easy. They're not. They need school, a diploma, and skills. Students must learn, finish school, and get experience. Professionals work hard to succeed. Some students quit school when it's tough. They should never doubt they can do more. There's a saying, 'You can do more than you know.' We can do more. We should keep trying and not be scared of challenges. We should be hopeful for a better tomorrow. We need to keep busy to do more.\n\nTo succeed, we must keep doing things. That's what counts. We shouldn't quit on important things. We'll regret it if we do. We can't just watch others succeed. If we stay busy, we'll do more. Hard work, helping, and jobs can make things happen. The world needs more hard workers than lazy people.

Michelangelo's words can stress us out and lead to bad behavior in different ways.\n\nAiming too high and missing is dangerous because it causes stress. High goals can overwhelm us and make us want to quit. If we quit, we'll feel hopeless and won't try again. Stress also makes us tired and lazy. This can lead to overthinking and negative thoughts.

For example, we might not spend time with family and friends. We could lose touch with them if we only focus on one goal. Also, we might act badly and forget to be polite. If we work on our goals all day, we might not sleep well and get cranky. These are examples of how bad behavior can happen when we aim too high.\n\nSome people say it's worse to aim too low and reach our goals. They say this because if our goals are too easy, we won't care much about them. For instance, if we just want to rest, they think we don't care about finishing tasks.

Our lives are not over; even old people fail. But we can inspire others to keep going, remember where they came from, and their story.\n\nWinston said, 'To succeed, we must fail first.' I think we can learn from our mistakes and go higher after failing. When someone fails at something they worked hard for, it makes them want to try more until they win. Being motivated can take us to places we didn't think we could go. Failing at a dream can make people try harder. LeBron didn't win a title for his hometown in the NBA at first; he left and joined the Heat. He won with them. Fans were mad, but he returned to Cleveland in 2016 and won the finals against Steph Curry. He failed, but then he succeeded and inspired others too.\n\nFailure can help us learn from our mistakes. I messed up in a video game and in basketball, which made me think more about my actions. I played Mario and couldn't beat a boss. I lost, but then I won. I also failed in basketball, which made me question if I was good. So, I trained to get better. I taught myself things I didn't know because I never had a coach. It was tough, but I needed to get better. Months later, I showed others what I could do. I reached my goal and am thankful. We need to fail to find and work on our weak spots.\n\nWinning can also be a kind of failure. I won but still lost once. Being too successful can make us fail because it can make us too proud and lead to mistakes. In history class, I was smart but got too proud and failed a test, which lowered my grade. I took the test again, checked my work, and passed. I was winning in a video game after many days. I got too proud and lost all my progress. It took me a month to get back, but I still found ways to win. In the end, you should never be too sure of yourself."}

For example, if someone has been through something you think you might face, listen to them. You can learn from what they say.\n\nYour parents can also teach you by sharing their stories. Sometimes you might need to ask your friends about what they have gone through. It may help, or it may not; everyone learns differently. Pay attention to people you enjoy listening to. They can help you handle things because they might inspire you.\n\nHelp others by telling them about these experiences. When you hear about what someone else has gone through, listen. You can learn from it and help others learn too. Remember these stories so you don't repeat the same mistakes. If it's something good, you might want it to happen to you. Sharing what you or others have gone through can help many people, even if you don't know it.\n\nIt's useful to learn from others because you can apply it to your life and share it with people.

They learn that they must try over and over if they don't win the first time. Failure is not good or bad. It teaches you lessons you will always remember. You must try again with the same excitement because you know more now.\n\nWhat things do people succeed at after they fail?\n\nThey get smarter and more patient. They learn to try many times, not just once. They know that they might not win the first time they try. They learn to keep their mind excited for each try. They don't know which try will make them win. If they fail, they know they can't just stop. They must keep going until they get what they want in life.\n\nWhat do people think when they succeed after they fail?\n\nPeople may think they couldn't do it, or they are not smart enough to win a lot in life. But when they win after they try hard and work hard, they start to trust themselves. They dare to try new things they thought they couldn't win at. Sometimes, it's good to give things a second chance. This helps you learn, teach yourself new things, and win at many of them.\n\nConclusion\n\nPeople who win a lot in life are those who failed a lot and learned from their mistakes.

It's better to let someone know something is wrong than to keep quiet about it.\n\nLying won't make you look good or help you. People will start to not trust you. When you try to tell them something, they might not believe you. Some people might not get caught for small lies, but you have to keep telling the same story. If you make a mistake, people will find out you lied. My friend lied to a teacher about what she did in the hallway and got caught. She had to explain her actions and her lie. You'll become someone people can't trust, and it's hard to remember all your lies.\n\nIn the end, I think telling the truth is better than lying because lies don't help you. People will see you as someone they can't trust. Lies can make people very mad at you. Many kids get in trouble with teachers and parents for lying or hiding things. The best way to avoid trouble is to never lie, not to adults or anyone else.\n\nBeing truthful makes people see you as dependable and good. It might upset someone, but if you're honest, just say it nicely and not in a mean way.\n\nMy friends and I always tell each other the truth. We don't let a friend go out with something embarrassing on them. Once, a friend's breath was bad, so another friend told her and gave her gum. Now, she makes sure her breath is fresh. My friend told her so no one else would say something mean about her breath. She did it in a nice way.\n\nSo, telling the truth is better than lying. Lying makes life harder, and people will think you're bad and not trust you. Lying doesn't help; it only makes things worse.

So, should the school make the lunch menu healthier?\n\nSome people think the school lunch menu is fine as it is. But, changing it to a healthier one is a good idea. A healthy menu keeps our minds and bodies well. It helps us learn better. It is important to eat well, especially when we are young and growing. We need to eat right at home and at school. Most students choose to eat unhealthy things like chips instead of real food. They do this because they don't like the bad school lunch.\n\nAnother reason is so students can eat healthy and have more energy to learn. Healthy food gives us vitamins that make us have more energy and focus better in class. Some students play sports and need energy for the day. Healthy eating is good for them.

Our personalities come from what we see on social media and in our daily lives, which can be good or bad. We use these things to build who we are because they give us ideas. They can also push us to copy the traits we see in others into ourselves. \n\nFirst, social media has a big effect on our thoughts and actions. It shows us a way of life to follow. Take the Kardashians, for example. Many people see them as the perfect American life. When their show started, it was very popular! They showed what everyone wanted: to be rich, attractive, and live an amazing life. We focus on these images, and they can make us think that's what we should want. Social media like Instagram, Facebook, Twitter can also change how we act and live. They can make us like or buy things with ads. \n\nSecond, we meet many traits in our daily lives. Feelings are a big part of this. They are in everything from talking to acting to making up characters. People around us, like our heroes, can change us. We admire these people and think there should be more like them. Our heroes are who we want to be like, now or in the future. They could be your parents or a friend who is a great example to you. But some traits can be bad for us, like a tough childhood or being picked on.

{"text_id": "2A426B89E8C5", "output_essay": "If we don't try new things beyond what we already know, we won't grow. Some people don't like this idea. They think sticking to what we know is easy and more enjoyable. They have a point; using our own language lets us be funnier, think quicker, and it's simpler. But we won't grow that way. Let me break it down. Thinking about our future, we realize we need to be in a better place. Getting there takes a lot of effort. I believe in working smart, not just hard. Our education is important. College means more effort. To land a good job, we must work for it. Even without education, we work hard to afford a house and a car. Work is unavoidable, but we can choose to work in a better place. We only learn what we're capable of by trying and understanding why growth matters. \n\nTrying is how we learn. It lets us see if something is hard or easy. We tend to like easy tasks, but I prefer challenging ones. Easy tasks improve us a little, but tough ones make us much better. They involve facing challenges and solving them, which makes us feel good. Each time we do something, we should aim to do it better. Improving ourselves also betters our country. I have a good life, and I want to pass that on to my son. This is how we improve our nation. Everyone must find their work; we're here to make a difference. Our education is our proof. When I become a doctor, it shows I've tackled many challenges. I've spent years in school. This means people can trust me. What about us? I want to be that trustworthy person. I want to help build a better nation and people through education. I value education because it makes us better. Those thinking of quitting school should try hard before giving up. Even at a job like KFC, they asked me to learn the system. Learning is key, even if we leave school. We should try things to see if we can do them. \n\nI believe we can achieve a lot, no matter our situation. We must keep going. If we fail in school, we look for a job or a new idea to improve the world. Others have done this and succeeded, like the creators of Facebook. We should be as creative as possible. If we lose trust or a relationship ends, we move on. We can't stop living because of setbacks. We're stronger than we think. God put us in different situations to help each other. If everyone were doctors, no one would work in fast food or clean streets. Each person has a role. We live in a city to support each other. Communication makes us better. We have different jobs for a reason. If I'm a doctor and my car breaks, I see a mechanic. If the mechanic is sick, he sees me. The person cleaning the streets is vital. Without him, our paths wouldn't be clean. We can do many things, but with hard and smart work, we can do even more. \n\nGrowth is crucial. It means thinking better. Learn from experiences and reflect on them to improve your mind. It's important to think about recent events or your whole life. This helps our minds grow. Reading books is another way. It helps young people think like adults. Teenagers like wild things, but reading can make a 17-year-old think like they're 30. Asking for advice is another growth method. Ask parents or siblings. They give great advice because they've lived longer and love us. We should watch and learn from them. If we don't have a family, we can find someone wise to help. Try to follow their example, maybe even do better than them. The challenge is having the patience to learn from others. We need to be smart in choosing our mentors. I'd pick a successful person. We need patience to see changes in our thoughts and life, and we need to pick the right teacher. Growth is a great thing. \n\nDoing more than what we're good at will improve our nation. By working smarter, we can achieve more. Education helps us a lot. We need to try first; then we can do it. Pushing ourselves will help us do more. Learning from others also makes us better. All this comes from discovering what we can do and believing in ourselves. When we believe, we'll pass on these good things to our kids. By doing these things and more, we need to do what we can't yet do to become more than we are now."}

This will help students stay fit and get strong. Some students might not like this change, but it's for their health. Healthy food gives us more energy for school work and class activities.

Healthier options will stop these complaints.\n\nNext, some students might say, 'I can eat what I want.' That's true, but healthy food helps us grow better and stay active.

We pick our own choices and actions.\n\nOn March 7th, 1999, the Washington Post talked to people from a local school.

For instance, having a good character can help you get a job over someone with a bad character. I saw this when I went for a job interview. I dressed well and made a good first impression. My boss liked that. I worked hard by staying late and learning more. What I learned about having a good character is that making a good impression and working hard can make you better. I think everyone should work on being better by working on their character. I say this because it's been shown to be true. Doing good things makes you a better person.

One day, I asked if I could help, and she agreed. She taught me to cook and clean dishes. I got better with practice. Now, my family asks me to cook, and I don't let my mom clean dishes anymore.

This curfew really gets in the way of teenagers' lives. The curfew should not be put in place because it stops teenagers who want to do good things. Students who work or play sports after school will suffer. Some teenagers who drive might even have a car crash trying to get home on time.\n\nThe first reason is after-school activities. Generic_Name is a student at my school; he plays soccer and works after school. He has to stay and practice with the team on weekdays. After practice, he has to go to his job at the mall. It takes him almost an hour to get there. He starts working at five and ends at ten o'clock.

Like other teenagers, she enjoys going to different places. She also likes to spend time with friends and family. The danger is big because she has to get home on time to avoid the curfew. She might drive too fast and have an accident. Doing all these things takes a lot of time, and the curfew would stop her from having the freedom she needs. The curfew cuts down the time for her and other teenagers who want to live a life full of freedom and chances.\n\nThe last reason is that not all teenagers are bad. At my school, there are clubs that help students focus on new things and stay out of trouble. These clubs let them pick the good side of life.

My singing can be useful in many ways. To end, I got better at singing because I didn't quit. I fixed my mistakes and asked for help when I needed it. Your skill can help you too.

My cousin has taught me a lot by saying things like, \"Don't do this because bad things could happen,\" and, \"Listen to others.\" What people tell you matters. If you mess up, you might remember their advice. You can avoid trouble if you listen to someone who knows about it. You might avoid bigger problems.\n\nOne reason I think learning from others is important is that you can think back on their advice if you make a mistake. My cousin's warnings showed me not to make the same bad choices he did. He wanted to keep me safe.

If you're tempted to do something wrong, ask your family if they've been through it. They can advise you, and you might think twice. My cousin shared his mistakes with me to keep me from taking risks.\n\nA third reason is to avoid worse problems. Before you act, think about what could go wrong. My cousin's advice, \"Think first,\" sticks with me. Remember what your family says. One day, you might pass this wisdom on to your kids or younger relatives.

I don't agree that he can't fail again because we are all human. Sometimes we win, sometimes we lose. No one is above anyone else. We can all get better than we were before. In a soccer game, you might score or miss. You might win a battle but not the whole war. No one is above anyone else because we are all born, we live, and we die. We all end up in the same place. I don't want to stay the same all my life. I want to show my family and friends that I can change. This is why no one is a complete failure. We are no different from others. If someone says you can't do something, they are not right. We can do what we want if we keep trying to make a change.

It's great that students use their time well and think about their future. This idea can also help our communities by making better workers who have more experience in certain jobs. This can make our lives better.\n\nWe see this when students work after school. They might pick a certain job and learn about it in class. Then, they can use what they learn at school at their job. This is good for the students and the school. It makes the school look good and shows that our community is ready.\n\nThis might be tough for students because they have to work hard, especially if they have a job after school. Life is tough, but being ready can make it a bit easier later on.

{"text_id": "49BEF8C33595", "output_essay": "Some people think it's not good for students to choose a career when they're young. They believe this because not everyone wants to be a professional. But it's actually good for students to decide on a career early. This is because young people can study anywhere and go after any job they want for their future. First, not everyone wants to be a professional. They might not go after a career because they have other easy things to do. Also, some might not be able to start a career. They may just want to work to pay for their home or help their family, especially if they don't have parents to support them. This is why many quit school or college. They find it too hard. Second, young people can study anywhere. When students are about to finish school, they think about what job they want or where to study. For example, my nephew will go to George Mason University. Everyone wants a different future to have a better life. Some work in jobs they don't like. So, they might want to get a career to find a better job and make more money. Third, they can go after any job they want for their future. Choosing a career means doing a job you like every day. You can do anything if you are interested in your classes and want to reach your goal. Some want to be doctors to help sick people or those who need medical care. This is a good job that helps others. In conclusion, even though some think it's not good for young students to choose a career early because not everyone wants to be a professional, it's actually good. This is because they have the chance to study and go after any job they want for their future."}

Some talents people use every day include singing, playing the guitar, playing the piano, doing magic tricks, and making people laugh. Many people sing to earn money. I really like Shawn Mendes and how he sings. Playing the guitar is also something people do daily. Some play it while singing, and others just play. It sounds so nice that it relaxes me. Playing the piano is also fun. I enjoy calm piano music. Magicians are amazing. I can't figure out their tricks. When I watch a magician on TV, I'm always excited by the end. Comedians are great too. They make me laugh until I cry. Sometimes, I laugh so hard that my stomach hurts. Other skills people have include being good at math, keeping things tidy, playing sports, getting top grades, and doing makeup. Many people are good at math. It's tough, and I admire those who are great at it. I'm okay at math, but not the best. Staying organized is hard. Not everyone can do it. It needs time, responsibility, and patience. Sports are tough too. You need many skills and to be fit. For example, ice hockey is hard because you need to balance well on the ice. Getting top grades is hard. I've tried and I'm still trying. You have to believe in yourself and work hard. Doing makeup is like art on your face. It's not easy, and it looks beautiful. Everyone has a talent. There are many skilled people out there. Some are famous, and some are not. Many people share their talents online. But new creators often get overlooked because they don't have many views or followers. Social media is big, like Instagram and TikTok. Many share their talents there. My talent is baking. I bake a lot. When I come home from school, I bake what I want. I learned to bake from my dad. He made tasty cupcakes for his business. I asked to help, and he said yes. Now, I bake almost every day. It's fun and helps me relax. When I'm bored, I bake. I can't stop baking! I make cakes, cupcakes, and more. My dad loves it when I bake. He thinks everything I make will be great. That's my talent, baking. Everyone has a talent they use every day."}

They won't need to bring their own lunch and can eat healthy meals they like. It's great that the cafeteria wants to change the lunch because students can have tasty food, don't need to pack a lunch, and can eat their favorite meals at school every day. But the cafeteria needs a lot of money to make new lunches. Students are happy they can have a tasty lunch every day, especially with the new cafeteria plan. Before the new menu, the lunches were bad and no one liked them. They always talked about needing better food to stay strong. They were sad they couldn't get better food at school. Now, with the new menu, they are happy and can stay alert all day. Some students who don't eat at school can't focus on their lessons. Every student needs energy to do well in class. Even though they don't have to bring lunch from home, students who didn't like the school food used to bring their own. The school food smelled bad and wasn't nice. Now, they don't need to bring their own food because the cafeteria is changing the menu. They can now enjoy school meals like hamburgers, rice, meat, milk, and fruit. Even though it's important to eat healthy, the school food often has cheese, which isn't very healthy. Students need to eat because they wake up early and need food for their brains and energy to last all day. They are happy to eat their favorite food, learn quickly, and have healthy options at school. Good food is important for students because they are the future. They need to be healthy and strong. Students who want to succeed work hard, wake up early, and need a positive, strong mind and energy. So, good lunches (healthy and tasty) are important for them to be strong. If we have a good lunch menu at school, it will be great. Every student will come to school and enjoy their lunch."}
{"text_id": "E82941E6EE4C", "output_essay": "In some places, students are told to pick a job before they start high school. Many students think they know what job they want by looking at it and thinking it seems fun or easy. They believe it will make them happy or look good. But some people argue that young students should choose a job early because they know what they want and are not unsure. However, choosing a job too early can make students care less about the job they really want. They pay less attention to their school grades and more to a job they might not like later on. If students pick a job too early, they might not focus on school and think too much about a job they won't want later. Good grades help them stay on track and get ready for the job they want after high school. It's important for students to get ready for college while in high school. This gives them more time to prepare for their future job. But they shouldn't waste time on a job too early because they might not follow that path after school. Instead, they should study for tests and do their homework. After that, they can think about their future job. Letting students take their time helps them make better choices instead of rushing into something they might not like. I think students should not be rushed. They need time to think and understand what they want. If rushed, they might not know what to do after school. It's confusing why some people rush into things. But it's always important to know what you want and get ready for it. If students choose a job too early, they might wonder why they started it and lose interest in finding a new job. Some people think students should start working towards a job early because they understand what they're doing and are ready. In conclusion, I think students should not be rushed. They need time to think and understand what they want. If rushed, they might not know what to do after school. It's confusing why some people rush into things. But knowing what you want and getting ready is key. Choosing a job too early is hard for students. They might miss out on other interesting and suitable jobs. It also puts pressure on them and makes them worry about their future. Students should be ready and happy with their job choice and not doubt it. Choosing a job too early can make them care less about the job they really want. They focus less on school and more on a job they might not like later. Students should plan and think about their job choice well. For example, if a student takes a biology class in high school because they want a medical job, it helps them get ready for what's to come. But taking a few classes is not enough to find the job they like. Some people say young students should choose a job because they know what they want and are not unsure. But choosing too early can make them care less about the job they really want. They focus less on school and more on a job they might not like later. Students are better prepared for their future if not rushed. I believe students should have time to think about what they want to do after high school. This way, they can get ready. They should think about what they want to do even if they're not ready yet. It helps when they are ready."}

We all have problems, and we can get past them; we just have to try hard. All the famous people you know had problems. Those problems made them better at what they do now.\n\nAnother reason is that problems show who you are and what you can handle. Showing what you can do can take you to a good place. When you face a problem, it can really change your life because you don't know what will happen next. For example, you could become the smartest person just by showing who you are.\n\nA third reason is that some problems are just for you. You don't know what will happen to you. A website called problems-help.com says that problems make you do your best and help you with things in your life, like school. They also say that problems are part of life; you don't know when a problem will come.\n\nSome people might not agree with me. They say that problems are bad. Here is why I don't agree: Problems make people think straight and help them do things right. So, having problems is really important. Yes, some problems can be bad, but most are good for you and change how you move forward. That's why I agree with Duke Ellington's quote, \"A problem is a chance for you to do your best.\"\n\nThe meaning of this quote, \"A problem is a chance for you to do your best,\" is that if you have a problem, you can get past it by trying your best. What I want you to understand is that everyone has problems; they are part of life. You can't run from them, but you can get past them, and they can help you think straight and get through life."}

I had a rough day once and didn't feel like doing anything. But playing video games made me feel different. When I get home, I first finish my homework. Then, I play video games. And guess what? Games aren't just fun. They can teach you things. Don't think so? Here's an example. In Fortnite, if there are 100 players and 20 get kicked out, how many are left? We just used math to figure that out. I learn about games by playing for 2 hours. This helps me get better at the game. Playing more helps me improve. That's a skill because it means I don't quit. Trying makes you a better person. Video games often involve math. Many games are about survival or strategy. And lots of people play fighting games, which use math too. If we didn't play games before, we might not be as smart. Sure, we learn language arts, math, science, and civics in school. But games help too. Oh, and games can keep you from feeling hungry.

Also, you could make your friends want to try them, and they could get hooked too. My second tip is to stay out of trouble. If you get into trouble a lot, you might get six broken pillars. Then you have to meet with your parents and teachers. If you get six broken pillars, you can't eat lunch with your friends. You have to sit alone, which isn't fun. You also want to avoid the Behavioral Intervention Program (BIP). BIP is a place you go if you've been bad. Third, don't do silly things like running in the halls, pretend fighting, or being rude to a teacher. These are dumb ways to get in trouble. You could also be late to class. If you're late, you get a broken pillar unless you have a note or a good reason. Fourth, join school sports like basketball, track, soccer, or volleyball. Playing sports is good for your muscles. Also, work hard to keep your grades up. If they drop, you can't join in on fun events. And if you're in trouble, you could be kicked off the team. In the end, it's best to avoid trouble.

Look at how you both did the work and what you found out. See if you both think the same thing in the end. It's good to get ideas from more than one person.

You can ask for advice in many situations. It could be when you're stuck on a problem, picking the best milk at the store, or choosing what to wear to school. For instance, if you're not sure about what you're wearing, you could ask a family member what they think about your outfit.\n\nIt's thought that more than 90% of people ask others for advice.

Some people say that schools should pick the clubs and sports for students because these activities use up a lot of time and energy. This leaves students with not much time for studying or homework. But others believe that students should pick their own activities because they know what they can do and what they need. I think it's better for students to make their own choices because they know their own schedules, what activities they need, and how much they can do.\n\nMost students keep a calendar. They write down their daily tasks and plan their time. They choose activities based on this plan. In my second year of high school, I had to go to an extra math class on Fridays after school. It was hard to stay late and then go to basketball practice on Saturdays. I was often late to the mosque or too tired to go. If I could have picked my own schedule, I would have chosen a different day for the extra math class. Schools and teachers don't know every student's schedule, so it's better to let students make their own plans.\n\nAlso, every student has a dream job they want to do. After-school activities can help practice for the job they want, which I think is more important than homework. These activities give them skills and experience for their future job. If schools pick activities for students, they might pick something the student doesn't like. I read an article that said it's bad for students to do volunteer work they don't like. It can make it hard for them to pick a job later. This happened to my brother. He didn't know what to study in college because he only did activities the school picked, which he didn't like. This shows that schools shouldn't pick activities for students. Students know what they need, and if they need help, they will ask.\n\nAlso, everyone is different. Students know how much they can do. Schools sometimes give everyone the same amount of work, but not everyone can handle it. Our English class had to do after-school activities, and it was too much for some students. Some did well, but others didn't. Schools should let students decide how much they want to do. If the school thinks a student is doing too much or too little, and it's affecting their grades, the school can talk to their parents to fix it.\n\nSchools are meant to teach students and get them ready for the world.

Schools help make students' skills better. \n\nSchools push students to learn more and get better because this can help them get into college and do well later on. For example, a student who is not good at school subjects might not find chances to do well. Her school lets her play a sport she likes. She gets very good at the sport because she works hard.

A saying from my dad that changed my life is, \"Treat others how you want to be treated.\" This saying made me see the world differently. But what does this saying mean, why is it important, and why should we learn from what others have gone through? I still think about this saying because it was helpful and made sense to me.\n\nFirst, what does this saying mean? It means if you want people to be nice to you, you should be nice to them. If you're mean, they'll be mean back. I saw a video about a man who gave food and clothes to poor people every day. Then he got into a car crash and broke his hip. He had no money for the operation. But the people he helped gave him money for it. They looked after him day and night until he could leave the hospital. They fed him and gave him clothes. After he got better, he promised to always help others.\n\nSecond, why is this saying important? My dad told me this because he knew it was true. He once shared how on his first day at a new job, he worked hard all day. During lunch, he bought mints for his coworkers to help them stay awake. He did this every week and always helped with their questions. When he needed money for our school, the boss heard about his kindness and gave him a better job. The boss said it was because my dad helped the workers stay sharp. Hearing this, I wanted to be like my dad, helping others instead of just myself.\n\nThird, why should we learn from what happens to us? Learning from what happens to us is important. It changes society, helps us not repeat mistakes, and makes us smarter. It lets us see the world in new ways. I didn't listen when my grandpa warned me about a biting dog. I got too close, and the dog bit me. I cried a lot. Then my grandpa showed me he had been bitten too. That's why he warned me. But the bite got better after some months.\n\nIn the end, learning from what happens to us is good. It makes us smarter. Always act how you want others to act towards you. If you do good things, good things will come to you. Learning from others' mistakes helps us too. Being wise comes from going through things and learning. People go through things and share their stories, but in their own ways."}

I think a curfew is partly good because it can be unsafe for teenagers to be out after midnight. I feel that being outside at 12 P.M. is risky. So, this curfew is great because that's not a safe time to be out. Parents can tell their kids not to stay out later than this to keep them safe. But being out at 10 P.M. is okay. For instance, my dad tells me not to go out after 11 P.M. because it's late and I could get hurt. But I believe an 18-year-old can hang out with friends since they're nearly adults at 21 and understand their actions. Still, parents should know where they are and what they're doing. After 12 P.M., only trouble and danger are outside. I think teenagers can stay out until 10 P.M. It's early enough, but they should be home by midnight for sure. \n\nWe often hear about teenagers getting hurt because of violence, and their parents don't know their whereabouts. It would be better if the curfew said that only teenagers 18 or older should be out late. If they find a 17-year-old out at midnight, they should help them because it's unsafe for them to be alone. Teenagers can have a good time, but not after midnight, and they need to be careful. \n\nI think help should be offered to any teenager 18 or younger who has no family, home, or friends and is in danger or doing wrong things. They need support, and to me, 'help' means caring for those in real need. If the curfew picks up teenagers, they should also look after the most vulnerable who need it more. The curfew can remove teenagers from the streets at midnight and tell their parents to come get them. But the ones without homes need this care the most because they long for a family and a home, and most of all, love. \n\nTeenagers need love too, especially from their parents. But I don't fully agree with the curfew because it seems to ignore teenagers who don't need help since they have families. Instead of help, those teenagers should get a different kind of consequence. The ones without homes should get the help because they need it more than the others."}
{"text_id": "237A3B66F1B2", "output_essay": "Do you think students should pick a career when they are young? In this essay, I will say that it is a good idea for students to pick a career when they are young. Students should pick a career early because they can find one they enjoy, they get ready for the future, and they work hard to reach their dreams. First, students should pick a career they enjoy. It's tough to choose a career as a teenager. For example, my best friend always asks me if I know what job I want after high school. It's a hard choice, but I love the idea of being a nurse. I want to take good care of my patients in the future. Second, getting ready for the future is important. For instance, I want to be a nurse. I need to study hard, get good grades, keep a high GPA, and practice to be ready when I finish school. It's smart to get ready because if you don't, you won't know what you want to do. Get ready for anything that life brings. Third, it's smart to work hard to reach your dreams. For example, in Guatemala, where I'm from, I was always the first to get what I wanted at home or school. I've always worked as hard as I can to do well and reach my dreams. I don't like being behind others. I work very hard to be the best at what I do. It's smart to work hard to reach your dreams. Some people think picking a career young is a bad idea. But they are wrong. Students can find a career they like and work hard to reach their dreams. Picking their career young is good for students. It helps them go after what they want in the future. It's good for their future, and they will keep doing well. Let young students choose their careers as they grow up. By picking what they want to do, they will always be excited. And being excited is the key to success."}

You can remember these tips for later, so you understand how things work. Tips help you learn how to do things from someone who knows them well. Often, getting tips helps you make better choices and have smarter thoughts. \n\nWhen you ask someone for tips, it's good because they have been through a lot. They know what is good and bad for you. They have made mistakes before and can give you great tips for your life and future. \n\nSometimes, when we ask for tips, people might not get what we're saying and give us the wrong tips. Then, we find someone else who really gets it and knows what to do. \n\nAsking for tips is useful because you can think back on them later. For example, my grandma once told me that not everyone will stay your friend and as you grow up, you'll have just one true friend. My dad also said to be on your own because you can't always rely on others to help, and you'll need to do things yourself. Getting tips from grown-ups is the best; they always know what to do because they've been through it. We also ask teachers for tips because sometimes our parents are too busy to listen when we need to talk. \n\nWhen you need tips on personal stuff, talk to someone you trust. Getting tips from many people is good because they tell you what they think and what they've learned. Having more than one person give you tips is good because they teach you what to do as you grow up. It also helps you choose what to do when you're not sure. Getting tips is great because it leads to smarter choices and a happier view of things. When you get tips, you learn, so you know what to do when something comes up. \n\nDid you know that getting tips can help you in life? It lets you make smarter choices. Tips help you do the right thing instead of making a mistake. \n\nTips are useful and keep you from trouble. They give you clever ideas and make hard things seem simple."}

I do, and I believe in the saying that honesty is the best way to go. If you're honest, you don't have to lie. Why? Because being honest means you tell the truth. Let me give you an example. Say a girl asks you if she looks big in a dress, and you think she does. You might not want to upset her, so you say no. But that's not being honest, that's lying. Instead, you could nicely tell her the dress doesn't look great, without saying she looks big. That way, you're honest and kind at the same time. It's important to note that honesty can sometimes hurt feelings. But it's still better than lying. If someone learns you lied, they might not trust you again. When you're not honest, it's like you're lying. This is because you're hiding the truth or not sharing your real thoughts. If you're always honest, people will trust you more. It can be tough to be honest because we're scared of what might happen. But we should be brave and tell the truth. If we lie, things could get worse later on. Many people aren't honest because they're scared of the future. I think being honest is a good choice because it means you're truthful. Sometimes, it's okay to say what someone wants to hear, like if they're having a hard time. It might help them. But I always want to feel okay with what I say or do. I try to be honest because I don't like lying and I know it's the right thing."}

I think that being honest can upset people because it might offend them and cause problems. You should tell the truth, but sometimes you can't because it would upset others and make them feel like they are not a good friend since you are making them sad. \n\nFirst, being honest can upset people because it might offend them and cause problems. If you lie and are never honest, people will find out and they will punish you. For example, if you go into the kitchen without your parents knowing to get a snack and you make a loud noise, your parents will come and see you eating and you might get a time-out. \n\nNext, being honest can upset people because you should always tell the truth, but sometimes you can't because it would make others sad. When your friend picks out a dress that is not nice and asks what you think, you might say 'it is pretty,' even though it is not. Or when your friend makes food and it tastes very bad, you don't want to tell your friend, so you eat it and then go to the sink to spit it out. \n\nLastly, being honest can make people feel like they are a bad friend. When you argue with your friend, you should tell the truth that you took their food, but you know they would be mad and you don't want to lose the friendship. When you try a new ice cream flavor and your friends don't like it, they might worry that no one will like it, so they dress up and eat all the ice cream, but then they feel sick from eating too much. \n\nI think that being honest can upset people because it might offend them and cause problems. You should tell the truth, but sometimes you can't because it would make others sad and they might think they are a bad friend. Don't be too honest or it could end friendships, and sometimes you have to lie about some things. But don't lie all the time, as it will cause more trouble. It's okay to be honest, but be careful not to upset others, or there will be problems from being too honest."}
{"text_id": "04CAB8943A49", "output_essay": "In today's world, many students are trying to decide what they want to do in the future. Some already have a career in mind, while others can't decide. Choosing a career can be stressful because it's a big decision. Often, parents tell their kids to choose a career as they start high school. I think it's important to choose early, but I don't agree that young students should. They often can't make up their minds, act without thinking, and should be thinking about college instead. \n\nHigh school students can't make up their minds about their careers because they don't know what to do after they finish school. For example, they might choose a job that pays well but then find it too hard and give up. They might not care about the career itself, just the money, and keep changing their minds. They don't take these decisions seriously. \n\nStudents these days don't take their school work seriously because they're too focused on classes about careers. These classes are useful because they help with future jobs, but if students only care about these, they might fail their other classes. They need to hand in all their work on time. For instance, some students with part-time jobs might ignore their school work and fail. They should care more about learning in all classes, not just career-related ones. Every choice they make has consequences. \n\nStudents should care more about learning than about picking a career when they're young. Education is key to success. If they're still unsure after high school, they should go to college. College gives them more time to think and choose classes. College classes are more practical than high school ones. For example, college students do more hands-on activities, while high school students take more notes. College students learn more because they do more than just write notes. \n\nChoosing a career is hard because it's a long-term commitment. Some students can't decide what they want. Others choose a career but don't do well in their other classes. They should focus on learning more than on picking a career.

{"text_id": "78A208F4C7A4", "output_essay": "A curfew will help keep teenagers safe by stopping them from going to late-night parties, hanging out outside at night, and visiting friends' houses after dark. Some people think curfews will help teenagers stay out of trouble for these reasons. But others feel that curfews are not fair because they stop young people from seeing what the world is like at night, going to movies, and having fun as teenagers. I believe curfews will help teenagers stay safe by stopping late-night parties, outdoor play at night, and visits to friends' houses after dark.\n\nFirst, curfews will help teenagers stay safe by stopping late-night parties. These parties can lead to trouble; teenagers might smoke or drink too much. If they do, they could make unsafe choices like driving drunk, which could cause car accidents or get them chased by the police. This is why curfews are important.\n\nNext, curfews will help teenagers stay safe by stopping them from playing outside at night. When teenagers are out late, they might make bad choices and do unsafe things. For example, when I was in Liberia, we used to play outside at night. One night, a boy threw a rock into the air, and it hit a girl on the head because it was too dark to see it coming. She got hurt. This shows why it's not safe to be outside at night. Curfews can prevent these kinds of accidents.\n\nHowever, not everyone thinks curfews are good. Some people say curfews are not fair to young people. They think teenagers should be able to explore the night, go to after-parties, and have fun. But I think curfews are helpful. Going to a friend's house at night can lead to trouble. Teenagers often don't make the best choices, so a curfew can guide them.\n\nIn conclusion, curfews can help teenagers stay out of trouble. They stop late-night parties and visits to friends' houses after dark. Some people might not agree. They think curfews are not fair to young people. But when teenagers go out at night, they can do unsafe things like drinking too much. Curfews can help prevent this."}

I wouldn't agree with this because the food at school is different from what kids get at home. A big problem is that students like the food they have now, including their favorite meals, which would be taken away. Most students don't care much about eating healthy. They might not like the new food and could protest if the school made this change. Even a few students can make a big difference in this way.\n\nParents usually don't give their kids the kind of food that schools serve during the day. Often, kids have a favorite food at school that they don't get at home, so they like the cafeteria food better. Parents choose what to feed their kids, which is fine, but kids sometimes get upset when they can't have what they want. Kids also like the snacks and sweets at school, even though they cost money, but it's not more than a dollar.\n\nIt would be hard for students to get used to new food because they like what the school offers now. It's tough for them to start eating something new. Most students don't think about healthy eating, so a change would be hard for them. Others might not care much. But some students don't want new food because they like what they have now.\n\nA change like this could make one student upset, and then others might follow. This could lead to a protest, and many students might join because they think it's cool, but it's not.

Learning more about computers can help them decide if they want to work with them or not.\n\nOne reason it's smart for kids to pick a job early is that they can learn about their future job.

Everyone loves unhealthy food like pizza, tacos, and quesadillas. If the cafeteria stops serving these foods, many students will bring their own lunch.

Junk food is popular, and if the school doesn't serve it, we will be upset and might leave because of this bad choice. Second, the school can't just decide this without us. We're all part of the school. They should tell us and let us help make the decision. We should vote on it - students, the community, everyone. The result of the vote should guide the decision about the new lunch menu. This matters to parents too. Some eat with their kids at school and they want satisfying food like steak and cheese or Chinese food. They also like drinks like soda and coffee. These are not healthy, but we all enjoy them. Many people like to drink soda with their meals. Third, a school without students is useless. A town without people is the same. Everyone, including teachers, needs a variety of food. We need salads, pasta, and protein to stay healthy. If a school changes its menu, teachers and students won't be happy. They might quit or move to other schools. Schools and countries have rules. One rule is that leaders can't make decisions without the people's input. People have the power to change things they think are wrong. They have the right to approve all changes. In conclusion, the school can't change to healthier lunches without asking us - students, teachers, and parents. If they do it without our okay, people will be angry and might leave.

For example, you might wake up feeling grumpy, but by the afternoon, you could be happy and laughing. This shows that your traits can change because you choose who you want to be.

I want to talk about talking to parents, keeping students healthy, and adding foods with lots of protein.\n\nMy first point is that we need to talk to parents and students about why we want to change the menu. Parents' opinions matter because sometimes kids bring their own food to school.\n\nAnother point is that eating better food makes students healthier. I think that healthy food is good for kids' bodies and minds, unlike junk food.\n\nMy last point is about having foods with more protein. For example, the menu could offer more vegetables and different fruits. It could also include rice and grilled chicken instead of pizza, hamburgers, and snacks like candy or chips every day. Eating too much pizza and hamburgers can be bad for our health.\n\nThese are my reasons for why the cafeteria should make a new lunch menu.

It's useful and makes learning easier for students through the internet or video calls from their homes using a computer or other helpful technology. I believe that taking classes from home is good for students. However, not everyone thinks the same and some may disagree with me. When students take online classes, they can find a quiet place to do their schoolwork without other kids bothering them. They won't have to put up with noise from others because they can be somewhere they can concentrate and learn better. They can work on a subject for as long as they need. They don't have a teacher rushing them to finish or to start something else. They can take their time and not worry about not understanding something. For example, they can switch topics whenever they want and go as fast or slow as they like. Students have technology like computers, tablets, and phones to do their work. They can keep all their work in one place, which is better than having lots of papers everywhere. This can help students who have trouble keeping their work organized. If they need help, they can use Google to find information for their classes. They can also talk to friends online and help each other. It would be good if more schools let students learn online. Not all schools can offer this choice. If I could, I would like to learn from home."}

Also, some are not skilled at sports. Many are afraid of being laughed at by others, like students and teachers. Some kids are too shy to even stand up and give a talk in class. So, I think students won't want to do things they're not good at. If they have to do these things, they will feel ashamed.\n\nStudents who are good at art can join the yearbook if they wish. I believe students shouldn't be forced to do things they don't like. They shouldn't be pushed to do things they're bad at. If they are pushed, they won't do well because they'll feel they need to be perfect. But, we should still encourage them to try, just not force them.\n\nIn P.E., the sporty kids take it very seriously, like it's a professional game. For instance, if they're playing basketball and someone misses a shot, everyone might yell at them. The person who missed was under too much pressure to score. Some students aren't good at sports, so they should be able to choose whether to join in. Also, even if someone is great at art, they shouldn't have to work on the yearbook if they don't want to. Some students don't want to join student council, sports, or the yearbook, so it should be their choice. Not everyone feels brave enough to do these things. Joining student council is a big deal and should be voluntary.\n\nStudent council can make some students anxious because they help with decisions. They might get very nervous if they make a choice that others don't like. Being on student council isn't bad, but it's a big responsibility. It can put a lot of pressure on a student to be perfect. But, as I said, joining should be up to the student.\n\nEvery activity should be optional. Not everyone excels at sports, the yearbook, or student council. No one should be made to do something they don't want to. Everyone should have the freedom to choose their activities. No one should be forced into an activity."}

If you have your own character, people will agree with what you do and respect you. \n\nWe should pick our own character traits because it helps us in the future. Also, remember to make your own character. For example, in a restaurant, if you want to be a server, they will interview you. If you meet your boss with a bad character, do you think they will hire you? Even if you are the best, without a good character, they won't hire you. When you work in a restaurant, you need to be nice and respect people. You talk to customers and ask what they want to eat. You can't do this well if you don't control your character. When places hire, they want a good person with the right character. \n\nAnother example is from my high school. We had a club called 'Key Club.' We helped at other schools. One day, my friend and I went to a kindergarten to help kids count. My friend was nice but couldn't control herself. When kids forgot numbers, she yelled. Our teacher saw and asked her to leave. That was her character. After we graduated, we didn't see each other. But five years later, she had no job because she couldn't control what she said in interviews. After we talked, she went home and thought about it. She changed her character. Now she is different, like writing on a new paper. John Lubbock said, 'Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it.' \n\nOne day, the news showed a young man helping an old lady with heavy bags across the street. Someone took a photo and it was in the news. They said he was helpful. Because of his character, people now help him. The news spread worldwide and people praised him. We should act like him to make the world better. \n\nFor me, character traits are necessary for everyone and important for the future. Think about it. Do you need to make your own character?

They might even find a job that matches their interests.\n\nSince students choose their activity, they will want to spend more time getting better at it. The school will help you continue doing what you enjoy. Some activities are basketball, baseball, swimming, football, and these will also give students exercise. Other activities include tutoring and helping classmates with their studies.\n\nYou should also agree with this because they will learn from the activity they do. They can use this knowledge in other parts of life or at school. It can help them in the future. And they can share what they learn with others.

My friends left me for another group. They changed how they look and act just to be accepted. They didn't think about the trouble they could get into. You can get suspended or have to stay in school as punishment for being with the wrong crowd. Eventually, these friends will leave you. Older kids still lead younger ones into trouble, both inside and outside of school. I knew someone who was told to avoid 'losers.' Later, when he wanted to return to his old friends, they didn't accept him. Kids pretend to be tough to impress others. They might bully smaller kids to look good in front of their friends. This wasn't their true nature until they met these bad influences. Then they get involved in risky activities that could land them in the hospital or worse. Some kids and adults don't stop this behavior because they don't want to look weak. They hang out with kids who skip class and don't do their work. As a result, they often get suspended. High schoolers act tough to feel superior. They pick on others who are just trying to get through the day. They do this for a laugh and to look tough and cool. People, especially teens, do things to look cool that they shouldn't. They skip class, don't do their homework, and miss school. High schoolers think looking good is more important than learning. They follow bad influences and get into trouble at school and home. They have to attend meetings and face more consequences. They don't think ahead and just want to appear cool. Teens fail tests or skip class because of one person's bad influence. This person wants to ruin someone's life for no reason. It's sad to see friends change like this.

An old saying tells us that telling the truth is the best thing to do. But it can make people feel bad, and here's why. Telling the truth can hurt because, first, someone might hurt themselves. Second, it could lead to a fight. Third, the person might get so upset they could end their life. I don't want to go too far, but these things can happen. Let's look at these reasons. First, if you make someone feel bad, they might keep hurting themselves until others notice and help. Second, if you are honest and it's harsh, they might want to fight. It sounds strange, but small things can cause big problems. They might find any reason to fight, and if you don't want to, it could make things worse. Others might not like it, and it could lead to more fights. Third, if you tell someone the truth, they might get very sad. This is especially true if you've been friends since you were kids. They could get so sad that they see everything in a bad way. Their life might feel so bad that they think about ending it. This could be because of the self-harm and fights too. So, the saying that honesty is the best thing to do can actually make people feel bad. It can lead to self-harm, fights, or even suicide, which makes everyone sad. Telling the truth is not always the best. It's just something we think about. It could be about someone we know or something from a TV show or movie. We think about it a lot.

She had a home, a car, and money. She wasn't being honest. I used to lie too, but I've changed. I used to lie so much that once I got in big trouble. My parents didn't believe me for two weeks. They thought I was lying all the time. I said sorry to them, and they believed me again. Now, I will never lie again. If someone lies to you, stay away from them.

Think about no one wanting to invite you anywhere because you are always in a bad mood or rude to them and to new people. It's always good to have nice manners. Manners help you make friends, meet more people, and have fun times with your friends.\n\nA good thing to learn is how to be polite both at school and outside of it. Being polite means helping someone who is older or younger than you if they need it. For example, it's nice to help an older person carry their food to their car or home, or to make breakfast or dinner for your grandparents. It's also nice to take your grandparents out to eat and pay for the meal. This shows you are kind and that you love them.\n\nUsing kind words is another way to be polite. Say 'good morning' or 'good afternoon' to your family and friends. Talk to people in a friendly way. Tell them they look nice, they have a great personality, or that you enjoy being with them. If you drop your pencil and someone gives it back to you, say 'thank you.' When you buy something and the cashier gives you your change, say 'thank you, have a nice day.' This shows you have good manners.\n\nIt's very important to treat people with respect. When I was in elementary school, my teachers told me to be respectful if I wanted others to respect me. They still say this because it's true. If you want respect, you must give respect. This means you shouldn't call people names or fight with them. With good manners, I bet you would make a lot of friends.\n\nThis is why I think it's important for elementary schools everywhere to teach kids how to be polite. This way, kids can have a good life and make many friends in the world."}

You learn not to trust everyone.\n\nIn 2006, a girl who didn't understand how schools in the United States worked had to decide about summer school. She was failing because she didn't get the lessons, especially in social studies, English, and math. She asked her friends and then her family if she should go to summer school to pass. Her family said yes, but her friends said summer school was useless. She believed her friends over her family. She didn't go to summer school and failed the year. Later, she realized her friends didn't care about her success. Trusting the right people leads to good results. Trusting the wrong people, especially without asking others, can lead to bad advice and poor outcomes.\n\nAnother reason to ask around is to avoid bad advice. In 1990, a smart girl got a scholarship to a great college. She didn't know if she should accept it. Her friends said no because they weren't going there. She listened to them and missed out on college because her parents couldn't afford it. She lost her chance to start her dream career.\n\nThat's why it's important to get many opinions. It helps you avoid making a bad choice based on limited advice.\n\nFinally, getting lots of advice helps you make the best choice and not miss out.\n\nYou can pick the best advice from many options. You won't miss chances because you have more than one piece of advice. With all the help, things tend to go well.\n\nIn 2002, a 14-year-old boy wanted to join a theater club. He asked his friends, family, and teacher for their thoughts. With many opinions, he chose his family's advice to join if he loved acting. He joined, did well, and became famous.\n\nAsking many people for advice helped him make a great choice and not miss his chance.\n\nIn conclusion, getting lots of opinions helps you avoid mistakes. Not everyone who asks around avoids mistakes, but those who do tend to make better choices. You learn who to trust. When you need to decide, ask many people.

Also, his friend moved because someone else suggested going to his mom's place. My dad helped his friend but still had a bad day.\n\nKindness can touch people's lives. Also, I told on my sister. What I said to my mom got my sister's phone taken for a month and grounded her for a week. For instance, my mom took her phone to teach her a lesson. Words can get someone in trouble. They can make her feel sad and angry. Words can upset people so much that they stop talking to their siblings. They might choose new ways in life, so they can learn and not make the same mistakes.\n\nPeople can change because of what others say. Hurtful words from someone you care about can cause pain but also make you stronger. Words can change people for better or worse. It all depends on the situation. Words can affect people, but sometimes you need to say things that can help others."}
{"text_id": "B1C43F31DAA7", "output_essay": "Did you know that some people want to start working towards a job in high school, while others don't want to start so young? I think it's a good idea to start thinking about a job when you're young, like when you enter high school. This way, you can learn to be responsible and start planning for your future. Kids can learn about jobs and think about what they want to do later, like going to college.\n\nFirst, kids can learn to be responsible for their future. They can think about jobs they might like, such as being a pharmacist, doctor, vet, or teacher. But some kids think starting a job young is too hard. I worry about this because kids should think about their future and what job they want when they grow up.\n\nSecond, kids can learn how a job can help them. Many schools let high school students start learning about jobs, and I think this is very helpful. But some students say this can make them stressed. I believe not being ready for a job later can cause even more stress.\n\nMy last point is that kids can think about what they want and get ready for college. They can prepare for a good job when they go to college. They can feel proud that they worked hard to find what they want for college. Also, many students think they can learn more in college. But I think they can learn a lot about jobs in high school, which will make things easier later on.\n\nIn conclusion, I think starting to work towards a job when you're young is very helpful for the future. It teaches you important things and how to be responsible. I believe it's a good idea for students to start early. They can learn a lot, and when they grow up, they can be the person they want to be."}
{"text_id": "6228D856DAFB", "output_essay": "Hello Ms. Principal,\n\nI'm writing to you because I have heard about your plans to start a new, healthier school lunch menu, and I understand that some students don't like this change. I also don't like it, and I want to tell you why.\n\nMy first reason is that if you take away the students' favorite foods, they might not eat at school. My second reason is that students might not do well in school if they don't eat. My third reason is about the cafeteria workers, who might have to throw away food that no one eats.\n\nI think that if students' favorite foods are gone, they may stop eating lunch at school. This could cause problems. For example, students might leave school to get food they like better and not come back on time for class, or they could be late. This would look bad for the school. Also, leaving school can be dangerous because the school is in charge of the students. Another problem is that many students might move to other schools if they like the food better there. Parents might also get upset if their kids don't eat at school. This could be bad for the kids' health.\n\nAlso, changing the school lunch might make students do worse in school because they're not eating right. Being hungry in class can make it hard to focus on learning. For example, when I'm hungry, I can't concentrate and I feel sick. Some people think healthier school lunches are good for students' health and can make them smarter or more active. But most students and people don't like eating vegetables or similar foods.\n\nAnother reason I don't like the change is that the cafeteria workers will waste food. This is because students might not eat things that aren't their favorites. We all know it's bad to waste food, especially when some people in the world have nothing to eat. It's also not fair for the cafeteria workers to make food that just gets thrown away.\n\nIn conclusion, I don't think changing the school lunch menu is a good idea. We shouldn't get rid of favorite foods because it could lead to waste. Students might not eat at school. They might also not have enough energy or do well in school because they're not eating well. And the cafeteria workers might be upset about wasting their work. I hope you will read my letter and think about what I've said.\n\nThank you for your time,\n\nSincerely,\nGeneric_Name"}
{"text_id": "812CBC21EE50", "output_essay": "Students can learn better by taking classes at home. They might feel more at ease and focus better on their work. For instance, some students can take breaks when they need to while studying. This helps them manage their own time. Studying from home can really help and lead to more students finishing school. Seeing their grades can show students how well they are doing. Being able to talk freely and feel sure of themselves during meetings is another plus of home learning. Video calls can help with understanding lessons, as students will likely ask more questions, which helps them learn more.\n\nStudents can spend more time on things besides homework. It's good for schools to let students have this choice. It helps them learn to plan their time. Students often do better in a place where they feel relaxed. Learning from a distance is a good choice and gives a great chance for success. More students might come to class with video calls, as they can learn and do other useful things at the same time. Teachers will like this. Coming to class is important because it shows students are responsible for their work and getting better, which is good for them.\n\nBeing able to take classes from home is really helpful, especially for students who get sick easily and can't go to school. Online classes mean these students don't fall behind, which is good for their learning. This choice can also make students less stressed, so they can think and work better.\n\nIn conclusion, students would do well with learning at home and coming to class more. Online or video calls can make a big difference. It's a better way to give support and the time needed to do well. Students will probably improve with online or video calls. I think students might also feel more sure of themselves in a place they know well, like their home."}

They can start working early, get good jobs while they are still young, and reach their goals.\n\nFirst, young people can start working early. In El Salvador, many start working at 18. For example, many finish college at 23 and then start working. Starting early lets them help their families and show others they can do the same.\n\nMy brother finished school last year at 16. He is young and now has a job at a car company. He likes his job. My cousin finished college at 20 and reached her goal by 30.\n\nSome think starting a career early is bad. They say young people should wait. They are wrong. Starting early helps families and secures a good future. It stops them from being too old to start working.\n\nSecond, young people can get good jobs early. I work as a doctor for crime scenes. I am glad for this chance because I can help my family and others.\n\nSome young people wait too long to work and can't help their families. Those who start early have more chances for the future. I finished school at 17 and was not too old to start working.\n\nFor example, my sister wants to be a Medical Assistant. She works very hard and has a good job.\n\nThird, young people can reach their dream jobs. All young people have job dreams. They want to be professionals. Some finish high school at 20 and feel too old for their dream job. Others see it as a chance.\n\nYoung graduates are thankful for their chances. They can go after the jobs they want. In many places, young people can't finish school early.\n\nSome can't find good jobs because they didn't finish school.

Making your own choices can make you happy and help you decide what's best for you. I also find it more fun to choose for myself than to let others choose for me.\n\nI choose to do great things because if I don't like what others pick for me, I won't do well. For example, my dad wanted me to play for a far team. I wanted to stay with my local team because I knew everyone. But I tried the far team and didn't fit in. They didn't pass me the ball, and the coach made me play defense. I told my dad I didn't want to play there. I went back to my old team, scored 18 goals, and won the league. I was the best forward. If I hadn't returned, I wouldn't have shown what I can do.\n\nI also think you should decide for yourself because others might make bad choices for you. Once, I had to wear a suit to a wedding because my mom said so. But everyone else wore jeans. I felt out of place. Another time, my friends chose spicy food for me, and I couldn't eat it. It was a waste of money. That's why I make my own choices now.\n\nChoosing for yourself is more fun because you do what you like. I loved fixing cars at 15 and found it fun. If you don't enjoy your job, you might quit or be unhappy. I didn't like going to church as a kid, even though my parents made me. It felt like a waste of time.\n\nChoosing your own path can bring joy. Making choices alone helps you find what's best. Enjoying what you do helps you discover what you like. That's why I chose these reasons. I think people should respect others' choices for their own lives."}

In this paper, I'm going to talk about aiming high and missing, because it's like trying to get all A's and scholarships for college. I think if you aim high and miss, you won't be perfect, but you'll be close to it.\n\nFirst, let's say you want to get all A's in your classes for a term. You take 5 honors and 2 AP classes. You work hard. You turn in all your homework and study for tests. You do well on tests. But you get 2 B's because of two projects. Still, you end up with great grades: 5 A's and 2 B's. Your GPA is 3.8, and you make the AB honor roll.\n\nNext, imagine you want a football scholarship to Louisiana State University. You eat well, train every day, and go to camps to meet coaches. You're the top player in your area. But LSU doesn't offer you a scholarship. You feel like you're not good enough. Then, Clemson University offers you a full scholarship. They are the national champions.\n\nSome people think setting low goals and reaching them is good. But what if Michael Jordan, Tom Brady, or LeBron James did that? They didn't. They keep setting new goals. Tom Brady was asked why he plays football at 42. He said he hasn't met all his goals. He has 6 Super Bowl rings and many records.

{"text_id": "92970A5AF246", "output_essay": "Imagine you are facing a big problem, and you don't think you can get past it... until you remember what the American jazz star, Duke Ellington, said: \"A problem is a chance for you to do your best.\" But what does this mean? It means that when you have a problem, you should try your hardest to beat it. I agree with Duke Ellington for many reasons.\n\nOne reason I agree with him is that you can learn and get better by dealing with a problem. Research from Harvard showed that 78% of people who had a problem tried their best to beat it and said they learned and got better from it. It's natural for people to learn from problems, whether they beat them or not. Duke Ellington also had tough times on his way to becoming famous. He faced criticism but learned from these issues and became the man we know today.\n\nAnother reason I agree with Duke Ellington is that you feel proud when you do your best. Studies show that when you try hard, you feel like you have done something great. People always want to feel proud; it's just how we are, and the best way to satisfy this is by trying hard. Duke Ellington himself became a famous jazz musician by doing this.\n\nA third reason I agree with Duke Ellington is that it shows what you can really do. A 2018 study by the Institute of Science found that when you try your best with problems, your body sends endorphins to your muscles. This makes them stronger and shows what you can really do. By taking his own advice, he showed America his true skill.\n\nStill worried about the problem you're facing? Now that you know why you should listen to Duke Ellington's advice, I believe you can handle it! So if you remember his words, and know that you can learn from it, feel proud, and show your true skill, you can beat any problem, no matter how bad or scary it is."}

They can use the internet to learn and find help for homework and projects. But they might cheat on tests by looking up answers online. If they do this all the time, they might not really learn the subjects well.\n\nThere are also great online tools that schools give to help study at home. Some students use video calls to work on homework and talk about what they need to do. The internet helps them do their work better and faster.

Security is a big worry talked about everywhere, where people are scared and don't see a good future for their kids. This fear is common where gangs or other bad groups are in charge. I think having a curfew to keep people safe is a smart move because it can change lives a lot.\n\nOne reason this is smart is it makes people safer. If the city makes a curfew, people can't be out too late or they'll be breaking the law. For instance, if you're walking home at 9 P.M. alone, you might be afraid. What if there's a man on the corner? You can't tell if he's a criminal or just a regular guy, but you're scared. A curfew tries to stop bad things from happening.\n\nAlso, this rule says teenagers out after 10 P.M. on school nights or midnight on weekends are doing something illegal. This is important because it could mean less trouble for teens. Many teens do bad things because their friends do, and this can lead to big problems like jail or death. The curfew might seem tough on teens, but it's not; it's there to keep them out of trouble and safe.\n\nThis rule could also lead to less crime in the city. Crimes are going up, and people are losing hope of getting home without harm. We're talking about all crimes, like damaging property, stealing, kidnapping, and gangs. If this rule starts, these problems should go down because of the strong law, making the city safer for everyone.\n\nBut, this rule might seem unfair. Some people, like my aunt who works late at a restaurant and walks home, would be breaking the law even if they're not doing anything bad. And what if you have an emergency and need to go out for help? These are good points against the rule, but I still think we should put people's safety first.\n\nIn the end, this curfew could help keep the city peaceful. It's meant to keep teens away from trouble and make a better place for them and everyone new."}

Elementary school helps you understand. When we grow up, we sometimes wish we could go back to being young. Kids in elementary school should know it's okay to make mistakes. They will learn and grow. Elementary school has tests you can't retake, so study hard. Kids should be happy in elementary school. You're young and stress-free. Time passes quickly, so enjoy it. Don't rush. Growing up means more tests and responsibilities. You'll have more homework and have to wake up early for middle school. High school starts later, which is nice.

After 2 hours, they came back and said they could trust me.\n\nHaving a good, confident attitude can help you get better chances, like getting into college or a good job. They usually choose the person who is generous, kind, and confident. Once, my brother Generic_Name applied to college. He was confident when he sent his application online. Later, he got a letter saying, 'We want to meet you to see if we want you at our school.' My brother is very generous and confident. I was sure he would get in. And he did. Now he goes to Generic_School.\n\nThis means that good attitudes and a positive view of life can bring you trust from others and better chances. All this comes from having good attitudes."}

My goal is to help and support the people around me. \n\nWhen I am a graphic designer, I will share stories from my own life and then talk about other things. I will talk about hard times I've had and how I kept going when things were tough. I want to tell people to get up every time they fall and to ignore those who try to put them down.

{"text_id": "0F14FEA19E2A", "output_essay": "Do you think students would do well learning from home? Learning from home can help some students because they have more time to finish their work. They can also rest when they are tired. But, students might not do well learning from home because they could cheat, they need the teacher to help them understand, and they might not focus on their work. First, students might not do well learning from home because they could cheat. For example, Generic_Name learned from home in high school. He always cheated on tests using his phone. At the end of the year, he took the SOL for his home class. He failed because he didn't know the material. Learning from home can make it easy to cheat. Second, students need teachers to help them understand things they can't on their own. Generic_Name learned from home for a class he needed to finish school. He skipped lessons he didn't understand. He needed a teacher to explain the hard parts. Often, students can't get the lessons without a teacher's help. Some say students do well learning from home because they can think more. This is true because they have time to think about things they can't in school. But, they might not focus on their work at home. For example, Generic_Name was lazy and didn't do his work on time. He needed to finish a class from home to graduate. He was too lazy to do the work and didn't take the class seriously. He failed in the end. In conclusion, students might not do well learning from home because they could cheat, they need teachers to explain things, and they might not focus on their work. Students often cheat at home because no one stops them. Teachers can explain things well, but at home, students can't find a teacher to help. Students are more likely to focus when they are in school. So, learning from home is not good for students."}

I think this is good because it gives kids chances, lets them try new things, and helps them belong to a group.\\n\\nEveryone likes to have fun, right? No one wants to be bored at home. There are many chances out there, and the principal wants to offer more. You might find school activities that match your interests. For instance, an art club. It's about drawing, painting, and learning about art. Imagine there's a drawing contest. It could make you better and teach you new things. Other clubs, like the student council, are also full of chances. If you want to lead, you can join the council.\\n\\nIt's great to learn and try new things, isn't it? You might get bored with old hobbies and want to try something else. New activities can teach you skills you've never tried before. Take 'High School Musical' for example. A boy named Generic_Name loves basketball but gets bored. He tries out for a play, even though he's never sung before. It's okay to do different things. Trying new stuff can lead to even more discoveries. I've seen it myself. A girl named Generic_Name, a dancer, tries out for soccer to do something new. Don't be scared to try new things.\\n\\nNot everyone has a group they belong to. Some students feel like outsiders and have low confidence. The principal's plan can help you find a group. Joining activities can help you make friends. Making friends is great. You can be happy to be part of a group. For example, a quiet girl named Generic_Name joins a club and makes friends. She feels happy to belong. Even if clubs don't meet every day, you can feel like you fit in. Another boy named Generic_Name finds new friends in a musical after feeling alone.

If there is an emergency, they might be scared of the police and not act quickly or at all.\n\nFreedom is very important to teenagers. If they lose their freedom, they find it hard to behave. They want to break rules. There's a saying, \"Rules are meant to be broken.\" This is what teenagers think when others set limits for them. Teenagers often act without thinking. They want to do things their own way. This is why they sometimes get into trouble. It excites them. A 10 p.m. curfew would make these feelings stronger.\n\nIn some places, teens can't drive from midnight to 5 a.m. But police say that over 70% of teen drivers still drive then. When asked why, they say things like, \"I'm hungry,\" \"I'm going home from work,\" or \"My sister is sick; I need to take her to the hospital.\" Teenagers don't go out at night to cause serious trouble. They might just hang out with friends. Many car crashes happen in the U.S., but people still drive every day. There's no law against driving even though it can be dangerous. The 10 p.m. curfew is like this. The risks are not big enough to make it a rule. Police would be focusing on the wrong things while real crimes happen elsewhere.\n\nSome people think teenagers can't be trusted at night. They believe the government should set a 10 p.m. curfew to control them. These people are not open-minded and probably don't lead their groups.\n\nThe 10 p.m. curfew should not become a law. Teenagers need to be free. If there's an emergency, they should be able to handle it right away without making mistakes."}
{"text_id": "5E26C9276FE3", "output_essay": "Is it really needed to go to classes in person if online courses or studying at home helps students a lot in their daily lives? Today, I will talk about why I think online courses are good for students in their lives. \n\nGetting up early every weekday to go to class can be hard for some, or even most, students. But if you can take online courses, you don't have to get up early to be in class by 7:20 am. I like this idea because it helps students who need to work at home or do other things to get ready for college or do two things at once. If you have a job in the morning and also have a paper or project due that day, you don't need to go to class in the morning. You would miss work and have to find another time to go, which would be a big problem if you didn't have an online course. Even if you're a high school student with no job or other big things to do, you would still like having online courses more than 8-hour classes at school. \n\nSafety is very important in your daily life. Students go to school every morning, Monday to Friday, and move from class to class for 8 hours. They might worry about their safety and how to not get hurt. Students expect the school to keep them safe while they learn for their future jobs. Online courses can help with these worries. You wouldn't want to get a call about your child getting hurt at school while you're at work. And you wouldn't want to send your child back to school if the school didn't keep them safe. This is why online courses can be safer and better for you as a parent. Also, taking online courses can cost less than going to school. \n\nWhat I think is most important about online courses is that they can make me, or other students, more independent and responsible at home or wherever we are. I know online courses aren't for everyone. They might not help some students focus or be as responsible as in-person classes. But sometimes what we do in school doesn't seem useful or clear. If I got into a fight, I could get detention, be kept in school, or even be kicked out. With online learning, this wouldn't be a problem because I wouldn't be around others or get upset over small things. These shouldn't be why I go to school or want to learn. School is for understanding the real world. Even if subjects like math don't seem to help with what I want to do, they are still important in my life. \n\nStudying from home can help me and others in many ways. But with the chance to take online courses, we also have to be good at managing our own learning. In the future, all schools should offer an online course option to make it safer for students and easier than going to a public or private school."}

It shows who I am, what makes me different from others. I agree with Lubbock because everything you do and learn lets you decide how it will change you. For example, if someone hurts you, you might want to get back at them. You choose to do that, or you can be smart and forgive them. You can choose to hurt back or forgive and move on. This is called free will. Free will means we can do what we want without others telling us what to do. Every day, we make choices that affect me and others. These choices show who I am. Jesus Christ is an example. He chose to be good and help people. He was famous and kind even when he was going to die, forgiving those who hurt him. Jesus showed us we can choose our character. I also agree because it's like my own life. I didn't know who I was or what my character would be. I just knew I could change. I started learning an instrument for fun. I loved making music. It made me love music, which is part of who I am. Learning music showed me I don't give up and I try hard. But I've also been very sad. I lost a friend who was like a brother. It affected me so much I didn't want to do anything. I changed from happy to serious. I can control who I am and what affects me. I will change in the future as I live and have new experiences. But sometimes we can't control our reactions. In the moment, you might get mad and act without thinking. Later, you face the results of what you did. You might be around bad influences and not know right from wrong. Then you live with what others showed you. You can't change if you don't know how. It's a hard topic. Both sides have good points.

We work hard to solve the problem. I agree because when we do something bad or cause a problem, we usually work very hard to get past it. Problems can be small or big. If I'm in a tough spot, I will work hard to get through it and do well. Always do your best. It helps you in the future and helps you avoid problems.

I've learned that being lazy and not trying gets you nowhere. So always do your best, even when it's tough. Try, and if you fail, try again until you're the best. I know if I set my mind to something, I can do anything and be the best. I always do my best, no matter what. If you're facing a problem, the first rule is not to give up. If you give up, it's over.

But don't give up. Do your best and learn from it so you won't make the same mistake again. Be ready because anything can happen. Always be prepared. I wonder about the saying 'A Problem Is the Chance for You to Try Your Best.' Does it mean if something happens, it's a chance to do our best? I think it depends on the person.

Many students at our school are tired of having the same food every day. They want to try different kinds of food for lunch. Eating the same thing every day can get boring. I have seen many students throw away their food because it's the same as always. My brother used to bring his own lunch because he didn't like the unhealthy food at school. Eating the same food all the time can make you lose interest in other foods. When I was 10, I got sick and could only eat soup. After I got better, I couldn't taste my usual food for a few weeks. In my home country, schools had food shops with new menus every day. I remember being excited for lunch because we could have different foods and drinks. Most students bought their lunch there. The money helped improve the school. If we change the menu, more students might buy school lunch. This could help the school make money. If we don't change the menu, everyone might bring lunch from home. This could be a problem for families who can't afford to pack a lunch. Some people might not want to change the menu. They might be okay with the same food or have no other choice. But I think a new menu is a good idea. It could make more students buy lunch at school. Our principal should make the menu better and healthier. Last time, he added more sandwiches and took away good things like ice cream and juice. We need more healthy options like salads and fruits. Too many sandwiches can make students lazy and gain weight. I stayed the same weight even when I worked out because I ate sandwiches at school. When I tried different foods in the summer, I lost weight. The principal should focus on healthy food and cut out junk food. Some students might not like healthy food, but it's important for their future health. All schools should serve healthy lunches to make us healthier and stronger. I hope my words encourage the principal to change the menu. This way, we won't waste food and everyone can have good options at lunch.

This means I can't pick my own personality traits. Also, no one is perfect, so it's not possible to choose our own personality traits. Picking personality traits and living by them are different. You might pick your traits, but you can't be sure you'll be able to follow them. Many people say, 'I am sure I can do it.' But later, they find they can't, and they feel very let down.

Being nice is good; it can make friends or family feel closer. Being nice can also reach out to others, not just friends and family, but also teachers, coworkers, and in sports. For example, if a team loses, a player from the winning team can say 'good game' to the other team.\n\nSure, feeling good is great, but what if you're not having a good day? You can ask your teacher or friends for a break. In the end, feeling good while you succeed and in other situations is good, and saying thanks for it is important because it could make you do better."}
{"text_id": "413E0A5AE69C", "output_essay": "What do I want to do? I want to do many things, and one is to learn soccer. Soccer is fun, but losing isn't, especially when others play well. It's more fun when you know how to play. If you're on a team, it's not fun to lose because you can't play well. Soccer is a sport. I'm not good at sports, but soccer looks easy and fun. However, it's hard when you don't know how to play. It seems simple to chase and kick the ball, but you need to control it and score. If you can't do that, don't play on a team; it can be embarrassing. But playing with friends is fun, even if you're not good. Learning soccer is worth it. It's not just for pros; it's for people like me who want to get better. Think of a famous soccer player. They're good, and that's why you know them. I want to be known as a good player one day, not a pro, but good enough. People everywhere play soccer, not just kids or teens, but adults too because it's fun and healthy. Usually, men play, but women can be great at it too. I hope to be as good as I want to be. Learning a new sport is hard, but if you try, you can be the best you can be. If you don't try, you won't get better. Once you learn, you'll be great at soccer. You might even be one of the best, but you have to try. In soccer, some people are great, and some have no clue. But if they play together, they'll have fun. Soccer is about having fun with friends or family. Some take it very seriously. It's a career, and you have to be good to succeed. Unlike other jobs, it's fun. I'd love it as a career, but I'm not good enough. If you or someone you know has the skills, play or encourage them. What skills? Kicking and running fast are important. Soccer is not just fun; it's exercise and keeps you warm. If you're cold, you'll warm up fast. Always bring water or a drink because you'll get thirsty from running. You don't want to be too tired and let your team down. Teamwork is key in soccer. One person can't win alone. The team works together to score. If one player can't move forward, they pass the ball. They keep passing until someone scores. In El Salvador, kids play soccer, called 'futbol,' outside their homes. It's common and important to learn. If you don't know how, you'll miss out on playing with friends. Learning soccer is exciting. Once you learn, you'll want to play all the time. To play, you need to know the rules, want to play, and have a ball. You need a team, but you can also play one-on-one. Teams make it better. I want to learn soccer."}
{"text_id": "149AA9153485", "output_essay": "Failing is just a big part of winning. To win at anything, you have to fail first. Failing is a step you take to win at what you're doing.\n\nPeople need to fail a few times to learn how to win. For instance, I played a game called Dead Ops for a while and got really good. One day, I thought I could try for the highest solo score. I did my best but didn't get close. But I learned from that try. I tried again and failed again. Even though I kept failing, I got closer to my goal each time I played. Almost two years later, I got the world record. I couldn't have done this without failing a lot and never quitting.\n\nFailing makes people grow and helps them get better. If you never fail, you won't be ready to win when it's time. Also, people who are naturally good at things often think too highly of themselves. This way of thinking won't let you push yourself. If you don't push yourself, you won't fail, and you won't move toward your goal. Failing teaches you to keep trying and shows you what stops you from winning. Take my sister, for example. She's very smart; she could read and write early on and always gets top grades easily. But because she never had to work hard, she became too proud and self-centered. Now, in harder classes, she finds it tough to handle a bad grade and to change to get smarter and do better.\n\nWinning is built on lots of failures. To win, you need to fail many times. Like my friend Generic_Name who wanted to get better at wrestling. He lost many matches but kept going. Then one day, he won against his coach. He couldn't have done it without failing, learning, and trying again. Failing isn't bad; people just see it that way. But really, nothing is more important than failing. Failing shows you the way to win. If you don't fail, you won't win.\n\nFailing and winning are two sides of the same coin. If you don't fail, you won't grow or learn important things. Winning is a prize you get after many failures. Failing is just a step to your goal, and without it, there would be no goal and no reason to push yourself."}
{"text_id": "E3F1E3B08625", "output_essay": "Three years ago, when I first came to this country, I didn't know any English. I learned a few words in my English class. The school year was almost done, and my English teacher had not given us any books to read. The tough part was when summer was over and school began again; I had forgotten all my English. The next summer, my counselor talked to my new English teacher. She said I needed to read a lot in English. My counselor asked her to give me books for the next summer. She did, and it really helped me get better at English. I didn't forget anything. Some people think that teachers should not make summer projects because students won't have time to learn what they want on their own. But I think teachers should make them. They can make projects that help students get ready for the next year. This way, students won't forget what they learned because they keep learning. \n\nMany people say teachers should not make summer projects. They say this because students won't get to choose what they learn. For example, students are stressed during the school year. They want to relax by watching TV, playing games, and spending time with family. But students can still do these things when teachers make projects. Students have the whole day. They can do the projects and still have fun. \n\nThe first reason teachers should make summer projects is to help students get ready for the next year. Teachers know what students need to learn. They know how hard the class will be if the student is not ready. For example, some students are not good at math. They get no projects in the summer. When they return to school and take a harder math class, they struggle. This is because they had no project to work on in the summer. Also, students don't know what they will learn in new classes. It's hard for them to make their own projects. \n\nThe second reason is that projects from teachers help students remember what they learned before. If teachers make projects, students can review and keep learning. Some students are far from home on vacation. But they can still do projects from anywhere. These projects might be on computers. Students can spend 10 to 15 minutes on them. So, they learn and have fun in the summer. Projects from teachers help students keep learning. This makes the next year easier for them. \n\nIn conclusion, teachers should make summer projects for students. This helps them get ready for the next year. Students can't make their own projects because they don't know how hard the class will be. Also, they keep learning with the projects from teachers. I think if teachers don't give students summer projects, they won't study. Teachers know what students need. Summer projects help students during the summer. That's why I think teachers should make the projects."}

Every day brings a chance to learn and face new problems. When I solve a problem, I learn how to fix it if it happens again. Someone could watch me work and tell me when I do something wrong. After I learn the job well, they can let me work on my own, like a mother bird does with her young. \n\nI have worked other jobs before. I've been a dishwasher, a salesperson, and a cashier. These jobs taught me different skills. As a dishwasher, I learned to work fast and do many things at once. As a salesperson, I learned how to talk to people and keep them interested. As a cashier, I was always polite and good at talking to customers. These skills are useful in many jobs. \n\nI am good at talking to people and following instructions. I might have worked with others in school or helped in my community. I know talking well is important for working well with others. I take following a leader seriously. I started learning this from my parents. They would tell you I am good at it. I listen to my bosses because not listening can cause problems and waste time. Bosses are there to help because they know more. They guide us, like a river guides deer to drink. \n\nThink about a family member, Generic_Name, who came to the U.S. from El Salvador. He only knew about farming. He could cook, play guitar, talk to people, and help them. In the U.S., he started his own business. He learned English and about business on his own. He worked so hard he thought his head might burst, but he stayed calm. He filled his head with knowledge. He learned how to lead by reading and trying things out. He has been in the news and is looking forward to retiring. He always says that hard work is worth it. \n\nIn the end, I think my uncle's story and his lessons show that anyone can be a great worker. If someone doesn't know how to do something, let them learn. Make learning fun and memorable. But the most important thing is to give them a chance to learn. If not, what's the point?"}

I agree with what Duke Ellington said, \"A problem is a chance for you to do your best.\" We all make mistakes that can cause problems. Some problems can't be fixed. Mistakes teach us what we did wrong so we don't repeat them. Repeating mistakes just causes more trouble and wastes time. You wouldn't want to be part of drama. That's why I think you should think carefully before making choices. Choose your words carefully and make sure you explain what you mean clearly.\n\nI think Duke Ellington had many problems but he made the best of them. He learned from his mistakes and found ways to move on. We all face the results of our actions. Everyone has problems and makes mistakes. We're not perfect, but we can try to be good. Duke Ellington became famous not just because he was talented, but because he worked hard and never gave up on his dreams. Problems will always be there. You might avoid some, but not all. We learn from our problems and mistakes. We only live once, so value what you have, not what others have. You can avoid some problems by being careful with what you do or say.\n\nI have my own problems too. Sometimes we say or do things without thinking. We're not perfect; we make bad choices sometimes. Even good people have a bad side, and bad people can have good sides. Our success depends on our choices. It's better to admit when you're wrong than to always lie. Lies can trap you. People will find out the truth eventually. It's best to admit your mistakes, move on, and live your life. Forgive and forget, or just forget. Problems can stress you out. Don't waste time worrying too much. Do what you need to do to solve the problems you don't want.\n\nEven famous people have problems. They're human and not perfect. Money doesn't fix everything. Life shouldn't be lived with too much stress. Don't lie about your problems; it will only make things worse. We will all succeed in our own ways. Be yourself. Your mistakes and problems can help you grow. We're not all bad, but not all good either.\n\nIt's good to listen to others' problems. You can learn from them and get advice. Talk to people you trust, like a family member who has a lot of life experience. Speak up; staying silent won't solve anything. Be clear and use facts. If you made a mistake, explain it. Try to fix problems quickly, but don't rush too much. It might take time for problems to go away. Don't stress too much about them. Have fun to take your mind off problems. Mistakes are part of life. If a problem doesn't go away, sometimes it's best to ignore it.\n\nThe people you spend time with matter. If your friends cause problems, consider meeting new people. But it's your choice who you hang out with. Friends shouldn't drag you into bad situations. You can help others with their problems too. Give them advice and spend time with them to help them relax. Problems have meanings, whether good or bad. Some people ignore problems, while others want to solve them quickly. Think before you act.\n\nHaving problems can be good. They teach you things, help you grow, and make you better at handling tough situations. Like I said, we all have problems, including me.

{"text_id": "A2B64A578852", "output_essay": "Should high schools let students finish in three years instead of four? Many students want to finish high school quickly to start college or work a year early. But, finishing high school early should not be allowed. This is because students would have to study too much and miss out on school activities, they wouldn't be able to work or spend time with family, and too much studying can stress them out.\n\nStudents who study a lot can't join in on school activities. Many students like to be part of clubs, learn about subjects they love, or play sports. These things make them excited to go to school. In clubs, students can show what they are good at or talk about what they love. Sports are a big part of high school. Many students enjoy school because they can play sports with friends. Also, every student has career interests. If they study too much, they can't focus on subjects that will help their future careers. Students need to balance study and fun. If they can't do what they enjoy at school, they may not want to go to school at all.\n\nStudying a lot also means students can't work or spend time with family and friends. In high school, students want jobs to save for college or help pay family bills. Summer and after school are when they can work to make money. Plus, students need to be with their family and friends. They look forward to summer breaks or hanging out after a long day at school. Students should have time for work, family, and friends.\n\nParents think students should study a lot because they want their kids to finish school and start college sooner. But, finishing high school early should not be allowed because it can cause a lot of stress. Students have many classes and homework. They have to do it all at once. They might stay up late, sleep less, and struggle to learn new things the next day. Stress can make students easily upset, leading to fights at school. Students need to study but also relax to avoid stress.\n\nSchool activities, clubs, and sports are why most students like going to school. High school students are teenagers looking forward to their future. Earning money and spending time with family and friends matter to them. Studying too much can make learning hard and cause stress. Finishing high school early should not be allowed because students need to balance study and fun."}
{"text_id": "05577F21EC4A", "output_essay": "Should schools decide what after-school activities students do, or should students and their parents choose? I think parents should talk with their child and decide if they will join these activities. But, students who do after-school activities might have other big tasks their parents want them to do instead. As students get older, they need to do more things like get a job, keep up with schoolwork, and learn to take care of themselves. First, students should learn what adult life is like and how hard it can be. They will need to find a job and get experience to feel motivated and do well. For example, a 17-year-old girl named Generic_Name has a job and goes to school. She wants to be a businesswoman. She has tough times but manages. She says, 'Life isn't easy. If you want to succeed, you might have to go through hard times to get what you worked for.' Generic_Name doesn't want to keep the same job forever. She hopes to do well and help her parents with money. Second, students should not use their phones or computers too much. They need to finish their schoolwork and have time to work or do other helpful activities. I know it's hard for us to do all our homework or projects. We get so stressed that we want to stop doing schoolwork. Take a 16-year-old Mexican student, Generic_Name, as an example. She had good grades but they dropped because she felt school pressure and met new friends online. These friends made her feel good, and she stopped focusing on school. But she is changing. She will solve her personal issues and ask for help at school to feel less stressed and get better grades. Finally, teenagers need to learn to live without their parents' help. They start a new part of life as adults, not just with money but also emotionally. For example, a 27-year-old Mexican woman named Generic_Name still lives with her mom and has two kids in school. She works hard for her children. The kids' dad doesn't help. He makes money but doesn't support his kids. Generic_Name's mom told her she can't always look after the kids because she has other things to do. That's why we need to be careful with what we choose to do. Generic_Name now has two jobs to support her kids. Her sister helps with the children, and she is working more to move out of her mom's house."}
{"text_id": "8B2CB9C1F189", "output_essay": "Have you ever thought about just staying home and not going to school for a day? You can do this. Some schools let you learn from home. You can use the internet or video calls to join classes. This is good for students who are sick, want to sleep better, and feel safer at home than at school. Some might say that staying home will make students lazy and not do their work. But that's not true. We want students to reach their goals. If learning from home helps, then it's a good choice.\n\nMany kids are sick and need to check their health often or take medicine many times a day. If they don't, they could get very sick and need to go to the hospital. At home, parents can remind them to take their medicine or check their health. It's also hard to make doctor's appointments that don't clash with school. But with online classes, you don't have to worry. You can watch the class later or even do it while you wait at the doctor's.\n\nSleep is important. It helps you feel ready to do things and pay attention. Sometimes kids don't sleep right away when they go to bed. They might use their phones or have trouble sleeping. Then they wake up late, miss the bus, or fall asleep in class. With online classes, they can choose when to study. This way, they can be more awake and not feel sleepy all day.\n\nWhat's the most important thing in the world? It could be you, your life, your kids, or your family. For parents, keeping their kids safe is very important. School should be fun and safe, not scary. If a child feels unsafe because of bullying or a bad teacher, online school can be a good choice. They will feel more relaxed and safe at home.\n\nSo, online classes are good for sick students, for better sleep, and for safety."}

You were honest, but it still hurt a little,\" said Generic_Name.\n\nWhen you tell someone the truth, it might hurt their feelings. But being honest is important to me. I don't want my friends to lie to me. Even if the truth hurts, it's better to be honest. Many people, especially girls, feel unsure about themselves. If you tell them the truth about how they look or act, it can make them feel bad. They might think, \"Am I really that ugly?\" I understand because I feel unsure about myself too. Sometimes, being honest isn't good. You don't know what someone is thinking or feeling every day.\n\nFrom my own life, I've learned to tell the truth. If you don't, someone will end up hurt. I've also learned not to trust everyone. That's from my own experiences, but I won't talk about that now. My friends have hurt me by being honest. But I accept that because I believe it's okay to be honest with friends.\n\nFriends might lie to you a lot. Even girls might say mean things about you. I believe that too. When people dislike you, use it as motivation. Show them you can do well in life. But being honest can also be harmful. Why? Some friends might dislike you and want to bring you down.\n\nI'm not sure if being honest is always good or bad. I've been through a lot. Of course, I want my friends to tell me the truth.

You can't always tell if someone is being completely honest with you.\n\nI can't fully say if I agree or disagree, but I have to choose. I disagree. It's better to just live and not worry about what others think. If someone really wants to tell you the truth, listen to them. Otherwise, I don't think being honest all the time is good. Many people lie to us. But there are good people who don't lie. Not everyone is bad, but some could do better. Instead of lying or being mean, be a real friend. Support them and care about their feelings rather than always being honest.\n\nFirst, think: Should I give my honest opinion, or should I support my friend? Second, think about how you'd feel if they were honest with you. Not good, right? Lastly, think about how to be a better friend. This is my final view: I completely disagree that being honest is always good because sometimes it's not.\""}

Students at school also pay for apartments and books. But online, it's easier to finish classes to graduate.\n\nMany students like online classes because traveling to school can be stressful. They can get stuck in traffic or miss class if there's an accident. I prefer online classes because we can do many things on the internet now, like work, study, or talk to teachers who are far away. We can also talk to teachers through video calls. This is a simple way to learn and ask questions. In a big class at school, it's hard to ask the teacher questions. But online, it's easier and you can learn more.\n\nAs students, we have to finish the classes we pay for. Online, you can spend more time talking to your teacher about the class. Online classes are often shorter, and you can use slides to understand better. The teacher can show you how to do things that will help you get a job later.\n\nIn the end, many students want to take classes online instead of going to school. But some people still like to study at school and spend time in the library. I think online classes help students who work and study at the same time.

{"text_id": "676A452D376B", "output_essay": "Is it smart for students to finish high school in three years and start college or work a year early? High schools have four-year programs to get you ready for college and your future. These programs work well to show you what college is like and what you need to learn. Four years is the usual time needed to teach you. Also, this time helps you in life because you can take extra classes and learn more. \n\nFirst, you need four years to learn all you need for college and life. For instance, my brother tried finishing in three years and went to college, but he wasn't ready. He wasted a year in college and had to return to high school to complete his education. This proves that trying to save a year can lead to trouble and later problems. You can't get the same education in three years as you can in four. \n\nMoreover, spending four years in high school lets you take more classes and learn extra things. In the fourth year, you can choose different extra classes. My sister, for example, speaks two languages and wanted to learn Art and French. In her final year, she could pick two electives and chose Art and French. By the end of school, she learned to draw and almost speaks French fluently. This shows the advantages of the usual four-year high school for your future. It prepares you for college, lets you learn about different cultures, and improves your language skills. \n\nSome might say finishing in three years and starting college is a good idea. They think it saves time and money, and you get the same education. They say this because some parents are happy their kids graduated in three years and saved time. But, the most visited website in Texas reports that students who spend four years in high school often graduate with honors and early. For example, my friend spent four years in high school and finished college while others, who rushed in three years, still needed credits. \n\nIn short, spending four years in high school is the best way to learn for the future. If you think three years will work, you might face problems later. But if you choose the longer, better way, you'll be rewarded. In the end, choose the safe path to avoid future issues. You can pick what you want for your future, but you can't go back to fix mistakes."}

You can try to shape your character, but it's not easy. Many things can change us. Your character can be shaped by your childhood, the people you meet, and the internet. For me, character is shaped by what we go through and what we learn. As kids, we all had someone we wanted to be like. It could have been a family member, someone famous, or a made-up character. We try to be like them. My role model is my mother. My dad left us when I was young. My mom had no money for a babysitter, so I went with her to work. She was very pregnant but still worked hard for us. She taught me to be independent and to never quit. Today, we use our phones a lot for Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, or YouTube. These apps let us see what others are doing. When you see someone rich and happy, you might want to be like them. You might work harder to reach your goals. Or, if you see someone fit on Instagram, you might want to lose weight. That person has influenced you to get healthy. Social media can change us in many ways. The people we spend time with also shape our character. We are all different. Being with others can make us better or worse. A shy person might become more talkative with the help of a friend.

{"text_id": "3A05F3FA6052", "output_essay": "Some schools make students do a project in the summer. This is to keep them learning when school is out. People can't agree if teachers or students should make these projects. But, it's clear that teachers should make them. Teacher-made projects help students learn during their break. Teachers should be the ones to make these projects, not students. \n\nTeachers know what is good for students. They teach students to think on their own. They show students how to start their projects. For example, Mrs. Generic_Name asks questions to help students think and do the project well. Teachers' knowledge can motivate students to start a project. It helps them understand and answer questions about the project. \n\nTeachers are older and more experienced than students. They use their experience to help students understand projects. Teachers who have done the project before can share tips. For example, Mrs. Generic_Name talked about her trip to the Bahamas. It was full of useful information. Teachers' past experiences can give students new ideas and information. \n\nTeachers have many ideas for projects. They can make it easier for students to understand the project and why it's important. A teacher's many ideas can make students do better. They help students figure out all the details they need. For example, a teacher might give quotes to help students come up with ideas for the project. Having lots of ideas makes it easier to understand and make details for the project. \n\nI think summer projects are good for us students. They let us keep learning when we're not in school. Teacher-made projects are better because they have more details and ideas. They guide us on how to do the project. Teachers can give us a lot of information that helps us understand the project. They think of many ideas before giving us a project. \n\nTeachers check the project before giving it to us. They make sure we can do it. They give us choices and clear instructions. This helps us understand and follow what to do. Student-made projects can be good too, but they might not have enough details. Teacher-made projects are well thought out. They match what we need to learn. They are creative and full of ideas. This helps us learn more. \n\nPeople should know that summer projects are good for learning during a break. They should be made by teachers. They have lots of ideas and are well planned. They are checked to make sure students can do them. Teachers help us understand and follow the project. Having teachers design them gives us ideas that help us understand the project better. It adds more to the project and helps us plan it out. So, summer projects should be made by teachers."}
{"text_id": "3CB26FC60794", "output_essay": "STUDENTS SHOULD PICK A JOB IN HIGH SCHOOL\n\nWhat is a job? A job is the work you do in your life, especially the kind you choose and keep doing. It's what you should think about in school before you finish high school, college, or community college. You should know what you want to study before you leave high school.\n\nAs children, we watched lots of movies, listened to music, and saw shows. We liked many people and wanted to be like them. Some children who saw adventure movies thought they could fly. Others who liked music wanted to be famous singers. They also thought they could go to the moon and have fun without time limits or eat a lot.\n\nAs we grow older, we learn more about the people and places around us. We see how things work, both good and bad. We learn what we should and shouldn't do. Some choose to do bad things: steal, fight, be rude, lie, bully, be late or skip school, not do their work, hurt others, join bad groups, and cheat on tests. Others choose to do good things: stay out of fights, get good grades, join helpful clubs, be honest on tests, come to school on time, finish their work, and more.\n\nIn high school, some students think they know what they want to study because it seems easy. Others don't know what they want to study. Many parents don't understand their children's skills. They just want them to be doctors or scientists to make money. This isn't always right because not all students are good at science. I think schools should have meetings with counselors three times a year. This would help students understand their skills and choose what to study in college with confidence.\n\nIn conclusion, if high school students know what they want to do before they finish school, they will do the right things. They will find that things are easier for them."}

Have they told you, 'You're always on your phone!'? It's good for students to join at least one school activity. It helps them meet new people, try things they've never done, and share who they are. There are many activities to choose from after school, like sports, art, and helping clean the school. This gets students more involved with their school. \n\nJoining activities helps students meet new people. They talk to other students and get better at communicating. This can help them in school and in life. They also learn about others. For example, they can talk about their past, what they like, their goals, and their families. \n\nStudents can try new things in these activities. They find out what they like and learn about themselves. They can do art, play sports, or make music. They learn new skills and can teach these to others. They also learn about different jobs, subjects, and languages. This can help them when they grow up. \n\nActivities help students get involved. In the past, kids played outside without electronics. They were full of energy and liked being outdoors. Now, a 10-year-old might play video games all day. Kids use their phones for 4 hours a day. If schools have activities, more students would join in. Parents can help by supporting their kids. \n\nIn conclusion, joining activities at school has many benefits. Students can make friends, try new things, and show who they are. Some people think this takes time away from family. But what if parents don't encourage activities? Kids will just keep using their phones. If parents don't want that, they should encourage school activities."}
{"text_id": "CDE5799DB671", "output_essay": "Many people argue about whether high schools should let students finish in three years instead of four. Some think a three-year high school is a good idea. They say students who work hard to finish in three years should be praised. They can take extra classes in the summer or at night. But I think the usual four years are better. Students need time to learn, take extra classes for fun, and work after school. First, students need time to understand what they learn. If they rush, they might forget it all quickly. Taking classes in summer or at night could overwhelm them. Sure, some students learn fast, but we should treat everyone the same. Second, all students should try fun classes. School is tough, and they need a break. With four years, they have time for classes like music, which can be enjoyable and lead to future careers. Fun classes help students make friends and learn to work together. This is good for getting jobs later. They also help students relax and stay away from bad things like drugs or gangs. Third, some students have to work after school. If they pick a three-year program, they won't have time to work because of extra classes. But with four years, they can work and do their homework. It's important for kids to learn about work and school. Four years give them that chance. In conclusion, the four-year high school is better than the three-year one. The three-year program is too rushed and doesn't prepare students well for college or jobs. The four-year program gives more benefits. It gives time to learn, have fun in elective classes, and work after school. These things help students a lot. If we prepare students slowly and help them in every way, the world will be better."}

They are fun and healthy. Joining sports is a good choice. It helps students make friends and feel like they belong. They should join to gain confidence and not be scared. Joining clubs and sports is important.\n\nStudents should join at least one activity. They could help make the yearbook. The yearbook helps save memories of school and friends. They could also join the student council. This might be enjoyable for them. Joining more activities is a good way to learn and feel part of a group.

Some people might not have the skill or interest. If students don't want to do sports or other choices, it's okay. They might not want another class. The principal's decision shouldn't be forced on everyone. We should talk to the students about it. If some agree, then we should add more choices. Not just sports, but maybe helping with the yearbook or being part of the Student Council. There are only a few activities, and they might not be fun for everyone. That's why they weren't talked about before. And these few choices involve a lot of moving and exercise. So, I really don't agree with making everyone join in. It could make students not come to class. They might not like it, it's not what they want to do, or they might not come to school at all on days when they have to do the activity. This isn't what the principal wants. The principal wants us to move and exercise, but the students don't. They might also complain. Students could often tell their teachers they don't want to be there. Or they might be rude to the teacher who is trying to help. I think it's better to keep things as they are and not force sports or other activities on everyone."}
{"text_id": "A0CC57255EF3", "output_essay": "Many young people think that their personality or actions help them decide what they want to do later in life. Personality is important for success. I believe that our personality is shaped by things we can't control because we copy others, we hide our true selves, and we try to be the best. Copying someone doesn't show your real personality or feelings. It's not good because if the person you copy has bad thoughts, you might too, and that's not who you are. For example, my sister admires Cardi B, a well-known singer. She began to dress and wear makeup like her. Once, she wanted to change her body. Our parents told her she could enjoy Cardi B's music but shouldn't try to change herself. She was upset at first but later she understood. If you hide who you are, you act without purpose and don't make smart choices. I almost smoked marijuana at a friend's party when I was 15. My friend called me names when I refused. I almost gave in, but I remembered my parents' warning and decided not to. I called them to take me home. I learned to make good choices. Trying to be the best can make others view you differently. No one is the best; we are all equal and can learn. My cousin tried to be the best in our family. We explained that everyone is equal and can learn. Finally, not being true to ourselves hides what we can really do and our true goals. If we are true to ourselves, we will think before we act, do things with love, and show our true abilities. Being true to our personality is important for success."}

Some students need more or less time, based on what they know. Some can start working early because they want extra time for themselves. It's smart for students to finish high school in three years. This helps them learn more and set their future goals. First, finishing high school in three years is smart because students can learn more. For instance, some new students from other countries don't even know how to write their names when they start high school. But high school helps them, and soon they can speak and write English well. These students think three years in high school is just right. In short, three years is a great chance for students from other countries. Next, it's smart for students to finish high school in three years to set their goals. For example, a student named Generic_Name at Generic_School was scared she wouldn't learn English or graduate on time. But she learned English in one year. In the next two years, she got ideas to help her in college. She also set her future goals. Students need three years like Generic_Name did. She finds those years very helpful. In short, three years are important to plan your future and learn a lot in high school. Some think it's good to start working early. They say it gives extra classes and time to finish goals. This might be true, but not all students need this extra year. They feel it's a waste of time. Most students are ready for college after three years. In the end, it's best to finish high school in three years. Students should know that starting work early is a waste of time. Many students want to finish school in three years and go to college. This is a wise choice they make."}

Some people really need someone who will always be honest with them, and they will let you know if they don't like something you did or said. \n\nFirst, it's good to have someone who is always honest with you. Some people don't like hearing the truth because it's hard to accept. But it's helpful because then you know what people think about you or what you do.

You can also be a better person by being honest. \n\nSecond, honesty can be painful, but that pain tells you that what you're hearing is real or that's how people see things. Even if it's tough, you have to deal with it. Everyone has good and bad sides, and we can't change that. But having someone who tells you the truth, even if it's hard to hear, is valuable.

It's tough to trust people because there aren't many who are honest. But we all need to be honest with each other. There are many good people who are great at many things, but they don't always tell the truth. And it's not just good people who can be honest.

My third reason is that if students make their own summer projects, they might choose something that won't help them. Teachers, not students, should make the summer projects because students don't know what they need to do.\n\nThe first reason is that teachers have spent the whole school year with their students. They know what each student is having trouble with. So, when it's time to choose a summer project, they know which one is best for their students. This way, students won't face the same issues next year.\n\nThe second reason is that a teacher already knows what to do. Teachers have given out projects for a long time; they know which ones will be good for their students. If a student makes the project, it might not be good for everyone, or it might not make sense to others. Also, a student doesn't have as much experience as a teacher who has worked with students for many years.\n\nThe last reason is that a student might not know the best project for themselves or might not take it seriously.

They tried to find the kid who threw the rock, but they couldn't.\n\nMy teacher told me about a boy in seventh grade. He didn't want to work or study. He just wanted to talk to his friends or use his phone. The teacher warned him that he wouldn't do well in life if he didn't work hard. The boy started to work and study. Now, he's in high school and getting ready for a job.\n\nMy teacher also told us about something that happened last year. She found a $50 bill on the street. She looked around but couldn't find who it belonged to. So she took it and gave it to a homeless person instead of keeping it. We should sometimes give to others, not just take. The homeless person was very happy with the $50.\n\nIn conclusion, it's important to learn from what others have been through and what they tell us."}

I think this is not good because you don't get much help, you work alone, and it's not like being at school in person. \n\nIf you choose to take classes from home, I say it's not good because teachers won't help you much. Sure, you can call or video chat, but it's not the same. Once, I was sick with the flu for a week. I emailed my teacher about what I missed. She told me to check Teams. But how was I supposed to know what to do? She didn't help me. That's why you should go to school. \n\nI also think taking classes from home is bad because you work alone. In school, you can work with others sometimes. Say the teacher lets you work in a group of four. Not everyone has to do everything. You just help out a bit, so you don't have to do all the work alone. That's why working at home by yourself is not good. \n\nThe last reason I think it's bad is because it's different from being at school. You can join clubs or play sports. School is the best for learning and making friends. They have soccer games and dances too. And you can eat good food in the cafeteria. That's why students should go to school. \n\nIn conclusion, taking classes from home is a bad idea. If you stay home, you won't do as much, you won't have friends to talk with, and you might not get some of the work."}

Many people think it's better to set low goals and hit them than to aim too high and miss. But it's good for people to set high goals. This is because young people work harder, teachers share hope with students, and grown-ups teach kids to think positively. \n\nSome think students should not set high goals because they might give up if they fail. Others say teachers don't push students enough. And some think grown-ups show kids bad habits. \n\nFirst, young people work harder. They pay more attention in school and study a lot. They ask for help when they need it. For example, they might stay after school or study online at home. They also learn from mistakes. They cheer themselves up when things go wrong. This way, they learn from every error. By working hard, they have a better chance to meet their goals. \n\nAlso, teachers share hope with students. They help kids keep trying, even when they fail. Students feel better and more hopeful because of their teachers. For example, if a student is scared of a test, the teacher helps and tells them to do their best. Teachers also love their work more. They get new ideas from students. They want to help, so they look for new ways to make students do well. Like, during tests, teachers work hard to get students ready. Sharing hope between teachers and students is key to reaching goals. \n\nLastly, grown-ups teach kids to think positively. They show by doing that it's okay to dream big. Besides school, grown-ups help and guide kids. For example, they can play with little kids and set good examples. Also, thinking positively helps grown-ups worry less. They can finish their work without stress. For example, they don't have to worry all the time. If they stay positive, they'll keep trying even when things go wrong. Being hopeful is important to make dreams come true. \n\nIn conclusion, everyone should dream big. It makes young people work harder, helps teachers and students share hope, and teaches kids to be positive. If people don't aim high, they'll never know what they can do. They'll give only a little to the world. People should aim high and not fear failing. Falling and getting back up is part of life. The goal is to keep going."}

This means they can start college early, work to save money, and it's good for them to finish early. It helps them figure out what they love, what they want to do, and what job they want. If students finish high school in three years, they can start college early. This could mean finishing college early too. They can go to college younger. This is good for those who want to work in fields like medicine, law, or politics. It's great to finish early, go to college, and get degrees like a Master's or PhD. Learning is important. Someone smart once said, 'Even when school is done, you keep learning.' We should always think about our future and make plans. Also, if students finish in three years, they can work part-time or full-time to save for college. They can go to college and work. Working makes them think about their life and future. When they leave high school, they leave their childhood. They start to see what life is really like. They learn how to handle life on their own. They have to make good choices and plan for their future. Finishing early is good because it helps students find what they want to do. When they leave high school, they think about their future and what they love. Starting college and working is hard. But these hard times help them find the right way in life. They find what they love, set goals, and pick what to study and work in. In the end, it's good and doable for students to finish school in three years.

They need to remember to buy things for their online classes too. Doing things for themselves and their family shows they care. Another reason to choose online learning is to have more time with family or do activities like sports. If you go on a trip, you can bring your school stuff and do it when you have time. You can always catch up later. Don't forget to finish your schoolwork. You can tell your teachers you're away. If you play sports, online learning can give you more time for that. You can choose when to learn and work, day or night, whatever works for you. I've seen that some kids like to work alone. They feel better away from crowds. They might feel this way because of things that have happened to them. Sometimes they leave places at school where they don't want to be. Then they get in trouble.

{"text_id": "7F3B3A0D56CF", "output_essay": "Hello, young students! Today, I'll teach you how to be nicer, even if you're not feeling good and are mean to others. I'll share three simple ways to get better. But first, know that these tips won't work right away. You must keep trying. Remember these five words: plan, rethink, try, result, restart. I'll explain them soon. Let's begin!\n\nFirst, to be nicer, show respect to everyone. It's clear, but important. If you're mean and there's someone you don't like, saying one kind thing can change a lot. You don't have to be friends, but you should still be respectful. Compliments can make that person happy. That's the first step to being nicer.\n\nNext, think about how to be nicer. Did saying something nice help? If you're confused, I'm talking about the outcome. Did it work? What did you think while being nice? If you're still lost, let's talk about 'plan.' Planning means thinking about if something will work. You guess what might happen. That's all for planning. The next step is 'rethink.' Always think before you act. You can't know if it will work until you try. That leads us to 'try.' You have a plan and are ready to act. After trying, we see the 'result.' How did it go? If it went well, you move to the last step, 'restart.'\n\n'Restart' means trying again. Not everyone gets it right the first time. Keep trying until you succeed. That's all for these steps!\n\nIf you're sad or need to talk, tell someone or call a help line. You're not alone. Now, the last step to being nicer is to be yourself. It's key to show your true feelings and feel better. If you're shy, look at people's noses instead of their eyes. Don't change who you are. People like you for being real. Being yourself makes you feel proud. No matter who you are, people will accept you. This is a big step in being a better, prouder person!\n\nThat's it. Sorry if it was long. These are the main three steps to improve yourself, plus five small mental steps. Thanks for reading; I hope you liked it!"}

They want the best for themselves and can start learning about the job they want to do when they're older. Choosing a job early, in 9th or 10th grade, can be hard. But it would help if they tried job-related classes to see if they like them. If they do, they can keep going. Sometimes, students feel lost in these classes because there are many choices for the future, or they don't know what to do after high school.\n\nI'm in a class called \"Social Media Marketing.\" It's about selling things and business ideas. I like this class a lot. At first, I thought it would be tough, but it was easy. Later, it got a bit harder when we learned about money. We watched a video and then answered questions, which was hard at first. But another student helped me and showed me some examples. The best part of my class is going on trips. We go to fairs, Washington D.C., other schools, New York City, and Virginia Beach. My friend takes a dance class. She likes it because she meets new people, enjoys music, and learns new things. When I walk by the cooking class, it smells so good. I wish I had taken it, but it's too late for me.\n\nIf someone wants to do makeup after high school, they need to go to beauty school for two to four years. Then they can choose to go to college or not, but it will cost money. Next year, I will take a class about animals. I'll learn about grooming and finding out what's wrong with them. I have a puppy I hope to bring to class, but I need to ask my teacher first. It's hard to pick a class. I like business, but I want to learn about animals more. I wanted to own a makeup shop, but it's too expensive. So, I chose to study animals because I want to learn something new.\n\nJeffree Star is a famous person who had a tough life. He lost his dad when he was four and moved out because his mom drank too much. He lived with his grandparents until he finished high school. He didn't know what class to take, so he chose cosmetology because he liked hair and makeup. After high school, he didn't want to do makeup. He wanted to be in a band, so he became a musician. But he got mean comments online and was called racist. In 2015, he wanted to change his life. He wasn't selling much makeup, but he made videos on YouTube. Between 2016 and 2017, he started selling his own makeup and did well from 2018 to 2020. Sometimes people don't make choices because they don't know what to do after high school.\n\nSome parents might not want their kids to take job classes in high school. They think the kids are too young and the classes are too hard. But parents should talk to their kids about why they want these classes. Students should pick classes they like and think they can do well in. Parents should see the classes at the school and talk to the teachers. Even though these classes don't have homework, they need note-taking and projects. I want people who don't agree to think about my reasons. It's good to take a job class.\n\nI believe students should take a job class early to get ready for their future. If they don't like the class, they should talk to their parents or counselors. They can find other options. After high school, they need to decide what to study in college. I tell students to try a class to find what's best for them. I care about them and want them to make good choices for their future."}

For example, if someone wants to play football or soccer, they can. If they want to play, they must sign a form. This form says that if they get hurt, they won't blame the school. Some students like to help with the yearbook. They design the cover and add student photos. To work on the yearbook, you need good art and writing skills. If not, the yearbook might not look nice. There's also a contest for the best yearbook cover design. You can also help in the student council for a day. You would do things like help in the office and assist teachers with their work. This can make you feel useful. If you want to be a teacher, this experience can help you. So, I agree that playing sports, making the yearbook, and being on the council are good for you.

For instance, imagine a game on the smart board. You have to join in to play. This helps you go over things you don't get. To pass your SOL, you must go over all we talk about. Joining in also shows teachers you know it all, you listen, and you follow what they say. It helps us learn in different ways. I joined in every time in math class until I got it. Then I did better, and no one had any problems. I know some don't like it, but that's how it is. My brother never joins in, but it doesn't change his grades. \n\nI guess I also disagree because some don't want to join in. They might be nervous or just not feel like it. Some are shy and scared to stand up and talk when the teacher calls their name. They fear they won't know the answer. Some students want to join in because they know the answer, while others don't because they are shy, nervous, and scared. But why not join in when we want to? Some are uncomfortable, lazy, or stressed about it. I see them act moody, but I don't know why. My counselor told me to focus, and I try. My old best friend thought caring about grades more than friends was dumb, but I think grades are more important. That's why I always go to class. \n\nWe need to join in; we have no other choice because it helps us learn. But I agree we need to get used to speaking in front of others. I know we're shy, nervous, scared, and uncomfortable, but we'll get used to it. High school is different, and we'll do it there, so I'll get used to it. Like giving a speech, it's scary to write and read one that's long. But reading to everyone is okay; everyone does it. I was scared until I knew everyone; then I wasn't nervous. I get why some don't want to join in. \n\nOnce you're friends with everyone, you're not nervous. That's what happened to me. Now I'm not afraid to stand up and talk. You get over your fears, then you can speak up and join in. You learn what the teacher teaches to pass your SOL. Students go to school to learn what they don't know but want to know later. My mom didn't go to school when she was thirteen. Now I go, and I want to tell her everything so she knows too. My dad didn't go to school at thirteen because they had no money for it. But now I go, and I want to learn about the world, like about the coronavirus in VA. I want to know more to help my family. \n\nI think people should join in, scared or not. You learn by joining in, like with the smart board game. In math class, I kept trying even when I got it wrong. I wasn't nervous. I asked questions and tried to guess the right answer. My parents want me to get A's. Some students don't want to work or join in because they don't know and don't want to learn, like my best friend. She doesn't want me to teach her. She talks with boys, but grades are what matter for getting a good job and a nice life. It's important not to repeat a grade. I've been joining in since elementary school. I'm here to learn and help my family. After the coronavirus, my mom and I are scared. They say it can kill you. Now I want to learn more about it, maybe read books and find definitions to inform my family and friends. I think we should do the activity to get good grades. If you don't join in, you might not pass and learn new things. Grades matter, so I say do the activity, even if it's hard. We'll keep trying to finish, pass, and get A's, like in science. We have to do a project to know the subject and get an A, and it's the same for other classes. High school might have a lot of this."}

If you're around someone a lot, you might start to act like them. People often repeat what their friends say or copy what they do. In tenth grade, my friend Generic_Name changed after he made new friends. He used new words and started skipping school. He even got into drugs and drinking. I stopped talking to him because he was too different, just following his new friends. But some people decide on their traits themselves. They don't let others influence them and want to stand out. There are kind people who help others and stay the same no matter what. In ninth grade, I knew a girl who always did her work, no matter what others did.

It is good to have more options to pick from. This makes life much easier. The more tips you get, the better you think about the plan and what will happen.

Getting more tips helps you think more. This thinking changes what you decide to do. More tips mean you learn more about the choice and your actions. For example, if you want to buy a better house or spend money on better things, you need to know what others think is best for the environment. Looking at what others think about what you might do or make better can change your mind or actions. It all depends on if the advice is good or not.

Duke Ellington, a famous American Jazz musician, once said, \"A problem is a chance for you to do your best.\" I think he's right because you can learn from your mistakes, get better at avoiding them, and help others not to make them too.\n\nFirst, I think Ellington is right because you can learn from your mistakes. I was playing soccer one day and kept missing the goal. Then, a pro soccer player told me I was kicking the ball wrong. He showed me how to do it right. At first, I still missed, but soon I could score goals. A week later, I could make every shot. Days later, I thanked him for his help. Another time, I was playing baseball with my brother. A friend said he'd give a prize to the winner. I only hit one home run. My friend showed me a better way to hold the bat. Soon, I was hitting more home runs. Weeks later, I could hit every ball.\n\nNext, I think he's right because you can get better at not making mistakes. Some people don't think you should see problems as chances, but I don't agree. In science class, I had to do a project but didn't know how to give good examples. A classmate helped me learn to research. My first project wasn't great, but the next one was much better. Once, I almost got into a car with strangers wearing masks. I escaped and later refused a ride from another stranger. I ran away and called the cops. They caught them the next day.\n\nLast, I think he's right because you can help others avoid your mistakes. In math class, I had trouble with a problem. The teacher helped me, and then I could do it on my own. My friend had the same problem, so I helped him. He learned to do it right. Months ago, my friend and I were playing football and missing goals. A good player showed us what we were doing wrong. I learned the right way and later taught my friend.\n\nIn conclusion, I agree with Duke Ellington. You can learn from mistakes, get better at avoiding them, and help others not to make them.

They always told me, 'Your personality is what you decide to make it.' I didn't believe this until I was older. I agree with John Lubbock, a British naturalist and politician, that our personality is our choice. It is what we decide to make it. First, the place where you are born and grow up greatly shapes your personality. For instance, if you grow up in a good area, you're more likely to be a nice person, well-educated, and have good traits. I grew up in a nice area in Vietnam with no lies, fights, or gangs. I didn't face those problems. This helped me become honest and have strong morals, which was very useful in school. Second, parents are very important in shaping who you are. The way they raise you matters a lot. If they are strict and push you to focus on school, you're more likely to do well and teach your kids the same. My parents were typical Asian parents. They wanted me to do well. They made me do homework right after school and go to bed early at 9:30 PM. This helped me be ready for class and taught me to be responsible early on. Third, how you behave and treat others also shapes your personality. Asian parents often teach their kids to respect older people and help those in need. In my family, I learned to respect elders and greet them properly. This taught me to respect everyone. Still, some people might develop good personalities on their own, without help. But this is rare. Without the things I mentioned, it's hard to develop a good personality by yourself. So, your personality is what you decide to make it. The three things I talked about show how they help you create the personality you want. Choosing to have good traits can be very useful for your future."}

Some people might wonder if this is a good idea. I think it is good to let some students finish high school in three years if they deserve it and have worked hard for it. They might have to give up extra classes and use their summer or after-school time. Some people might not agree because they think students are too young for adult tasks. But I think it is a good idea for some students to finish high school in three years. They could do something more useful in their fourth year, some want to finish school quickly, and it teaches them to be responsible early on. First, students could do more important things during what would be their fourth year of high school. For example, a student could start college early, finish their career sooner, and have a better life sooner. They could make plans for their life and do useful things during that time, which is often why they want to finish school early. Next, some students want to finish school as soon as they can. They might not like school and want to be done with it, or they want to be successful early in life. It's important to know that some students may not live with their parents and need to work while also wanting to finish school. Being able to graduate in three years could really help them. For example, a friend of mine wanted to finish school early because he didn't have support from his parents and needed to work to live while trying to be successful. Finally, students can learn to be responsible early by finishing high school in three years. Leaving school early could help them grow mentally and take on adult tasks, which I think is good. They would become stronger in character and learn to deal with life's hard parts. Many high school students are not responsible, and the chance to finish school early might make them take things more seriously. In conclusion, is it a good idea to finish high school in three years? I think it is a good choice for students who are ready and have enough credits to graduate. Those with big goals in life should think about finishing high school in three years. While some may think teenagers are not ready for the world's tasks, I believe that finishing high school early is good because it lets students do more meaningful things, helps those who want to finish quickly, and teaches them to be responsible at a younger age."}

I think the school lunch menu needs to become healthier. The school should make the lunch menu healthier for many reasons. For example, our lunch menu has more sugar than protein. This makes it hard for students to pay attention in class because they get too much energy from the sugar. Also, healthier food would help keep students healthy. Some students want to eat healthy food at school to stay fit, but they can't because there aren't many healthy options with protein. This makes some students skip eating for the whole day. Having a healthy school lunch menu is a great idea. It can make our school a healthier place. For example, if the menu is healthy, more students will eat at school because there won't be any bad food. Also, students will be able to focus better in class. This means they won't eat sugar or fat, which helps them stay on task and keep fit. Some people think the school should not change the lunch menu because some students like the current food. They don't want a different menu. But we need to think about keeping students healthy. Many students try not to eat bad food, but they have to eat what the school serves. Not all of it is healthy. So, students either don't eat or eat because they are hungry and have no other choice. But the school lunch menu should change to improve our students' health. In conclusion, the school should make the lunch menu healthier to help our students stay healthy. The menu should also help students focus better in class.

There are many sicknesses you can get if you don't eat well.\n\nBeing very overweight is a big issue in many places. It means you have too much body fat because of bad eating habits.

They worked hard in sports and school, and now they are professional athletes. \n\nEven as adults, we can change. If we move to a better place or meet better people, we can become better too. Take DeMar DeRozan, a pro basketball player. He grew up in a hard place but stuck with basketball. Now he plays in the NBA and helps his friends and family. \n\nSome think we pick our personality because we choose our friends. They say we change to fit in with them. I don't agree. We choose friends who are like us and fit our personality and where we live. \n\nOur personality is something we can't completely control. We might try to change, but we keep the traits our parents and home gave us. We should accept who we are. Let's not change for the worse. Let's use our personality for good."}
{"text_id": "3B7430E38767", "output_essay": "Being a teenager is important for everyone; it is the happiest and most joyful time. Like the wind, once it passes, we can't catch it again. Every day we spend in school is valuable, and we won't forget those memories. It's not good for students to try to finish high school in three years instead of four. It's not a good idea for them to hurry through it. First, we can't rush learning. Students need time to remember what they learn at school. They need to gain experience and then use what they know in real life. Many students who come from other countries start with no English. They can hardly talk to other students or teachers. So, they need time to learn English and other subjects. If we tell them to hurry through high school, they might want to quit. They also need to get used to a new place and a new country because everything is different. Second, every student under eighteen is still a child. Children need to play, learn, and rest. Then they grow up. We shouldn't force them to act or study like grown-ups. In high school, it's easy for kids to make friends and share secrets. So, it's bad to use all their free time for extra study. It's also bad to use all their time in optional classes just for studying. In these classes, students can learn new things or stay fit in gym class. If we stop all optional classes and sports to study more, it will cause stress. Too much stress can hurt their mental health. Last, spending one year in high school to study or work is not fair. After high school, college students don't have much time to make friends because they're busy studying. It's hard to make friends. If they get a job after high school, they can make friends at work. But it's different from high school friends because they're all grown up now. Thinking like an adult can make it hard to make friends. Think about two people: one spent three years in high school and did well in life, and another enjoyed four years and also did well. Which one is better? And when they talk about high school to their grandkids, the one who stayed four years will have more stories than the one who stayed three. In the end, it's about how we live and what we choose for ourselves. Staying in high school for four years is better than rushing out in three years with no time to rest, play, and learn."}

If you can stay true to yourself when the world tries to change you, that's a big deal. Try to be what you want to be. Never act like someone else. Be you, always. I will share my thoughts and what others think about this topic. People have different views.\n\nRalph Waldo Emerson said, \"Being yourself in a world that tries to change you is the biggest achievement.\" I agree because many people pretend to be someone else. They do this because others say to or they feel they're not good enough. Pretending is bad. You end up doing things you don't like. It's best to be yourself. You're the best at being you. Don't listen to those who say you can't be yourself. They don't know you. By being yourself, you can do great things. Many people change themselves. They achieve things, but they can't stay true to themselves. I've been there. As a kid, I tried to fit in with others. I would lie to make friends. I got into trouble to be with them. But I got tired of it and started doing my own thing. I kept my friends and made new ones by being me. I did things I liked, like playing soccer and learning about cars. I wouldn't have done these if I had changed.\n\nNow, some people think changing is good. It lets you try new things. Maybe you'll like it. If you fail, some might laugh. People change because they see others doing it. They want to fit in. But change can be good. For example, if you were bad and decide to be good, that's positive change. You chose to change for yourself, not for others. But not everyone agrees with me. People see things differently.\n\nI've shared my view and others' on Emerson's quote. I agree with him. It's a big achievement to be yourself when others want you to change. But don't listen to them. Be yourself, always. You don't have to change for anyone. Be true to yourself. People might talk if you're different, but ignore them. You know yourself best. You don't need to change for them. But if you want to change for the better, that's okay. That's your choice. Many should aim for this achievement, but not everyone will understand. Just be yourself."}

It is also nice to be outside playing sports. You get exercise and you get stronger. When you run a lot, you might feel tired at first. But you will get used to it. Running is a sport that helps you build strong legs. This is true for track and cross country too. Riding a bike also makes your legs strong. Playing sports is good for your health. But sometimes you can get hurt. You might break a leg, twist an ankle, or hurt your knee. These injuries can take a long time to get better. But they do happen sometimes. Sports make me happy because they are fun. I sweat when I burn calories. But you don't have to play sports every day. You can play just two times a week or even every day.

Some students do nothing in online classes, and not everyone has a computer or internet. I believe online classes are not a good idea. It was hard to weigh the good and bad points. We can see that it has more bad points. It is harder and costs more than regular school because you need to buy a computer and get internet if you don't have them. So, I think online classes are harder.\n\nFirst, I think it is harder for teachers to teach online. They have to do more work than in regular school. For example, teachers have to teach every day to many students and give different lessons and homework for seven classes. They can't tell if all students understand. This is why I think online teaching is hard. Teachers also have their own things to do at home. Some have kids to look after, making it harder to do everything at home.\n\nAlso, some students don't have a computer, which is a problem for online classes. Even if schools give out computers, it's a big responsibility to take care of one that isn't yours. Most students don't have internet at home. So, when online classes are the only choice, some students choose to stop going to school. It's hard, and not all parents can afford a computer or internet. It's even harder when there are several kids at home who need to study online. What about young kids who can't use a computer and their parents can't help them? There are many downsides to online classes.\n\nHowever, some people think online classes are easier and better because we are at home. We don't have to wake up early or spend money on food. But that's the only good thing about home classes. I think some students don't work hard in online classes because they lack responsibility. It's also easier for them to just quit. Parents can't always help when we don't understand something. We never see the teachers, and having seven different ones makes it hard.\n\nIn conclusion, there are many reasons why online classes are hard. The only good thing is staying at home. But it's harder for teachers because they have to do everything online. It's also hard and costly for students and parents. Parents can't always check if their child is doing their work because they can't talk to the teacher. Some people can't use computers well. It's easier to go to regular school. This is what I think, and others might agree or disagree."}

This is good because you learn about your school and can show school spirit. It also helps you stay fit. Most kids at school don't join in because they're lazy or they have to look after their brothers or sisters. For example, when I was in fifth grade, I played basketball and joined a club called 'On My Road.' We did our homework and then played different sports outside. I really enjoyed after-school activities because I could take a break from my sisters and my mom, who is always cleaning, which bothers me. As soon as I get home, my mom tells me to clean my room and the bathroom. After cleaning, I hardly have time for homework. Some activities can help you later on. For instance, you might go to college for free if you're good at school and sports. I think sports are fun because you meet new people, get better at the sport, and play against other schools.

Life becomes tough when people work toward their goals. Keeping excitement is important for people to succeed. When people fail, they often learn things that help them later. Success is moving from one failure to another without losing excitement because people get experience and feel good about themselves.\n\nFirst, success is moving from one failure to another without losing excitement because people get experience. For example, Generic_Name wanted to be a teacher and live on her own. Her parents said she couldn't because it was a big step. She didn't listen and moved out. After three months, she ran out of money and had to go back home. Even if people don't reach their dreams, they learn from their actions. This learning is good for the future. In short, people get experience that helps them later.\n\nSecond, success is moving from one failure to another without losing excitement because people feel good about themselves. For example, Generic_Name needed to pass a math test to graduate. It was very hard, and she wasn't sure she could do it. She studied for two days, passed the test, and graduated. When people work hard, they can reach their goals, even if it's hard. In short, trying hard and not giving up leads to success.\n\nSome might say that success isn't about moving from one failure to another without losing excitement. They might ask why people would try again after failing. But success is about this because life is about getting up after falling down. For instance, Generic_Name was rich with the best cars and phone. He fell in love with a girl who then took all his money. He lost everything and lived on the streets. A year later, he worked in a barber shop and got his life back. In short, even when life is tough and people let us down, life goes on, and we can get past it.\n\nTo sum up, success is moving from one failure to another without losing excitement. People learn new things and feel proud when they reach their goals. Also, people might not want to try if they know they'll succeed. So, failing is an important part of life we shouldn't forget. Staying excited helps us reach our dreams."}

Summer break is the longest break students get from school. School is where students learn to get a diploma and a job later on. But schools should not make students do projects over the summer. This is because it might make students not want to go back to school, probably no one will do them, and students will forget it all anyway. Some people think summer projects are good because students don't do much during their break. They play games and sleep. Others think projects help students get ready for the next year. They believe it will make learning easier for them. But they are wrong. Schools should not give summer projects. It will make students not want to go to school. Teens are already tired of school. If they have to do projects over the summer, they will like school even less. Students don't enjoy school or homework. Homework is hard and makes them dislike school. Summer projects are too much because students work hard all year. Everyone needs a break. Many young people work in the summer to save for college. They help their families with money. Working during the school year is hard. Too much work is bad for health. It can hurt them emotionally and mentally. Emotionally, because they can't spend time with family. Mentally, because they can't rest their minds. This could lead to sadness. The School Board should not make students do summer projects. No one will do them. Students are busy in the summer. They spend time with family or go on vacation. Vacations help avoid sadness from school. Projects during the break will ruin their fun. Teens will get frustrated. They need time to relax and enjoy peace, not the stress they get from school. If they have to do projects, they will feel just as bad as they do about school. Everyone needs a break from school to rest. Schools should not ask for summer projects because students will forget what they did. They might finish the project quickly without learning. But learning is the point of these projects. They are supposed to help with the next school year. But students don't use what they learn. They just do it for a grade. Summer is long, and they forget what they did. People do many things in the summer, like going on vacation. This is when they relax and forget school stress. Stress comes from tests, homework, projects, and school itself. Projects add to this stress. Students worry too much, even about small problems. Worrying too much is bad. Schools should not give summer projects. No one will do them, students will forget, and they won't want to go back to school. Without summer projects, students could save money and rest from school."}

A city council is talking about starting a 10 p.m. curfew on weekdays and a midnight curfew on weekends for young people. I think curfews should help keep young people from getting into trouble and breaking the law. \n\nCurfews should help keep young people from trouble because breaking them is illegal. For example, young people have limits; they can't work whenever they want. They are too young to work late at night. They are not adults, and no one is in charge of them. If they break the law, they could face big problems. Young people should follow the law and stay away from trouble with the police. \n\nAnother reason curfews should help is that night time is more dangerous. For instance, bad things can happen at night when a young person is working. There might be drunk people around, or even a shooting. Someone could rob the place or take money. When the young person leaves work, it's dark, and that's not safe. The world has many dangers. Young people should avoid trouble because working at night can be harmful. \n\nSome think curfews should let young people work at night to make more money. But others think curfews should keep them from trouble. A third reason to avoid trouble is that young people are too young to work at night. For example, even responsible young people can find trouble. While working, someone might see them and call the police. This could cause big problems for the young person and their boss. Young people like to have fun, so they might play around and break or lose something. They are not grown up enough and too young to work at night. \n\nYoung people can't break the law by working too many hours. The streets at night are very dangerous for someone too young. They should not work at night until they are 18. I believe if we follow the law, young people will be safer and not break the law."}

You should be yourself because why try to be like others when you can be you and live your life your way? If people judge you, it's okay because you are unique, and that's good.\n\nOne reason to be yourself is that people will judge you no matter what. People think differently, so why change for them? Everyone has their own thoughts. The world has many kinds of people. Why try to fit in? Be yourself and ignore what others say. If you change, some might miss the old you. You might also feel bad for not being true to yourself.\n\nIf you copy others, you won't stand out. It's boring to be like everyone else. Be proud of who you are and don't care about others' opinions. Show how different you are. Why blend in when you can be unique? Don't let others tell you how to live. There are so many people; just be you and stay the same.\n\nHere's an example. Some don't like me because of my personality. I'm wild, loud, and funny. I love myself and wouldn't change. People want me to be more grown-up and quiet, but I don't want to be boring. Being like others won't make me happy. You choose how to act. If others want you to change, it's your choice. I think you should be happy and be yourself.\n\nAnother example: if everyone were the same, life would be dull. Being different makes things fun. Think about comedians.

This could be playing sports, being part of the student council, or making yearbooks to relax. I love playing sports, especially soccer, which is my favorite. It would be great if our school principal set up a soccer activity after school. Playing soccer makes you run, get tired, and sweat, but it's a good way to exercise and relax your mind from school subjects like math, science, art, music, civics, English, and others. As I mentioned earlier, having activities after school or during school is a good idea. It's a nice way to relax after a busy day at school. Many students stay after school for activities, but not everyone joins in. Some don't because their parents won't let them stay for two more hours. I think parents should let their kids stay after school for an activity. It would be great if all students joined in, even if they can't play a sport or do other activities yet. They can learn by watching others. Having these activities is also a way to meet other students and teachers we don't usually talk to. By taking part in these activities, you can make new friends. Some students can volunteer to help around the school. For example, they can help keep the school clean. The principal should think about starting more activities like helping at school. You might ask how you can help. You can by keeping the school tidy. Some students can pick up trash during school. Others can help organize the library. If everyone helps with something, our school will be more organized and look better. This way, when people visit, they can see how nice our school is. The way our school looks says a lot about us. We have many kind and smart students. Teachers and students can't change the whole world, but we can improve our school. We can make it a better place, even if some don't like the idea of after-school activities. I think we should have them. After a long day, I go home tired and bored. That's why we need activities, so we can go home happy. Sports are a good way to end the day well. All activities, during or after school, are good for us. They keep us entertained and give us a break. When school is over, some people feel bored, tired, or sad. But if we have new activities, they can go home feeling good. In the end, I do agree with our principal. I think teachers and parents should have a say too, so we can start more activities. Let's help our school, students! Let's support our teachers and principal in making decisions. Let's keep our school clean, beautiful, and safe. Let's make it look great, so when people visit, they can say good things about it.

Others need to do jobs at home, like looking after animals on a farm or watching their brothers or sisters. The head of the school might not know the tough times some kids have gone through.

Many kids don't like sports because they feel too much stress from their coaches or they just don't like it. If a student is behind in school, catching up takes a lot of time. They might not have time for things like the yearbook club or student government. Making a yearbook page can take a long time. Also, some kids might not be right for student government because they act out, can't stay focused, or can't handle responsibility. I have more to say. About sports, some parents won't let their kids play because they could get hurt, have a head injury, or worse. Health problems, like leukemia and scoliosis, can also stop kids from playing sports. I think students shouldn't have to join an after-school activity. Some kids can't play sports because their grades are too low, like having three F's.

But, new menus might not have the food we love. Like Italian Thursday or the ice cream we've had since 2017. Kids don't want to lose their favorite lunches. \n\nIn conclusion, I want to tell the principal to keep our lunch menu the same. The first reason is that new food takes too long to get ready. The second reason is it can cost too much. We should keep our menu until we can afford new items and still have the food we like."}
{"text_id": "A11947097A2D", "output_essay": "Some people think that students should do summer projects to learn more and get ready for the future. But students should not have to do this. They want to go on trips, rest, and see their families. The first reason students should not have summer projects is that they need a break. They are tired from going to school every day, all week, in the morning. This is even harder for those who work at night and get home very late, at 12:00 am, and only sleep a little. They are too tired for school and do not have the energy to focus on their studies. So, they need the summer to sleep more and get their energy back. The second reason to not have summer projects is that students need to rest their minds. They need a break from always thinking about homework and school. If they don't get this break, they might worry too much about school and become very sad. This is even more important if they work in the afternoons. They need time off to stop thinking about school stress. The third reason is that many students want to spend time with their families and friends or see relatives who live far away. Summer might be the only time they can travel, especially if they have not seen their loved ones for a long time. Going to new places is a great way for them to relax and have fun on their vacation. Also, most students like to hang out in groups and make good memories with their friends and family. In conclusion, every student needs a break in the summer to rest their mind and body. They deserve to stop thinking about school for a while to hang out and go to new places. This makes sure they come back to school ready to learn and do well."}

Everyone has someone who has taught them something important. This could be your mom, dad, or anyone who has changed your life. I have taught many things to people, like my cousin Generic_Name and my mom. If you don't have someone like this, you should find one. Without it, your future might not be good. My cousin Generic_Name has taught me a lot. He has helped me because he does many things for me. For example, he comes to my house to play after school every day, even when he is not feeling well. He also helps me when I don't understand things. He is always nice and thinks that if I try hard and ask questions, I can do well in life. The most important thing he has done is take me out when my parents are busy. When I see his car and his smile, I feel happy. He always asks if I am ready to go out. This is why I think Generic_Name is smart and has given me good experiences. My mom has also taught me a lot. She is very kind, and I have happy memories with her. When I fight with my sisters, she stops us and gives us ice cream. She says it helps cool down anger. My mom also takes care of me when I get hurt. Once, I hurt myself playing basketball, and she took care of my injury like a pro. She is always there when I have questions or need help. She comes quickly and knows the answers. This is why my mom is smart and has given me good experiences. I believe you need someone who can make your life better. Without this, your future could be hard. For example, not having friends can make you feel alone and sad. Also, if you don't make others happy, bad things like fights can happen. You should get close to a family member or someone you know. If you don't, they might not understand you. These are the reasons why it's good to have people to share life with. Otherwise, there could be problems. Many people have wise people in their lives.

Schools would make sure students join in these activities for sure. Students would learn to split their time with the school's help.\n\nStudents could finish their schoolwork without any excuses. I think if schools help manage what students do outside of class, they would make sure students have enough time for homework and other school tasks. Still, the student must do the work. If students feel the school is helping them, they will feel they should do what the school asks. This could help students get better grades and have a better chance at scholarships, especially if they are about to graduate. Good grades can lead to a better college, but students must work hard. The school will do its best to help, but the student must do the most.\n\nSchools would make sure students join an activity for sure. Schools would help students make good choices. I think students should choose whether they want many activities and less time, or one activity and more time for school. If a student's choice doesn't work because of time, the school would guide them to a better choice. Schools should manage what students do outside of class because they know more about education than students or their families. Schools would try to give students what they want, but it depends more on the student. The student must be responsible, so the school can give them what they want.\n\nStudents would learn to split their time with the school's help. Schools would play a big part in managing what students do outside of class and helping them with time. Students would learn to split time by being in activities and doing schoolwork. This skill would help them in future jobs or as adults. I get that some students want to control their own activities, and that's fair, but it's hard for young people to manage time well. Some might ask about freedom if schools control even the activities, but it's the best for a good reputation in and outside of school. I know some may disagree, but this is my view.\n\nI think schools should manage student activities because it's best for them. Students could finish their work, have learning experiences from activities, and learn to manage time. They would have time for everything and get better grades because of good time use.

You can meet new friends and learn to focus better while you create and talk about your work with others who like the class too. This helps you grow and move forward in life. \n\nOr consider wrestling. In this sport, two people try to pin each other down, and the first to give up loses.

This can make you feel good because you are doing something kind. You also help the Earth, which might make you want to keep doing good things. This leads you on a good path and helps you grow and move forward in life. \n\nStudents should join these activities because they are taking a safe chance that can help them in many ways. For example, soccer can keep you entertained and stop you from being bored, while volleyball can improve your planning skills and how you feel about yourself. All these activities teach you things and help you solve problems. This can lead you to find new things you like later in life. That's why I agree with the idea."}

When you're part of a sports team, at work, or in school, not everyone will like you. But if you have a good attitude, you can handle anything or anyone. Your own goals are important. To reach them, you need to start with a winning attitude. Don't worry if your teammates, boss, or coworker will help you. Believe that what you're doing will be great. If a plan fails, try a new one.\n\nI remember when I was younger, I played beach volleyball with new people. They all had different ways of acting. Most were nice to me. There was one, Generic_Name, who was not nice. No one wanted to be around him. He got angry when we lost points or someone made a mistake. He wouldn't talk to them. Before a tournament, everyone told the coach about his bad behavior. The coach had to talk to him and warn him that he might not play in the tournament.\n\nThis wasn't my only time dealing with difficult people. You can't win alone. By being negative, you bring yourself and others down. Generic_Name's mistake was not managing his anger. He made others feel bad, and some probably wanted to quit.\n\nIt's important to keep going, even if you fail. Use your losses to learn and get better. If you give up after losing, you won't succeed and might have trouble with others. Help others and show them what they'll miss if they stay negative. Show them that giving up and blaming others won't help.\n\nRemember, it's not easy. You might fail many times, but believe in yourself. Avoid negative people and use their doubts to stay strong.\n\nIn the end, a good attitude leads to success. It might not happen when you expect it, but it will come when you least expect it. Be patient. Do it for yourself. Show what you can do and don't let anyone ruin it. Don't give up easily. Think about the effort you've put in.

I believe this because as we get older, we start to understand who we are. This can be shaped by someone we look up to, and we might start acting like them. But this usually happens when we're young and our feelings can change our traits. So, I think John Lubbock's words are for people who are still figuring out who they are. \n\nI believe we choose our character traits because if we didn't, it would be like we're not really living our own lives. Everyone has different traits, but some people might be similar. They might have had the same role models or parents. We all get influenced and that's what makes us who we are.

Being yourself means you can solve problems alone and it inspires others to do the same. Being yourself is the best thing you can do in life because it helps you make your own choices without caring about what others think. It also means working hard to be successful. Trust your own thoughts when you decide something.\n\nFirst, being yourself is the best thing you can do in life because many people like to work alone to get better results. They use their own ideas and try hard to finish things smartly. For example, a student at Generic_School, Generic_Name, spent time at home studying for her biology test on Monday. Generic_Name looked over her cell notes for 30 minutes and worked on the study guide. On Monday, Generic_Name took her test and got a 90%. Generic_Name's teacher was happy because she studied well to do better. Working alone let Generic_Name learn a lot without her teacher or friends. Being yourself helps people decide what is right or wrong, and they learn more when they are alone.\n\nNext, being yourself is the best thing you can do in life because it helps students feel good and be in charge of their own success at school or in their community. For example, volleyball players try hard to improve and get good scores. They plan their time, and some practice twice a week at the fields. They push themselves because the good things that come from working alone will help them in the future. The volleyball players get better by working alone, and they enjoy the results. To be successful in life, you need to show how you can be yourself.\n\nSome people think that being yourself is not the best thing you can do in life. They say that working with others is better because it helps make friends and get help with things you can't do alone. This is true because working with others can change the world and teach you new things. But, being yourself can also keep you safe from strangers and make you a person who is always ready. So, being yourself helps you stay focused and have strong beliefs. Be proud to be yourself.\n\nIn the end, being different in life makes people feel prouder and more sure of themselves. Being yourself helps you make your own choices without worrying about what others think. Doing things on your own makes you smarter. People should be themselves because it shows they can do things without any help."}
{"text_id": "58A9AFCBBD39", "output_essay": "Yes, I agree because leaders should be positive. People watch you and hope you will find and make a good solution. This includes trust, talking well, working well, good feelings, and relationships at school and in everyday life.\n\nThink about this: How can you solve problems when all the workers are angry?\n\nAfter reading 'Leaders Eat Last,' I learned that you must bring good feelings into your business. If your business has problems, you should start solving them and make a place where workers like to work and do well.\n\nThe book talks about a business and how it did well in work and life. They talked to workers who didn't want to work there. One worker said, \"People are mean to me. I try to talk to them, but everyone just wants to win. They only care about money and not others.\"\n\nA good leader should ask: Do you want a lot of competition and think workers can be replaced, or do you want a good place where they stay and do well by talking better, working well, and knowing each other?\n\nIf I were the leader, I would pick the second choice. Why not?\n\nIt may take time for them to know each other because they want to move up and earn more, then leave. But why not make a better place to work? Imagine going to work every day, and it's bad because they don't talk well, and work isn't done because they dislike each other. Think about how to make a place where workers like to work and stay, feel welcome, and love each other.\n\nFrom the book, the leader chose the second way. Years later, the business is top in its field and in the news. They were asked how they became so good and efficient. This shows what a good leader can do. Being the best isn't enough; it's about making a 'Home' where workers do well in work and life.\n\nAsking workers again, 'What's it like at your business?' They said they don't want to leave, they're happy with their job, and they've done well in life. They've made a good social place with good feelings. One said, \"Someone in my family died, and I was sad and couldn't work. But my coworkers and friends helped me. They told me to keep going. They made me feel better, and I'm happy to be here. We care and support each other, and I have many friends. I'm happy to wake up and work here every day.\"\n\nBeing positive is part of everyday life. You might be upset sometimes, but that doesn't mean you're not positive. For example, you're mad at your boyfriend and don't want to talk. His friends might give you advice, good or bad. Life is about choices, and to be positive, you might think, 'Maybe I'm wrong. I should talk to him.' This is good because you're being positive.\n\nSchool is another place to be positive. In my first year, I wanted to be heard and have friends, but couldn't because I thought they were 'fake.'\n\nNow, I've learned that thinking everyone is fake is wrong. By changing my attitude, I've found out my strengths and weaknesses and those of others. Now I think I'm a leader because I make a good environment in class and at home. With better talking and a good place, I've improved talking, taking part, and good feelings. This builds 'Trust.' Trust is key to being better and positive. When you're positive, you make more friends and a place where you can focus and learn more about school and each other. I'm happy I've changed. When I'm positive, people around me are happy too.\n\nIn conclusion, being positive helps with talking, working, relationships, trust, good feelings, and focusing. These are real examples that work in everyday life. They show why being positive is good. Share your positivity, and you'll see a big change. I suggest you read 'Leaders Eat Last.' You'll find more about this and why you should change your attitude."}

At first, I didn't really listen and got bored when he shared his stories. But now, I see that it's good to learn from what he's been through. It's good to learn from others because you can avoid their mistakes, you learn how to handle things, and you get to know them better and what they've faced in life. I've made choices I wish I hadn't. Sometimes I do something and then wonder why I did it. If we listen to what others have been through, we can avoid making the same mistakes they did. If we're ever in a similar spot, we won't do something we'll be sorry for later. Hearing about other people's lives also shows us how to deal with things that happen. My dad has helped a lot of people. He feels happy when he helps, and that tells me I should help others too. For example, if I see someone drop something, I'll pick it up because my dad has shown me it's good to help. Learning from others can make you a better person. It also lets you understand their past better. By hearing about my dad's life, I've found out things I didn't know. Like the time he drove from one city to another to help his friend's daughter. Her car was broken, and she couldn't drive. He wasn't forced to help, but he did it because he likes to help. I had no idea he did things like that. You can discover things about someone you didn't know, including the challenges they've faced. To sum up, it's important to learn from others.

They go to parties or just talk with friends. But this can take up a lot of time. Time they could use for homework. They might end up staying up late to finish work because they were out. Sometimes, they don't finish their homework at all. They come home too late or are too tired. Not getting enough sleep can make it hard for them to focus in school.

It's not bad for those who deserve it. Many smart kids in school don't have the things they need for class, and some have to work hard. For example, some work at places like McDonald's where they make little money and can't help their families much. Letting them finish high school early can help them get better jobs and pay. This means they can have a better life and future for their families.\n\nIs it good for students to finish high school in three years and start college or work early? I think it's good if they have support to help them in the future, like finding a job, handling money, saving, and being respectful and honest.\n\nNow, what can you do after four years of high school? Well, it's like doing three years, but sometimes you can't take the classes you want. Most students would rather go to school for three years. This is because we have poor, middle class, and rich people. Rich people usually do four years, middle class might do either, and poor people often want to finish early to get a job and support their families.\n\nSome students leave high school because they need to help at home. Some try to finish school while working part-time.\n\nWhat's the difference between three or four years of high school? The main difference is that with three years, you might need to take more summer classes. With four years, you take regular classes and are a normal student.\n\nFor example, I'm Generic_Name, and I'm good at math and other subjects. But I'm tired because I work after school and wake up early to come to school. I'll try to graduate early to get a better job.\n\nThere are examples that show why this is important. Like Generic_Name, who works after school to help his family and wants to graduate to get a better job.\n\nSomeone who stays for four years will learn more because they can take the classes they want and spend more time at school. They can also get an advanced diploma, which can help them succeed more in the future.\n\nGraduating early isn't always the best because it can be stressful.

But then, they said they were close to crying. Another time, I was messaging someone who looked a bit sad. I asked, 'Are you okay?' The person then told me about their feelings. I am not sure how I got this ability, but I am thankful and proud to understand and help others with their emotions. I think I might have gotten this skill from how I grew up or from living in a happy and kind place that I picked up later in life. Once, my friend seemed very unhappy. I asked if he was okay, and he told me about his family problems. He was very angry and it was like he was a bomb about to explode. When he did explode, he cried and yelled, hitting lockers. It was tough. I did not know what to do except try to make him feel better. This lasted for about 20 to 25 minutes! In the end, things got better, like they usually do. This happened two months ago. Now, he is doing well, maybe even better than before. I am glad I was there to help him, not just as a friend, but as a person."}
{"text_id": "6FBD476D8AC9", "output_essay": "If there is a talk in my city about starting a 10 P.M. curfew on weekdays and a midnight curfew on weekends for teens, I think it's a bad idea. I believe teens should be allowed to be out at 10 P.M. during the week and at midnight on weekends. The City Council should not make this curfew rule for all teens. Curfews don't stop teens from getting into trouble. Teens are like adults; they can make their own choices about what they want to do any day. This is just not fair to young people! Take my life as an example. I get up at 5 A.M. to get ready for school. After school, I work from 4 P.M. to 11 P.M. I only work for 7 hours because I need time for homework, to talk to my friends on my phone, and to read my favorite books. If this curfew starts and I'm out at 11 P.M., I would be breaking the law! Some teens don't have parents; their parents are far away or have left them. So, they have to work after school and sometimes work more hours. I don't agree with this curfew because not all teens out late are just hanging out; they are working for a better future. It's tough to decide if this curfew is good or bad. The City Council won't keep teens out of trouble with it. Teens control their own lives. Some might say the curfew will keep teens safe. But the best way to keep teens safe is to teach them to stay away from drugs and alcohol. If teens use these things, they might not listen to their parents. Parents should teach them to be good at home, at school, and outside. On weekends, most teens and adults like to go to parties, and others stay home with family. If they go to a party and come back at 12 A.M., the police will arrest them for breaking the curfew. The City Council should not make this curfew rule; it won't help teens learn about life, including working at night. We are teens; if we are responsible at school, we can be responsible outside of school too."}
{"text_id": "EDC27501821A", "output_essay": "Most high school students, over 85 percent, join after-school activities because they want to, not because they have to. I think it's wrong to make someone take part in these activities. Students should figure out what's good for them on their own. Being told to do something isn't useful. When a school says you must join an activity, you might not want to keep doing it after school is over. Schools offer many clubs and sports, but the number can change from one school to another. Even so, there are usually enough choices. Sometimes you might not get into an activity because it's full or you don't like the options. Then, the school might make you do something you don't enjoy, which doesn't make sense. Some students join groups or sports outside of school. Schools don't know if you will do this because they don't know what you do in your free time. This brings me to another point. Managing time is hard. People are always trying to get better at it. Life keeps bringing new things to handle. Schools don't know everything, like how many tests students have to study for or if a student's house needs fixing. It's not fair to expect students to add more to their plate by joining an activity when they are already busy. Making someone do something usually doesn't end well. My mom used to tell me to clean my room. I would do it, but only after complaining. Now that I'm a bit older, I clean my room without being told. But if my mom told me to do it now, I would be upset because I want to make my own choices. This is the same for being forced to join a school activity. It's not right for a school to make you join an activity. It can cause problems. It might mess with your ability to manage time, stop you from choosing sports on your own, or hurt your schoolwork. Most students would pick a sport they like if they could. But if there's no room, they can't join. Then, if the school makes them do something else they don't like, it's a waste of time."}

It's important to be the person you want to be, even if you're not perfect. This will make you and the people who love you happy. Stay true to yourself even when others offer you drugs or alcohol for 'fun'. They may say it's the best thing ever and will make you happy. They might even push you to join a gang because you feel you have no other choice or nothing else in your life matters. They will try to convince you that your life will get better if you do what they want. But you should do what you want for your future. What if someone's life is not happy because they made bad choices? For example, if a person lets his parents choose his path, he may never live the life he dreams of. He won't know what could have been if he had followed his dreams. He gave up on them because he let his parents decide or didn't have the courage to chase them. Being happy or successful is a big goal for everyone. For some, it's easy, but for others, it's hard. If you're born into a successful family, it's easier to achieve your dreams. But if you're not, you have to work harder and make tough choices. People who work very hard have a clear idea of what they want and don't let anything stop them. So, being true to yourself is the best way to be happy. Don't listen to a 'friend' who tells you to do something that isn't right for you. Don't let your parents make choices for you if they're not what you want. Never give up on your dreams, even if it's hard. The bigger the challenge, the better the reward when you get past it. DO NOT LET ANYONE MAKE YOU GIVE UP ON YOUR DREAMS OR GOALS."}
{"text_id": "AB425524DFA1", "output_essay": "Duke Ellington once said, \"A problem is a chance for you to do your best.\" Think about it: every time you mess up or can't do something, what should you think right after? Agreeing to this can be shown in simple ways, like 'every mistake teaches you something,' or 'you can learn from your mistakes,' and 'failing can lead to greater success.' When you hear 'A problem is a chance for you to do your best,' you quickly understand why it's true. The way it's said shows a lot of meaning in just a few words. 'Every mistake teaches you something.' This idea is like what Duke Ellington said because they both talk about the same thing. Imagine you mess up or can't do something you know you can. At that moment, you didn't make it. That's when these words help. Many people mess up; most learn and do more than they first tried. That's the lesson: messing up gives you the push to try harder and do better. 'People can think about their mistakes.' When you look back at a mistake, you often say, 'Next time I'll do better,' or 'If I had done this, I could have done better.' These thoughts make you want to change or think differently about the mistake. Mistakes happen, but they're there for you to learn from. They make you want to improve. That's why after a mistake, you keep thinking about it until you've done better or even more. 'Mistakes are just part of life.' They happen a lot, to everyone, no matter their age or gender. They're not there to ruin your day or make you quit. They happen to push you, to make you look back and get better, to plan to do more, and to become a better person. 'Mistakes' means something you failed at, but it's not the end. In conclusion, Duke Ellington's words, 'A problem is a chance for you to do your best,' mean a lot. Always think about your mistakes. Those words and mistakes will help you become a better and greater person, one that you wouldn't have become without that mistake."}
{"text_id": "1DAF72D388B1", "output_essay": "I agree with this statement for a few reasons. The first is that it's important to be honest with yourself and know what you're good at. The second reason is that working hard pays off. The third reason is that it's good to have a job that you love. For example, being positive, honest with yourself, and picking a job you love are keys to being happy.\n\nWhen I do well at something, it's because it shows who I am. I stress this because I want to have a job that I like and will work hard at. Loving my job is very helpful. When I do a job I love, I make money and can help my parents. This is because I value respect, truth, and kindness. For example, when I play basketball, people tell me to 'just be myself and play,' and it works. Being honest with yourself leads to good things and growth.\n\nI want to be successful by working hard to make money. Athletes, for instance, train a lot to get to big competitions. They work to win for their fans. Hard work and success usually mean more money. Life is easier when you are honest with yourself, work hard, and stay positive. People work hard to make money for their family. When I work hard, my parents are happy. Being honest with yourself can also help when you're upset.\n\nLoving my job will help me stay positive, be myself, and work hard. I think I can do anything if I do what I love and am good at. For some, it's easy to be themselves and love their job. I like sports a lot, so I'm interested in sports marketing. I will be honest with myself by picking the college and job I want.\n\nIn the end, being positive, choosing a job, and being honest with yourself can lead to making money and getting respect. Being yourself is like taking care of your own things. It seems easier this way. Being honest with yourself helps make choices about your job and school, and it keeps you positive. Some people like to work alone to reach their goals and make money. I should always be honest with myself, even when I'm angry or sad, to help calm down. This is why I agree with Emerson's statement."}
{"text_id": "AA36E879B375", "output_essay": "We live in a world full of people. We all share some things, like hair color, skin tone, or eye color. But each person is unique. Being true to who you are can be hard but it's a big achievement today. Being yourself is great because people and the world often try to change you. It's also how we learn who we are and what we want to do with our lives. If you stay true to yourself, the world supports you, and you can make a difference. This is why I think Emerson was right when he said being yourself is the greatest thing you can do. People can be good or bad for us. They can make us do things if we let them control our lives. For example, in the US, there are many shootings at schools and stores. Often, more than one person does them. The main person gets more jail time. But both should be responsible. This shows we need to be careful about our friends and family. They can lead us to do bad things. If we do what they want, we lose ourselves. We need to know who we are and what we want in life. It's hard to know everything about yourself. Sometimes I do things I didn't expect. I think about the saying, 'If you don't know yourself, how can you know others?' We copy what we see in the world, like violence and crime. But if we have a goal, like becoming a doctor, we focus on that. We ignore the world's problems and work on our goal. When you know who you are, the world helps you, and you make a difference. Having a positive personality and a good heart helps. If you know yourself and your goals, the world supports you. This helps you and others succeed. Take Malala, for example. She fought her government for the right to go to school. Women in her country couldn't study. Malala believed in herself and her goal. She succeeded, and now women can get an education there. Malala shows that being yourself is a big achievement. In the end, the world and people can be obstacles. We need to understand ourselves and others. Having a goal helps us focus and ignore world problems. Then we can find out who we are. When we believe in ourselves and know our goals, things change. The world supports us, and we can help make it better. I believe that being true to yourself, despite the world's pressure, is the greatest thing you can do."}

Even though outside forces might try to change our choices, we still pick our own traits in the end.\n\nOne reason we pick our own traits is that they make us different. For example, we choose traits that fit our own way of thinking and view of the world. This is because traits that come from us are more real and true than those we copy from others. It is better to pick our own character than to let others pick it for us or to let events and outside forces shape our traits. This is because the latter does not come from our own view but from outside.\n\nAnother reason is that when people pick their own traits, they show their true selves better. For instance, a person with a tough personality might want to be seen as mean, grumpy, or a troublemaker. But if outside forces were in charge, the image would not be right because it would not show the person's own view. In short, picking our own traits is good because it shows who we are.\n\nWe also pick our own traits because they show who we are and how others see us. This is very important because it is what people notice about us. In the end, we choose our own traits because, as John Lubbock said, \"Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it.\" This means it is an easier way for people to understand who we really are, not based on something else that controls us.\n\nIn conclusion, some might say that our traits are only picked by outside forces and that picking our own traits is not a good idea.

If they could go to school, they could learn more and have a better chance at a good life after they finish school. I want to build schools in the poorest areas. This will help children get the education and safety they should have.\n\nThe fighting in Sudan has hurt the country a lot. It started in 2018 and has been bad ever since. Omar al-Bashir was a harsh leader and caused many problems. In 2018, people started to protest against him. Schools closed because teachers and students were afraid. Omar al-Bashir's soldiers attacked the protesters with tear gas and bullets. They also took away the protest leaders. This made prices for food and other things go up. For example, tomatoes became very expensive. Children were too scared to go outside or to school. If I build a school, it will be safe like the ones in America. It will have security, cameras, good classes, free food for those who need it, and internet. Students will want to come to a safe school where they can eat.\n\nSchool should be a place where kids feel happy, learn, and have fun. But in Sudan, schools are not fun. They only focus on learning without mistakes. There are no fun activities or trips. I want to make a school where learning is enjoyable. Kids could learn the Quran with songs and do math with fun activities. This way, they won't worry so much. They can finish school, go to college, and get good jobs. They can also do sports or clubs after school. This school can make a big difference and keep them busy.\n\nWe will build schools in places where people are struggling, like Al-Obied, Khartoum, Bahri, and Port Sudan. These areas had a lot of protests. The children there need more help because they have lost a lot. I care about them because I could have been one of them if I hadn't moved to America. I want to help so these kids can learn, finish school, get jobs, and feel safe. Building this school is important to meet their needs and protect them.\n\nIn short, I want to build schools in Sudan with safety features, cameras, free food, and internet. These schools will keep kids safe and busy so they can learn and earn a living later. They will enjoy fun activities and projects.

{"text_id": "A43056665FEC", "output_essay": "American jazz star Duke Ellington once said, \"A problem is a chance for you to do your best.\" My friends and I agree with Duke Ellington. We tell people to do their best when they have problems. This is because problems are really good chances to show how great we can be. People should see the good in all problems, big or small. They let us show what we can do. Also, it's very important to believe in yourself, especially when big problems make things hard. Some people get scared and give up. So, we should help others with their problems. They are the ones who can decide to do great things. A problem is a chance to work hard and keep going without giving up.\n\nFirst, a problem is a chance to do your best because it makes you work hard. For example, I once talked with my best friend, Generic_Name, in the school cafeteria. She told me about her math test. She talked about the questions she got right and the ones that were hard. I was so excited and asked if she passed. She said yes with a big smile and said, \"Of course I did!\" I was surprised and asked how she did so well. She laughed and said, \"This problem was a chance for me to do my best on the test.\" So, Generic_Name got a high score. This taught me that a problem is a chance to do great. Even if you don't know how to fix a problem, you have to keep trying until you find a way. This story shows that when you have a problem, you must work hard until you solve it. It also shows that a problem is a chance to try hard and be patient. If Generic_Name hadn't told me her story, I might not have learned that problems are chances to do well.\n\nAlso, a problem is a chance to do your best because it stops you from wanting to quit. For example, I read a book called 'Generic_Name's Problem.' It was about how Generic_Name faced many problems but didn't give up. Once, while shopping with friends, he found out about a running race. His friends knew he liked to compete and told him. He was so excited that he ran to sign up. But in the race, he was so busy hoping to win that he didn't listen to the rules. He didn't know where the finish line was and kept asking other runners. They were trying to win and didn't help him. At last, one kind runner told him, and because he didn't give up, Generic_Name won the race. This story shows how important it is to keep going and do your best to solve problems, even if you caused them yourself. If Generic_Name had quit during the race, he wouldn't have won.\n\nIn conclusion, when you have a problem, you should work hard and not give up. It's a chance to do great. For example, if Generic_Name hadn't shown that a problem was a chance to do her best and told her story, I might not have been pushed to work hard and listen to her. And if Generic_Name had given up when things got tough, he wouldn't have won the race. Let's encourage ourselves and others to make good choices and always try to be the best. Because a problem is a chance to do your best, even when it's hard."}

Ask how someone's day is going; you might make it better. High five them to make them feel good. Compliment them. Smile at someone, even if they don't smile back. If you see someone upset or being hurt, help them or find an adult who can. What's important is that you're trying to be kind.\n\nSome people want to be kind but are scared. They think they'll look cooler if they make fun of others. Many people act mean but want to be kind. They worry they'll lose friends if they're nice. But that's not true. Real friends will stay by your side. If you want to be kind but are scared, remember you're not alone. There are many kind people around you. So don't be afraid to show kindness.\n\nDid you know you can be kind by giving money or old clothes to people who are poor? Every year, many people are homeless, including families with kids and babies. It's sad, but you can help by giving them food, clothes, and blankets, especially in winter when it's cold and they can get sick. My dad gives $20 every month to help people in need. You can do something similar to help.\n\nI am kind by helping my mom and dad. My mom does a lot at home, like taking care of my baby brother and cooking. I help her clean and do laundry when my brother sleeps. I also help my dad with groceries and other tasks. I read to him when he doesn't understand English. My mom doesn't speak English, so I help her by reading things and translating them to Spanish. It may not seem like much, but I try to make them happy. This is how I show kindness.\n\nYou can be kind in all these ways. It makes a difference. Kindness is like a cold; it spreads. When you're kind, others will be too. That's why it's important."}
{"text_id": "5AE56FFF7789", "output_essay": "Why do we need to change first impressions?\n\nIt's wrong to think that first impressions can't be changed. Sometimes we can't dress up for an event, or we don't know what the event is. Still, people expect us to dress right for different events. I learned this when I started my first job; I wore formal clothes.\n\nYou can change how people see you, and not just by how you dress. You should show your smarts and how well you work with others. That's part of who you are.\n\nYou should wear the right clothes for different times. For a job interview, you should dress up. People remember your first impression when they think of you. It's tough to not want to change for new chances later on. Many people don't agree because they think differently. It's hard to choose when people won't help you because they got a bad first impression of you. Everyone has their own views. I think your clothes show who you are and how you feel.\n\nMy experiences have taught me this. I dress right for school in the morning because you should be a good person, a good student. But if you dress right and make bad choices or say mean things, it ruins your first impression. Your first impression is like your 'picture'; it shows who you are. But you can change your 'picture' with what you do. You should show your true self. If you have a role model and want to be like them, that's okay. I want to be like my grandpa and my mom. He has strong views on life and work. My mom is kind and has lots of experience. She's always been good at her job and very responsible. That's a good 'picture' for people to remember.\n\nBeing smart is more than how you look. You can change. People do change, even if some think you can't change first impressions. Some people are selfish and judge you by your looks or where you're from. Everyone has their own culture and ways; some people like other cultures and ways. People judge a book by its cover. Being smart is key to getting ahead, but if your first impression was bad, that's not good. You have to keep going and try to make a better impression on others.\n\nIn conclusion, it's wrong to say that first impressions can't be changed. They can change. For example, when I started my job, I was nervous at the first meeting, but I wanted to make a good impression on my boss. I work in a restaurant, and I sometimes talk to customers. My first impression and how I talk are important for doing better with different people. Your impression makes people judge you, for good or bad. Impressions matter for many reasons. I don't think first impressions are fixed, and I believe people who think they can change them have more confidence and can change how others see them. Just be yourself."}

Without enough learning, we can't earn money or find work. Young students might not be sure about their job choice for the future.\n\nWe can't change our past, but we can shape our future. Everyone wants a better job to make more money. This can happen if we learn well and don't hurry through school. Young people often struggle to make big choices. Not everyone is smart in the same way. Some are quick at math, but others are not. Some students might have a hard time picking a job because of physical issues. Schools should let students try new and creative things.\n\nIn school, we learn different things every day. Before high school, students often change their job goals. They don't know much about the job or the work needed. High school is key for our future. Students should take tough classes and pass exams to graduate. You can't finish school without passing. College comes after high school. In high school, it's easier to choose a job because we know more. But picking a job before high school is too hard. High school teaches us a lot. We learn from our mistakes. It gets us ready for college. In high school, we practice writing essays. This helps us for college, where we write a lot. But we might still change our job choice in high school. There are many chances before and after high school. If you can, use these chances. Not everyone can go to school. In Afghanistan, where I'm from, many don't go to school because of the Taliban. They attack schools. If you have the chance to learn, take it!\n\nSome young people in Afghanistan work as doctors and teachers. But they didn't get enough learning. Some didn't go to college but still work in schools and hospitals. This can be bad for sick people and students who need good learning.\n\nSome rich people don't go to school. They think they don't need it because they have money. But learning is important for everyone.\n\nHaving a job is important. It's not easy to get. A job can improve our lives, but we need good learning first. We shouldn't rush. It takes time and patience. We need to study hard. Without effort, life won't get better. We should do our best. Nothing is too hard. The more we learn, the smarter we get. Don't hurry to pick a job. People often start their careers at 25-30 years old. Don't make choices you'll regret. Be patient.

As life goes on, no one teaches others about the troubles and duties that come with getting older. Time keeps moving, and many people are always looking for ways to make troubles lighter, or to live without worries, or to find happiness or the bright side in bad situations. Life always brings good and bad, but people find ways to do well despite the troubles life brings. Many believe that staying positive is the key. They think that with a positive outlook, no trouble is too big.\n\nI believe that staying positive is the secret to doing well in life. I agree with this for many reasons. For one, being positive shows in your mood. Happy people smile a lot and are open to listening to others. They get along well with everyone. A positive outlook helps us every day, especially with our mood. It makes us less stressed. And when we're not stressed, we do our best at everything. Doing your best is one way to do well in life.\n\nAnother reason I agree is that positive people are quick to tackle problems. This means that when any trouble comes, in life or work, a positive outlook helps find solutions fast. This is a great trait to have.\n\nSomeone who can solve problems easily, no matter how hard, will likely get better grades or a better job. This is doing well in life.\n\nAlso, being positive helps you get along better with others, including family.\n\nIt's interesting that being positive makes others want to be around you. If you're liked by others and your family, it's almost certain you'll do well in life. For many, all their mistakes or troubles are tied to their relationships with others. That's why being positive improves relationships and helps you reach your goals. People liked by others and their family don't have self-esteem issues. Without these issues, you're not afraid to try new things and do well in life.\n\nIn conclusion, life is tough without the positive key to doing well. Every day is a chance to show and find new ways to reach your goals. A good, positive mood helps you have better days, without stress or health issues. If people stay positive and remember things could be worse, the world will be full of people doing well. People will find better and easier ways to solve problems. They'll be valued for doing their best at school or work. The world will welcome them, and they'll fit in with their family. Life will still be tough, but not as much, because a positive attitude can make a big difference. Staying positive is the real secret to doing well."}
{"text_id": "232CDFBFCCC3", "output_essay": "I think we need better lunches at school because they help you think more clearly. If you eat good food, your brain works faster. This is why eating right is key. When more kids eat good food, they learn more, get better grades, and score higher on tests. High test scores make your school look better. So, healthy students make a smarter school. \n\nGood food at school means healthier kids. It gives them the right amount of calories and other health benefits. It also teaches them to live healthier. But there's a problem with fast food. In America, people have been picking fast food over home-cooked meals for a long time. It's quick and easy, but the bad parts are worse than the good. Eating fast food all the time is bad for students' health, their diet, costs them money, and can make them moody. You might not see the problems right away, but they will show up over time. \n\nChanging the menu might mean losing some favorite foods, but it's for the best. Eating fast food every day is bad for you. For example, to play sports at school, you need to be fit and full of energy. Eating right helps with this. If students don't watch what they eat, they could get sick. No parent wants that. So, better food at school is a good idea. Parents want their kids to be healthy and smart. If we serve better lunches, parents won't worry about their kids' health. \n\nSome students may not like the new food because it's different. But they need to start eating well to stay healthy as they grow up. If you're healthy, your mind is too. This makes school easier. Healthy food can be cheaper than fast food. If we eat well at school, we can save money. I want my school to be healthy and smart. Don't you?"}
{"text_id": "37344DDF73D9", "output_essay": "As teens grow up, they start to have their own ideas. These ideas can change how they live. People often talk about whether teens should pick a job early. Some students think they should choose one quickly. Others say it's better to wait and find the right job. I don't think teens should rush to pick a job. I believe it's better for them to wait until after high school to decide what they want to do. Many students want to think about their future jobs. So, they go to college. College helps them see life after school and learn to be responsible. For example, college shows students that life can be hard. It gives them a chance to get used to new duties and study what they like. Some go to a local college to try different subjects, get a degree, and get ready for more school. Local colleges help students choose what to do next. They make it easy to move to a university that suits them. Students like many things. They need time to see which hobbies or interests fit with the job they want. High school students are young. They don't know much about life after school. They like to do many things and want a job they love. They join sports teams and clubs to learn about what they like and how to do well. For example, someone who doesn't know what job they want might join a club to see if they like it. Or, someone who wants to be an athlete might play a sport to see if they want to get better. High school is for trying different things and doing what makes teens happy. If they had to choose a job fast, it could stress them out. Some people say students should pick a job quickly because they don't have much time. Others think being fast helps them get ready for the future. But making students choose quickly can stress them out. Stress can make them very sad or cause big problems if they have too much to worry about. Time is important. Students should enjoy life and do their schoolwork. They will have time to think about their future. If they rush, they might get too stressed, very sad, or think about hurting themselves. In the end, students should take time to look at different choices by going to college. No one likes to be rushed or to do things they don't like. So, students should find things they care about. They need enough time to think about their jobs because life goes by fast. It's better for students to take their time in high school instead of rushing."}

I think our character is made by things we can't control. For example, you can't just change who you are by trying hard; many outside things shape who you are. \n\nI think our character is made by things we can't control. This is because who we are can change. Take my sister, for example. She was very shy until 2nd grade. Her teacher told my mom to see if she had a problem or was just shy. Then, she moved from a Japanese school to an American school in the middle of 2nd grade. We were worried about her making friends. But she worked hard to talk more at school. A few weeks later, she was more outgoing than before. Now she is the most outgoing of us. \n\nEveryone has their own character made by their traits. But you can shape yourself by being in control. If you don't like something about yourself and want to change it, you can. I don't like that I'm too nice. It's a good thing, but I can't say no. I always agree with my friends because I care about what they think. \n\nSo, I try to say no to things I don't want to do and tell people why. Little by little, I've changed. I can now share my own thoughts. I still care, but I don't worry too much about what others think. \n\nThe last point is that you can grow by being in control. As the first two examples show, you can change and make yourself. After you change, you feel you've grown, not in size but in your mind. Having new traits can make your mind stronger. Before I changed, I thought in a childish way. I was scared of what people would think. But now, I can have my own opinions and ideas. So, I feel I've grown and think more like an adult. \n\nIn conclusion, changing your character by things you can't control can help you grow up. Change yourself by being in control, make your own traits, and grow by changing. People grow in their minds and become more outgoing. Changing our traits can lead to good things. \n\nSo, I think our character is made by things we can't control."}

I believe this because these activities help people make friends and be more social, they make them more active and strong, and they teach them how to work with others.\n\nJoining activities like clubs helps people make friends. It helps them talk to more people. For example, by playing football, they meet others who like the same things. They can become friends at school and outside of school. They meet new people they didn't see during classes. If they are in the same club, they can get to know each other better. They can also meet people who are older or younger. This can help them learn new things or teach others. Being in clubs helped me make friends and learn about what interests younger people.\n\nActivities like sports make people more active and strong. Playing sports makes students move more. It helps their hearts and makes them want to try more sports. Practicing every day can make sure they exercise for 2 hours. This makes them feel good and get better. It also makes them stronger by doing exercises every day. I think these activities also help your brain. They helped me get better grades and behave better. I worked hard and felt great. Doing these activities helped me improve a lot.\n\nThese activities also teach kids how to work with others. Playing a sport like football means working with a big team.

Like my dad says, 'Teamwork makes the dream work.'\n\nSo, do I think it's good for everyone to do after-school activities? Yes, I really do. Now you know why I think so: because it helps people make friends, be more active, and learn to work with others. These activities helped me a lot, and I hope they help everyone who wants to try them in school."}
{"text_id": "061AD4A149E6", "output_essay": "Ralph Waldo Emerson once said, 'To be yourself in a world that is always trying to change you is the greatest success.' Do you agree or disagree with Emerson's thoughts on being unique? Choose a side on this topic. Back up your answer with reasons and clear examples. Our world tries to shape us into followers. With the internet, we can talk to anyone and learn anything. But, the media often shows perfect images and pushes certain views. This makes people act like what they see online or on TV, even though they are free to be different. Emerson's words mean that staying true to yourself is very impressive. We could be more unique, but we often follow a few popular ideas. In the last ten years, social media has become a key way to talk and get news. On these platforms, you can show who you are, which can be different from what most people expect. This has become popular, leading to a world where many people are unique. Topics like bold makeup or gay rights are popular online. Even if you don't follow them, they can inspire you. It's a big success to ignore society's strict rules and be free from expectations. Social media lets you share your thoughts and likes with everyone. It's a chance to show your real self. I like to post photos on Instagram and Facebook that reveal my personality. Society and friends often limit how we show who we are. Social media lets me speak out. But, it also takes bravery to share different thoughts for everyone to see. So, I agree with Emerson that being yourself is the greatest success. You need courage to face society's judgments. Social media spreads ideas without words. We spend a lot of time online, where we don't need to show our real selves. On my account, I can make a popular post by copying trends. I don't need to be myself to get attention. I just post something that looks like what's already popular. To someone on Tumblr, makeup, flashy clothes, or jokes are just ways to get noticed. Sharing my own thoughts is not important. This shows that Emerson's idea is hard to live by in the world of social media. People who don't use social media often have more life experience and might not agree with Emerson. They keep their personal feelings separate from work and think they have done bigger things than just being themselves. Others fit into society's roles well. In the end, we should be ourselves and have our own unique qualities. Being unique shows what you like and who you are. Social media helps some people be themselves. It can shape your style. Being yourself lets you stand up for yourself. The internet also supports Emerson's idea. Not worrying about others' opinions or having your own style is important."}

This is a smart way to think about our abilities. They show us how to get better. For instance, we can improve a lot by spending some of our free time on hobbies. When something seems too tough, we must still try. Everyone should try new things to get better. The authors' advice gives us a helpful idea. The key is to take their ideas and use them in real life. Their advice will help many people. It talks about a big idea that can help anyone who wants a better future. We all have dreams. I have many things to do, and I do them every day. We learn new things daily. Our life is like a story that we can make great. We need to be patient. Think about if you're doing things right. If something is wrong, stop and change it. Be happy and do what's best for the world. Don't copy others. Do what you want, no matter what others think. If you think about your future, you'll see some people give up because they don't try. People often focus on the negative. They say that trying to get better won't work. It's hard to think about the world's problems and how some people don't want to try. Some say, 'I give up; I can't succeed,' without knowing if they could have. For example, a student might want to go to college to become a doctor or work for the government. He could succeed. But some might say, 'Don't do it; it's a waste of time.' They think it's too hard. That's why many don't plan for their future. They are too negative. The best thing to do is ignore negative people. Listen to your heart. If you're unhappy, stop and think about what makes you happy. Try new things that could help you later. Like the authors' words that inspire me to do what I want. Now, as a 12th grader, I'm almost done with high school. Time is flying, and I need to start now to reach my dreams. I dream of studying nursing and maybe becoming a doctor to help people.

You'll make your family proud. I am now sure about what the authors said. I agree with them. It's time to think about how we can do many things, like learning and fixing our mistakes. The key is to learn from errors and not repeat them. This gives you experience. With experience, you'll do things better and succeed. Think about your future and if you're doing something good for the world. Follow the authors' steps. Their words are meant to help us try what we want. Don't listen to negative people. Listen to yourself and your heart. Find someone who can help. Tell them your plans. The most important thing is to follow your dreams and make a good future. Conclusion I agree with them because they taught me to follow my own ideas. Think about the future and do things right. I will try to do everything I want and not miss out. If I ignore my ideas, I'll lose a lot. I won't know what could have been. So, I won't ignore my ideas. This also helps others who listen and do what they want, like taking classes for their future."}

What was he trying to tell us? People think about that saying in different ways. For me, I believe it means that a problem is an opportunity to get better, to learn, and to figure out how to fix it. That's what I think he meant.\n\nFor instance, imagine you didn't wash the dishes and your mom is upset because she asked you to clean them before bed. How can you fix this? What's the best way? What will you do?\n\nFirst, look at the problem: you didn't wash the dishes and your mom is upset. The best thing to do is to talk to your mom. Say you're sorry and promise to wash the dishes next time without fail.\n\nDo I agree with Duke Ellington's saying?\n\nSome people might not, but I do. Why? Because you learn from problems. They teach you to be better and show you what not to do. A problem encourages you to keep trying to solve it because there is always a solution.\n\nTake big businesses as another example.

It is a rule that makes certain people stay home after a certain time at night.\n\nI think the curfew law is good because it will help keep teenagers from getting into trouble. Parents will know where their kids are, and many teens will be safer. Nighttime is when criminals often do bad things.\n\nThe curfew will stop teens from hanging out with friends at night. This means they won't get into car crashes. This is important because many teens use drugs these days. If we have a curfew, we will make teens safer. A friend of mine got arrested because he was with gang members when they hurt someone. He didn't hurt anyone, but he was there, so he got in trouble for it.\n\nParents will know where their teens are because teens usually don't tell their parents their plans. This is bad because if the teen gets hurt, the parents won't know. If the teen needs to go to the hospital, the parents could get blamed for not keeping their child safe. Even if parents say no to going out at night, many teens sneak out. If something bad happens, the parents are blamed.\n\nAt night, it's easier for bad people to do crimes. We all remember Ted Bundy, a famous criminal in the US. He did most of his bad things at night. Nighttime is risky for everyone, not just teens. If we make this curfew law, we will protect people more and there will be fewer crimes. We can't stop all bad people, but we can make it safer. If we keep our teens safe, they will have a better future. They will pay more attention to school and stay out of trouble. A curfew can help stop crimes.\n\nIn the end, a curfew is a good way to protect teens. I know teens might not like this law, but if parents agree, they are keeping their kids safer. By making sure teens are safe at night, we are helping them. Bad things can happen at night, and we want what's best for our teens. Teens are the future of any country; they are the future."}

For example, we should eat less unhealthy food like greasy hamburgers and pizza. These foods are not good for us and don't give us the vitamins we need. We need things like vitamins, iron, and calcium. The school should think about giving us healthy food, like more vegetables, natural juices, and fruits such as strawberries, apples, oranges, and pears. These are all good for us. \n\nCaring about our school menu is very important. I have my own story about the food at school. Once, I ate a pizza that looked so tasty I ate it all. But after 30 minutes, I felt very sick. My stomach hurt so much I couldn't focus in class. Dear Principal, we need to make a change in our school. This will help us be active and healthy so we can grow up strong and smart. We are at school for many hours where we eat breakfast and lunch. Some students don't eat all day because they don't like the school menu. They wait until school is over to eat something they enjoy. \n\nWe can make the school menu better by adding more fruits and vegetables. We can make tasty and healthy things like vegetable salads, fruit salads, fruit smoothies, and wraps with healthy stuff in them. Teach us to care about what we eat, and we can learn to look after ourselves when we're not at school. This way, we can be a strong and healthy group in the future."}
{"text_id": "C610A820CFFB", "output_essay": "I think it's a good idea for teenagers to have a 10 p.m. curfew on weekdays and a midnight curfew on weekends. A 10 p.m. curfew could help keep teenagers safe. At home, they could do useful things like study or do homework. This could help them do well in life and stay away from bad choices. Some people might not like this rule, but we can find ways to make it work for everyone. We could set up some rules and let people choose the ones they think are best. \n\nWhen you first hear about the 10 p.m. weekday curfew and midnight weekend curfew, you might not like it. But if you think about keeping teenagers safe, you'll see it can keep them out of trouble. You also won't have to worry about them getting hurt. I fully support this rule because we don't know what could happen to teenagers outside late at night. This is especially true for school kids who need sleep and need to pay attention in class. \n\nMany teenagers have jobs and some finish work at 10 p.m. or later. They need to tell their city they'll be out late so they don't break the rule. They should let the police know they work late. Teenagers should only be out late for emergencies or with their parents. If they're out after curfew without a good reason or alone, they're breaking the rule. This is especially true if they seem to be up to no good. \n\nSome parents want their kids to be safe and do well in school. That's why they might like this rule. It could be a great or bad idea. Like I said, some people will like having rules to keep teenagers safe and help them in school. \n\nI don't think this rule is unfair to teenagers. Some might think so because they want to hang out at night. It's okay for teenagers to have fun with friends sometimes. But some go out without asking their parents. They don't think about the dangers or that their parents don't know where they are. \n\nIt's important to follow rules and agree with most of them. We might think some rules are not needed or limit our freedom. Some people think rules stop us from doing what we want. But if you think about it, rules are there to keep us safe and help us do good things for our future."}
{"text_id": "3B74F5C263C2", "output_essay": "I agree with John Lubbock that you can choose what kind of person you want to be. Being a good person is important because it shows how you were brought up. You can choose to be good or bad. Everyone can act good, bad, or just okay. It's up to us to decide how we act. The way we act can change depending on who we are with. If we hang out with good people, we will probably act well. But if we are around bad people—those who use drugs, drink too much, and do harmful things—we might start acting like them. People pick up new behaviors quickly, and this includes how we act. If we see people doing bad things that most people don't like, we might start doing them too. So, we should choose to act well and not badly. How we act mostly comes from how we think. If we think badly about someone or a group, it might be because of our thoughts or a bad thing that happened. How you act with others shows where you come from, so you should try to be good and kind to others. Our behavior won't change unless we want it to. Schooling can really affect how we act. In places where schools cost money, the government might not help people go to school, or it might be corrupt. So, not all kids can go to private schools, and they might not learn good manners. This shows in how they act. People might call them rude or criticize how they talk, but not everyone is the same. Some kids who don't go to school but grow up in the same place can still be good. People act differently with different people: badly with rude people and well with kind people. If you want to act badly and poorly, that's your choice, but then people will think of you as someone who acts poorly. Often, society blames parents for how their kids act, but we should remember that all parents want the best for their kids. No parent wants their child to be a criminal. We should stop blaming parents and focus on giving good advice instead. In Muslim history, their leader Muhammad is a great example of someone who acted well. Even when bad things happened to him, he was still good to everyone, even those who hurt him. He is a role model for everyone. No one can make you act a certain way; you have to choose how to act to be respected and have a good name in society. How you act is not because of things you can't control. It's up to you, and you are the only one responsible for your actions. It's your choice. Think about a man who spoke badly on the street, which surprised polite people. Later, he said sorry for being rude and started acting better. When asked why, he said that as a dad, he needed to act better for his kids. This shows that no matter how you have acted before, you can always choose to be better. We shouldn't copy bad things around us; we should make good friends who help us be better. It's up to us to decide how to act and what kind of person we want to be. So, try to be good, follow good people, and don't look up to those who are a bad influence."}
{"text_id": "DA5225693EC1", "output_essay": "What is a problem, and how can solving a problem help you do well? A problem is something that is giving you trouble and you are trying to fix it. Solving a problem can help you do well because it shows what you can do and helps you understand how skilled you are, which you might not have known before. I think that a problem is a chance for you to do well because you will learn something new and want to try harder the next time you face a hard time.\n\nFirst, I think that a problem is a chance for you to do well because you will learn something new. For example, there was a woman who lived with her husband and three kids. The woman loved her husband a lot. She did not see that he did not love her back. The husband was mean to his wife. One day, she broke her phone by accident while giving her husband food. The husband got very mad and locked her in the basement for a week without food or water. When the kids asked their dad where their mom was, he lied and said she was on a work trip. The kids were puzzled because they knew their mom did not have a job. But they were scared to ask their dad more questions. After a week, the husband let the wife out and told her to go shopping. While she was walking, her husband hit her with his car. At the hospital, the doctor said the husband had to give his kidney to save his wife. The husband got mad and said he did not care if she died. He left and did not come back. One of the kids gave his kidney to his mom. When the woman got better, she saw that she had been wrong about her husband's feelings. But she was thankful for the accident because it showed her the truth. This story shows that a problem is a chance for you to do well because the woman did not know her husband's true feelings until she had this big problem. Clearly, a problem is a chance for you to do well because you will learn something new.\n\nSecond, I think that a problem is a chance for you to do well because it will make you want to work hard. For example, when my sister Generic_Name started high school, she did not do well. She had bad grades, was rude, and fought with other students. One day, Generic_Name showed her bad report card to our mom. Our mom was very upset when she saw the bad grades. She took my sister's phone and said, 'You can have your phone back when your grades get better.' Generic_Name took the easy way and paid another student to do her work. This made her grades go up. Our mom was happy to see the change and gave back the phone. But when it was time for the big tests, Generic_Name was scared because she did not know anything. She felt bad for cheating and decided to study hard to pass her tests. This shows that a problem is a chance for you to do well because if there was no big test, Generic_Name would not have wanted to work hard. Without a doubt, a problem is a chance for you to do well because it pushes you to work hard.\n\nIn conclusion, I think that a problem is a chance for you to do well because you will learn something new and feel the need to work hard. For instance, there was a woman who liked her husband, but he did not like her back. One day, he told the woman to go shopping, and then he hit her with his car. Luckily, the woman lived but needed a kidney from her husband. He said no and left her in the hospital. One of the kids gave his kidney to his mom. When the woman got better, she understood that her husband had never loved her. In the same way, when my sister Generic_Name started high school, she did not do well. She got bad grades all the time, so our mom took her phone until she did better. Generic_Name paid someone to do her work. Her grades got better after a while, and she got her phone back. But when the final tests came, she knew she had to study hard to pass. Why should people work hard?"}
{"text_id": "F8A1AC1C01D6", "output_essay": "Online learning is a choice for many schools. Is it good for students, or are there other ways to learn? Some think schools should have online learning so students can learn from home. Others think there are better ways. This matters because online learning is a good way for students to learn from home. It is the best because it gives more time for home activities, keeps students safe, and is more comfortable at home. \n\nFirst, online learning is good because it gives students more time at home. Students have a lot of work to do, so learning online can help those who are busy. For example, students with housework, jobs, or personal projects need time for these things. Online classes make life easier and give them more free time. They can finish schoolwork and then do other things like cutting the grass, cleaning, or working. So, online learning is good for working at home because it gives more time for tasks. \n\nAlso, online learning is the best because it keeps students safe at home. Some students are scared to go to school because they might get hurt or sick. For instance, students can get sick from others who cough or touch them. This happens often because many don't wash their hands or see a doctor. Online learning stops sickness by having classes online instead of at school. Fewer students and teachers would get sick, keeping everyone safe from illness by not meeting in person. Schools used online learning to stop sickness during the coronavirus. This lowered sickness in schools and stopped the need for quarantine, which would stop lessons and learning. So, online learning is the best because it keeps students safe from sickness at school. \n\nHowever, not everyone agrees. Some think there are better ways for students because they are more reliable and comfortable. But they miss that online learning is comfortable at home. For example, students are usually more comfortable at home, like sleeping more or choosing what to eat. This makes it easier for them to manage at home. Students with anxiety or disabilities might like being at home with a parent. So, students might pick online learning because it is more comfortable than school. This can help them listen and learn better online. \n\nWith all these points, we can say that online learning is a good way to learn from home. It is good because it gives students time for other things, keeps them safe, and is comfortable at home. Online learning is as good as regular school because students can still learn online. Tools like Google Classroom help them do homework and classwork on time. This can make students and teachers learn better than at school. Learning from home is the best choice for anyone who wants online learning for a better future."}

But I don't think it's good for kids to stick to one thing when they are so young.\n\nKids can change their minds fast. For example, they might find a new interest in the middle of high school and want to learn about it. Or, after high school, they might not want to follow the job they studied for because they like something else more. Young kids often can't make up their minds, and being young can make them unsure about their future job.\n\nAlso, some kids don't know what they want to study. They have lots of choices and can't pick just one job. Plus, kids might want to learn about all the different jobs out there and see which one they like best. They might want to keep looking, or they might not know what they want to do later. So, young teens often don't know what job they want to have.\n\nSome people say it's good to start young. They say kids can start working in their job early or go to college to do better. They say kids can be independent and proud of what they do early on. But others don't agree. They say kids are too young to think about their future job. They say kids shouldn't worry about it until they are older in high school. Also, it's not good for kids to be stressed about the future when they can think about it later.\n\nWhen you're a young teen in high school, it's hard to stick to one thing when you're not sure it's what you want to do. You can change your mind about the job you want. Everyone has different ideas, but this is what I think. What do you think about starting young, studying for a job, and sticking to it?"}
{"text_id": "8BA79A866F2C", "output_essay": "Most people have things they need to do every day and in their lives. Students, for example, want to finish homework, get good grades, graduate from high school, and go to college. These are their goals. If they don't reach their goals, they fail. But failing can help people succeed. Some think that failing does not lead to success. They believe that when people fail, they feel sad and just accept it. But Churchill's words tell us that failing is part of trying to succeed. It teaches people from their wrongs and shows them new ways to win. \n\nOne way failing helps people succeed is by teaching them from their wrongs. People fail when they can't do what they planned or if their goals are too big. They may think that mistakes can't be fixed and should be seen as 'punishment.' But the main thing is to think about it and learn from those mistakes. When people think about their mistakes, they gain confidence, make better choices, and finally win. Mistakes also make people think and give them another chance. \n\nFailing also leads to different ways to succeed. Failing can help people in many ways: redoing a test, taking extra classes in summer, staying late at school, or going to school on weekends. These are choices a student can make to get better. For example, I got a 'C' in English because of a test. The test had three parts: research, grammar, and writing rules. I did well on one part, but not on the other two, which made my grade drop. I asked my teacher if I could redo the test. She said I could redo it during a free period or after school on Thursday. So, I chose to redo it during the free period. After three days, my grade went up to a 'B+' and I felt proud. I was happy I took the chance to improve my grade and that I learned from my mistakes by studying more. Failing can make people feel better about themselves and show them that there is always another choice, another way. \n\nPeople say that failing is important in trying to succeed. Success comes from failing, and failing comes from mistakes. Without failing, people wouldn't learn from their mistakes. This could make them less driven, miss out on good chances, and face other problems. Every mistake teaches a lesson. That lesson shows people a new way to face challenges and get better at any goal they have in their daily life. There is always a way to see what comes from the choices people make. They just have to look at it from a different side."}

By doing this, you can probably find the best opinions and get the help you need. You get to listen to all the great information. So you can hear all the options, and that might give you an idea. Looking for opinions is a smart move. \n\nGetting many opinions is good because you might need advice. You might be in a situation where you need someone's honest and best advice. You might need information quickly. Maybe you're dating someone, and you don't know whether to bring flowers or chocolate; you can ask someone fast. You can get advice for the future. Maybe someone tells you what you should be or do; you might follow it, or you might not. Looking for advice is a good way to find an opinion for later. \n\nLastly, the main reason to get many opinions is because your own might not be good, and you might need others'. If you can't think of a good, useful, and kind opinion, it's best to ask someone. So you have no excuse for anything.

A big plus is that when you run into trouble, you have a lot of time to fix it and try your hardest. Also, when you face a big issue, you see who your real friends are. They are the ones who help you. A trouble is a chance to try your hardest and fix it with friends and family's help.\n\nBut, a downside is that some people might leave you to deal with your troubles alone, and you could end up in a bad spot.\n\nI had a time when I was taking the last test at school. My friend gave me a ruler, and the teacher thought I was cheating. I told her I hadn't talked. The teacher seemed to want to challenge me so I would try my hardest and not depend on others. After the test, the teacher told me, \"Don't let anyone cause you trouble.\"\n\nI've heard a saying about time and chance: \"Time is like a sword; if you don't cut it, it cuts you,\" wrongly said to be from Shakespeare.\n\nSo, time is like chance, and both are like a sword—if you don't take action, they will affect you.

Do we pick our character traits, or are they shaped by things we can't control? I believe our character traits should come from outside influences.\n\nFamily should be a big part of what shapes you. For instance, growing up with your family should make you feel shaped and proud of who you are. Your mom and dad shape you; they affect what you like. Your brother or sister can also shape you a lot. My brother had a big impact on me; he showed me a lot about cars that I didn't know before. My cousins have also shaped me; one got me into boxing, and I liked it so much I kept at it.\n\nSocial media is a huge influence on people everywhere. For example, it can push people to work hard for things they like or want to do. It might get you to start painting, sell stuff you don't need for money, or try something new. Social media made me work harder to be a better boxer; I learned the right way to punch, how to do a hook, a jab, and even jump rope. It also showed me what I need for training or boxing, like a speed bag or hand wraps to keep my hands safe. Social media can get you to try and learn new things, and maybe find what you want to do in life, like sports, painting, or making YouTube videos. It can really push you to try new things and keep at them.\n\nReligion is what someone believes in and is influenced by. For example, religion helps some people feel better and keep going, like the Bible does. Many people are guided by the Bible and its messages about life. Some are guided by God, while others are not; many believe in God and think God can help them with problems or when a family member is dying. Others don't think religion or God guides them; they don't see it as important. But for some, it's a big deal because it matters to them and influences their beliefs. Religion is a strong influence; it brings many people together to believe in their faith, and there are many religions that influence people.\n\nFamily, social media, and religion are all big influences that can shape people everywhere. In the end, I think our character traits will be shaped by influences at some point, but family, social media, and religion are all major things that can influence people around the world."}

We all face problems, but we often hide them. Still, we need to do well in life and our jobs. Going to night school or taking online classes doesn't mean we don't want to be in regular school. Many of us have big responsibilities. Now, in 2019-2020, some parents are making their 17-18-year-old kids leave home. Some kids have no place to live, and others can't afford food because things are tough at home or where they live. I'm 18 and in my last year of high school. I thought my life would be fun, but it's not. My family is making me move out. I work two jobs to pay for rent and my phone, and I need help. It's hard being young and not having your parents support your dreams of college or the military. I'm one of those kids who deals with this every day. I work very hard to get to where I am. We can't change what has already happened, but we can change what will happen. Many kids my age work one or two jobs. Some parents think we're ready to live on our own and push us out. But we can't change much about that. If I were a teacher or on the school board, I'd ask them why they think kids are upset. Do they think we want to finish school early to do great things?

{"text_id": "5BB9B79C46E0", "output_essay": "It's true that in some places, students must pick a job path before they start high school. This is good because many kids think about what job they want from a young age. For example, little kids often pretend to be cooks, police, firefighters, soccer players, and more. Most of these kids keep up their interest and later study for their chosen job. Knowing what job you want early is good because you won't have to look online or struggle to pick a career. Many find it hard to choose a career, and when high school ends, they leave not knowing what to do. They are just starting to learn about their job, if they have any ideas at all.\n\nMany students start working, maybe in middle school, but by 8th grade for sure. Some work in high school to save money to start a business or to help their family. No one really knows what's happening in other students' lives. Some high school kids work two or three jobs because they need to. Others study hard because they know the job that will help their family.

Many kids start working young to help their families and look forward to the job they dream of to help themselves and their family.\n\nYou can have fun in life. The best things aren't easy and need hard work, but you enjoy what you've done after. By picking your career early and working hard to learn about it, you can get a great job and enjoy the rewards.

{"text_id": "169528C31812", "output_essay": "The University of Washington says that 89 out of 100 people who don't succeed think that failing is the worst thing that can happen on their way to success. Winston Churchill, a past leader of Britain, once said, \"Success is moving from one failure to another without losing your excitement.\" People who fail believe they won't get another chance to succeed. They think that if they fail once, they will keep failing and their excitement won't help them succeed. The best way to succeed is not by failing over and over. This just makes more problems for people to solve to be successful. Success is about working hard every day with the same excitement we had at the start and doing what others think can't be done.\n\nOne reason why failing again and again doesn't lead to success is that it creates more problems to solve. In 2017, scientists found that failure hurts people's feelings and gives them more troubles. Now, they have to deal with their failure and their feelings. People want to succeed in life and in solving problems they face while trying to succeed. I had a teacher who wanted to be the best at her school. But some students didn't listen to her. She tried hard to make them pay attention, but it didn't work. She saw her efforts weren't helping us become better students. Months later, she quit, felt upset, and couldn't be the teacher she once was. This shows how failing can have bad results.\n\nAnother reason why success isn't about failing over and over is that success is about working hard every day with the same excitement we had at the beginning and doing what others think is impossible. Success isn't just about reaching a goal; it's about making every moment useful for us and the world. Success makes us feel good and inspires others to do good things without failing. I have a friend who wanted to be a soccer player. He trained every day after school. Everyone thought he would fail at his first game, but he didn't give up. In his first game, he proved he could be one of the best soccer players in America. He kept working hard every day. Years later, a team from Spain called him to play for them. Now, he's in Spain, playing in the best league, showing that his hard work was for a reason: success. Some people think failing is the best way to learn and improve. But failing is one of the worst things we can face when trying to succeed. Failure has been shown to destroy people's chances of success.\n\nIn conclusion, success isn't about moving from failure to failure without losing excitement. Not everyone sees failure as something good. Most people think failure just makes more problems to solve before they can succeed. These problems make most people stop trying to succeed. Also, people feel beaten after their first failure, which causes them emotional problems. Success shows how important it is to take each step without failing. Success is the result of all our hard work and effort without failing. Failure just destroys our dreams."}

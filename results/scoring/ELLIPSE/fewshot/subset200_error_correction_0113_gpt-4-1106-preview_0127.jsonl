Some may see it as a problem for their child, but others may view it as a way for students to receive the education they need in their lives. Some schools have allowed their students to take classes at home as an option, enabling them to receive education at home while being able to do other things in the meantime. The students receive their education through online or video conferencing, allowing them to be seen working by their teachers. While some may view at-home classes as problematic, agreeing to it can allow students to take as much time as they need for help, enable them to focus more on the subject or task without distractions, and ensure they receive the education necessary for their lives.\n\nOne benefit is that students can take as much time as they need when they require help with something. When a student is struggling with homework or studying for a test they need to pass, they can ask a teacher for assistance to understand the problem and how to succeed. The teacher can mark anything that is incorrect on their homework or assignment and help them until they understand their mistakes. With students juggling many subjects and tasks, the potential for stress is high, but with a teacher's help, they can take the time they need to finish. This support can significantly improve a student's chances of success in class.\n\nAnother advantage is that students can focus more on the subject or task without distractions. By taking classes at home, a student has a quiet room to concentrate on the given tasks without others diverting their attention. There is no risk of another student interrupting them, causing them to lose focus and forget what they were working on. Teachers want their students to succeed in their classes without any distractions, so they can grasp the material and potentially improve for an upcoming test or quiz.\n\nFurthermore, students will acquire the education they need for their lives. While some might think that what they are learning in class is pointless, teachers strive to impart knowledge that will be useful in students' daily lives. What some may consider a distraction, others view as valuable when helping family and friends. For some, this knowledge is a goal to be set; for others, it is an accomplishment that will assist them through both hard and good times.\n\nWhile some argue that students may not receive the recommended education they need to succeed in life by taking classes at home, the benefits are clear: students can take the necessary time for help, focus more on their work without distractions, and gain the knowledge essential for their lives. For schools to offer this opportunity for students to choose to take their classes at home and receive the education they need to navigate life will help them improve and potentially teach others who are having similar learning difficulties.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

This is because some activities at school are boring, and the people who like to stay after are the ones with a more active system. They enjoy staying for sports or to learn more. People might like to see how fun it could be sometimes, because staying after is not that bad. You can stay at your favorite club or activity. Mine would be to play for the soccer club, and they could see how much fun it could be. Some people would stay for other classes and be interested so they can bring their grades up and get good grades on their report card. Others might go to a club or a technology room because they find it interesting. The principal probably wants students to do something fun and not be bored at home. The principal likely wants them to be a fun person for a day and give everybody a chance to join a club or activity, have fun, and so they can meet other people and learn about them. This way, they won't always be talking to the same people. Sometimes, people need to meet others so they can talk about each other and discuss how much they love the activities. But, in my opinion, I want to disagree at the same time because some people don't like to stay after school. It's boring, and there's nothing fun to do, so they just go home. Some people are just tired and exhausted, and that's why some other people can't even stay to help their parents around the house or take care of their brother or sister. But sometimes, you just get bored and don't even want to stay at the school because you are tired of seeing the classes and the people, or just even learning. Sometimes people say, 'I want to stay,' but they never do. Others say, 'I will stay this time,' and they don't. Some people just don't like to see the school every day; they only come to learn and then leave for home. But other people come and stay because they have nothing to do, or they are just bored at home. So, they go to the after-school activity so they won't be bored and can just have fun.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

I believe we, the people, accomplish more if we are doing something because there is movement, and we can have a lot of accomplishments.\n\nWhen there is movement, we accomplish more things. We accomplish more because we get an idea of what we are doing and how to do it. Our brains get working, and the next time we do something we have already done, we are going to know how to do it because we are using hands-on experience. Also, we are going to do it in a faster amount of time. That way, we accomplish more than just one thing. Thomas Jefferson once wrote, \"Determine never to be idle... it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing.\" This means that we should be determined to do something to accomplish more things than we can think of because with determination, we can do many things.\n\nThere are many accomplishments we can achieve. We can build schools for people who are not wealthy and live in poverty so they can receive an education. We can also build parks for kids to play in, and so people can go out for a walk or a run. We can also help animals by creating a National Park so that the animals can be taken care of and have a safe habitat. We can also help reduce the use of natural resources so we can have a clean and safe environment. There are many things we can accomplish, but the thing is that we are not doing much, and we are just thinking about all of this, and we never go out and actually accomplish things.\n\nEven though others may believe that we accomplish more when we are inactive because we are using our brains, however, they are wrong because what is the purpose of using our brain if you are not going to do the things we have in mind? It is good to think, but it is not good to keep all the ideas you have in your brain. I think that people who are inactive do not accomplish more than the people who are doing something. The people who are doing something are actually doing things to accomplish more and more. I believe we, the people, accomplish more if we are doing something.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe we, the people, accomplish more if we are doing something because there is movement, and we can have a lot of accomplishments. When we have hands-on experience, we accomplish more because we are actually doing something and we are not just sitting around doing nothing to prevent things from happening.

They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.\n\nSecondly, If you are honest \"all the time\" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher. By the wrong person you talk to, you might accidentally start a riot.\n\nLastly, you should be careful on how honest you are to people, because you don't know whether they are going through some stuff you are pointing out to them. Being truthful to someone and saying everything to them might make them upset on how you view stuff in the world also. Honesty is like an opinion that may cause someone that went through something upset them drastically. This is why I disagree that honesty is the best policy. From the situation you are in say respectful stuff towards the person. It might make you a better person if you are not saying negative things towards a person too.\n\nIn conclusion, I disagree with \"Honesty is the best policy\" by the situation you are in with the person and what they are going through. May cause them to dislike themselves in a way you wouldn't know.\"\n\nExample essay 2 of score \"3.0\":\n\"CURFEWS SAVE TEENAGERS\n\nBy Generic_Name\n\nCurfews are a great way to keep teenagers safe and out of trouble.\n\nTeen teenagers who spend too much time on the streets are more likely to get in drugs, curfews will prevent teenagers from spending too much time in the streets.

You don't want to end up like them because they probably end up living on the streets in a dirty city, regretting your life choices and having too many kids. But with a great attitude, you'll have a different perspective on life. When you have a good attitude, people feel like they can trust you and are more likely to want to be your friend. Also, people with great attitudes can get better opportunities in life than those who are mean and ungrateful.\n\nIn life, if you want people to trust you, you're going to need to be nice and caring. They're going to be like, 'I like that guy; he has a nice attitude.' You can get friends who know you and think that you can be trustworthy. I remember when I was 11 years old, my older sister had a 2-year-old baby named Generic_Name. She was visiting to take my mama to the doctor's appointment. Then they said that they couldn't take my baby niece because she would just be crying the whole time. I knew that my mama and my sister knew I could take care of the baby. So it was just me, my baby niece, and my younger sister, but she didn't do much. They came back in 2 hours and they said, 'Mama and I, we could trust in you.'\n\nWhen you have a good, confident attitude, you can get better opportunities in your life, like when you want to apply for college or for a high-paying job. They are most likely to pick the one who is generous, kind, and confident. One time, my brother Generic_Name was applying for college. He sent his form to the college's online website and was so confident when he sent it. A few days later, he got the mail; the college wrote back, 'We want you to come talk to us about if we want you at our school.' My brother Generic_Name is one of the most generous and confident people I know, so I knew he would get into the school. He did get into the school and now he studies at Generic_School.\n\nThis all means that having good attitudes and a positive perspective on life will give you people who you can trust and better opportunities in your life. Just by having good attitudes.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

Your character will be what you choose to make it, whether it's good or bad; it's all in your hands. This has its own benefits: you will find your passion, surround yourself with the right group of people, and have no regrets at the end.\n\nYou will find what you are passionate about. Finding your passion is one of the hardest things to do, so start searching at an early age. \"Once you have something you love to do, you will never work a day in your life,\" Kobe Bryant remarked. To find your passion, you have to be yourself. Most people aren't lucky enough to find what they love. \"If you wake up mad about going to work, do something else. I was lucky enough to find my passion,\" he said. And if you choose to do something because of your friends, good luck, because they probably like their job, but you will be wasting more energy. Every person has their box; your box might not be as beautiful as mine, but you have to dance beautifully in the box you are comfortable in.\n\nFind influence and be an influence. It is easy to find influence or inspiration once you know your passion. My influences have changed over the years, but my passion for basketball remains the same. I used to just like the sport, but my love for it started to fade away until I heard about basketball legend Kobe Bryant. Because of Kobe Bryant, I fell in love with the sport. Not only was basketball my life, but I now loved everything about it: the smell of the ball, the sound of the dribble, and the smooth leather of the ball. I've drawn a lot from Kobe's game and his off-the-court experiences. Now, I try to influence younger kids to work on their craft.\n\nRegretting something at the end is one of the worst things ever. If you followed someone else's dream, passion, or footsteps without realizing what you are doing is wrong, you will regret it after retiring. You will regret not following your own dreams and not making your own character. \"I have no regrets. I left everything on the court every single day, so now that I'm retired, I have zero regrets,\" Kobe Bryant said. Find your passion, be the best at it, and at the end of the day, you will have no regrets.\n\nSome might say you need an influence to work hard; I agree. However, there is no point in getting influenced if you don't know what influence you are looking for. Be yourself; you will find your passion, find the inspiration or influence that you may need, and have no regrets at the end. Go and make your own character.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing.\" According to Thomas Jefferson's quote, inactivity is not a way to achieve our goals; we should be always working and striving towards them. It is hard to believe that the most effective way to accomplish something is by being busy and always doing something. Although some people say that we accomplish more when we are inactive than when we are always doing something because we have more time to set our goals, in reality, we accomplish more when we are active because we have more time to keep working on our goals to achieve them sooner, and we don't waste time that can be used to work on our goals.\n\nSome people argue that we accomplish more when we are inactive than when we are always doing something because we have more time to set our goals. The main reason these people believe that inactivity serves an important purpose is that they get more time to think about what they want to do in their life and have their goals already planned. According to The New York Times, people who take moments of inactivity are usually confident and sure about what they want to do in their life, and what goals they want to set and achieve. In addition, they are more motivated and put more effort into their goals.\n\nHowever, we accomplish more when we are always doing something because we have more time to keep working on our goals to achieve them sooner. Being always active and working is the best way to achieve our goals. According to a study from Generic School, all the people who are now successful were always working on their goals and never had a moment where they thought they had to stop and wait because the accomplishment was about to come. We always have to be working; our goals will never come easily. As we keep working on our goals, they will come to us sooner.\n\nWe accomplish more when we are always doing something because we don't waste time that can be used to work on our goals. Sometimes when we are working hard on our goals, there's a time where we think that we have to stop and rest, but we shouldn't do that because that would be a waste of time that could be used to keep working. The right person to say that is my dad. When he was a teenager and had already graduated, he wanted to become an Industrial Engineer, but he didn't want to go to college right after he graduated. He wanted to wait and be inactive for at least one year before entering college, but that was a big mistake because during that time he didn't get a job, so he used a part of the money that he would have used for college. Now he is not an Industrial Engineer; he never achieved his goal because he wasted the time that he could have used to achieve it.\n\nThough some people say that inactivity is more effective than activity in accomplishing goals because it is a better way to set our goals, being active is the best way to accomplish them because we can achieve our goals sooner and we don't waste useful time. In conclusion, as you can see, inactivity will not be the best way because the reality is that we can achieve our goals and get a lot of wonderful things just by being always active. Stopping to have a good moment of relaxing might be awesome, but nothing compares to having what you want in life and doing things that will show our effort and dedication.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

Although some people may think that inactivity is part of life and that chances will show up later in their lives, I believe that by being active, opportunities will present themselves with more frequency. Being active improves our skills, keeps us healthier, and opens up a new world full of opportunities and success.\n\nBeing active brings perseverance into our lives. One example is the improvement of our skills. By being active, we make progress in our skills or even develop new ones. This gives us an advantage over inactive people and helps us make a living doing something we enjoy. This is why I think that improving and developing skills is very important in human life.\n\nActiveness is extremely important for all of us. Another example of the importance of being active is our health status. Being active, in a fitness sense, is very important. It has a significant impact on our health. Being inactive can lead to diseases, some of which can be terminal, such as cancer. This is another reason that convinces me that doing something is a big deal in our lives.\n\nPutting ourselves to work on something will lead to a life of success. The last example is the opportunities that an active life can bring. By leading an active life, as I mentioned before, we improve and develop new skills. These skills will lead us to a life with numerous opportunities that will make it much easier to succeed. This is possibly the main reason why we should always put ourselves to work on something.\n\nTo conclude, I think that challenging ourselves or putting ourselves to work on something may be hard, but the results are worth enough to motivate us. Health, new opportunities, and self-improvement are integral parts of our lives. It is our choice to be an active or an inactive person, and the results of each are clear. For all these reasons, and many others I could not mention, I believe that doing something is the key to achieving our goals and being successful.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

I believe that encountering a problem is an opportunity for you to rise again and try another approach. When faced with a problem, not only can you learn from your mistakes, but you can also identify what went wrong and seek guidance from someone who has succeeded, to discover a better way of assisting you. Additionally, you can observe and consider the actions of those around you who have previously succeeded.\n\nLearning from your mistakes by observing successful individuals around you isn't as negative as it may seem. It's a chance to start anew, armed with the knowledge that the method you previously tried was ineffective, and with an understanding of what to do differently before revisiting your past work. For instance, you might encounter a challenging project that requires you to persist through errors to build a strong understanding of it. If you make a mistake in a relationship, it doesn't mean you must end it; instead, you can work through the issues, strive to improve, and learn from the experience. At some point in life, you will face a challenge that demands repeated attempts, as this is a period for introspection and deciding how to move forward from past errors.\n\nWhen you encounter a problem, you shouldn't shoulder the worry alone; seek help from someone who has faced a similar issue. Their advice, born from experience, can be invaluable. For example, scientists often make mistakes but persevere until they achieve satisfactory results. Math teachers may struggle with difficult questions, but they continue to work through them until they find the correct solution. We all face problems daily, yet we don't give up; we persist until the issue is resolved, no matter how long it takes. When confronted with a problem, it's our chance to excel by seeking assistance and learning from our mistakes. Often, when working on a project assigned by professors or teachers, students may doubt their approach. How can you know if you're on the right track if you haven't consulted the person who assigned the project or someone who has already succeeded?\n\nI concur that a problem presents an opportunity to excel because it allows you to seek help from peers or to learn from your mistakes and observe others. It's important to confide in a friend or someone you trust about your struggles and how they can support and comfort you. By not repeating the same errors, you can learn from your mistakes and find solutions to your problems.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

You follow the voice and end up in the middle of the mall where a girl is singing her heart out and playing the guitar. Then, all of a sudden, you find an interest in singing and playing the guitar. Everyone has a talent or skill, and some people use it every day.\n\nHere are some talents people use every day, like singing, playing the guitar, playing the piano, being a magician, and being a comedian. A lot of people sing for a living, and it's so cool how they sing. My favorite singer is Shawn Mendes, and the way he uses his voice is so cool and beautiful. Playing the guitar is an everyday thing for some people too. Some singers play the guitar, or some people just play the guitar without singing at all, and it sounds so beautiful that it makes me feel relaxed listening to people play. Also, playing the piano is very fun and exciting, and I love when people play calm and peaceful music. I always thought magicians are cool and mind-blowing; I just don't get how they do their tricks. Every time I watch a magician on America's Got Talent, I'm always on the edge of my seat by the end of the episode. Finally, comedians are so fun to watch; they make me laugh so much that I'm always in tears. Sometimes when I think the person is so funny, I laugh so much that my stomach starts hurting right after.\n\nThese are some everyday skills people use, like being very good at math, being organized, playing a sport, getting straight A's every time, and doing makeup looks. Most people are good at doing math and solving problems. It takes effort to be good at something. Math is a very hard subject, and I don't know how people do it. I'm kind of good at math, but not that good like others. Being organized is a hard thing to do. A lot of people aren't organized. It takes time, a lot of responsibility, and patience to be organized. Playing a sport is hard because you have to have a lot of skills and be athletic to play. Like ice hockey, it is very hard because you have to have good and strong balance in order to skate on the ice. Getting straight A's every time is not that easy; I've tried before, and I'm still trying. You have to believe in yourself and tell yourself you can do it. You need to have a lot of effort and study a lot in order to reach this goal in life. Doing your makeup is a skillful task because you never know if you're going to mess up or not. It's basically art but on your face; it's beautiful.\n\nEveryone in the world has a talent, and there are a lot of skills in the world too. There are a lot of talented people in the world; some are celebrities, and some aren't noticed. There are a lot of people who are posting videos of their talent, but some people don't watch because some are new YouTubers, and people see that they don't have that many views or subscribers compared to other YouTubers. Social media is a big thing in the world, like Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, Twitter, Facebook, etc. A lot of people post on those social media apps their skill or their talent.\n\nMy talent or skill is baking. I bake all the time. Whenever I get home after school, I bake whatever I'm craving. I found out about my talent when I saw my dad making delicious, fluffy, and moist cupcakes for his catering. I asked him if I could help him with the order, and he said \"Yes!\" Ever since then, I bake almost every day. It's so fun; baking calms me down and gets my mind off things. Whenever I'm bored, I start baking; I know I'm addicted to baking! I make cakes, cupcakes, truffles, etc. My dad gets so excited when I bake; he says whatever I make is going to be good no matter what. That's my talent, baking. Everyone uses their talent or skill every day, and everyone has one.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher. By the wrong person you talk to, you might accidentally start a riot.\n\nLastly, you should be careful on how honest you are to people, because you don't know whether they are going through some stuff you are pointing out to them.

I suggest we continue with the traditional method, as it seems to be a better option.\n\nThe first reason why is that many teachers can maintain their jobs and continue working as they are accustomed to. This means that many teachers won't have to lose their positions. There are likely a lot of them who prefer having a classroom full of students, or some may find it easier or more enjoyable to communicate with students in person. This interaction can sometimes be beneficial for the students.\n\nThe second reason is that students can learn to be more social with their peers, which can lead to better communication skills with other people. For example, it would be much easier for them to secure a job on their own because it makes them more confident in themselves, and this confidence can improve their performance in almost all their classes.\n\nThe third reason is that schools can still be used normally, as long as everything is okay with them, and they can still serve many purposes for students. However, some people argue that allowing students to take classes from home through online or video conferencing might provide a more flexible schedule because they are in their homes. But I believe this might disrupt the students' learning, especially if they don't have access to Wi-Fi or transportation, like having to go to a library. That's why I take this position against taking classes online.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing.\" That saying raises the question: do we accomplish more if we are always active, or does inactivity also serve a purpose? Most people believe that inactivity does serve a purpose, and here is why: it allows our brains to rest, and without rest, we would eventually pass out from exhaustion, and our brains wouldn't function at 100%. \n\nOne of the reasons why people agree with inactivity serving a purpose is that it allows our brain to rest. For example, when you have had a stressful day at work, you'll want to relax and do nothing at home. Doing so will allow your brain to recover and process things better, and you'll return to work stress-free and ready for the next day. Also, when I was in the 10th grade, I got really stressed out about not advancing to the next grade. It wasn't until I took a day off and did nothing school-related that I realized I could get after-school help to stay on track. This was one of the reasons why inactivity serves a purpose. \n\nThe last reason why inactivity serves a purpose is that without rest, you would eventually pass out from exhaustion, and your brain wouldn't work at 100 percent. For instance, there have been cases where people have passed out from working too hard and not getting enough sleep. Moreover, if you don't rest your brain, it won't function at full capacity. It has been proven that 95% of people who pass out do so mainly because of exhaustion. \n\nThus, this is why you should rest and take time to relax now and then. \n\nSome people may argue that you do accomplish more by working continuously, like gaining more knowledge. However, it has been proven that people pass out due to a lack of sleep from work or school. Also, you shouldn't risk your health just to gain more knowledge. \n\nIn conclusion, inactivity plays a major role in your mental health. Being inactive allows you to rest, and without proper rest, you would eventually pass out from exhaustion, and your brain wouldn't function at 100%. Overall, this is why inactivity serves a purpose in life.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times.

For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return. Secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later. They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.\n\nSecondly, If you are honest \"all the time\" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher.

This is equivalent to having an extra day off at work or school. Therefore, schools should adopt the habit of a four-day school week by extending the school day by two hours. The benefits of changing to a four-day school week include conserving energy and resources, improving academic performance, and providing enough time to complete school assignments.\n\nThe amount of energy and resources used at school for a whole week is more than what we use at home. Examples of such are electricity and water. The more we use, the more the school pays for it. That one extra day off reduces expenses in respect of food services, transportation, and utilities.\n\nNot only does the school conserve energy and resources, but it also offers teachers and students an additional day for rest every week. As a result, there is less stress over schoolwork. Students feel less pressured because they have enough rest at home before coming to school. This is an important factor that helps improve the academic performance of students.\n\nNotwithstanding the fact that the school conserves energy and resources and provides enough rest, students will also have enough time to complete their assignments. Most students complain that they do not get time at home to finish up with the homework given to them by their teachers. When this continuously happens, it could drag down their grades. Having an additional day, making it a three-day weekend instead of two, will give them more time to prepare for tests and study at their own pace.\n\nSwitching to a four-day school week will help change a lot.

This letter is to express why I believe I would be an asset to your company. My suitability for the role may hinge on my skills and level of responsibility. I am proud to say that I am responsible. In school, I was a very good teenager and a student with good grades, not to brag. However, I must admit that initiating conversations is not my strong suit, which I mention just in case.\n\nIn college, I was a diligent student, though not one to achieve straight A's\u2014I was more of an average student.\n\nI can be helpful for two reasons: I am a helpful person by nature, and I strive to make others feel that I am a good person who can contribute positively to their lives. I hope you will come to see me as a helpful individual because I aim to fulfill my mission of being the best person my parents have always wanted. I don't want them\u2014or myself\u2014to feel that I was born for nothing. It bothers me when people are upset or angry, as I tend to feel responsible. That's why I am driven to solve other people's problems. I don't want to let them down; I want to be someone who does things right.\n\nNow, let's discuss my personality and work preferences. As I mentioned, I'm not the best at starting conversations, but I am a very talkative person. I enjoy talking, though I admit I can become a bit annoying and tire after a while. My speaking pace can be quite fast, depending on my mood. However, if I am in a bad mood, I will control myself because I respect others and don't want them to think my mood reflects on the job. Regardless of whether I am mad, sad, happy, or indifferent, I will remain respectful no matter what.\n\nAs for the type of job I am seeking, I am open to any position you believe suits me. I live by the motto, 'No job is too big, no job is too small.' I am confident I can handle any task you assign to me.\n\nIn conclusion, I hope you will consider my application.

I disagree with this statement because it is likely that each impression we have is based on the actions of others. You may have many impressions about something you believe is terrible, but if you investigate it, you might conclude that it's not as bad as you thought, so your impression can change. It's not impossible for impressions to change.\n\nFirst, it is possible for us to change our impressions when we encounter something good or sometimes bad. We often think that everything we see is real, but we never truly understand what is happening in real life. Also, the first impression we have of another person is not always accurate because we don't know who they are or what they want. Therefore, we shouldn't say bad things about them; we need to get to know the person first and share experiences with them. Only then can we judge them fairly. Sometimes, bad impressions are harmful because some people have health problems, and when they learn about something very bad, they can become depressed or so sad that they don't want to do anything.\n\nIn life, we have many impressions that are incredible, like when we have the opportunity to get a great job. We have the best impression when we first arrive, seeing the place and what others do, and sharing moments with them is great. However, over time, our impression may change because it is not the same as in the beginning. Maybe now you have problems with your colleagues, and the impression you have of them has altered. It is common for our impressions about things or people we consider friends to evolve.\n\nAt the beginning of the year, I had a friend for whom I had great affection. In my opinion, she was the best friend I had, but over time she changed. She treated me poorly and did many bad things, so my impression changed. I don't know if others feel the same because my impressions change quickly when I see things I don't like. At the same time, I wondered why she changed towards me. I was sad because the person I considered my friend had become just another acquaintance. It is rare for the impression you have of a person at the beginning to remain the same.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

Without venturing into new areas, individuals will never grow; they will remain stagnant, repeating the same tasks they have mastered. It is beneficial to try something else, something never experienced before, to learn new things instead of sticking to what is already known. I believe that when people engage in different types of activities they are not accustomed to, they will be able to learn new skills, better themselves, and surpass their previous limitations. In my opinion, once you have mastered one skill, you should attempt to learn another, thereby becoming more adept and growing to be successful in all that life presents. If you continue doing the same thing you have already mastered, you are missing an opportunity to learn something new that could enhance your abilities and provide more life experience.\n\nStudents in school sometimes receive the same classes every year, classes they have already mastered. They could be learning something new to become more capable in every aspect, but instead, they miss out on new experiences. When you are engaged in the same activity all the time, there comes a moment when you grow tired of repeating it. At some point in your life, you may feel that you have missed the opportunity to learn something different, and it may seem like a waste of time\u2014time that could have been spent trying something new instead of what you have already mastered.\n\nIn my opinion, I agree with Emerson's statement because he encourages people to look beyond and not just stay focused on the same thing all the time. He suggests moving on to other things after mastering one, so you can grow and become successful in life. Emerson implies that 'people who do the same thing they have already mastered will never grow.'\n\nIn conclusion, people should practice something other than what they have mastered, so they can grow and learn new things, thereby becoming successful in life. Individuals will never develop by doing the same thing repeatedly; they need to look beyond and not just remain in the same place. I think Emerson's statement is a good reminder for people to move on in life and look beyond what they have already mastered.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

We all have something in common, whether it be the same color hair, tone of the skin, or color of the eyes, but everyone's personality is different. It can be good for you and bad for others, or the opposite. However, being yourself can be one of the greatest accomplishments these days.\n\nOne reason why being yourself can be the greatest thing in this world is that the world and people's behaviors are obstacles to being you; they would try to change you. A second reason is that being yourself is important to find out who we are and what purpose we want to achieve in our life; that's one step. The last reason is that if you are yourself, the world is on your side, and with that, you have a big weapon to make a difference. That's why I agree with Emerson's statement that 'To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.'\n\nThe world is constantly trying to make us become something else, but the world is us, humans.\n\nOne or a group of persons can be either good or bad influences in our lives. They literally can push us to do anything if we give them control of our lives. For example, in the United States, we have a higher percentage of shootings in high schools and stores. The majority of them are committed by two or more persons. The police reports that I have read constantly give more years in jail to the main responsible. To me, one of them was a bad influence; they become an obstacle for themselves and for those that they kill. Fairly, both of them get to pay for what they have done. However, that's why we need to know who we call friends and family because they can push you to do things that maybe you don't want to do; they become an obstacle. Furthermore, if you do anything that they want, you totally lose yourself and always be the way that they want you to be. That's why we need to find out who we are, find ourselves, and a purpose.\n\nIt is important that we find out who we are and what purpose we want to achieve in our lives. To me, personally, it is hard to know everything about myself; sometimes I do things that I never thought about. There is one phrase that is inside of me; it says, 'If you don't know yourself, how do you pretend to know others?' That phrase reflects to me how we pretend to go against the world if we don't even know who we are. We basically do what we see in the world. There is violence, murders, economic problems, rapists, robbers, and more. In addition, this includes how important it is to give ourselves a purpose. It is important because if you are focused on your goal, for example, you want to be a doctor, you spend a lot of time studying and working that you would forget about what is going on in the world, you are going to ignore problems and other people's lives and be focused on yourself to achieve your purpose. Once you get to be yourself, the world is on your side, and with that, you make a difference, and that becomes a big accomplishment.\n\nPersonality works better when it is positive, and you have a good heart; you get to support others, and they support you. If you have everything under control, know who you are, and your purposes, the world would be on your side. That makes a difference to you and others, becoming successful and a great influence on others. For example, the majority of us have read documentaries about people who had an impact on the world to make it better.\n\nFor example, Malala, she was a young lady who decided to fight against her government to get the right to study; in her country, women were not allowed to go to school. Malala was very confident in believing in herself, and she knew what the purpose was. As time passed, Malala achieved her accomplishments; now, thanks to her and all those that gave their support, women are allowed to have an education. Malala is a great example to believe that being yourself is the greatest accomplishment.\n\nIn conclusion, the world and people's behaviors can be big obstacles to us; it can be friends or family members. That's why we need to know ourselves and learn how to know others. It is important to give ourselves a purpose so we would get focused and ignore the problems that are going on in the world, and while that time, we would be finding ourselves.\n\nOnce we have confidence in ourselves and know the purpose in our lives, everything would be very different. The world would be on our side, and that's a big weapon to support others and help the world to become better. In my opinion, I agree with the idea that being yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

You enter your house and sigh with boredom. Once again, the rest of your family is out participating in activities, and you are left alone at home with nothing to do. This situation has occurred to many people who don't participate in any extracurricular activities. I believe that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because students will be able to meet new people, find a new passion, and it gives them something to do.\n\nIf you are looking to meet new people, joining an extracurricular activity is a great way to do it. It is easier to make friends with people with whom you share common interests. So, it will be less difficult for you to talk to someone who has joined the same club as you because all of the people in that club at least share the common interest of the subject of the club. Participating in the same activity and being in the same room encourages you to talk to people. When I am at swim practice, I am encouraged to talk to the people in my lane because we are swimming together for one and a half hours, so why not get to know them? Because of this, I have made new friends outside of school, and I regularly spend time with my new friends outside of swim practice as well. Meeting new people is only one benefit of extracurricular activities; however, there are many more.\n\nIt is hard to discover hidden passions if you don't try new and different activities. Through these new activities, you could discover that you have a strong interest in robotics that you were not aware of before. If you find an activity that you are passionate about, your life will be much more exciting and enriching. It can also help you figure out what type of career you want to pursue when you grow up. Naturally, people will want to pursue careers that are related to subjects they are interested in. So, it will be much easier for you to decide because you have discovered your passions and talents at an earlier age. My father signed me up for theatre one year, and when he first told me, I was apprehensive. I am naturally a shy person, so I didn't think that I would enjoy being on stage in front of a large crowd of people. But, I ended up really enjoying the whole experience and participated in that theatre camp for three more years. Also, when I first started taking piano lessons, I thought that it would be a huge waste of time. But, I found that I was quite talented at playing the piano, and I enjoyed creating music that my family and friends loved listening to. Extracurricular activities help you uncover new passions, and they also provide you with something to do.\n\nParticipating in an extracurricular activity is a productive way to use your time. Many students come home and waste time on the internet or social media because they have nothing better to do. There is nothing worse than coming home and finding out that your child spent four hours watching cartoons on TV. An activity would give them something to think about or allow them to spend their time somewhere productive. When I have nothing to do at home, I play the piano because it is a great way for me to use excess time, and I enjoy doing it. On the days that I am not at swim practice, I would feel like I have too much time on my hands. But, I have other extracurricular activities scheduled for those days, like meeting with my math team or piano lessons, which prevent me from experiencing painful boredom. These are only a few reasons why students should participate in extracurricular activities, and it can be seen that there are significant benefits.\n\nIn conclusion, students should participate in extracurricular activities because they give you something productive to do, they help you find new passions, and allow you to meet new people. Every student should choose one extracurricular activity to participate in because of the plentiful benefits these activities provide. Suddenly, you realize that today was the first day of track practice, and you frantically call your friend, asking them if they can come pick you up and bring you back to school. When they arrive, you hurriedly jump into their car and anxiously wait during the drive back to school. Once you are finally there, you burst out of the car and hurry down to the track. Luckily, the coach had only just started with stretches, so you put down your bag and stretch with the rest of the team. Throughout the rest of practice, you laugh with a new friend whom you would have never met if you hadn't joined the track team.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

The reason I'm telling them this is because their lungs could get ruined, and they might not be able to breathe well, possibly requiring an oxygen tank. Additionally, if they do it repeatedly, they could become addicted and may continue the habit for their entire life. Another reason to avoid it is the risk of influencing their friends to try it, who might also become addicted.\n\nMy second piece of advice is to avoid getting into trouble, especially when you're at risk of receiving six broken pillars. Then you'll have to attend a meeting with your parents and all your teachers, or sometimes just with your teachers. If you do receive six broken pillars, you will have lunch detention and won't be able to hang out with your friends during lunch, which you'll probably prefer over sitting quietly alone. Another reason to avoid trouble is the Behavioral Intervention Program (BIP). Why avoid it? BIP is a room you go to if you've done something bad.\n\nThird, don't do foolish things like getting in trouble for running in the hallways, play fighting, or talking back to a teacher. These are some of the silliest reasons to get into trouble, especially when you're in a rush to get to class or lunch. Other reasons for getting into trouble include being tardy, and if you're tardy, you will receive a broken pillar unless you have a note from a teacher or a valid excuse.\n\nThe fourth reason is to get involved in school activities like basketball, track, soccer, volleyball, or whatever sport you play. It's beneficial because it helps your muscles stay strong. Also, try to keep your grades up and not let them slip because if they do, you won't be able to participate in events, especially important ones. One reason to stay out of trouble is that if you don't, you could get kicked off the team.\n\nIn conclusion, it's better to stay out of trouble because your parents might get upset and restrict your participation in activities. Also, strive to get better grades so you can succeed in life like other people or one of your family members. You could also land a better job or acquire a better house and car. You might even enjoy a better lifestyle.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

Some people believe curfews will keep teenagers out of trouble for these reasons. Others believe that curfews unfairly interfere in young people's lives because they need to experience the real world at night, go to movies, and have fun as teens. I think curfews will keep teens out of trouble by eliminating midnight parties, nighttime play, and visits to friends' houses at night.\n\nFirst, curfews will keep teenagers out of trouble because there will be no midnight parties. At midnight parties, there can be a lot of trouble; people can even do dangerous things. For example, when a teen goes to a midnight party, they will most likely smoke or drink, and when they get high or wasted, they may do something dangerous, like driving home drunk, which will most likely lead to car crashes, or the police may chase them. That is why the curfew is there to keep teenagers out of trouble.\n\nSecondly, curfews will help a lot in keeping teenagers out of trouble because there will be no playing out at night. When teens are out at night, they make reckless decisions and do dangerous things that can get them into a lot of trouble. For example, when I was in my country, Liberia, we used to go out at night and play, but one night something bad happened. There was this boy named Generic_Name; he took a rock and threw it up in the air. Then the rock started to come down, but no one could see it because it was night. There was this girl named Generic_Name who was right under where the rock was coming down, but did not know it. The rock hit her on the head, and she started to bleed. That's why playing out at night is not safe. Curfews will help keep teens safe.\n\nHowever, not everyone agrees that curfews will help keep teenagers out of trouble. Some people believe that curfews unfairly interfere in young people's lives because they will not have the chance to find out what the world is like at night, will not have the chance to go to after-parties at friends' houses, and miss out on having fun as a teen. Otherwise, curfews will help keep teenagers out of trouble because going to a friend's house at night is not good; a lot of bad things happen there at night, and most teens don't have the best judgment when it comes to staying out of trouble, so the curfew will help them with that.\n\nIn conclusion, curfews will keep teens out of trouble. No midnight parties, and no going to friends' houses at night. Others may not like that; they may say it unfairly interferes with young lives, but it does not. When teenagers go to parties at night or just go out, they do a lot of dangerous things which they know will get them into trouble, like drinking or even driving after they have drunk a lot.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

Some people think cell phones in school are a great help for their classwork. Others believe students take advantage of these devices during class time. I think cell phones are a distraction to students during school and at home. Although some argue students should be allowed to use their cell phones for educational purposes because they are a good source for finding research on a topic in class, in reality, cell phones are a distraction in school because students take these devices for granted to play games and for entertainment, such as Netflix and YouTube.\n\nThose who think that students should use their cellphones in school for education only have their reasons. Students argue that they should be allowed to use their cell phones for anything they miss during class or in case of an emergency. I believe students take their cell phones for granted when they are allowed to use them during class.\n\nStudents have lost their focus in school and are more focused on games. According to social media, a game is trending around the world and it's called Fortnite. Kids today are captivated by playing Fortnite or any kind of games. Students get out of focus when they are bored. Teachers get annoyed when they are trying to teach and one of their students isn't giving them the attention because they are playing games on their phones. Students don't focus on their work and don't even do their homework at home because they are busy playing games or engaging in other distractions. Some kids don't get enough sleep, staying up until 3 in the morning playing online games with others. These kids don't have enough energy in school and fall asleep during class. Some believe that Fortnite or any kind of game has taken over these students' attention.\n\nWhat will happen in the next episode? What have they uploaded today? Netflix and YouTube have become significant distractions for some students today. Some students get anxious to see what happens next on a show they are watching on Netflix or wondering what a YouTuber has uploaded today. Some teachers report that kids in their class hide behind their book bags or under their desks to watch entertainment. Some students don't pay attention or notice what they are doing when they are engrossed in a show. Parents complain when their students have low grades, not realizing their kids have been playing games or watching shows on their cell phones during class time.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe cell phones are a distraction for students in class and at home. Using time wisely with these devices will help both teachers and students. There is enough time to play games, watch shows, or view YouTube videos. Students should finish all their classwork, pay attention to teachers, and complete their homework first when they come home from school, then there will be no complaints from anyone. Students will stay on track in school, and no one will be left behind!\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

If you are honest with yourself, then you can be honest with your loved ones like your family, friends, and all the people that are there for you when you need them or when you have a problem; they will always help you.\n\nThat shows to be honest with the ones you love because once you lie to them, you won't stop lying, and that can lead to consequences only because you just can't be honest with your friends, family, and all the people that are around you. If they are there for you and if they trust you, don't repay them by lying to them. Just be honest because if you lie to them, you will lose the family that was there for you when you needed them, those friends that were there to help you when you had a problem.\n\nLike, for example, lying is the reason why many people ruin their relationships. Lying is the reason why people don't work out because they don't have trust in each other. The only thing that they think about is to lie to each other because they just can't find a way to be honest. However, some people might end up hurt because you were just lying to them the whole time, and sometimes when someone is hurting another person, it's like hurting themselves because they can't fix all that pain that they did to others. That's why think about what you are going to do or say. Just take time and think before saying something that would hurt other people. That's why think about it twice, not just acting like nothing happened. Think about what other people can feel, think, or say.\n\nIf you are honest with others, you will have a normal life with honesty, not just with lies and all that stuff that can hurt other people. Another example: if you go to a job interview and the boss starts asking you questions, and to the first question the boss gives you, or whoever is doing the interview, if you tell a lie to that question, it's not going to end up well. Because if the person who is doing the interview keeps on asking you questions and you are just telling lies, then that's not going to work at all. Because now you can't stop lying, and you can't control yourself after telling a lie, then you will not get the job because you were just lying and lying to others is like lying to yourself.\n\nAll I have to say is to be honest with your friends, family, and all the people that have been there for you when you needed them. Just be honest. If you're going to say something that is not honest and it's a lie, then don't say it. Think about it twice. Anyway, try your best in what you do. Don't live your life with lies because, in the end, you will realize what you said was wrong and it wasn't the truth. Then you will see at the end that what you did wasn't honest, even though some people think that lying is the best. When you tell a lie and another lie, and those people that you love\u2014your family and your friends\u2014once they believe you, and when they find out that you just lied to them, they would never believe you again.\n\nI think it would happen in the same story that my mom told me once. She said that a long time ago, there was a guy who used to have sheep. He lived in a small town, and she told me that one day, while he was outside feeding his sheep, he started screaming for help, saying that a wolf was trying to attack him. Then everyone in the town went outside to help him, but when half of the people that lived in the town got to where the man was, they saw that there was nothing. Then the man with the sheep started laughing because the people of the town actually believed him. Then the next day, the man with the sheep started screaming again and saying the same thing he said before. The people of the town believed him again. Then the people of the town got mad at him, and they left. Then the next day, he started screaming again, and this time the man was telling the truth, but it was too late because nobody from the town came out to help him because they were thinking that if he lied to them two times, he might be doing it again. Then the man was scared and kept on screaming that the wolf was eating his sheep, but nobody helped him because they thought that he was just lying again. Then, at the end, the wolf ate all the man's sheep, and nobody in the town believed him ever again, and the man stayed all alone because nobody believed him.\n\nI learned a valuable lesson only because of this story. This story is telling me to be honest with others. If you tell a lie and you keep on telling it, they won't believe you because you were lying all the time. So be honest with yourself and others.\n\nIf you can't say something honest, don't say something that you will regret, and think about it before you act, or you will hurt others.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

They need to be an example to others, showing them a good path so that they can find better opportunities to become better individuals.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

It's because of how you talk to them the first time. They might have responded to you in a bad way, such as with a rude manner, attitude, or by ignoring you, etc. That will just create a bad impression of yourself. On the other hand, if you have a positive vibe and attitude, your first impression is likely to be good. People will think that you are willing to work hard and set good standards. That's what they look for when you take interviews for jobs.\n\nFirst impressions are hard to change, and the reason I say this is because no one likes a negative person. If you walk into a job interview with a bad impression, they're most likely not even going to hire you. When you meet someone for the first time, are you going to be negative about it or positive? Most people, if not everyone, will say positive. Why, you may ask? Because they don't want to make a fool of themselves. If you choose to be negative, you'll regret it, because people will not just want to talk to you; they'll talk badly about you, saying, 'He's not a good person,' or 'He has a bad attitude,' etc.\n\nNow, let's say you have a positive attitude while meeting new people. They'll like you instead of not wanting to talk to you. That's what you call a good first impression because you did not have an attitude, you did not ignore them, and you kept a positive vibe while talking to them. And if you keep that same attitude, they will want to talk to you again because you didn't treat them badly. Another thing about first impressions is that many people are going to ask what you do for a living, and that's a good thing because you can have a humane and chill conversation with them. Many people just ask questions, and you give them an answer; that's not really a conversation. A conversation is when you actually get to know each other and share what you like to do and what your hobbies are, etc. So, in conclusion, have a good first impression; it'll take you far in life. No matter how bad your day went, just smile because there will always be another day.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

Some people travel to another country or state of the United States because they do not like the cold; they prefer hot places. I disagree with some teachers who argue that there should be year-round schools, where there would be a 3-4 week break in the summer, a longer winter break, and a week off in the spring. But we study for about 8-9 months; why do they want more time to study?\n\nIf they want a longer winter, how can we enjoy it? Because in the winter, there's snow, too much cold, and we can just stay at home, which will lead to stress. I prefer a longer summer break because we can practice sports, go to the beach, and cook outside (like carne asada).\n\nPracticing sports is good for our bodies, something we can do in the summer. Sports like soccer, baseball, and running on the street with our friends are enjoyable. Soccer is a sport that we can practice in the summer because you can form a team and compete in a big league with other teams, make new friends in that league, and if you like soccer, maybe you can join a big team like Barcelona, Galaxy, or Real Madrid. The benefits of practicing sports include taking care of your health because you won't be looking at your mobile phone, which can damage your eyes. You'll be a happier person without stress, and you'll maintain a good physique instead of staying in bed and getting fat. Also, you can learn about sports you don't know; if you have friends who know how to play, they can teach you. After learning, you'll feel good when your friends talk about it because you can share your opinion, whereas before, you couldn't because you didn't know about the sport.\n\nAnother great thing to do in the summer is to go to the beach with your family to enjoy the sun, the sand, and watch the sharks swim out to sea. Watching the sunrise over the sea and exclaiming 'wow' is breathtaking. If you have money, you can travel to another country where you can find coconuts or palm trees, like Mexico, where you can enjoy 'agua de coco' or sleep under a palm tree without a care in the world. You'll forget, for a moment, all the bad things like work, study, enemies, etc. That's another reason I want a longer summer: to forget all my troubles for a while and gain more energy to start a new school year. I really enjoyed last summer because we had three months, and I went to different countries to enjoy the sea. I built sandcastles with my brother and ate a lot of shellfish. I like shellfish because my father told me that when I was young, I would be strong because shellfish contain a lot of vitamins. I didn't like them at first, but when we traveled, he would say if I didn't eat the shellfish, I wouldn't get any other food that day. So I was scared, and that was the first time I tried some. Now I love shellfish; whenever we go to the beach, my family at the hotel orders some because now the whole family likes shellfish. It's the first food we eat.\n\nCarne asada is another thing I can do in the summer. 'Carne asada' means barbecue, a name for food that Latin America calls. To make carne asada, you need to have a clear sky because when you cook, you need to have your grill outside the house. I can't do this during the winter because it's cold, and I would freeze. That's why I prefer a longer summer to cook carne asada many times and share it with my friends or family. We can also go to the park and cook there. It's beautiful when I do this because all my family comes to my house, and we can talk about our stories. When my grandfather talks, everyone has to be quiet because he talks about his past life and his ideas for a good future for us. We can also dance to any music we like. These are moments I can't forget because in winter, all these things end.\n\nSummer is a time that most people like because you can do many things, enjoy time with your family and friends. In winter, you can only stay at home, watch television, use your phone, play Fortnite, etc. I don't like all those things; I like to enjoy my youth. When you are young, you have to explore your mind, make new friends, and I believe you can't do this at home; you would die of boredom without friends. That's why I prefer a longer summer because if they give me just 3-4 weeks of summer, I can't do anything, and I won't want to come back to school; I will be bored. Summer is the time when we can enjoy and do many things to prepare for the winter because in winter, you can't work or travel. So summer is very important.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

And even if others mock you for your problems, continue to fight and always heed your parents' advice, as they are older than you and have experienced more. \n\nNever let others bring you down because you are strong and intelligent. Don't become angry over what people say about you; instead, confront your own problems and always trust yourself. Help yourself with the issues you face, allowing your mind to open so that when another problem arises, you can solve it easily. For instance, when you build a company and a significant problem arises, the leader must resolve the issue, or the company may fail. Some problems can be minor, and some can be challenging. Everyone faces problems, even children, so if you are going through a tough time, don't give up because it's difficult. You can face a problem without even realizing it. Sometimes the problems you encounter can hurt your feelings. For example, if your girlfriend cheats on you and you don't know how to deal with it, you can ask your parents or a trusted adult for help. Some problems may be family-related, such as grieving over the death of a family member. You can take a few days to rest and then tell your parents how you feel, and they will come to comfort you so that you can overcome it. A problem may be hard to get past, but once you do, you will be fine and won't have any problems ever again because you'll be able to face any challenge that comes your way.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

Sometimes we don't have time to dress formally for an occasion, or we don't know what the occasion is. Nevertheless, people are expected to dress appropriately for specific events. An experience I had was when I took my first job; I dressed formally.\n\nWhen you have the opportunity to change first impressions, you can, but not just with your dress. You need to represent your intelligence and your capacity to work with others, which is who you are.\n\nPeople need to dress appropriately for different occasions. When you go to your first job interview, your dress should be formal. The first impression is what people remember when they hear your name; it's the first thing that comes to mind. It's really hard for a person not to want to change for new opportunities in the future. Most people disagree with this because not everyone thinks the same way. It's hard to make decisions when people don't want to help you because your first impression was really bad. Some people have different opinions; in my own opinion, your dress reflects who you are and the emotions you have.\n\nThe experiences in my life have taught me this. When I wake up in the morning, I dress appropriately to go to school because you need to be a good person, a good student. But if your dress is appropriate and you make bad choices or verbal actions, it affects your first impression. The first impression is like your 'photo'; it's who you are and what you represent, but nevertheless, your 'photo' can be changed with your actions. In my opinion, you need to represent whatever your personality is, or if you have a good leader in your life and you want to be like him or her, that's fine. Personally, I want to grow up to be like my grandfather and my mom because he has strong opinions about life and work. My mom is a good woman who has a lot of experience, and she has always been good at her work and very responsible. That's an impression, a good 'photo', for people to remember her by.\n\nIntelligence can be more than how you look. It's not impossible to change. People change, contrary to those who believe that it's not possible to change first impressions. The world has many who are selfish and critical just because of how you look or where you're from. Everyone has a different culture and habits; some people actually like another's culture or habits. People judge a book by its cover. Intelligence is the foundation of entering the world, but if your first impression was terrible, it's bad. You need to continue and work to give a better impression to other people.\n\nIn conclusion, it's a really bad idea to say that first impressions are almost impossible to change. It's possible to change; for example, in my life, when I started my job, I was nervous at the first meeting, but I wanted to make a good impression on my boss. I work in a restaurant, and sometimes I need to talk with customers. My first impression and my verbal impression are important for improving and working better with different types of people. Your impression also makes people judge you, for better or worse. Impressions are important for various reasons. In my own opinion, I disagree with the notion that first impressions are set in stone, and I believe that people who think differently have more self-esteem and the ability to change their first impression.

However, keep some things to yourself if you think it's not positive to say to another. Second, It might make the person feel bad if you do say something harsh to them. Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times. Sometimes you have to say what's right in order to not hurt someones feelings from what you said. For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return. Secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later. They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.\n\nSecondly, If you are honest \"all the time\" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher. By the wrong person you talk to, you might accidentally start a riot.\n\nLastly, you should be careful on how honest you are to people, because you don't know whether they are going through some stuff you are pointing out to them.

Some people see themselves in a role and believe they can make a difference. For example, Generic_Name is one of the best soccer players in the world, but before he achieved what he is known for, his doctor told him he couldn't play soccer anywhere because he was sick. Another example is Generic_Name, who, when in high school, told his father he wanted to be like him. However, his father said no. Look at where Generic_Name is now.\n\nThe second example is that they have information about the career. They have the skills they need to get the job, they know what education is required, and they understand what the job entails.\n\nOn the other hand, people who don't like being forced to choose a career in high school are right because they may not like the career due to their parents' influence. I agree with them, but at the same time, some people have to work in jobs they don't like because they need to make money to support their families.\n\nThis is my idea about the topic, and I think it's significant.\n\nSincerely,\n\nGeneric_Name\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

Well, I have, many times with my mom. My mom helps me by preventing bad things. For example, one day my friend and I wanted to walk to the store by ourselves, and we asked my mom if we could go. However, my mom didn't let us because she said we could get kidnapped. Similarly, one day, my mom and her friend were walking by themselves and they almost got kidnapped, so we didn't go. It is important to know people's experiences so you won't make the same mistakes they did, learn from their experiences, and help yourself by preventing bad things. Experiences are always shared and are very important.\n\nThe first reason why you should share experiences with people is to prevent yourself from making the same mistakes as others. You can also make a better choice. For instance, one day, I went to the doctor's and I had to get a flu shot, but I didn't want it because I don't like shots. Then, my mom told me that once she had to get a flu shot and didn't, and the next day she got sick. So then I decided to get the flu shot. Making the same mistake as someone else is not fun, so listening to people's experiences is a great way to prevent repeating those mistakes. Many people make mistakes and learn from them. Mistakes are always made, but not when you have already been warned.\n\nThe second reason is to learn from experiences. Learning from another person's experience can help you by showing you how to do something well. For example, one day, I was doing something wrong and my teacher came to me, talked to me so I wouldn't do it again, and showed me how to do it in a better way. Doing things in a better way can be much easier. Never give up when you can't do something; just keep trying or ask for help. Learning something new is an everyday thing. Another example is when I didn't know how to bake a cake, and my aunt helped me, and the cake turned out very well. Learning is a very fun and exciting experience.\n\nThe third reason is so they can help you prevent bad things. Bad things never lead to anything good. One time, my sister and I were misbehaving, thinking we wouldn't get in trouble, and we were hitting my 3-year-old sister because she hit us with a bat while playing around. We got grounded afterward and couldn't go to the pool anymore. When you need an opinion on whether you should do something or not, just ask someone, so you can avoid doing something bad. Help others prevent bad things. Bad outcomes are never the best. Working hard is always the best thing to do.\n\nFinally, avoid doing everything that is bad and ask for opinions on whether you should do it or not. Also, learn from your past mistakes and do something better and easier. Sharing experiences can help people make better choices. Easy things can become better in life. Try something new and better every day. People change into better individuals when they receive the best advice. People always have the best advice to give.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

Working toward a goal takes time. I know that achieving a goal is one of the proudest accomplishments we can make for ourselves. However, thinking about and working on a goal every day is not the best idea. This is because we do not have time for ourselves, we need to recharge our minds in order to continue with an activity, and stress will enter our lives.\n\nFirstly, to become successful in this world, we need a routine based on productive things and also time for ourselves to do what we desire. We need time to relax and enjoy what this world offers us. Five years ago, I remember my parents being too busy to have a day off and take care of me during the school year. My dad was working at a construction company from Monday through Saturday, and my mom was studying at the university. We did not have time to have a deep conversation and enjoy a day off at home. We needed a break at that moment, but once Spring Break came, we stopped our routine. My parents and I were happy because we knew that we had time to do some fun things, and we stopped worrying about school, work, and study. After the break, we were ready and refreshed to start our routine again. Having a break between activities helps us to give time to restart our minds.\n\nSecondly, humans are able to accomplish great goals, but time is required. When I was in middle school, my teacher always gave us time to relax and stop what we were doing in the classroom. According to my teacher, inactivity provides us with energy and is a way to be able to continue with classwork or activities at school.\n\nPracticing this activity was helpful to me because I could concentrate even more on my school activities. Additionally, when my classmates were tired, they would ask the teacher for a break because they needed that time to clear their minds from worries and stress.\n\nMy friends and I needed time where we could interact with others. Getting to know a new person makes me feel important to that person. We need time not only for activities and responsibilities but also to rest and stop worrying about work in order to recharge our minds and become successful.\n\nFinally, stress can lead to depression. It is hard to imagine how difficult life can be. By concentrating more on your required activities than on fun activities, you encounter its negative side. Some people might quit their goals by not having time for themselves. For example, when my older brother went to college, he needed money to pay for college and supplies. He was required to work at a restaurant to earn some money. Once he started college and working at the restaurant, I noticed that he was extremely exhausted, stressed, and quiet. He felt he was not able to finish college. After a couple of days, he quit college and his job because not having time for himself stopped him from trying to reach his goal. He could have reached his goal, but too much activity and stress led him to depression. Breaks are as important as activities in our lives.\n\nMany claim that the earlier and more rapidly you start your activities, the more chances you have to get things done. Additionally, some people believe that breaks are not important or beneficial in achieving a goal and should not be required; however, taking a break between your activities can change your life. Because you have time to recharge your mind, you also have time for yourself, and stress does not affect your well-being. Life is short; do not let activities lead you to depression. Take a break and start again.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

The three-year program should be an idea that more schools offer because it would provide students with an advantage when it comes to having a fresh sense of the information about the subjects.\n\nOne of the main reasons why the three-year program is better than the four-year program is time. Time is one of the main influences on high school students, and knowing how to manage time is the key to success. Therefore, the three-year education program takes care of not wasting time and allows students to finish high school in a shorter period, giving them the opportunity to enter college or the workforce one year earlier.\n\nAnother advantage for high schoolers enrolled in a three-year program is that they have fresher information due to the fact there is no long pause like summer vacation. They have their classes one after another, which helps them not to forget information and also helps the teacher by having less time to waste on reviewing material.\n\nAlthough the three-year program may sound perfect, it has one major problem: students enrolled in a four-year program have more time to work on financial savings because they can save money for student loans for a longer time.\n\nIn conclusion, the three-year program is better than the four-year program because it gives students the advantage of more efficient time management, a better grasp of the subjects, and a better understanding of how to manage time.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return. Secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later. They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.\n\nSecondly, If you are honest \"all the time\" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher. By the wrong person you talk to, you might accidentally start a riot.\n\nLastly, you should be careful on how honest you are to people, because you don't know whether they are going through some stuff you are pointing out to them. Being truthful to someone and saying everything to them might make them upset on how you view stuff in the world also. Honesty is like an opinion that may cause someone that went through something upset them drastically. This is why I disagree that honesty is the best policy. From the situation you are in say respectful stuff towards the person. It might make you a better person if you are not saying negative things towards a person too.\n\nIn conclusion, I disagree with \"Honesty is the best policy\" by the situation you are in with the person and what they are going through.

What do they want to do in the future? Schools should form partnerships with companies because it helps students understand what's best for them, for example, what they are interested in, provides opportunities to explore the world, and aids in developing communication skills with others.\n\nOne reason why it's beneficial for students is that they get to discover their interests. If students have the chance to participate in these internships, it allows them to work with a diverse group of people. Working with people from different cultures will teach them how to collaborate and handle various situations. They'll be able to pursue their interests and gain experience as well. Many students are unsure about their future careers. An internship can help them make informed decisions. Often, they don't have the opportunity to explore their true interests. Some students may choose classes simply because their friends are taking them, even if they lack interest, due to uncertainty about their own preferences. Consequently, they might quit the class later, realizing it's not for them. This also creates trouble for school counselors, as they then have to rearrange the students' schedules, which can be problematic. However, an internship can provide clarity about their interests, preventing future confusion.\n\nThe next reason is that students receive numerous opportunities to explore the world. It is rare for students to have the chance to learn about the world firsthand. This exploration is something many students desire but unfortunately, not everyone gets the opportunity. Learning about different cultures and making new friends can be incredibly beneficial. When they explore the world, they may learn new languages, which can greatly enhance their employability. In the United States, employers often seek multilingual students because it can improve company effectiveness. Students who speak several languages tend not to hesitate in communicating with others, feeling empowered to achieve their goals.\n\nThe last reason is that internships enable students to improve their communication skills. Often, students may be knowledgeable but lack the confidence to speak up. They may feel shy or doubt their abilities. Participating in internships can help them become more confident. By working and interacting with others during an internship, they will overcome their shyness and gain confidence through practice.\n\nCommunication is a vital part of life; without it, students may struggle to understand what's happening around them, which can negatively impact their education. Both in and out of school, strong communication skills are essential for self-improvement. Communication not only facilitates the exchange of ideas but also empowers students to speak up. As they become more vocal, they'll gain confidence and become less concerned about others' opinions.\n\nSome argue that internships may not be suitable for all students, as they already have commitments such as sports or after-school jobs. However, if schools establish partnerships with various companies, it could provide an invaluable opportunity for students to explore their interests, discover the world, and become more confident and communicative. This experience can reassure students that they are capable of achieving their goals.\n\nIn conclusion, collaborating with companies can help students make decisions more confidently and overcome any shyness. It can also assist them in determining their life's ambitions. These partnerships offer students the chance to learn new things and languages, which would be challenging without the experience of an internship. I believe students should have access to these internships to help them grow and improve.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

Online or video conferencing could benefit students, allowing them to attend classes more conveniently. Although there are advantages to physically going to school, taking classes from home means students don't have to worry about bullying by classmates, being late because there's no need to travel, and lacking food to eat at school.\n\nWaking up early every morning for school can be very stressful. Students have to take a shower, brush their teeth, some girls apply makeup, and then pack their school bags. Often, students feel too lazy to get out of bed, resulting in them missing the bus. Consequently, they might have to stay home, wait for a ride, or even walk to school. Most students don't get enough sleep, which impairs their focus in class. Hunger can also be a distraction, making things worse. When working online, students may choose the time that suits them best and stay at home, eliminating the need to worry about their appearance.\n\nAttending online classes means there are no classmates present, which can be beneficial. Without classmates, students can concentrate on their work, as there are no distractions from noise or other disruptions. Since they're not in a physical classroom, there's no risk of being bullied, teased, or judged. Bullying can lead to depression in school for some students, whether it's about their dress, looks, smell, or past actions. This can result in students no longer wanting to attend school. Therefore, in online classes, students work independently, which can lead to greater focus on schoolwork.\n\nWhat are the benefits of attending classes in person at school? By going to school, students can communicate with others and make friends. They can ask teachers or friends for additional help. Since the student is out of the house, parents save money as the electric bill will be lower. By attending school, students can participate in sports or after-school programs that may help them choose their career, rather than being cooped up at home.\n\nIn conclusion, attending classes online can benefit students. It is the best way to receive an education for those who prioritize safety from bullies, no distractions from classmates, always having food available to maintain focus, and the flexibility of scheduling classes according to the student's own time.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

I agree with this statement about individuality because it encourages you to be brave enough to show your soul, your personality, and the real way you are without fear of what people are going to think or say about you. Do what you love without letting people interfere or trying to change the way you are.\n\nBeing yourself in this world comes with many obstacles that you confront every day, trying to change the essence of who you really are. For example, some parents want their kids to choose a career that they do not like just because it is the career that the parents wanted to pursue when they were young but, for some reasons, they could not. Parents forget that everybody has the right to choose over their own lives, or who they want to be; to choose a career that really inspires them, makes them feel good, and proud of their accomplishments.\n\nYou are going to find many people trying to change you. For example, your friendships, when someone of your supposed \"friends\" is trying to convince you to do bad things or make wrong decisions just because they do the same. Some of your friends may show you how to smoke or how to steal things from commercial centers; if you do not feel good doing these things, then do not do it just to be part of their group. Do not let people influence your life in a bad way if you know that you are a different person. Be yourself; real friends will understand that you do not feel good doing bad things and will love you for who you are.\n\nIn conclusion, to be yourself in a world with many obstacles is the greatest accomplishment you could achieve in your life, and few people do. Being yourself means that you feel comfortable with the person that you are, and you do what you love without anybody's interference. Do not let obstacles change your essence and your individuality. Express your ideas, do what you like, trust yourself before anyone else, be proud of who you are, and be happy being yourself.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

People talk with others on the phone. Some of them don't talk face to face; they use technology instead. For example, if you're traveling to another country, you have to speak with them in other languages; you can't use technology to communicate with them.\n\nTechnology has both positive and negative effects if you use it in the right way. There are some positive effects of technology, such as sending mail fast, making phone calls, talking with someone, and online shopping. Technology affects people's minds by playing a lot of games, being on the phone a lot, and not talking with other people.\n\nThe most important effect of technology on humans is communication. Most people don't talk because they use technology a lot, and it affects their being by sitting at home and being on the phone for hours. People need to talk more than just being on the telephone. Technology is growing more and more every day; that means that ten years from now, there might not be communication with anyone. Everyone will talk on the phone or use other technology.\n\nThe second most important effect of technology is on kids. When a kid is crying, the only thing their parents give them is their telephone or technology to make them stop crying. I think that is not a good idea because their minds will set, and every time they cry, they will want a phone to keep them from crying. Parents allow their kids to have a phone and they allow their kids to use their phone even while eating lunch or dinner. It's good now, but in the future, it's not that good because they'll not know how to communicate with someone or how to talk with someone without using technology.\n\nOverall, I think technology is good. It's good to use technology, but not all the time, not to communicate but to get work done. Don't allow your kids to use technology all the time; it's not good for them. Technology is making them turn to the phone instead of talking in person.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

However, in school, some students cannot stay for such an extended period consistently for four days. There are students who would like to have a four-day school week, but extending it by two hours would not be good for them. Spending ten hours in school is akin to students spending the whole day there and coming home just to sleep. Some students have jobs after school, and others take care of their little brother or sister while their parents are not at home. Some students might be happy with this, but they do not realize how tired they will become. Schools should not follow this model by extending the school day by two hours because students will not have much time left to do their homework and other extracurricular activities. Some students work after school, and they do not get much time to spend with their families. \n\nSchools should not adopt this four-day school week model with an extended school day because students will not have enough time for homework and extracurricular activities. If students spend ten hours at school, they will not have time to play video games or participate in sports such as soccer, football, basketball, and cricket. They will also lack time for homework and sleep. If students come home from school and sleep, they may not be able to sleep at night, and if they cannot wake up in the morning, they may become ill. Students need to refresh their minds by sleeping for one or two hours after they return from school and engage in activities like games. They need more time; if they spend ten hours at school just studying, they come home tired and are unable to do anything or understand the material at school. If they cannot understand the material, they might fail in class, which could be problematic. With the amount of homework and tests/quizzes they have every day, they cannot study adequately in such a limited time. They also need more rest to refresh their minds. Therefore, schools should not allow a ten-hour extension because students will not have enough time to prepare for tests/quizzes, do their homework, or rest. \n\nSchools should not follow this model by extending the school day by two hours because some students work after school. If schools extend the day by two hours, some students may lose their jobs because they go directly from school to work. Some students work to save money for college or university fees or to help their parents. Immigrant families who have recently arrived in the country may not have much money, so their high school children also work to support their parents. If schools extend the day by two hours, those students who have jobs may lose them and struggle to survive. Students who work the entire week will lose their right to do anything else if the school day is extended, causing significant hardship in their lives. A student who has big dreams and works to save for college will be deeply affected by the loss of their job and may give up. If schools extend the day by two hours, some students may have to change their job schedules, resulting in them coming home late and not having time to do schoolwork or study for tests. Schools should not follow this model because it does not help students who work after school. \n\nSchools should not follow this model by extending the school day by two hours because students will not have much time to spend with their families. If schools extend the day, some students will not be able to spend time with their families, especially if their parents work on weekends and cannot see their children. When students come back from school, they will be tired and will only want to sleep. \n\nIf schools extend the day by two hours, students will not have time to go out; they may have a three-day weekend, but they might be too tired from spending four consecutive days of ten hours each at school. They might receive more homework because of the three-day weekends. They might become sick of all this and not want to talk to anyone at home. Extending the school day by two hours will distance students from their families. Spending time with family refreshes students' minds. If students do not spend time with their families, it can cause problems because their minds will be preoccupied with school, leaving no room for anything else. Therefore, schools should not follow this model because students need to spend time with their families. \n\nIn conclusion, schools should not extend the school day by two hours because students will not have enough time for homework, extracurricular activities like games and sports, or to spend with their families. Some students have jobs after school, and the extended hours would significantly impact their lives.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

If you fail one thousand times, it's okay; don't worry because one day you can realize your dream. Failure is just an experience in your life. I agree with Churchill's statement about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success because you gain more experience in your life, you remain a positive person without loss of enthusiasm, and you accept your mistakes.\n\nFirst reason: gaining more experience in life. The experience that you gain when you fail helps you to realize your dream and achieve success in your life. For example, if you were in a relationship where your boyfriend was a bad person and it failed, you wouldn't want to have another relationship with someone like him because you have learned from the bad experience, and this helps you not to make the same decision again.\n\nSecond reason: being a positive person without loss of enthusiasm. View failure with a positive attitude because you can't feel bad or depressed when you fail. For example, when my mother wanted to drive, she needed to pass the driver's test but always failed. The first time she felt bad and disappointed, but she kept trying until she passed.\n\nFinal reason: accepting our mistakes. It is difficult to accept our errors when we fail at something. For example, when you fail a test because you didn't study and didn't pay attention in class, you don't want to accept that it was your fault. However, when you learn to accept the mistake, you start to strive not to fail again.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe the purpose of going from failure to failure is that we never lose enthusiasm to try again because we live in a country where we have many opportunities to pursue something. Failure helps us to learn about life, gain more experience, and accept our mistakes. We live in a country where we have many opportunities to pursue something.\"\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

Some argue that it is better to work alone because it fosters responsibility and confidence. However, this is not the case. Although some people might argue it is better to work alone, actually it is better to work in a group because we can finish our work quickly and we can learn more or gain more knowledge.\n\nThe first reason that explains why it is better to work in a group is that we can finish our work quickly. For example, in my history class, some of the students chose to do their work on their own, and some chose to work in a group. The student that finished early would get a prize, and the students that chose to work in a group finished earlier and got the prize. It is better to work in a group because if we had not done the work in a group, we would not have finished early and won the prize. It is better to work in a group to finish our work quickly. Another example that supports this is a man who had to fix a lot of cars in two days to pay for his house rent. He could not do it on his own, so he called his friends to help him. They worked in a group, and he finished his work quickly and also paid for his house rent. It is better to work in a group because if the man had not finished fixing the cars, he would have been on the street. But because he worked in a group, he finished his work quickly and paid his rent.\n\nThe second reason is that it is better to work in a group because we can learn new things. For example, I didn't know how to create a pie chart for my chemistry presentation, and I asked my friends for help. They said, 'Let's teach each other in a group,' and they showed me how to do it. I got 100 on it. It is better to work in a group to learn new things because if I hadn't done my pie chart and presented it, I would have gotten a 0 in my grades. But because I worked in a group and learned, I got 100. Another example is a girl who did not know how to swim. Her sister and brother taught her, and they also taught each other how to swim in different ways in a group. She learned how to swim. It is better to work in a group to learn new things. If she had not learned how to swim, she could have drowned. But they taught her in a group, and she learned how to swim.\n\nThe other side might say it is better to work alone because we can be responsible and confident. However, we can be more responsible and more confident if we work together in a group. For example, there were a lot of kids learning how to ride a bike, but there was one kid who felt confident and did not want to learn with them. He was 11 years old and so confident that he could ride a bike by himself, but he could not because he was not in the group. He fell when he tried to ride the bike and hurt his leg. It is better to work in a group. If the kid had learned how to ride a bike in the group, he would not have fallen and hurt his leg. Another example is a boy I know who wanted to live by himself and moved into a big house, but he could not afford the rent. It is better to work in a group. If the boy had worked in a group and paid the rent with the group, he would have been able to afford it.\n\nAlthough some people might argue it is better to work alone, actually it is better to work in a group because we can finish our work quickly and we can gain more experience or knowledge.\n\nIt is better to work in a group because working alone is not better than working in a group. When we work in a group, we will be safer, we can accomplish things more easily, finish quickly, and learn new things. It is better to work in a group to succeed.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

This is because students must be self-confident in order to learn effectively. Additionally, some people believe that the source of true self-esteem is achievement; without achievement, they won't learn how to master their self-esteem. Students should have the opportunity to control their fear to become confident and build self-esteem. While some people believe in praising a student's work, even if it is not their best effort, others argue that praise for deficient work undermines learning by lowering standards. It is commonly said that self-esteem comes from achievement. We should put more effort into it so that students can become professionals and master their self-esteem. Sometimes students don't want to succeed in life, so they avoid trying things that are good for them, thinking it's not important to be confident in areas where they are not skilled. It's true that life is not easy, and confidence can be hard to come by. That's why people should attempt challenging things, so when hard times come, they know how to be confident and prepared to deal with it. I have experienced that life is not easy because it always pushes everyone to succeed. Life forces everyone to cope with difficult parts. An example of a hard time in life is when you try to look for a job and you don't find one because you lack experience or confidence. That's why people make it more difficult to understand or to do; they will show you first how to do it and later let you do it on your own. If students are not satisfied with doing the right thing, it doesn't matter because we are trying to help them succeed in life. Not everyone is prepared to deal with life or its harder aspects, but the important thing is that they try and know that the best way to succeed and be confident is to put effort into it. I recommend that students should try harder and not be afraid or shy. Even if a student is not trying and putting forth their best effort, some students who have experienced the same lack of confidence say that it is a challenge for all people in the world and it's not easy. Other students had an idea of starting a club where students can participate. It was a good idea for the students to open the club. Students should do something to lose their fear and become confident; they should attend a club or talk to their parents. But if students don't try because they feel that the fear will not go away, they should understand that we do it not because we hate them, but for a reason\u2014not to bother them or act like an evil person. In conclusion, we should all put effort into what we do because it is very important to be careful in our actions, so we can say we did it, we lost our fears, and now we are more confident.

While many people believe that graduating in three years is not good, they argue that the traditional four-year graduation is better because students will gain more experience and will be able to determine the career they want to pursue in college upon graduation.\n\nTo begin with, students who stay in high school for four years will have more experience. They will complete the classes required for graduation and may take subjects they are passionate about. Joining clubs at school allows students to learn more skills and develop their ability to speak for themselves. Some students participate in groups that volunteer to help others in school, engaging with many people and developing skills. These activities may even earn them credits for college. Additionally, students from other countries or those in ELL classes may learn at a slower pace and need more time to improve their English before graduating. High school teachers always provide support, helping students to develop quickly.\n\nThe second reason is that students will have the opportunity to discover their career interests. They can choose classes that align with their career goals. For example, if they are interested in a Marketing career, they can take DECA classes or an introduction to Marketing to support their career aspirations. Schools often organize meetings for students to discuss careers with representatives from colleges or universities they may consider after graduation. Counselors provide detailed support regarding skills, GPA, location, tuition, and scholarships, helping students choose the right career for their future.\n\nAlthough students can graduate early in three years, they may feel pressured by their subjects. However, they can save a year to do something else, like entering college early, getting accustomed to the new environment, working, and earning money to support their life in college and pay for tuition. But these students may have less experience and be confused about their career in college because they have not fully developed their thinking, leading to potential time lost in learning and career exploration.\n\nFinally, students should graduate traditionally in four years. They will be supported by more people in school, learn from a variety of classes, develop their social skills, and apply these skills to their career or life. Moreover, they will not waste time finding a suitable career with the help of counselors and teachers. In summary, graduating traditionally in four years is beneficial because it provides students with more advantages for their future work.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

Moreover, it affects the physical health and mental well-being of those who use it.\n\nTechnology causes distractions and problems. For example, people don't pay attention when they use their phones to play games, watch videos, or text with their friends at school or in their jobs. This leads to poor communication and problems with their teachers or bosses, resulting in people taking online education and online jobs, which affects their ability to interact with new people and to learn about other opportunities within society.\n\nThe technology influences people to choose easier ways. For instance, fewer people use books to find information, go shopping, eat at restaurants, or play table games with their families or friends because they can find these activities on TV, computers, or phone applications. People would rather stay at home and acquire everything in an easy form, which is bad as they become lazier and lose the opportunity to share and talk more with their families or people around them.\n\nTechnology affects the physical health and mental well-being of its users. For example, some people have vision problems because they spend a lot of time on their phones or watching TV, and others have hearing problems because they use headphones with loud music for extended periods. All of these issues affect people's ability to communicate, as vision and hearing are forms that humans use to communicate with others.\n\nIn conclusion, technology has had negative effects on people's lives, affecting their communication, progress, and physical health, and therefore people have fewer opportunities in their present and it affects them in their future.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

Kindness is a huge part of life that makes us grow and have a good, loving, and kind heart. Every day we need to show kindness because we are helping people who have a bad day or are going through a rough time. I have been one of those people who are going through a rough time, and it's hard and sad. Last year at my old school (it was a private school), I was lost. The people that I trusted were fake, and their kindness was fake. I needed someone by my side, but they didn't care. The only thing that was important to them was themselves. They didn't care about other people's feelings, except for their best friend, which I was not a part of. They called me 'shy girl' because I was quiet. When you are new to a school, you get nervous, you feel you don't belong, and you say to yourself, 'This isn't my school.' Those were the exact same words in my head when I entered the building four years ago. I needed a true friend that was going to show me kindness, telling me that everything is going to be okay or 'I will always be by your side.' I cried every day for that matter. They judged a lot of people who were innocent by their looks or how they act. I felt alone. Until... \n\nThe end of seventh grade I transferred to a public school, I felt alive. I never felt that feeling in years. The people were nice to me. I met so many nice people. I met real friends. They cared about me; they asked me if everything was okay, said 'You are beautiful,' 'You are amazing,' 'What's wrong?' 'How was your day?' 'This will make you feel better.' Everything they said was kind. It always made my day. I felt that I belonged here. I was so much happier, and I am still happy. Any people who do any kind or nice things to me, I appreciate it. \n\nBelieve me, if you do any kind thing to someone or say something nice to them, it makes their day because they know they are not alone. \n\nKindness may not be everywhere, but as long as you feel you belong or have a purpose in life, you have kindness in you, and the people around you do too. Whatever happens in life, you must have kindness in your heart because one day you will change someone's life just like a switch. Because if you don't turn on the switch, it stays dark, but when you turn on the switch, it is bright; it shines. That's how kindness works. If you help people to show kindness, they will bring kindness back. \n\nI hope people show kindness because they helped me, and I help them. Kindness, any little thing you do, is something that the people will always remember and cherish. The only thing I always remember and say is to always show kindness to the world. Show kindness and respect always. Maybe one day you will change someone's life. Showing kindness is the right thing to do. Always be kind.\"\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

If so, you might've heard one from Michelangelo. Michelangelo was a great artist who once said, \"The greater danger for most of us lies not in setting our aim too high and falling short; but in setting our aim too low, and achieving our mark.\" I don't agree with this statement because the greatest danger lies in us setting our aim too high and falling short. The statement that Michelangelo made is negatively impactful because it can cause us stress and make us act negatively in different ways.\n\nThe greatest danger for most of us lies in setting our aim too high and falling short because of stress. By setting our aim too high, stress can make us feel like giving up on what we want to accomplish in our lives. If we do this, we will feel hopeless and not try again. Another reason why stress is related to this is because it can make us feel tired and lazy. If we become tired and lazy, it can make us overthink and have negative thoughts. These are the reasons and examples of what stress can do to us if we set our aim too high.\n\nThe greatest danger for most of us lies in setting our aim too high and falling short because it can make us act negatively in different ways. If we focus so much on setting our aim high, it can make us forget important stuff. For example, it can make us forget to have quality time with our family and friends. We would lose the connections with our family and friends if we are only focusing on one thing. Another reason is it can make us behave badly and forget our manners. For example, if we focus on setting our aim too high and spend so much time on it all day, it can ruin our sleeping schedule and cause us to act cranky. These are the reasons and examples of acting negatively in different ways if we are setting our aim too high and falling short.\n\nSome people think the greater danger for most of us lies in setting our aim too low and achieving our mark. They think that because if we set our aim too low, we won't care as much about what we want to accomplish. For example, if we are just trying to rest or relax for a bit, they think we don't actually care about finishing our tasks. Another reason why they probably think that is because we won't be focusing on important things in life if we don't accomplish our goals first. For example, if we don't show the effort in front of them, they will automatically assume we don't show interest in accomplishing it and think we don't really care about what we want to do in life. Even though this may be true, I still think that the greater danger for us is setting our aim too high and falling short because it can cause more problems.\n\nThe statement that Michelangelo made is negatively impactful because it can cause us stress and make us act negatively in different ways. It can make us stressed if we set our aim too high and make us act negatively in different ways if we focus too much on setting our aim too high and falling short. By setting our aim too high, it can cause us to be stressed and make us feel like giving up and not wanting to finish our work. It can also make us stressed by not getting enough sleep if we're only focusing on one thing. These are the reasons why I disagree with Michelangelo because he believes that the greatest danger for most of us lies in setting our aim too low and achieving our mark.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

Although some people think students should not take online classes, nevertheless, there are some who agree with this situation in education. This is because online classes are time-limited, so students can use their time wisely for other things, and for those who face transportation problems every morning, classes from home will make their life easier.\n\nTo begin, taking online classes from home is much more valuable because these classes are time-limited, allowing students to use their other time wisely. For example, online classes usually have sessions which are at fixed times. One course must be completed within that session time. In this case, students can plan their study time during the day and work a job in their free time. In the USA, most students have to take out loans to finish their education. So, doing a job while taking an online course will help a lot with those loan terms. Clearly, it is beneficial to take online classes and agree with the offer of distance learning.\n\nFurthermore, for students who do not have their own transportation, online classes are the best option. For instance, in the USA, not having one's own transportation is a big problem. It is often the students who suffer the most. Every single morning, they have to rush for public transportation to get to campus so that they will not be late for class. Sometimes it affects their attendance, depending on the institute and their professors. This proves that taking an online class can solve most of these problems easily. And students will be able to focus on studying more than handling little problems like these, which are almost turning into a part of their daily life.\n\nOverall, it is much more important that taking a class online saves time and allows students to do other jobs to earn enough, and offers them the opportunity to be on time when there is a possibility of being late to class only because of transportation problems. This shows that students should attend classes from home via online or video conferencing and accept the offer of distance learning.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

I believe we choose our own character traits. It is all about how we choose to act. This means we make our own decisions to act. People can judge us by how we act and do things. It means the choices we make can be good or bad. We choose our own decisions and actions.\n\nOn March 7th, 1999, the Washington Post interviewed people from a local school. It was reported that students who chose to make good choices in school and at home became better people. This indicated that the students' decisions and actions showed how they built up character. The students who had good character over the year became successful later on. They were more successful because of their good characteristics and had a good personality.\n\nThis applies to many things, like schools and jobs. For example, a good character will most likely get you accepted to a job rather than having a bad character. I have experienced this when I was at a job interview. I made a good impression by dressing up and looking good, and my employer seemed impressed. I was determined to work by staying longer hours and studying. What I've learned from building a good character is that when you make a good impression and you are determined to do something, it will help you to improve your character. In my opinion, every individual needs to be a better person by improving their character. I believe this to be true because it is proven. It is proven because when you do something good, it will make you a better person. I feel that every individual should try to put a little more effort into their character. When people make good choices, they probably have a better future; this might help them to get a good job because of their good actions.\n\nIn conclusion, I think we do choose our own character traits. I believe every individual, including myself, should try to improve their character. When people do this, everyone will have a better character, and when there is better character, people will become more successful.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

They want individuals to have a career and to know what they want to do when they graduate from high school. Whether they aspire to be a teacher, doctor, police officer, or something else, they can become that person, but first, they need to pass all their tests and classes. For example, you need to pass this test. In all schools, they help students choose a career. They want the best for the students.\n\nI think that is a good idea because if someone wants to be a doctor or teacher, they help to choose the best career. I think that is important because it helps you more. I know my brother's friend; he is a teacher and he is 23 years old. Because he chose a career at a young age, he or someone helped him to choose a good career for him. The school is that friend that you have because they help you choose the career that you want to pursue. The school helps you with your classes and homework, stuff like that; the school helps you, and the school helps you with something else I cannot say because I don't know what I need to think.\n\nMy brother has another friend who graduated last year from Generic School, and now he is in college.

I may not go to the best university, but I can go to a university, and there I will work hard to pass all my classes, and I will choose the best career for me.

However, not all schools offer this opportunity, only some high schools. Our parents have jobs and want us to take care of our siblings. This is good because we don't need to come to school, and we can take care; we can also wake up late, depending on what time the classes are. My older sister is taking NOVA online, and she says it is easier because she works in the morning and does the classes at night, but she only takes classes three days a week: Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. When I graduate, I plan to do my university online too.\n\nMy thought is that attending classes from home via online or video conferencing is a good opportunity and benefit.

But now, with these opportunities of classes online, he can study from home after work and get his high school diploma. Secondly, not only for work but for many other reasons, some people can't finish their professional education. Some girls get pregnant at the same time they are trying to get a diploma or any career done. They give birth and have to stay home taking care of the baby. Thanks to the opportunities that these schools offer online, they can complete from home what they need to complete without going to school. In conclusion, schools that offer classes online or by videoconferencing are doing a great job helping students that for any reason don't have time to go to school to complete their goals to succeed in life.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

However, keep some things to yourself if you think it's not positive to say to another. Second, It might make the person feel bad if you do say something harsh to them. Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times. Sometimes you have to say what's right in order to not hurt someones feelings from what you said. For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return. Secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later. They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.\n\nSecondly, If you are honest \"all the time\" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher. By the wrong person you talk to, you might accidentally start a riot.\n\nLastly, you should be careful on how honest you are to people, because you don't know whether they are going through some stuff you are pointing out to them. Being truthful to someone and saying everything to them might make them upset on how you view stuff in the world also. Honesty is like an opinion that may cause someone that went through something upset them drastically. This is why I disagree that honesty is the best policy. From the situation you are in say respectful stuff towards the person. It might make you a better person if you are not saying negative things towards a person too.\n\nIn conclusion, I disagree with \"Honesty is the best policy\" by the situation you are in with the person and what they are going through.

Be prepared: do not go skating without your gear, or go camping without your camping gear\u2014that would be terrible.

Plus, it also helps you exercise, like having to walk when it is very hot outside\u2014it will make you sweat. Something that you can learn from hiking is how nature works. You might come across a unique animal or insect, see a different type of bird filled with many colors, or encounter a duck if there is a lake nearby. You might even see a terrifying animal like a bear. But most importantly, it is for you to have fun with your family.

In my neighborhood, you take a look around, and there you have nobody outside in sight. In my opinion, spending time indoors is not really an issue for most people. However, spending time outdoors can be more exciting and beneficial for a teen's lifestyle. There are a lot of activities that you can do, with many advantages and a lot of fun to be had.\n\nTrying new things for the first time can be really fun, and you never know if you might actually be into it or good at it. For example, you can try new sports, or even if you already play a sport, you can practice outdoors. One advantage of having community parks is that they can be one mile or two miles away; they can be right in your neighborhood. Working out can be another example of enjoying or taking care of yourself. Being allowed to have community parks is a great opportunity to try new things out.\n\nState parks are almost always one of the most liked by teens of this generation. They host carnivals, where you can go and hang out with your friends and family. Carnivals are often during spring break, so rather than staying home bored for a full week, you can go and have a great time doing challenges at a carnival. Water parks are also fun to go to, especially in the summertime. There are a lot of state parks where you can wisely enjoy your time, like Kid's Choice or anywhere outdoors.\n\nNational parks can be way more exciting to go to, but sometimes for some people, it is not affordable to spend money on. One of my favorite national parks to go to is Disney World. At Disney World, you can have an enjoyable time. There are so many options to choose from, like going on the rides, visiting the zoo, or shopping at the stores. You can socialize more with your friends and family; you can spend time with them at a restaurant with your loved ones. Sometimes you can realize that by having a great time with your adorable family, you can become happy and change your mood.\n\nGoing out is not only about being somewhere else besides your house. It can also affect the way you decide to live your life. It is about how many fun activities you can do and how much fun you want to have. It could also affect your health if you decide to take up some hobbies. It could also affect you mentally. Sometimes you need to find something you like, to not just stick around your house and have more fun outdoors at parks and take advantage of what the government offers us by having National, State, or Community Parks.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

Compare your approach and results with theirs to see if you arrive at the same conclusion. Seeking the perspectives of more than one person is beneficial; it allows you to identify errors and gain different strategies for finding solutions. It is always wise to ask for advice, as it helps you comprehend the diverse thought processes of others.\n\nSoliciting multiple opinions can assist someone in making a more informed decision and in understanding different viewpoints. It enables you to consider perspectives that may not naturally occur to you. By receiving input, you gain insights into what others think, which can guide your own thoughts. Advice can be sought in various situations, whether you are stuck on a problem, choosing the best milk at the grocery store, or selecting an outfit for school. For example, if you are unsure about your clothing choice, you might ask a family member for their opinion on your current ensemble.\n\nIt is estimated that over 90% of people seek advice from others, which not only facilitates better communication but also allows for the sharing of strategies.

In my opinion, as a student, this is a good idea because some students live on their own or they help with their parents' finances. On the other hand, students will become more familiar with technology, and almost all students have internet access at home, which would make things easier for them. However, some people disagree with this idea because some students are not familiar with technology and may not be able to have internet access. In these cases, the school and the government could support them with technology. Distance learning will build a better future for students and society.\n\nOnline classes will have a positive change in their daily lives. For example, the time that students use to prepare and when they take a bus to school, this time they can use to sleep more or even start the classes early. Some students already have a job to save money for college, so they will benefit more because they will have more time to manage their time to do homework and work, in this way they will be less stressed. This can also change their social interaction.\n\nTherefore, their video conferencing classes will have more interaction with the teacher, and if the student needs help, then the teacher will have more time for them. On the other hand, the relationship between the student and their friends can improve; they can use the time after school to hang out and enjoy their free time, and at the same time, this benefits their classes because they don't get distracted during class. By the way, regular schools have alerts and they close the school.\n\nThe reason why regular schools lose so many classes is because of the weather, but online classes represent a better option because students can attend classes from home and they are safe; they don't have to be in a dangerous situation, like taking the bus when it is snowing. So, they can continue their classes like a regular day.\n\nIn conclusion, online classes represent a better option and offer more opportunities for those students who have to work and study at the same time.

It's better to learn while having fun because the information will be more memorable. Science experiments are the best because they teach how to work as a team, work independently, and develop life skills.\n\nScience experiments teach teamwork because teammates help each other out. Working on an experiment doesn't mean one teammate does all the work; there are roles for each team member. For a team to function well, someone must be in charge to assign roles so the experiment can proceed smoothly. If a team doesn't work together to achieve the goal of the experiment, then the science experiment wouldn't be as educational. Science experiments are enjoyable because students can work with their friends as a team to learn and have fun at the same time. If they have fun while doing an experiment, then they will most likely remember it.\n\nAlthough science experiments teach teamwork, they also teach how to work independently. Some students might not feel comfortable working with teammates, so they work independently. Some also prefer to work independently rather than with a team for various reasons. One reason is differing opinions; when working with a team, the team members might not all agree with one another. Some students prefer to work alone because they can focus better. If they were in a team, then they might get stressed out because of peer pressure from teammates.\n\nLife skills are another set of skills that science experiments teach. Whether a student is working with a team or independently, they learn life skills. Students in teams learn how to lead, command, and collaborate. They might not work with their friends, but when they are in a career, they might work with people they don't know, and that's what science experiments prepare them for. Students who work independently learn how to be more self-reliant and cautious.\n\nScience experiments are an enjoyable learning tool. Students can have fun and learn at the same time, which is why science experiments are beneficial. Sometimes they might seem like they don't teach anything, but they do. Most of the time, they are memorable, which is the purpose of a science experiment.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home? I believe that there are benefits for students to be able to attend classes from home, as it provides extra time to work, and if students cannot go to school, they can still participate in class from home.\n\nSome schools offer distance learning programs that allow students to attend classes from home, which is helpful for gaining additional time to work. For instance, in some classes, students are required to complete their work within a limited time, which can be stressful. However, distance learning programs can offer students enough time to work at their own pace.\n\nIn this world, every person has their own dreams for the future and an ideal way of life. For example, some aspire to be doctors, engineers, athletes, or astronauts. However, if you are not educated, it is challenging to achieve your dreams. If education is necessary to realize one's dreams, it is not possible for everyone to attend school due to various reasons, such as living far from school, lacking sufficient funds, having part-time jobs for sustenance, among other factors that can impede their aspirations.\n\nOn the other hand, students who participate in distance learning programs may find it more difficult to work on assignments and homework compared to those who can learn in school. This is because students at home do not have immediate access to teachers and classmates who can facilitate understanding through examples and explanations.\n\nIn my opinion, there are benefits for students to be able to attend classes from home, as it allows for extra time to work and provides an alternative for those who cannot attend school in person. In conclusion, having distance learning programs in schools is highly beneficial for students. Therefore, schools should offer distance learning as an option, enabling students to attend classes from home via online or video conferencing. Additionally, students should not give up if they cannot attend school in person, as they can opt for a distance learning program to make their dreams achievable. Schools should play their role in helping students realize their dreams.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

I believe that some parks offer activities that you can enjoy with your family. For instance, state parks often have engaging activities suitable for family enjoyment. Community parks may offer some interesting activities, but not all community parks are equipped with such options. Typically, community parks provide a space where everyone can visit and spend time with their family. National parks, on the other hand, not only have interesting and fun activities for families but may also offer special holiday activities that you and your family can participate in.\n\nI think that community parks, state parks, and national parks can provide a wide variety of fun and interesting activities. For example, a national park might have activities that allow your children or the entire family to partake in, including holiday activities. State parks might offer family-friendly activities and could host events like a father and son competition, such as a fishing contest or a boat-building challenge, to test if the creations work and float on water. Community parks may host summer activities, such as a 'mud run,' where there are numerous activities to try, including a race through mud.\n\nMy first reason for believing in the value of community parks, state parks, and national parks is that they offer a range of activities, though this varies by park. A community park might have activities, or it might simply be a place where everyone can gather for a cookout, where you can take your kids to play, walk with your friends, or engage in sports like soccer or football. Community parks often have interesting summer activities for those looking for something to do.\n\nMy next reason is that community parks, state parks, and national parks offer different experiences. For instance, a community park is a place for fun and family time. A state park might offer interesting activities for families and children, and it could be a fun destination. State parks might also have holiday activities or simply serve as a place for families to spend time together and discover interesting activities. State parks often host cool and interesting activities in the summer that are enjoyable for friends, families, or children.\n\nMy final reason is that community parks, state parks, and national parks each offer unique experiences. A community park is a place for fun and family time. A state park may provide activities for children and families, while a national park offers a wide array of activities for families to try. National parks might also have holiday activities for children and families. In the summer, national parks are filled with activities that friends and families can enjoy, and the parks are often large enough to accommodate everyone participating in the activities.\n\nIn conclusion, community parks, state parks, and national parks each have their own unique offerings. While some may not have as many interesting activities, they all serve as places where people can go to have fun with their families. National parks, in particular, are known for their wide range of interesting and fun activities that can be enjoyed with friends and family, including during holidays.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

However, keep some things to yourself if you think it's not positive to say to another. Second, It might make the person feel bad if you do say something harsh to them. Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times. Sometimes you have to say what's right in order to not hurt someones feelings from what you said. For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return. Secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later. They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.\n\nSecondly, If you are honest \"all the time\" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher. By the wrong person you talk to, you might accidentally start a riot.\n\nLastly, you should be careful on how honest you are to people, because you don't know whether they are going through some stuff you are pointing out to them. Being truthful to someone and saying everything to them might make them upset on how you view stuff in the world also. Honesty is like an opinion that may cause someone that went through something upset them drastically. This is why I disagree that honesty is the best policy. From the situation you are in say respectful stuff towards the person. It might make you a better person if you are not saying negative things towards a person too.\n\nIn conclusion, I disagree with \"Honesty is the best policy\" by the situation you are in with the person and what they are going through.

Teenagers could be kidnapped or raped when they are in the streets at night and some cases they can be forced to do drugs or join gangs, if they dont do this things they might be beaten to death until they do it.\n\nSecond reason, There are teenagers at night who tempt to drive at high speeds when they are drunk. This should not be allow because, it can end in car crash, teenagers don't have a lot of experience driving at night.

So I did, but I failed a few times before completing my goal.\n\nI felt like such a failure every time I didn't pass the test, but I did not give up. As a result, after studying day and night without giving up, I accomplished my goal. Failing to me is not the end of the world; it just motivates me to do things better every day.\n\nA person must have love, passion, and enthusiasm to be successful.\n\nMany people work hard and with passion in what they love the most. For instance, my stepfather, Generic_Name, a great businessman, faced total chaos when he started his company.\n\nThe company was not popular and was not selling products. Generic_Name went to bankruptcy once, but loving what he does and without giving up, he stood up to work hard to have a successful company.\n\nIMPAK, his company, is now one of the most popular in selling plastic products in the United States.\n\nSome would argue that you don't have to fail in order to be successful. On the other hand, 98% of successful people fail before reaching their main goal.\n\nBy doing what you love the most and not giving up on it, is the main key to success in life.\n\nIn brief, don't just give up on your goal just because you fail a few times. Complete them in order to be successful.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

They take both bad and good ideas and create other ideas that follow the appropriate intentions in the country or society.\n\nFirstly, in polytechnics, the idea or situation that the country and society face is immigration. People have two different ideas and are guided by two systems called democratic and republican. Some people support immigration and protest for it, while others have different ideas, do not support immigration, and harbor ideas of discrimination or racial problems in the country.\n\nSecondly, in religion, people have different ideas about God. Almost every country, like Iran, has conflicts with other countries or people within the country, like protests of people who do not like the religion.\n\nFinally, there are problems in society with laws that a person does not like. In the change of laws in Venezuela with the president, people who follow the president's laws do not have problems, and those who do not follow the laws face death, lack of food, and problems with the police.\n\nIn conclusion, people follow ideas or take ideas depending on the situation in the country or society.

Ring! Everyone rushes to the halls to get on their bus to go home. They think of all the things they can do when they get home, like flying a kite or playing football, not thinking about school in the slightest. Now, take one and a half hours of those students' free time away from them. This may become a reality if the school board gets their way.\n\nIf I asked students if they wanted one and a half hours added to their school day, most of them would say no. People's thoughts may vary when it comes to a topic like this. I would only approve one and a half hours being added if school gets a later start time. As a student myself, I would say that exercise is very important, but extending school time will take away from that time. Most high schools end at three o'clock; if the board adds one and a half hours, schools will end at four-thirty p.m.\n\nThis may be a good thing because students will have more time to learn instead of doing nothing. Some children are worse off than others; some are homeless and some are without parents. This would be a good time to learn so they could be better off. Parents that work nine-to-five jobs won't have to worry about leaving their child unsupervised. There will be increases in work ethic and discipline. Less homework will be assigned because the students will have more time in their classes.\n\nThe reason I disagree is because this would hurt not only the students but also the local government's economy and the taxpayers. If the teachers work more hours, then they will have to be paid more money. If the local government has to pay them more money, then they're going to tax more people. That means that their income tax will be higher. Taxpayers would boycott the additional tax that comes with the one and a half hour change.\n\nThis is why adding one and a half hours would not only hurt students but also the local government's economy and the taxpayers. In retrospect, the board should lay out a plan that works for students, parents, and the economy. There are some pros to this plan, but there are mostly cons. I hope the head of the board and members consider not enacting this time extension. These are my thoughts on the topic at hand.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times.

For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher.

However, sometimes students need to work as well, because they live with a relative, such as a cousin or sister, and they need to help at home. Some students work because they want to buy things they desire. Others work because they need to balance work and study, especially if they live alone and have to pay for everything like an adult. When we enter college, everything is different; we have more responsibilities. It is difficult, but if you focus on what you want, you can achieve anything and manage both work and study. At times, balancing the two can be challenging. Some students need to work because they do not live with their parents but with other family members, and they work to help at home or to buy what they need. This is especially true for those living in a different country or city, where being away from family can be tough because you need your family with you, and sometimes it is difficult for these students because they have nothing in the place they stay. Some students work because they want to, or they dislike staying at home, and they work for entertainment or simply because they want a cellphone. They work to buy the things they want.\n\nOther students work because they need to, as they live alone and really need to work to pay for all their necessities. These people work and study, and they often have good grades in school or college. When we are in college, we have more responsibilities, whether at home or wherever we live.\n\nSome people believe in praising a student's work to build self-esteem, even if the work is not the student's best effort. Praising the student is important because we need to check in and ask if they feel good or what happened during their day. All students want someone to show interest in them, and students must be self-confident in order to learn.

A few years ago, when I was able to pass Algebra One, this helped me learn something higher, which was Geometry. Others might claim, \"But you'll just forget the stuff you learned and mastered.\" However, you won't exactly forget everything, and you'll remember some of these to help you when taking higher education. Statistics have shown that three-fourths of the people who had a higher education were able to learn something new and beyond what they knew when they started from scratch. People who have been looking for a high-paying job with higher education were also able to learn something new due to experience, and it wasn't just education that helped them out to learn new things. People should be able to grow from what is new beyond what they mastered because I have also been learning new things that I had learned from the past, and most people with higher education were able to learn something new and have a high-paying job. These jobs were not only required to have a mastery of that education but also due to the experience that they had in order to get the job they want, and also not forgetting the stuff you learned, which will help you take higher courses.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

Schools offer fun activities for classes. Students can make so many friends when they are in school. Although some schools offer online schooling, being in school is probably the better choice because students won't slack off at home, and they can participate in more fun activities at school with friends.\n\nBeing homeschooled isn't the safest choice for a student. Students now will usually have a cell phone or some electronic device that could keep them distracted from taking their classes or doing their work. Cheating could also affect their careers because then they won't know the material for the bigger tests like the SOL and the SAT. Students might just slack off. Online classes probably won't teach them life lessons or offer fun activities.\n\nSchools have so much more to offer than taking classes online at home. Students will always have help for questions at school, and they don't have to look it up. In schools, students can always make friends and participate in lots of activities with them. There is never cheating on any tests and quizzes.\n\nOnline testing isn't the best thing for students; it's probably less engaging for them. They won't have to wake up as early as regular students do when they have school. Their classes are shorter than those at regular schools. The best part is probably that they will always be at home.\n\nStudents will have the most benefits when they are at school and not at home taking online classes.

I play sports because it's fun, and it helps me lose belly fat. Being physical is great, and it's wonderful to be outdoors playing sports because you not only get physical exercise but also build stamina. When you run a lot, you can get tired, but you'll get used to it. Running is a good physical sport, similar to track or cross country, because you gain leg muscle. Not only that, but biking can also make your legs stronger. All sports are beneficial for your health, but sometimes they can lead to injuries, such as breaking a leg, spraining an ankle, or even tearing your ACL. These injuries can take a long time to heal, but they happen to everyone once in a while. To me, sports bring happiness because they're fun. I sweat a lot from burning calories, but you don't always have to play sports every day. You can, if you want, but some people play like two times a week or every single day, especially if they play for a team. My favorite sport is soccer. In soccer, we have to run a lot because we need good stamina. That's why my best skill is playing sports.

However, keep some things to yourself if you think it's not positive to say to another. Second, It might make the person feel bad if you do say something harsh to them. Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times. Sometimes you have to say what's right in order to not hurt someones feelings from what you said. For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return. Secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later. They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.\n\nSecondly, If you are honest \"all the time\" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher. By the wrong person you talk to, you might accidentally start a riot.\n\nLastly, you should be careful on how honest you are to people, because you don't know whether they are going through some stuff you are pointing out to them. Being truthful to someone and saying everything to them might make them upset on how you view stuff in the world also. Honesty is like an opinion that may cause someone that went through something upset them drastically. This is why I disagree that honesty is the best policy.

For example, growing up in my house, my parents always told me that I have to go into the medical field and become a doctor or a nurse. However, I have always had an interest in computers. I really love computers; I like being able to take things apart and put them back together. So, in my junior year of high school, when I was looking at career fields that I wanted to major in, I came across cybersecurity and instantly knew I wanted to enter that field. I went home and told my parents what I wanted to do, and they looked a little upset because I didn't want to go into the career field they had planned out for me. But that was not going to stop me. I still wanted to pursue the career, so I did some more research, got more educated on what cybersecurity actually is so I could get a better understanding and explain to my parents in detail what it actually entails. We all sat down at the dinner table, and I explained to them in detail what cybersecurity is actually about. They said to me that they are going to support me with any decision I make and with any career path that I choose to pursue. Right now, I'm a senior in high school, and I plan on going to a local community college to save money and do what makes me happy, which is working with computers. People may look at you and try to bring your spirit down on something you are trying to do or trying to achieve or accomplish; you need to just stay at it and forget what anybody has to say about you or the people around you and what you're trying to do and accomplish in life. By not being yourself, you're constantly pleasing the people around you and not yourself. I'm sorry, but the world needs to learn how to be more selfish and think about themselves a bit more than they think about other people. My conclusion is that if happiness is not leading you in everything that you're doing or planning on doing, then you should not be doing it. Do what puts a smile on your face, which is pursuing the career path that you want to pursue. Do those little things that make you happy. Dress however you want to dress and be confident every step of the way.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

A first impression can be a good or bad way to meet. Humans have many ways to react to a good or bad first impression. This first impression could be like going on your first date, attending an interview, or performing your first concert on stage. Feeling is a significant part of a first impression. It can prevent worse things from happening.\n\nStay calm and keep your feelings in check. For example, stay calm when talking or meeting a new member, don't be nervous, and always be happy to be there. For some of us, it is difficult; others just have great and positive energy. For those who don't, create mistakes and start asking themselves why their first impression came out as a failure.\n\nAlways check your mistakes. For example, ensure your clothing is in check and has no stains. There is always a second chance and hope for a good impression; just give a good enough effort to it. Give out good vibes. And before going out to whatever you are going to attend, always double-check; it is important because you don't want any bad impressions while going out.\n\nHave a nice and great attitude. For example, having good manners is great for making a good impression; this could change what people might be thinking of you. Be excited and polite to others. There are so many ways to change a first impression, whether it's good or bad.\n\nSome people have agreed that a first impression is almost impossible to change. For example, what you did was already made, and you can't change or go back to it. But for this, I would say you can go back to it. And yes, you can't go back and fix it, but you can always check your mistake for it. Ask anybody for help, or just remember your past event and tell yourself what you did wrong.\n\nWe all have our own thoughts and opinions on deciding if we can ever change our first impression. I have decided we can. It all depends on our reaction to it and, most importantly, our manners. Think twice before you do something. And if you have decided you still can't change your first impression, all I've got to say is give it all you've got. Make this a goal of yours. Stay calm, don't be nervous, and maintain a great, positive attitude.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

Praising for self-esteem is kind of bad because you're just hoping for it and hoping for it to come. Having self-esteem is a positive thing because you can accomplish more in life and stand out from the crowd with your positivity. When you are happy with what you've done, then you'll realize how capable you are of doing things you thought you weren't capable of.\n\nIf you have good self-esteem, you would be able to do things others can't do and would be able to go out of your comfort zone and discover new things, things you've never thought you would want to discover. Having good self-esteem means you aren't shy with anything you do, anything to do with other people or just in yourself. When you have achieved something on your own and see you've done amazing on it, then it gives you motivation to keep on doing more and more; it's like energy given to you after you accomplished what you wanted to accomplish.\n\nHaving self-esteem from praise isn't that good because you're just waiting for it to happen, or it just comes naturally, which is also fine, but it's better when you accomplish something because you feel the need to do more and to not be ashamed of yourself and who you are. If you want to have self-esteem, then you've got to be you and achieve something you wouldn't do on your own, or something you think is way too hard for you to do. You can't always rely on praise because not all the time are you going to get what you want, or feel the same way as if you accomplish something for yourself.\n\nI think that if you're positive and accomplish good things in life, you would have good self-esteem from all your achievements you've done; you just got to be patient, and you'll see how things change when you have good self-esteem.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

However, some may disagree due to their own opinions. I agree with this statement; I believe that the key to having a successful life is by maintaining a positive attitude.\n\nMany people are often in a bad mood, which may convert into negative energy, thus forming a negative attitude. With a negative attitude, people seem not to care much about what they are doing and may not realize what they are capable of achieving in life. People with this negative attitude tend to get mad very easily and quickly. This affects them because they give up, and giving up so quickly and suddenly won't be beneficial for them; they won't be able to make it far in life. However, for people with a positive attitude, the result is very different. Those with a positive attitude most likely have a lot of energy within them, and with this energy, they can reach greater heights. People with a positive attitude don't give up easily, partly because of the energy they possess, but also because they tend to see something good in everything, like a positive result or a better outcome. Let's compare a person with a positive attitude versus a person with a negative attitude: if a person with a negative attitude plays the guitar for the first time and doesn't get it right, they will become frustrated with themselves and give up. In contrast, a person with a positive attitude won't give up after a couple of mistakes; they will keep going until they get it right, a result of always maintaining a positive point of view.\n\nHaving a positive attitude is beneficial; it affects you and others around you. You may not see it, but it's most likely true. In my opinion, a positive attitude is the key to having a successful life.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

I think showing that you have a good and outgoing personality can influence the people you are always around. Another reason is that if you demonstrate how hard you work and how much you contribute to your community, it can inspire others to do the same.\n\nIf your behavior is good and outgoing, it can influence the people you spend time with. For example, if you associate with a friend who exhibits very admirable behavior, it can affect the way you act in a positive way. Another example is when everyone sees what kind of person you are and how you help others with anything they need, it can affect their mood in many positive ways, which could help them in the future to perform good deeds.\n\nIf you show how hard you work and how much you do for your community, it can have a positive influence on others. If you are helping the community by organizing fundraisers or preventing littering in the area, it impacts the community positively and encourages others to do the same. Another example is that if you demonstrate how diligently you work at something, it can reveal what kind of person you are and help influence those around you to succeed in whatever their goals are for the future.\n\nSome people may think that your behavior doesn't matter in how it influences others because they believe there are many more methods to influence others without showing your personality. I think the opposite because your behavior can affect others due to the set mood and the way you're acting. Your personality is a significant factor in influencing others in a positive way.\n\nIn conclusion, I think the reader should research how a human's behavior can set a good example for many people and show what can come from it in the future.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

There are a lot of bad opinions, and you don't want to pick a bad one because it can get you into trouble. People ask for multiple opinions because their opinions might not be right. They might need some good advice; your opinions might sound bad.\n\nSeeking other people's ideas is a good thing because their opinions might sound very true and convincing. You can collect others' thoughts. By collecting others' thoughts, you can probably find the best opinions and get the help you need. You just get to hear all the brilliant information. So you can hear all the choices, and that might bring you an idea. Looking for opinions is a great idea.\n\nFinding multiple opinions is a good thing again because you might need someone's advice. You might be in a situation where you need someone's honest and best advice. You might need some quick information. Maybe you're dating a girl, and you don't know whether to bring flowers or chocolate; you can ask someone very quickly. You can get someone's opinion for the future. Maybe someone tells you should be this or that, or what to do or what not to do; you might do it, or you might not. Searching for advice is a good way to get an opinion that you might use in the future.\n\nFinally, the last best reason why you should get many opinions is because your opinions might sound bad, and you might need others' opinions. If you can't even think of a good, helpful, and respectful way of an opinion, a good option is to ask someone. So you don't have an excuse for something. If you stay at home because you are pretending to be sick and the next day you go to school, you had a big test; there is no excuse, you should have asked for someone's opinions. You can ask for someone's opinions so nothing bad happens to you. You should ask for a doctor's opinion so nothing bad happens to you or your family. Lastly, you should ask for people's opinions, so you would not regret anything that will happen later on.\n\nMost of the time, people ask for multiple opinions because they want to know what others are thinking.

For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher. By the wrong person you talk to, you might accidentally start a riot.\n\nLastly, you should be careful on how honest you are to people, because you don't know whether they are going through some stuff you are pointing out to them. Being truthful to someone and saying everything to them might make them upset on how you view stuff in the world also. Honesty is like an opinion that may cause someone that went through something upset them drastically. This is why I disagree that honesty is the best policy.

This is a great idea for everyone. Why? Because when you try to get to your four-year mark, it gets stressful. I'm not saying that if we had just three years, we wouldn't be stressed on our way. Of course, we are going to be. Getting to the question, of course, it is going to be a great idea for students to finish high school in just three years and enter college. Or, more easily, for those who are not going to college, they can start working and not have to wait one more year to do it. For example, my people, my Hispanic people, when they are at school and I'm with them, all I can hear is, 'I'm leaving school.' They're not saying they're going to another school; they just want to start working as soon as possible. But for those who really care, this example of three years of high school, doing summer school, is perfect. School and graduation are a journey, and we, of course, know how to get there; we just need to push. All we need is for schools to offer students the choice of what classes they really want. Every school has this thing that says if you don't have this class, you're not going to graduate. What I'm trying to say is, if we want to be a doctor, schools have to offer classes that will help you with those things. It's better if you choose your own seven classes that you are really interested in. Another thing that shouldn't be accepted is that people who really study for everything, meaning texts, quizzes, homework, to pass their ISO, and they don't get to pass it because they didn't get the correct credit. But people who just copy others without doing anything the whole year get to pass and graduate easily. What I can say is that schools have to be more powerful with those things.

With that said, technology has allowed people to live more comfortably. It has had a positive effect on improving human society. Technology has made many humans much more capable of intelligence and has provided a better and safer lifestyle. If we didn't have technology, our lives would be really difficult. For instance, what if we want to learn about something or know about someone? We can use some type of technology. Nowadays, we use technology for a lot of things, not just schoolwork or a job; we use it to contact others or search things up.\n\nMost technologies are used in a positive way. We may use them in school to do some research or to type an essay, and some use technology for work, especially those who work in an office or some type of business. Technology can be very helpful. For example, let's just say I have to do an essay based on a person, and I search up the person's name. There might be a whole ton of websites about that person. But then, if I read all these websites with different types of information, I wouldn't like that because if there were so many websites, I couldn't find the right information about that person.\n\nActually, technology can have an effect on other people's lives. We may not know how to use them correctly or how to set our limits because sometimes we make mistakes, especially those who are in high school. Let's just say kids or teenagers don't really use their phones correctly. When the kids are in school, their cell phones can be a distraction in class.\n\nAlso, technology can have negative effects because cell phones or any other type of technology can be a distraction. People who are working and trying to get their job done on time can't really do so because their phone or any type of technology can be spamming the person's phone constantly, which is not a good thing.\n\nIn conclusion, I personally think that having technology can be damaging for others and that it can cause serious problems. However, if others can control their use, then that's a good thing for them, just as long as they don't get distracted.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

I agree because students need to have at least 30 minutes outside. Students should also be a part of an activity in their school because it is very fun. The principal said that you have to do at least one activity. It is good for you if you stay after school to participate in activities like sports or work on the yearbook; you can also work on your homework if you need help. It is beneficial because you get to learn new things about your school and can represent your school; you can also stay in shape.\n\nMost of the students in the school don't do anything because they are too lazy, or they have to take care of their siblings. For example, when I was in fifth grade, I had two activities that I did, and they were basketball, and there was a club named 'On My Road,' where we did our homework, and when we were done, we would go outside and play sports, and each day we had a different sport. I had a lot of fun when I was doing activities after school because I got to get away from my sisters and my mom, who always cleans, and it annoys me. Right when I get back from school, my mom says, 'Go clean your room, clean the living room, go clean the bathroom,' and when I am done, I barely have time to do my homework.\n\nSome activities can help you in the future because you can go to college for free if you are a good student with good grades and know how to play a sport. In my opinion, it is very fun to do a sport because you get to meet new people, improve at sports, and compete against other schools.

It will keep them away from bad influences, they will stay away from danger people in the streets, but the most important is that this curfews will keep them safe.\"\n\nExample essay 3 of score \"2.0\":\n\"Yes i agree for that all we have that be our selves for put to go out a head we live in the own world where the people judges our behavior and not sees its errors. because in this world to be bieng you yourself and don't matter how you are, you have that yourself, always we need remmerber that you can change the world, not the world change you.\n\nall of them we have a problem but we need learn, follow our dreams i want graduate this year sometimes i think i can't anymore but i have a son i need to follow because he follow me i want change the world for my son he need make a better person because he need help other people i want that he follow her dreams.\n\nwe need change our to think for that change the world we need make major people i need make better people i need help to the people poor, and the ancient people we need change our character because we want a better future for our children they need learn to be bette people they knoe our future.\n\nin the school i learn about no judge the people if we have a different type of skin and different color and nationality don\"t matter in this world all the peole are the same.\n\ni don't change my manner of to think because you need to be yourself. don't chage your ideas to be a big person in the world in conclusion don't worry be happy because the life is short you need live the life don't matter that the people think follow your dreams \" i want study in the university i want to pass my tests i want a be a big person that my son see that all can you can make whattever you want if you can and you want you can.\n\nWe can change the world for a world better. \"\n\nEssay to score:\n\"In this situation, there may be some students who would not approve of this kind of plan. However, there are also students who would welcome the adoption of an extended hours plan, like myself.\n\nIn my opinion, it would be better if our School Organization approved the adoption of extending class hours. Adopting an additional two hours would be a good plan; it would instill in students like me the importance of valuing our education. By doing so, we can help to conserve energy and resources.\n\nExtending class hours would be very beneficial for students like me; not only would we learn the importance of dedicating time to education, but it would also teach us how to value time by spending it in a productive way. Education is very important to us; we learn many things in a short amount of time, but we could learn even more if we were given the chance to do so at the right time.\n\nSometimes, there are disadvantages to having a limited amount of time, especially in education. For example, running out of time to create something meaningful. We students deserve time to develop ourselves, and it would be very helpful if our school approved the extended time period to allow students to become fully knowledgeable.\n\nStudents like me need sufficient time to develop ourselves and become better through extended educational opportunities. We can explore different ideas to help us succeed. By doing so, we can contribute to conserving energy and resources by using our time wisely.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher.

A good example of honesty could be when someone drops their credit card, so you give it back because it's not yours. Now, for my personal idea, I think that honesty is really good because it's not good to lie. You can even go to jail for lying, but it depends on what you've done. However, you get rewarded for being honest; when police look for people, they put up posters with the face on it and the amount of money. Honesty is bad to some because, in some cases, it can hurt people. Honesty helps a lot of things; when you get a job, you need to be honest in the interview. Honesty can affect who you are; if you are honest, you can be a good person, but if you lie and you're not honest, you can be not so good. Being honest is good because people can trust you, unlike those who are not.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

I think people should trust their own decisions rather than having others tell them what to do. One reason I think it's better for you to make your own decisions is that you can do what you want to do without anyone telling you otherwise. Another reason is that you'll be able to build up confidence and won't be scared to speak up. What would you do: make your own decision or have others make it for you? I'm here to show you how it's better to make your own decision.\n\nMy first reason why I think it's better to make your own decisions is that you can do whatever you want to do. You don't have to listen to anyone else. If you want to go play soccer, football, baseball, or basketball, then do it; that's your decision. Don't go seeking guidance from someone else because they might tell you to do something that you don't want to do or something that you have already done before. But if you make your own decisions, you can do what best fits for you and no one else. You can learn and have fun by making your own decisions.\n\nMy other reason is that you'll be able to build up self-confidence and won't be scared to speak up. A lot of people are really scared or shy to speak up about what's on their mind, but I feel like if people would just make their own decisions, they wouldn't be scared or shy. However, if people let others make the decisions for them, they are always going to be scared to speak up. I know this because I was once shy; I would never speak up for myself and I would let people make decisions for me. But once I started making my own decisions, I felt my confidence boosting. Now I am not that shy anymore and I can make my own decisions.\n\nA lot of people would disagree with me and say that it's better to seek guidance and that the guidance should make the decisions for us. They argue that experts know what's best for us because they have already done this before. So, they can give us really good tips to help us make it easier. They could be a really good help in making our decisions or just make them for us; that would help us in life. It would make us try new things out to see if we like them or not, and if we don't like it, we have to go seek some more guidance that would help us make our decisions.\n\nI still think that it's better if you made your own decisions rather than having someone else do it for you. I gave you two reasons why I would make my own decisions, and I also showed you why people would rather have other people make their decisions for them. I hope this essay helps you in life to figure out if you should make your own decision or have someone else make it for you. Both sides could help you in your life, but I think making our own decisions is better, and that's my decision, no one else's.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

They are an important asset to us because, without them, honestly, everyone could potentially be out of control; we need their help, and it's not wrong to need or ask for help. Some people may need it much more than others, but that's why there are guidance counselors at school if you don't feel comfortable telling a parent, or people who need legal help have lawyers. We can't just do whatever; we need help all the time, no matter how little of a thing it may seem. I don't think it's too wise to just let people do what they want because they feel like they don't need help or advice on something. Going off instinct or just your ideas isn't the way it should be. We don't know what kind of ideas some people may have.\n\nPeople should be able to make their own choices, but a little bit of guidance when making the decision wouldn't hurt anyone. Sometimes you really do need the help, whether it's from your mom, a police officer, or a lawyer. Not everyone likes to seek help when they need to make a tough decision, and I get why it can be difficult asking others to get involved with the things we do. If we were to follow all our ideas and instincts, do you really believe this world would be the way it is right now? Probably not; we humans can make some really bad choices. Not everyone, but we have a good handful of people that don't care about what they do, say, or who they hurt. If everyone was just going off instinct, this world would definitely be messed up and all over the place; it'd be way more messed up than it already is. We are human; we can't go off whatever we feel is right in our minds because that could land you in trouble, and it may not even be worth it. We have to ask for help when we need it, no matter who it's coming from. Asking someone just for advice can make a difference in many ways. We get told what to do for a reason; we need help and rules. We have many people around us to talk to. Seeking help is never bad; it can change your mind about the littlest ideas to really the important ones.\n\nThe people that don't think they need anyone's opinion or help on making a wise decision are really the people that need the most help. Here is an example: in a TV show I watched not too long ago, this teenage girl took her life but didn't ask for help from anyone. She just wanted people to know she was upset, but who was going to know when she was carrying around a big smile? The point is that not every person has the mentality we all think; so differently and getting professional help from someone who sees or hears things like that we may feel or think is normal, and they can give us the answers we would never find on our own.\n\nIt's really important for everyone to understand that you can't just do whatever we please. There are consequences for absolutely everyone roaming around with wild ideas and thinking you can just do what your mind is telling you. For instance, would you feel comfortable knowing we just do whatever whenever because we don't have limits or rules, or would you like to see a friend fall because they put their pride over getting help? I sure would not enjoy seeing a close friend or family member getting dragged down because they were ignorant and decided not to look for help with their problems when they needed it the most.\n\nIn conclusion, I agree with seeking help from experts instead of having people go off what they think is right because I probably won't think the same things others do. I'd rather see people lining up to talk to someone about their problems, whether they be big or not. The ones who don't want help are the ones who just want to struggle on their own and fight it out. Those are the people who prefer living in their own little world. I ask for advice and opinions on a daily basis because it makes me feel better and more secure about my decisions, and I hope that's what others feel too. Asking for advice has never been a bad thing; everyone has your back if you need the help. I'm sure there are many people who need to know it's good to seek help and not just stay in a shell and swallow it. People need to just stop being ignorant and forget about their pride and put themselves first.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times.

For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher.

In this essay, I will argue that graduating from high school in three years is much better and easier as well because you can have an extra year to do something else that can help you in the future. Not all of us have to be smarter than others. Just to get where we want to be, all we need is effort and a need.\n\nFirst, having an extra year may help you to work a little harder; you can start working a lot, so in the future, you have enough money to pay for college. Otherwise, your parents don't need to worry if you're going to college or not. Another thing they don't need to worry about is if they're going to have exactly the money to help you save up for your stuff. College costs a lot of money and effort as well.\n\nSecond, once we start school with good grades, everything comes out well in the end. Students may enter the military force a year early or enter college too. Doing something at a very good age is really better because you're only thinking about your own stuff, as most young people don't have obligations at home. It means there's not much to think about, only knowing that school is the most important.\n\nThird, back in Brazil, I met a boy named Generic_Name. He was so poor that sometimes he didn't have food to feed his siblings. One great thing about him was that he was so smart, and his dreams were really big. One of his dreams was to earn a lot of money and buy his mother a house. His mom had cancer; that's why she couldn't work to help their kids get ahead. She felt so miserable because her older boy was the one who was working to feed all of them instead of her. Once Generic_Name said, \"I am going to be someone incredible in life, I will have success in life.\" That's when he got more energy and started making an effort to graduate a year early from high school. Family makes us sometimes be a grateful person in this world.\n\nSome people say that graduating from high school in three years instead of the traditional four years is the same thing, but they are wrong because if you graduate early, it is because you made an effort to get good grades. Furthermore, it's not the same. In conclusion, in the future, try to do all you can, so nobody will get to you and tell you what to do. Move forward for better results. Not considering anything good won't make us successful in life.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

They are wiser because before they were mentors, they were students who made lots of mistakes and improved upon them along the way. Also, they have been studying the topic or activity that you are trying to improve for longer than you have.\n\nThis could come in handy because they can tell you something you might not have known with just the knowledge you already possess.\n\nAnother reason why I think you should seek guidance is that they are watching you. By this, I mean they can see the mistakes that you make. This is good because once they acknowledge you doing something wrong, they can help you improve it so you can do better than before. Also, mentors can make sure you're still sticking to your plan so you can accomplish your goal. Many people have reported that when they start to try to accomplish a goal, they often end up getting distracted or lose focus on what they need to accomplish, but with a mentor, you have someone to remind you and uplift you to accomplish the goal you want.\n\nMy final reason why you should seek guidance is that they motivate you. So often, when people are trying to improve something or try something new, they sometimes get discouraged when they make a mistake. But when you have a mentor, they will encourage you to keep trying and learn from the mistakes you made. Also, mentors will give you self-confidence that will make you feel like you can conquer anything. I say this because with all the motivating speeches your mentor gives and his or her help in getting you through things you never thought you could get through, you are going to feel on top of the world.

Eye contact, manners, and conversational tone are all things that people tend to look for when involved in a first encounter. When meeting someone for the first time, you should always be on your best behavior and act with respect and dignity. Eye contact is very important to ensure that you are being attentive and are completely immersed in the conversation. While first impressions are important, they are not impossible to reverse if one does not go in your favor.\n\nOne can easily make a good first impression only to act disrespectfully later, which, in many cases, can overpower the good first impression. One can also make a not-so-great first impression but turn it around for the better. While it may be difficult to recover from a bad impression, it can be done. The idea of 'never judging a book by its cover' would appropriately fit this scenario. Since we are each our own individual character, we cannot immerse ourselves in the minds of others to truly understand what they are feeling or thinking. Many people may become nervous during the first impression, putting a void between eye contact and such.\n\nUsually, one encounter with someone is not enough to judge them or to determine the kind of person someone is. Until a person is comfortable with their surroundings and the people around them, it is very possible that they may not act as friendly as they would in a situation when they are at ease. Furthermore, it is not an entirely fair assessment to judge a person without a few encounters.\n\nIt is wise never to judge someone based on their first impression; however, there are exceptions. If someone is cynical, sarcastic, rude, or arrogant during a first encounter, this may be typical behavior. Someone who attempts to belittle you or acts as if they are on a higher level is most likely always this way. A person who preoccupies themselves while in a conversation with things such as texting or listening to other things that are not a part of the conversation, or who interrupts, is most likely displaying their normal behavior. Doing such things is rude, disrespectful, and will be hard to recover from.\n\nEven if some portray themselves to be rude individuals, a judgment should not be made based on one single encounter. People should be given more than one chance to display themselves as they truly are. Judgments should be made after a few, lengthy encounters to ensure that true character is shown. Give everyone a few opportunities to prove themselves as good-minded individuals.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

A good attitude can help foster positive relationships with those around us, such as friends, family, or work partners. It is common for some people to lose their jobs because they have a bad attitude towards other employees. However, there will always be people who dislike the attitudes of others.\n\nOne reason why it is beneficial to have a positive attitude is that during a job interview, employers assess not only performance but also the way candidates express themselves when speaking. For instance, in jobs that require interaction with customers, it is essential to maintain a good attitude. This underscores why having a positive attitude at work is advantageous.\n\nMaintaining a positive attitude throughout our lives is advantageous. When going out with friends, having a good attitude is beneficial because it can lead to meeting new people and embarking on valuable life projects.\n\nIn conclusion, I agree with the statement that attitude is pivotal when attempting to secure a job or when socializing with friends. Attitude reveals much about a person's character and their interactions with others. By cultivating a good attitude, individuals have achieved success in life. A positive demeanor can elicit constructive ideas from others, which in turn helps people to thrive.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

If the teacher designs the summer project, there is the possibility that she gives you a project that can keep you focused. For instance, you might reflect on the summer project. It is a good idea to have a summer project to do the right way.\n\nThose who believe that students should design their own summer projects have their reasons. For example, students might just make the project because the school requires it. They don't care if it can help them in the future. Students just make the project without any importance to them. They just want to play on their phones and watch TV. On the other hand, those who think that teachers should design the summer project are thinking the right way. Students don't like to make summer projects, but if the teacher gives them a project that looks interesting to them, they might do good work. They might learn new things about the topic.\n\nIn conclusion, don't you think that if the teacher gives the right summer project to the students, they will have to spend more time making good decisions instead of just playing? Don't you think that students can do great things if they have more practice in making summer projects about what they like or what they would work at?

They take additional classes during summer or vacations as a pastime to get ahead, or to complete their education sooner. This can be beneficial as it helps individuals to advance and continue on to college for a better job or life. However, some people who come to South or North America may need an extra one or two years to finish high school due to the language barrier with English. Therefore, it is a good idea to continue classes and finish for a brighter future, start college, and enter the workforce. But life is not always good and easy, and often requires self-reliance and the support of others, so one must always strive.\n\nWhen you accelerate your classes and finish high school in less than four years, you are prepared for college. With an extra year, you can work to save money and use it to pay for college classes or to get ahead academically. However, during this time, you need to stay focused because you have to finish your education and start a career, making the most of this time for a better life for yourself and your family. But remember, nothing comes easily; it takes effort and support from family and friends.\n\nYou can get a job and earn money for college, paying for your classes. Some may dismiss this as mere pocket change, but once you graduate from college and secure a good job, you can recover all the money spent and more, and use it for yourself and your family. It's important to look to the future, considering needs like a car, a home, and savings. When you're older, you'll want to enjoy life, rest, and be surrounded by loved ones, whether that's family, friends, or pets. The key is to feel content with your choices.\n\nAfter finishing high school or college and securing a good job, you can have a fulfilling life with your family and friends, enjoying your earnings, traveling, and experiencing the world. Enjoy your retirement and the rewards of your studies and work for a prosperous life, and remember those who have supported you along the way.\n\nSome advocate for the traditional four-year high school experience, while others promote the faster three-year track, using the extra year to work or advance in college. After completing your career, you can rest and enjoy life. It's important to consider what's best for your life and future, thinking about how you want to live and what your goals are.\n\nUse your time wisely, focusing on your future. Celebrate and enjoy life after achieving your goals. Study diligently, whether during vacations or the school year, and don't waste time.\n\nSometimes you may not pass all classes or master every subject, but with focus and determination, you can achieve something in life, secure a good job, or buy a home where you can rest. A good life with family and friends who are there for you requires focus on your life, a good job, and a loving family. Consider how you want to spend the precious three or four years of high school and whether to continue on to college or enter the workforce.\n\nUse the time you need; there's no need to rush. Take all the time necessary to achieve your goals in life. Enjoy your summer vacations, knowing that once you're finished, the reward will be great, and then you'll have plenty of free time.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times.

They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.\n\nSecondly, If you are honest \"all the time\" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher.

Now, which one sounds better? Being honest can be very hurtful in many ways. A reason for someone not to be honest is for being a good friend or supporter. Giving your honest opinion could help, as well as giving your not so honest opinion.\n\nNot being honest can be very helpful in many situations. One of them is being a parent. A parent can't always be honest with their kid. If their kid dresses up like a character, the parent can't say they look bad. They have to say they look like the character they dressed up as. Another reason for someone not to be honest is going out with friends or couples. Even if they don't look the best, you have to compliment them nicely.\n\nOthers may say that being honest can help others to become, or do something better. Many friends want the honest opinion from others, and that may help them. Maybe the outfit doesn't match, or something is wrong with the way they dress. Being honest can prevent someone from being embarrassed later on. If a person's favorite cartoon character is showing? Someone has to be honest and tell that person what's going on before others see the problem. An example of being honest is a therapist. A therapist 'has' to be honest; that's why they get paid. Therapists tell their patients their honest opinion, and their honest opinion on what the problem is.\n\nThere are many problems in life when someone needs your honest opinion. Being honest can help others do better, and not being honest can help protect someone's feelings. In general, both being and not being honest can be very helpful with feelings, problems, and solutions. Which one would you choose, honesty, or protecting someone from being hurt?\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

They feel that change is a good way to succeed in life. I agree with the quote; I believe that to be myself in a world that is constantly trying to make me something else is the greatest accomplishment, and this is true because being yourself helps you to be honest, to be more secure in who you are, and people love you because you show your true self and are not trying to be someone else.\n\nFirstly, I believe being honest all the time is synonymous with being yourself, and honesty enables you to be true to your identity. Being honest is beneficial because people trust your words, and if you are doing something good, others are likely to follow suit. Some people constantly lie to impress others and to appear as someone they are not, which is not good because every lie will ultimately affect your life. I think if people really like being around you, they will accept your mistakes. It is like when you are getting to know someone and you tell them about yourself.\n\nSecondly, being secure in who you are means being yourself. People think that changing who they are will alter the past, what they did, or how they appeared before. They believe that by changing their appearance, they can change the way they treated people, but many change because someone hurt them and they don't want to revisit a past filled with bad memories. Others love themselves as they are and don't want to change anything because they feel secure.\n\nLastly, people will love you for being yourself and not trying to be something else. People treat you based on how you present yourself. If you are genuine with others, they will not doubt you. People love those who show their true selves, how they genuinely treat others, or how they truly act. When you don't show your true self, others may think you are lying, even if you are telling the truth. However, when you are being yourself and telling the truth, they will have more confidence in you.\n\nAs you have read, I agree with the quote because that's the way I think. I feel that being yourself in a world that tries to make you something else is an accomplishment. Often, many people think they want change, but for the better. People hurt you in life, and you change because of them; they make you stronger. I believe that not changing is a good way to feel satisfied with what you did right in the past, and that is why being yourself is an accomplishment.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

However, keep some things to yourself if you think it's not positive to say to another. Second, It might make the person feel bad if you do say something harsh to them. Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times. Sometimes you have to say what's right in order to not hurt someones feelings from what you said. For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return. Secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later. They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.\n\nSecondly, If you are honest \"all the time\" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher. By the wrong person you talk to, you might accidentally start a riot.\n\nLastly, you should be careful on how honest you are to people, because you don't know whether they are going through some stuff you are pointing out to them. Being truthful to someone and saying everything to them might make them upset on how you view stuff in the world also. Honesty is like an opinion that may cause someone that went through something upset them drastically. This is why I disagree that honesty is the best policy. From the situation you are in say respectful stuff towards the person.

In my opinion, it would be a good idea to have a career at a young age by the time they enter high school because they can start to be responsible for what they want for the future. Students can begin to have knowledge of how a career can be helpful, and they can start to think about what they want and practice for college.\n\nFirst, students can start to be responsible for what they want in the future. They can start with something they would like to be when they are older, like a pharmacist, doctor, veterinarian, teacher, and more. However, there are also some students who say that having a career at a young age will not be easy for students. Additionally, I am concerned with this opinion because students need to start thinking about their future and what they want to be when they are older.\n\nSecond, students can start to have knowledge of how a career can be helpful. Many schools have the capacity to allow high school students to start a career at the school, and I think that helps a lot of students who want to have a career in the future without any problem. But many students say that having a career in high school can lead to stress. However, in my opinion, students can have more stress if they are not ready for a career in the future.\n\nMy last point is that students can start to think about what they want and practice for college. Students can be ready for a good career when they go to college; they can feel that they have been trying hard to search for what they want for college and now they have found it. In addition, many students think that they can learn more in college. I think they could even learn more about that career in high school over the four years, and it will be easier for them when they are ready to pursue what they have been searching for.\n\nIn conclusion, I think having a career at a young age would help many students a lot in their future because they are learning new things that are important in life and starting to be responsible. In my opinion, it is a good idea for students to have a career at an early age. Students can be learning more, and when they are older, they can be the person they want to be.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

Only 5% of students have the chance to graduate in three years instead of four. A survey shows that after their graduation, the majority of students don't know what to do with their lives. In high school, students don't have enough maturity to make important decisions and consequently, they don't know what to do. It is a fact that high school is not an easy stage; for that reason, students cannot possibly finish their education earlier. They have to do the work of four years in three, which means that they have to attend summer school, stay after school, go to night school, and consider other options. They have a lot of work to do; therefore, they are not going to have much time for other things, like having a job or just having free time. If students are constantly under pressure, they are going to suffer from stress. Stress is a real problem that always affects students and their grades; with stress, they cannot have a relaxed life and peace with themselves. Early graduation is a difficult and unnecessary process because it doesn't give the student the chance to acquire enough maturity for real life, it gives them too much work to do in less time, and it causes them stress.\n\nThe normal four years in high school give the student the chance to acquire enough maturity for real life. This time helps students to grow up, physically and mentally, and to develop their perspective on life. During this time, they can understand what they want in the future, what is right and what is wrong, what their abilities are, and how they are going to develop their skills in the real world. At this stage, they are still young and the majority have no idea what they want to be when they become adults. After high school, they have to start their life, a real life, because they have to be independent; they are no longer children. They have to make really important decisions, like whether they want to go to college, get a job, or be President of the United States. Students have to think about the future; they have to know which path they want to take. It is a very difficult task to decide what you are going to be for the rest of your life when you are still an adolescent, and if you have to make this decision earlier than normal, it is even more difficult because it is easy to dream, but students also have to be realistic about their options. Of course, the aim of education is to help students discover who they really are, and it depends on the students to take everything learned during their education and put it into practice after high school, in their new life.\n\nThe majority of students decide not to finish high school early because it is not an easy task; you have to do the same work as in four years, but with less time, and that is more stressful because it can be too much. Students claim that if you decide to graduate early, you have to work day and night without a break. You have to continue working on important days like holidays; yes, no vacations if you want to finish early. As Frida Kahlo once said, \"Life isn't a race; there is time for everything.\" If a student has the chance to finish school in four years, what is the hurry? Why rush through school if this is the most important time in the life of each student, where you find yourself? It is not a good idea to be burdened with a lot of homework, tests, projects, and many other things; that is too much, it is not necessary to suffer that. Students have to live in the moment; they just have to enjoy each stage of life, the good, learn from the mistakes, and live life. If students are always working on school, how are they going to have a job in the afternoons to earn extra money for the things they want, or how are they going to have fun with their family and friends if they don't have time to be free, to be adolescents? School is not a race; there is enough time to go step by step.\n\nResearchers believe that one of the most important and worrying problems that adolescents face is stress. Stress can lead to several consequences in their lives, such as nutritional problems, sleep deficiency, being angry or tired all the time, and in extreme cases, stress can lead students to suicide. It is not normal for students to suffer from stress. They should not have to handle high amounts of work; they should follow the normal process if they want. Students have to proceed at their own pace, they have to learn that it's fine to go slow. Just ensure that they enjoy school because studying and learning new things should be interesting and fun, not something that destroys your life.\n\nFor these reasons, programs that allow high school students to graduate early can affect more than improve the lives of students. The duty of a high school student, of course, is to succeed in their learning and develop their skills in the best way they can. But their duty is also to enjoy their youth; they are not adults yet, that's why they can and should have time to have fun, to make memories with the people they love. They do not have to start before it's time, and take important decisions that will mark their whole life if they are not ready to do so. They also cannot live with the stress that is a consequence of having too much homework to do. School is one of the most important things in the world, but there has to be a balance, and schoolwork cannot be all that you have to do at that stage. Now you know, life isn't a race; there is time to do everything. You can take your time, make mistakes, start again, learn many things.

However, using your cell phone during lunch is not a good idea because after lunch, students are not going to want to put their cell phones away. I think it's better if students turn off their cell phones and keep them in their lockers. One reason is that if you're in class using your cell phone and you're taking a test, you could be cheating with another person in your class. A second reason is that with your cell phone, you can be taking pictures of other people during class. Bringing cell phones to school is not bad; it's good too because you never know what can happen. Another thing about bringing cell phones to school is that during class, while the teacher is teaching, students don't like to listen, and that's when the teacher gets mad. I think that the policy should be that you can bring your cell phone to school, but you should keep it in your locker. If I were a teacher and a student was playing with their cell phone, I wouldn't get mad. I would just take the cell phone away.

I also believe that as long as we try our best and do something to accomplish it, we can succeed.\n\nPeople do not know their limits. We do not know how much we can accomplish if we do not try. For example, my friend Generic_Name played basketball and she was good at it. However, whenever our coach asked her to enter the state game, she always made some excuse not to enter. One day, our coach called her and told her that he was scared to enter the state game too. He said we will never know our limits until we push them. Another example is my friend's sister, Generic_Name, who is a great artist. She never sold her work because she thought no one would buy it. Then one day, she uploaded some of her art pieces on a selling website. Not only did they get sold, but she also got a job because of it.\n\nAs a kid, we all learned to never give up. In school, every kid has been told to follow their dreams, to do what they like, or to never stop following their dreams. For example, I love to draw, and when I took art in school, I was disappointed with my work after seeing other students' artwork. After a few weeks, I decided to drop my art class. When I told this to my art teacher, she told me to never compare myself to others; learn to look at where you started, what you have achieved, and what more you have to accomplish. In my gym class, I could not run for more than five minutes. One day, my teacher told me to run ten minutes without stopping. It seemed impossible, but after days of practicing by walking one mile every day, I did it. Then, my teacher told me there is no limit to how much you can achieve as long as you try your best to accomplish it.\n\nAlthough some people think doing something small for our accomplishments does not help at all, I believe every step we take towards our goals, no matter how huge or little, always serves a purpose.\n\nLife is like a game; every level will teach you something, no matter what it is.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

However, keep some things to yourself if you think it's not positive to say to another. Second, It might make the person feel bad if you do say something harsh to them. Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times. Sometimes you have to say what's right in order to not hurt someones feelings from what you said. For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return. Secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later. They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.\n\nSecondly, If you are honest \"all the time\" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher. By the wrong person you talk to, you might accidentally start a riot.\n\nLastly, you should be careful on how honest you are to people, because you don't know whether they are going through some stuff you are pointing out to them. Being truthful to someone and saying everything to them might make them upset on how you view stuff in the world also. Honesty is like an opinion that may cause someone that went through something upset them drastically. This is why I disagree that honesty is the best policy. From the situation you are in say respectful stuff towards the person. It might make you a better person if you are not saying negative things towards a person too.\n\nIn conclusion, I disagree with \"Honesty is the best policy\" by the situation you are in with the person and what they are going through.

Also, you are not supposed to rush your dreams. But if you are rushing your dreams and it doesn't work, you must keep trying and never give up. Some people may say that they will accomplish their goals without trying. However, in life, you must try to be able to accomplish anything because nothing is easy; you must earn it.\n\nFirst, being humble helps a lot of people. If you're humble, many people will like you. Also, if you apply for a job, they will likely hire you because you are humble. Being humble is going to help you in the future with your school and in actually trying hard to achieve your goals and other things in life.\n\nAlthough, rushing your goals or accomplishments is not going to let you accomplish your goals in life. For me, and some people, life is all about timing. When you're planning to be someone in life, it will take time because of the dedication that you put into it. Life is hard, but that doesn't mean that you are not going to try or give up. Many things in life will not be given to you; you must earn them.\n\nFinally, some people may say that they will accomplish their goals without trying. But you must try to earn it because no one will give you a job if you are not trying or doing what you are supposed to be doing. Teens say many things like that, but they don't know what life is after you finish school. They don't really know what they are talking about because they think life will stay how it is for the rest of their life.\n\nFor these reasons, I agree with Michelangelo's statement because life is all about how you act. If you are really humble, your dreams will come true. But if you are a cocky person, it's hard for your dreams to become what you want. Life is all about accomplishment; no one will accomplish things if they don't work hard for it.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

He is my dad, and he taught me so many things throughout my life, like giving advice, imparting wisdom, and last but not least, teaching me how to cook. That's pretty much anything a dad could do for you, or any family member for that matter. It's also important to learn from others because it teaches you new things and a new way of life. Another reason to learn from others is that they might have much more experience than you, or they could just be smarter.\n\nMy other conclusion is that you can ask questions or make a bond with each other. For example, a teacher is a perfect illustration of having a connection with them or gaining wisdom. The first reason why is that they teach you so many new things that will be useful in the future, like getting prepared for a job, being responsible, and showing respect for others.\n\nMy second reason why a teacher is the best way to share experiences with students is that they went to school specifically to teach us. They know way more than us, so they definitely have more experience than students.\n\nThe third reason why a teacher is important for you and can share experiences is that they are always here for you when you need help. Also, you can become friends with your teacher.\n\nAnd last but not least, the final reason to have experiences is just to live a better life in general. That's the whole point of this.

The reason why I think after-school homework club is the best idea is that it can help students finish their homework earlier, and it can also be good for students who need extra help in some classes they aren't doing very well in.\n\nFirst of all,\n\nI think after-school homework club is an amazing idea because some students are never able to do homework at home. They have siblings that constantly bother them and never give them time to do their homework, or they're just not motivated to do homework at home. Also, I think students aren't motivated to do work at home because they don't have anyone to push them to do their work.\n\nAnother reason why I think after-school homework club can be a splendid idea is that students can be doing very poorly in some classes and just not understand what's going on. So, they can get extra help after school from teachers or even students. In my opinion, students usually understand more when teachers or students are guiding them on what to do. It's also a good idea because students can be surrounded by people who want to do well in school, and I think that can really push students to try their hardest!\n\nFinally, I think it can be a fun idea because students will have a chance to socialize with others once they're done with their work. Students can also discuss what they've learned and maybe teach each other something new!\n\nIn conclusion, after-school homework club would be an outstanding idea because it can help students finish their homework earlier at school, and help students with classes they aren't doing very well in.

Some businesses have adopted a four-day workweek, with each day consisting of ten hours. Should your school follow this model by extending the school day by 2 hours more every day?\n\nMany businesses have switched over to a four-day workweek.\n\nFor many, this is a great thing, and for others, not so much. How does this affect schools around the world if they were to adopt this method? In this essay, I will be talking about the pros and cons of this subject involving school scheduling, cost, transportation, and how it can benefit or not be feasible to have a four-day school week.\n\nTo start, having fewer days of school can improve attendance. With fewer days to miss, students are more likely to have better attendance and be more motivated since they have time to rest and prepare. Some studies have been done, and they showed that attendance has improved by twenty percent in a two-year period.\n\nIf you only have a four-day school week, that means the amount of work assigned is less, so more students will be able to turn their assignments in on time. The same thing would go for teachers; since the workweek is shorter, they have more time to prepare and time to organize things to be ready when the week starts.\n\nAnother thing is that since the workweek is shorter for teachers, it gives them more time to do other work and not have to work over the weekend, as some do sometimes, and students can attend other school activities during that day off.\n\nWhen it comes to cost, this can make a significant change. Energy will be saved since the school will not be running the full five-day week.\n\nOverall, I believe having a four-day school week would be more beneficial in the long run. More students would be motivated to attend school, and teachers' lives would be less stressful. I am for this to happen and feel that many other students would say the same; a four-day school week would make life easier and a better place to learn.\n\nMy conclusion is that it is better if the students and teachers have a four-day school week because they can have time to do other things and work better. But the most important thing is that they can enjoy school.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

The principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I disagree with his decision because most students will not want to participate in an activity. They will just sit there and do nothing, or they'll fall asleep. There are more reasons why students should not always be required to participate in activities.\n\nThe principal made that rule, but the students who don't want to do it will get in trouble. Getting into too much trouble can affect their lives and also their grades. Students should have the right to choose what they want and what they don't want because it would not be fair. For example, students need to stay after school for an activity, but they couldn't go. Extracurricular activities are great sometimes because you have more time to hang out with your friends and such, but when they don't let you, that's when students get mad. I would not join an activity because when I get home, I don't have time to do all my stuff at home. Students get annoyed when teachers tell them to do something they don't want to.\n\nAll the schools in Generic City have good and bad rules. They don't let you do what you want to do, and sometimes you get in trouble for not going to your activities. Students often don't have time for activities, or they don't find them important. Also, they can be scared to go because they're afraid of being bullied by someone. There are many reasons why students should not be forced to participate in activities. If a student picks a sport like soccer, they can get hurt in many ways, as in other sports. People get bored when they're just sitting there listening to the teacher. They can also get distracted easily and then get in trouble for talking. The teachers can also be too much; they get mad if you're chewing gum in class and then they're like, \"I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU A REFERRAL FOR CHEWING GUM.\"\n\nTeachers could create some other fun activities so students can enjoy their time with their friends. Some students can be too lazy to even think about doing activities. I mean, a lot of people out there have different ideas; some don't think the same as others do. The county should create more exciting activities so students can go and learn more, helping them understand that maybe activities are not that bad. Students may look like they're distracted, but maybe they're not; maybe it's because they don't know how to do something in the activity. That's why I wouldn't agree with this decision that the principal made.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

The question is whether students can attend class from home. Yes, because if the students have a reason\u2014like, for example, the hospital says this person has to rest at home for one month\u2014it has to be like that. This is because many people have the same problems; if this person doesn't get rest, they become more sick, and now the problem is more severe. The problem here is that these people can be dead in a couple of days. In another case, if the school notices that a student has to call the student and ask what happened, why the student didn't report the problem to the school when they encountered the problem. Also, many students do these things to adhere to the rules, which have many benefits. Well, my writing was about the many things because they look for resolution and get the benefits. I reviewed my paper to be certain that it accurately reflects my intentions, which are about completing the information in the paragraphs. Depending on the information said, it is something that has to be perfect; one has to strive harder and see how much has to be completed, the information or the problem, and also the experience which does because these people have to strive to convince the old criteria. And here are other opportunities for older students: the students can take the class online and get the score via email, or these students can go to school and get the score from school, and also can finish school. But these students have to be concise to complete the real information on the school's page that they were subscribed to in order to get the diploma and get more benefits like going to college and more opportunities for a better life and economy. But many people want to go to college and get a scholarship from the college, but the benefits are not available for everyone under the rules because not every college has the same benefits. Some people have to pay a lot of money to complete college in many states; these people do not have the same opportunities. That's why people lose their dreams in this country because of the cost and don't ask how much the scholarship is, years or months to take some classes online or go to college. But the benefits are not the same because if this person doesn't attend college and wants to do the classes online, they cannot expect to get the chance again because these people can subscribe to those colleges. For that reason, they lose the opportunities. The only chance is to repeat again the old thing that he or she did when they started to get the benefits.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

In my opinion, teenagers have the right to be on the street during the 10 P.M. weekday and during midnight. Teenagers can be anywhere at any time during 10 P.M. and during midnight on the weekend. The City Council should not accept the adoption of this new curfew law for all teenagers.\n\nCurfews can't keep teenagers out of trouble. Teenagers are the same as adults; they can choose their own decisions about what they want to do during any day of the week. They are only unfairly interfering in young people's lives! My life can be one example. I wake up at 5 A.M. to get ready to come to school. After school, I have to go to work from 4 P.M. to 11 P.M. I work only 7 hours because I need some time to do my homework, and some time to use my phone, FaceTime my friends, and time to read my favorite books.\n\nIf the law of the curfew is adopted and I'm on the street at 11 P.M., it would mean that I'm breaking the curfew law! Some teenagers have no parents; their parents are in their country, or they have abandoned their children. For this reason, they have to work after school and sometimes they have to work extra shifts. The reason why I disagree with this curfew law is that not all teenagers who are on the street during weekdays and weekends are wasting their time; they are working hard to have a better future.\n\nThis is a hard debate between disagreeing or agreeing with this curfew. The City Council is not keeping teenagers out of trouble. Teenagers are owners of their own lives. Some people may think that adopting the curfew is one of the best ways to keep teenagers safe. The best way to keep your teenagers safe is by teaching them not to use drugs and alcohol. If teenagers use drugs and alcohol, they may not follow the instructions of their parents. Their parents need to teach them how to have the same education at home, in school, or outside the school.\n\nDuring the weekends, most teenagers, including adults, prefer to go to parties, and some people prefer to stay at home with their families. If people go to the party and come back from the party at 12 A.M., the police will arrest them because they are breaking the curfew law. The City Council should not adopt this curfew law; they will not be helping teenagers to understand how life works, including working during nights. We are teenagers; if we take our responsibility at school, we can also take responsibilities outside the school.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

Things I would like to accomplish in the future include becoming a soccer player, joining a team, and playing against professional soccer players. This is because one of the things I enjoyed doing when I was young was playing soccer all day in the backyard of my house, hitting the ball against the wall again and again. Another dream of mine is to be an architect one day; it's just the passion I have for drawing houses and decorating them inside and out.\n\nA ton of people want to become veteran soccer players one day; that's one of my dreams. I remember playing soccer in my original country with my friends in P.E., during free time, and at my home. My dad used to buy me a soccer ball every month because sometimes at home, I would kick it so hard that it would go too high and end up in an enormous tree or in another house. Why do I want to be a soccer star? It's because when I was young, I would watch TV and see my favorite player, Messi. He inspired me to play soccer, and every time I watched him and his team, Generic City, I loved soccer even more.\n\nAn architect earns a lot of money, and if you are a talented drawer and study for 5 or 6 years in college, you can become an excellent architect. That's what I'm planning to do in the future: study in college for 5 or 6 years. I think I can achieve my goal with perseverance and by not giving up. I think I'm a good drawer too; it's just the passion to draw and decorate stuff. I'm really trying to be an architect. When I was a kid, I used to draw pictures on a piece of paper and search for the pictures on my phone.\n\nTo be a soccer player or an architect is hard, but with perseverance, you can achieve anything. Just don't give up; nothing is impossible. Everyone can make it, but for me, I think being a professional soccer player is easier than becoming an architect. In soccer, you need talent, while an architect needs to study for 5 or 6 years.\n\nSomething that I would like to accomplish in my future is to become an architect, a soccer player, go to college, get a good job, etc. Those are some of the things that I would like to accomplish in the future, and maybe even more goals. Last but not least, I want to help my family if they need it too.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

However, keep some things to yourself if you think it's not positive to say to another. Second, It might make the person feel bad if you do say something harsh to them. Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times. Sometimes you have to say what's right in order to not hurt someones feelings from what you said. For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return. Secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later. They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.\n\nSecondly, If you are honest \"all the time\" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher. By the wrong person you talk to, you might accidentally start a riot.\n\nLastly, you should be careful on how honest you are to people, because you don't know whether they are going through some stuff you are pointing out to them.

Honesty is like an opinion that may cause someone that went through something upset them drastically. This is why I disagree that honesty is the best policy.

Not only that, but they are also expected to commit to a specific career at a young age. This issue with young students committing to a specific career is not a good idea, nor is it fair. There are many reasons why this approach is unfair.\n\nFor example, it's not fair to expect a young student to make a definitive decision on a career when there is so much more they could explore instead of setting their mind on one specific topic. They may not be interested in it when there are so many other opportunities from which to choose.\n\nCommitting to one specific career is not at all easy, especially when you know there are so many other opportunities out there that you might like and want to pursue. But because you enjoy it when you're young, you really have no clue which career will best suit you.\n\nAfter you choose a career, then comes the commitment to the classes and other subjects.\n\nAnother reason this is a bad idea is that these young students have to pick a career at a young age. They also have to keep in mind what their classes will be about and how this will guide them toward their career. Another thing is that these young minds will be overwhelmed by all the work they will have to do during their classes.\n\nAnother problem would be the amount of stress they will be put under, as well as the amount of homework they will be given and the time they will have to complete it. It will be a big stress for the young students.\n\nFurthermore, young students will have a difficult time deciding whether or not they made the right call on what career they picked. Having to make a significant decision on what career best suits you isn't at all easy; it makes you overthink your choice and how hard it will be, and so on.\n\nThen, you will start to question whether or not you really want to pick that one career, or if there will be more along the way that are better suited to your interests, and you will know when you find that one career that really catches your eye later on when you know what path to take.\n\nIn conclusion, committing to a career at a young age isn't a great idea. After putting all this thought into this decision, it's best to say that it's a bad decision in the matter. For these reasons, not only do you have to think about how hard it is to pick a good career, but also about the career and the path you will be taking. Not only that, but also whether this career suits you in the best way, and consider the outcome of it all. This will always have a big effect on life because you're debating whether or not to follow the path or to give up and not try because the path you chose wasn't the right choice. In other words, I feel that it would be a bad idea to commit to a career at a young age, not knowing what the ultimate outcome of it all will be.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

It may be a difficult time, but just be happy and don't be mad at someone for something they didn't do to you, as that is going to make them feel bad.\n\nOne time, I saw a girl who was not happy and being rude to this boy, and the boy felt bad because the girl was yelling at him. The boy said to the girl, 'I didn't make you mad; that was your friends.' I thought that was not the right thing to do to him, and I knew that the girl was having a bad day, so I told the girl not to be rude to the boy. She apologized to the boy. Then I told the girl that if you have a bad day, you need to maintain a good attitude, and she told me that I was right, she should have a good attitude, and I smiled at her.\n\nI had a bad day, and the girl that I was talking to noticed I had a bad attitude, and I made her sad because I was being rude to her. That made me sad that I had been rude, so I told her that I was having a bad day, and she said that I needed to have a good attitude. I said thank you, and she just smiled at me.\n\nIn conclusion, I think it's a good practice to maintain a good attitude when having a bad day, so people don't think that you're rude.

Some of these interesting activities include a play area, hiking, and skydiving. Most of these activities are somewhat common in most parks.\n\nOne of the interesting activities I listed is play areas, or also called playgrounds. They're mainly used by children under the age of 12, but they're useful in some ways, especially if you don't want to watch over your kids. You can just go to the nearest park and leave them there playing while you sit in a chair doing nothing. Why is this activity so enjoyable? Well, because it's where kids can go outside and spend some free time with other kids, and they could possibly find a new friend to play with. It's also healthy for the child; he can get some exercise.\n\nThe other activity I mentioned was hiking. Community parks don't have hiking spots; however, state and national parks do have some hiking spots. Hiking is fun; it's a way to have a fun time with nature, but sometimes you might encounter an animal that could harm you, like a grizzly bear or a rattlesnake. It could be a bad day for you, but usually, you don't, so most of the time it'll be a golden experience.\n\nThe last activity I mentioned was skydiving. It looks scary, but when you get used to it, it's pretty cool. Many people enjoy skydiving because it feels like you're flying, and plus, it takes a lot of courage to go skydiving. Skydiving is a great activity if you're not scared of heights; otherwise, it's not going to be good for you.\n\nOverall, these activities I just mentioned are pretty great for parks, mostly national parks, but also good in community and state parks. Playgrounds are great for children but not for teens. Hiking is great if you want to see what nature has in store for you, but not great if you encounter a grizzly bear. Skydiving is also great for people who have the courage to skydive. In conclusion, these activities are enjoyable for most people.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

Neglecting to show kindness can lead to negative consequences. If you fail to be kind, people may not like you and might refuse to help when you need assistance. It's important to reciprocate kindness to those who support you. Otherwise, you might find yourself alone, which can lead to feelings of regret for not having been kinder. A lack of kindness can result in others harboring resentment towards you, speaking ill of you, and ultimately isolating you. This can lead to anger and self-loathing for not having done the right thing, and as a result, more people may dislike you. On the other hand, showing kindness can earn you love and respect for being a good person, making both you and others happy. Failing to do so can leave you in a difficult situation, which is undesirable. Without kindness, people might perform tasks poorly out of spite, causing frustration. This can extend to loved ones, potentially leading to estrangement and the loss of family, possessions, and friends. In extreme despair, one might wish for their own end. Therefore, it is sometimes necessary to show kindness to avoid such dire outcomes. Now that you understand the potential repercussions, it is clear that showing kindness is essential.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

It's only fair if the student gets to make that decision. Why make them do something they wouldn't enjoy? Most students don't put in as much effort as others do, and that's because they don't care as much. If they aren't going to care enough about school, then what's the point of making them do extracurricular activities when you know they wouldn't put in the work for it? Students and families should be able to decide whether or not to participate in extracurricular activities because many students have jobs, they need time to do homework and study, and they should be able to enjoy their school years however they want to.\n\nStudents who have jobs aren't able to participate in extracurricular activities; they don't have the time for it. Most students need the job to save up for college, a car, and to help their families out. Making them do an activity for school would only put them under so much stress. Not only do they have to worry about college, a car, and helping their families, but they also have to worry about extracurricular activities. It wouldn't be fair to those who have a job; they are too young to be stressed out this much.\n\nA reason why a good number of students have bad grades is that they can't do so many things at once. They lose track of time and end up having no time to do homework and study. Others just lose motivation to do anything after a long day of being busy and decide to procrastinate, which isn't good.\n\nYou only get to be a kid and a teenager once; we should be able to enjoy these years however we feel is best for us. We aren't in school forever, and if schools were to control what extracurricular activities we did, there wouldn't be any fun in that. What if they chose something we really dislike? We wouldn't be able to do anything about it because we have no control over it. It would be best if they let us choose the activities we wanted to do; then students wouldn't complain so much about it, and they would actually have fun.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

He was right; he got replaced by a self-talking machine which did leave him jobless for that time. Technology is really making life horrible for the uneducated, not only for them but also for the educated people. In my opinion, the limitation of human contact due to the use of technology has a positive effect on people's lives because, just a few years ago, a human-made robot took twenty-four of the world's scientists. And I can't imagine how much more we would lose if there were no limitations to technology.\n\nJust to begin, limited contact due to the use of technology makes life easy for each type of person living at the moment. For example, not everyone has a satisfactory education, so accepting limited contact with technology won't have a disadvantage for a lot of people. That shows an adequate number of people will keep their jobs. And as it's limited, each person gets an almost equal amount of use to communicate or compute with others without getting into debts in life.\n\nNext, for the safety of the people, technology that includes making self-driving cars should stay away from humans. For example, Tesla, the self-driving technologically monitored car, is one thing to worry about. As researchers have said, because of the material the car is made of, the chance of the car catching fire has increased. And the chances to survive or escape from the car are really low. There is also a higher chance of having a horrible accident with those technologically monitored cars because they are human-made, and humans make mistakes.\n\nSome say technology has made humans survive longer because, for example, it helped humans make cropping faster and created a chance to communicate with any country to make it easy to survive by trading in and out. However, before technology made it to the headlines like nowadays, human beings survived for plenty of years without knowing what technology was. For example, like nowadays while trading, things get shipped, but before all of that, people used to walk from one country to another or had horses to travel. Therefore, technology cannot be something human beings have to depend on because before technology came, human beings made this earth easy to survive, but the hard way.\n\nIn conclusion, to protect this earth and to make it more survivable, technology should be limited before mistakenly made mad robots are created and make human beings go extinct.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

Let's say you have a phone; you can call people to get you to places. And then, on the way to those places, you can check out books, watch movies, play games, shop, and listen to music. You can do all these things with technology; it's so great. Does technology have a positive effect on people's lives?\n\nI think technology has a positive effect on people because of what it can do. For example, I just came from a camping trip, and I forgot my tripod for my camera, so I went on Amazon and ordered another one. This is why I love technology: because on some websites that you are shopping on, there is an option for overnight shipping. That is the option that I'm always pressing. People are getting positive effects from technology.\n\nThe power of technology is so great because it helps them get things like car parts, shoes, clothes, and something for the house. For example, let's say you move into a brand new house and you want to buy things for it. So you go to the store and you buy most of the things. And then you need two more items on that list. Let's say you go to every single store to look for those items; what would you do? For me, I would take out my phone, go on Amazon or something like that, and buy those two that are left.\n\nWhile some people believe that technology has a negative effect on people's lives, others argue that technology has a positive impact on people's lives. For example, let's say a person and his friend order a cab, and the cab driver is talking to them. Your friend thinks it's rude to ignore him. That is because he was watching something on his phone with his headphones plugged in. And then the driver asks where they are going, and he doesn't say anything, so his friend had to poke him in the arm to get his attention. That is a sign of technology having a negative effect on people.\n\nIn conclusion, I think that technology has a positive effect on people and not negative. And yes, there is going to be a little bit of negative effect on people's lives, but it is mostly positive. But for me, it is going to have a positive effect on people. I think technology is great to have; really, I mean, the people who are making technology are really changing the world with the evolution of technology.

I feel this is a better decision than permitting students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times. My opinion is based on the potential negative impact on students' learning and education. For example, a student was texting another about an incident at a different school. She relayed what happened but couldn't share everything because she had to attend class. Unfortunately, it was a day when a crucial lesson was taught, yet the student was distracted, wondering about the rest of the story instead of focusing on the lesson. Consequently, when she took a test that included questions from that lesson, she failed.\n\nThe other student, who was in class while texting, also failed to pay attention. Her distraction not only affected her own learning but potentially the education of others around her, as she too failed a test on an important topic covered that day. This illustrates why it is vital to prohibit students from bringing phones to school. Moreover, phones can be a source of disturbance; for instance, if a student forgets to silence their phone and it rings suddenly, it can disrupt the entire class and impede learning.\n\nI also believe that the rule 'Phones are not allowed in school' should be implemented in all schools. Students should never bring their phones to school. In my view, this would be the best policy for all educational institutions.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

I agree with the sentence that says, \"Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.\n\nFailure does not mean you have to give up on your dream because you should use your failure to make your dream come true; people learn from disappointment. However, if you never experience it, you would not be receptive when you encounter failure. But if you have already faced failure, you should get up and use the sensation from your failure as an impulse for success. My mother said, \"Where there is attempt or exertion, there is success too.\"\n\nOn the other hand, a lot of people do not like failure, just like me, and absolutely nobody likes to fail, but in this world, you cannot escape failure; everyone in this world has to make an attempt to tackle failure. I also had a failure before; I flunked a math class, which made me unable to be an exchange student. To be an exchange student is my dream because I want to have the experience of studying in an American high school. But I flunked at that time. After that, I tried and tried harder every day. Currently, I am excelling in math class, and I can be an exchange student from Thailand to America.\n\nThe main problem with people's failure at present is laziness, and this is an issue that makes people not want to be successful. People are afraid to show enthusiasm because they are terrified of failing again.\n\nTherefore, I think everybody should make an attempt to persevere; you will be successful if you try hard enough and do not give up on your dream because I believe everyone can do everything that we want to do or to be.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

One of the reasons is because it has many benefits for me and other students in the school. Also, it will make our country better, and it saves lots of time for students.\n\nOne of the reasons I agree with the idea of establishing a homework club in my school is because it has many benefits for students. Firstly, it will help a lot of students to get good grades on their tests, classwork, homework, and more, which will make them feel happy and love school even more. It does not only make them happy, but it also makes their parents happy because we are like the treasures of our parents, so if we are happy, our parents will be happy too. Secondly, students can directly talk to their friends while they are working on their homework. Students can also stay after school and discuss their projects if needed. Lastly, students can get help from the teachers whenever they need it. To summarize, homework clubs are very helpful for students because they help students to get good grades, allow students to directly talk to their friends while they are working on their homework, and they can get help from teachers if needed.\n\nWhile establishing an after-school homework club has many benefits for students, it is also better for the future of the United States. It is better for the future of the United States because the number of people who will get good jobs would be increased, so the U.S. will earn more money. One of the characters in a movie I watched before said, \"Your future is based on what you did in the past,\" so if we study well right now, we will get a good job in the future, and that also helps our country to become better. Another reason is that the number of students with good grades in our country will be increased. Lastly, when we talk about America, everyone will think about the land of opportunities. Overall, establishing an after-school homework club will be better for our country because more people will get good jobs in the future, the number of students with good grades in the country will be increased, and it will make us proud of our country.\n\nAlthough establishing an after-school homework club is better for the future of the United States, it also saves students a lot of time. One of the reasons for that is because students can finish their homework early, so when they get home, they don't have to do anything. Next, after school, they can enjoy the rest of the day with their family, or they can do whatever they want. The best reason for that is because they can join some outside activities, and that will keep students healthy, stronger, and not get tired during school. So, establishing an after-school homework club will save students a lot of time because they can finish their homework early at school, they will have more time to enjoy with their family, and that will keep students healthy.\n\nMany students say that establishing an after-school club has many disadvantages, but they are wrong. I agree with the idea of establishing a homework club in my school because there are many benefits for students who have difficulty in certain subjects, or who want to finish their homework early. Next, it is better for our country, and it also saves a lot of time for students. An after-school homework club will be the best friend of many students, including me.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

The most interesting thing to watch changing for me is technology. It has grown and changed a lot in just the past 10 years. For example, right now, you don't even have to leave your house in order to get some food. It is not just changing itself, but it is also changing us and our lives. We don't even realize how much technology has helped us in our lives. The limitation of human contact due to the use of technology has a positive effect on people's lives because it has made it easier, more comfortable, and very interesting.\n\nTechnology has made our lives much easier. We are using technology every day as a helpful tool and resource. It really has changed the way we live, work, and rest. Right now, instead of going to a library and looking through 100 books to find an answer, you can find it in 2 minutes without even moving or asking anyone for help. In our time, you don't even need to feel uncomfortable in front of a girl while asking her on a date. It is much easier to just send her a text.\n\nIt is also very comfortable. Technology has made us feel comfortable, and our work to be comfortable. Sometimes there are things that we can't say to a person's face, but technology has made that better by letting us just send an email to that person. Technology has made an awesome impact on our lives. Also, it is comfortable in transportation. For example, a cell phone is very small, but it does a lot for us.\n\nLastly, technology is a very interesting thing. It can also do a lot of different things for us. It can tell us what other people can't tell us. People can only teach us what they know, but technology can teach us anything that we want to learn. It is a great way to learn new things because technology always gives you a full explanation, but people don't.\n\nIn conclusion, technology really has a positive effect on people's lives because it has made it more interesting, comfortable, and easier. If you can't find an answer with a person, you can always find it with technology. You don't need to talk to anyone to find an answer anymore. It really has changed our lives in a better way.

It is really important to attend school to receive an education, but there are many reasons to be absent from school. For example, for some people, it is difficult to attend class because maybe they missed the school bus and they do not have transportation, or they could have a part-time job that wears them out, making it hard to be ready for the next day of school. Additionally, the weather can be in extremely bad conditions, and it is dangerous to be outside, so you can stay safe at home.\n\nNevertheless, there are also many options for not missing the content of the school classes because you can attend classes from home via video conferencing or online. This is a good benefit for you because you can stay at home and at the same time be able to keep on track with your studies. However, it also has disadvantages because not everyone has an internet connection at home, which makes it kind of impossible to attend classes from home. Also, you can get confused with a topic, and if you have questions, your teacher might not be available at that precise moment to solve them, so you will have to wait until the teacher can be available again.\n\nThere are more disadvantages, for example, you cannot enjoy the activities that the school organizes or the field trips that the school plans. You could not spend time with friends and also with your teachers, and you could not contribute to school activities or be in clubs or sports teams of the school. Those are activities that students who attend classes online from home might not be able to participate in.\n\nAbove all, the disadvantage of attending classes at home, there are the same benefits that going to a regular school offers you, but with a different method of learning.\n\nIn conclusion, there are many ways to continue school even if you stay at home through an online site. Of course, there will be disadvantages, but you can always see the benefit of that, and you have to make more effort than normal to learn new things. I think distance learning is a good choice because it has almost the same benefits as going to school, but instead, you are staying at home.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

For example, my biggest dream many years ago was to learn how to draw. I always dreamed of being someone who could create art from anything. But there were many reasons that almost made me forget about that dream. Another reason why I think that failure could lead us to the best things in life is because if we don't try, we will never know if it could be possible. Also, failure is not something that we should be afraid of; I think that failure can give us experiences in life that can lead us to success, things and experiences that only life can offer us.\n\nFailure in life, for me, is just another opportunity to try something again but with the same or more enthusiasm. For example, when I started learning how to draw or paint, there were many reasons that almost made me forget about my dream. One of the main reasons was that I didn't have enough materials to make a simple piece of art; it was hard for me because in my country I didn't have the same opportunities that I have now. And I went from failure to failure, but I always tried to forget about negative things and I was just focused on being someone different in life. Now that I'm better at drawing and also have the materials that I always wanted, I'll keep getting better and I can say that it wasn't easy, but it was worth it. I know that I still have a lot to learn; I'll keep following my dream, and I know that one day I'll say, 'I FINALLY DID IT.'\n\nAnother reason why I agree with Churchill's statement is that most of the time we don't see what we have until it's gone. And failure can lead us to success because it can give us experiences that only life can offer. For example, if we do something wrong, we know that we won't be able to fix the past, but the only thing that we can do is to learn from our mistakes and try to be better in the future. And that is why I think that failure can lead us to success because if we don't know how hard it is to obtain something important in life, we will never appreciate what we have or what a person is doing for us. And it is very hard to imagine something that we haven't experienced; it's hard to try and learn from what we hear than learn from what we have been through. That is why we shouldn't be afraid to do something or to try new things in life because nobody was born knowing things; only life can give us the knowledge to learn and teach.\n\nWe shouldn't be afraid of falling through because life is about doing new things every day. Life is about living the way we want, having in mind that nobody is perfect and it's fine to make mistakes, but we have to learn from them. For example, many years ago I was afraid to leave my country; for many reasons, I thought that I wouldn't make it. But my main motivation to come to this country was to see my father for the first time after 18 years. I was scared to fail, but at the same time, I saw that opportunity as the greatest thing that I ever had. That's another reason why I agree with the statement because, like all the rest of the people, I'm not perfect. But I'm proud of some of the decisions that I have made in the past, and at the same time, I learned from my mistakes and I'll keep learning.\n\nThe hardest things in life are the things that will always be worth it. I share Churchill's idea because you have to suffer before you triumph. Everybody can try and teach you something, but your best teacher will always be life. To fall through is not a defeat; it's a new opportunity to do something better. And it's fine to fail in order to find success; we just have to stand up and try again but with the same or more enthusiasm.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

It would also be healthier for students to learn by being taught directly rather than having to rely on online videos or conferencing from home.\n\nMany citizens decide whether to send their kids to public school or to homeschool them. However, in some states, they are not required to decide whether their children should attend public school or be homeschooled; the state should mandate that all children attend public schools. This is because children and students can be more focused when taught in person rather than by technology online. Additionally, it would be a healthier choice for students to get 8 hours of rest, so they do not sleep whenever they want to because they are being homeschooled. The government and the president should make a decision on what's best for our people and children. Nearly 50% of our population consists of children who attend homeschool classes. Parents should take the time to see what's best for their children, as should our government.\n\nIn schools, teachers and principals have many ways to work with students who are used to being homeschooled. They even encourage them to have a great time with sports, clubs, and activities they would enjoy. Students would have a much more knowledgeable understanding of their surroundings and how children and students should be taught. Some people in other countries or states have decided that children should not be allowed to attend public schools and must be homeschooled. Citizens and states invest a lot in their children's education to determine what is best for them. However, the government should take charge, as attending homeschool classes can be detrimental not only to technology but also to our children's and students' minds.\n\nAttending classes from home should not be required because of late sleeping hours, excessive technology use, and lack of participation in activities.\n\nStudents should be required to sleep 8 hours, but many do not get enough sleep because they use so much technology, which keeps them awake. Other factors include doing homework late, watching TV, and playing sports that end late. Students are involved in other networks that can disrupt their sleep schedule. Video games can also keep children up by engaging them in talking and playing all night.\n\nChildren have problems with technology by not staying focused on their schoolwork, which is common when they are homeschooled. Technology has impacted students with social media, games, and computer texting.\n\nWhen being homeschooled, children don't get enough exercise and may not have the time to participate in sports during their free time. Some parents who homeschool their children do not have experience in organizing activities. Homeschooling does not always encourage children to join clubs or enjoy sports.\n\nChildren who are homeschooled by their parents may not be able to keep in contact with friends or engage in school learning. Parents should provide more opportunities for their children's education to be more connected with the world so their knowledge can be enhanced by experienced teachers and educational learners.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

To be an individual on Earth means that people can do everything they want, making their own path and taking their own steps to be successful in the world. I disagree because being an individual in this whole world doesn't mean that we can reach or get the biggest achievement. A person by oneself can't progress; he/she can't arrive at the highest level they want to reach their success. A person by oneself is not complete, so everybody needs help in their life to direct the right way and attain their biggest achievement.\n\nA person, to be an individual on Earth, can't make their greatest achievement because every human in the world needs the instruction of their family, best friend, or someone else that helps and modifies their life. The cradle of every successful person is that they listen to the thoughts of their families or friends. They are interested in the speech of them about how to be a powerful person and how to make ourselves be something in the world and reach the greatest thing that we want.\n\nBeing an individual, a person cannot arrive at the highest position because life is very difficult. Everyone needs help from someone who can help and direct the right way. For example, at the very beginning, I want to say that the ones who make our life amazing and give us the capability of anything we want, that is our family. Like when a baby is born, he or she doesn't know anything about life, and their families are responsible for teaching their children the good and the bad things of the world. So we can say our family is the most powerful influence in our life, helping us to progress and try a lot to be a person that can reach the jewel, the treasure of the biggest achievement of our life.\n\nA person by oneself is not complete, or sometimes we can say no one is perfect; it means that everybody needs a good helper to direct the right way and to modify and complete their life to reach and get the biggest achievement. For example, when we first come to school to understand knowledge, the teacher is the best and most helpful for a student because they teach the student and show them the right way, leading the student to the highest position. Also, teachers show the difficulties of life to the student to never 'give up' and to be positive. They help the student to attain and accomplish the greatest thing they want. So in this way, everyone needs a best friend that can follow their decision and find the right way to be successful and get the biggest treasure of their life.\n\nIn the end, I want to say that every person in the world cannot do anything without the instruction and guidance of family, friends. So when we are individual, we are not perfect or we are not complete. The best way to advance and progress is to communicate with other people to expand our life into the right position and make ourselves capable of the things that we want and to be a helpful person in the world to attain or reach the biggest thing that we have wished for. So every person has the worthiness of this to arrive at the highest way to get the greatest achievement.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

After implementing this change, the company has become more effective, resulting in greater benefits and attracting a larger clientele. Additionally, he suggests that schools should adopt this method, saying, \"I believe the schools can improve their academic averages.\" This method could significantly help students as they would learn and understand the material much better. It also benefits students who work on weekends, as they can complete their homework on Friday and then work calmly on Saturday and Sunday.\n\nFirstly, extending the school day by two hours is beneficial because students can learn and understand the material much better. For instance, all the students in the English 11 class at Generic_School are achieving better grades since the school added two more hours. Clearly, the students are more engaged in English 11 and their comprehension has improved. As a result, the students in English 11 are receiving good grades, and the school's overall average is rising. This new method helps students to focus more and benefits schools by improving their averages.\n\nSecondly, an extended school day is advantageous for students who work on weekends. For example, my friend Generic_Name, a seventeen-year-old who works at a restaurant called 'Brickhouse,' is comfortable with his schedule because the extra school hours provide him with more time, allowing him to work on Saturdays and Sundays. He has Fridays off to do his homework. As a result, Generic_Name has sufficient time for his activities and benefits from the school adding two more hours because he can complete his homework on Friday and work more calmly over the weekend. This arrangement benefits students who work on weekends by giving them enough time to complete their homework.\n\nOn the other hand, some people argue that adding two more hours is not a good idea because students might fall asleep in class due to the extended time in school, and it could affect teachers who live far away. Additionally, they fear this new method could lead to increased school dropout rates. These individuals disagree with the proposed change. However, they are mistaken, as this extension would help both students and schools. As a result, students would learn and understand the material much better, and those who work on weekends would benefit as well.\n\nIn conclusion, adding two more hours to the school day has both benefits and disadvantages. Some argue that it is not a good idea because it could cause students to fall asleep during class, affect teachers who commute from afar, and potentially lead to higher dropout rates. However, others believe that extending the school day by two hours is a great idea because it helps students learn and understand better, benefits those who work on weekends, and contributes to improving the school's academic average.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

Firstly, because everyone should always keep trying since we should know that nothing comes easy; we have to keep trying. For example, I used to have a friend who hated school because of his math class. He used to tell me that whenever he went to his math class, he would feel stupid because he didn't understand anything the teacher taught, but he never gave up. While he was in school, he kept trying and trying until he got better at math, and now he is a math professor. He always tells me to never stop trying and to believe in myself.\n\nSecondly, I would like to say that success doesn't come without struggle. If we want to be successful, we should know that there will be a lot of struggles on our path. However, if we stay strong and positive, we will be successful one day. If we become successful, we can set an example for people who don't try or for those who fail once and then stop trying. We can be someone's inspiration; maybe people will be inspired by us one day. For example, I failed my driving test twice, but I didn't give up because I knew that getting my license was not going to be easy. After taking driving classes and learning how to drive from my parents, I got my license on my third try. I was so happy and proud that I didn't give up and just kept trying.\n\nLastly, I would like to say that failure also teaches us valuable lessons in life that we will never forget.\n\nAll these experiences are very beautiful in our lives because we can share them with people and spread positivity among those who give up easily or those who fail once and think that's the end of their chances to be successful. Everyone should always keep trying because success is not going to come to us; we have to go to success. Success doesn't need us; we need success.\n\nIn conclusion, I would like to say that I agree that success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm. First, because success doesn't come to people who give up. Second, success doesn't come easily.

If that happened, it could have positive effects on the students' work. First, the students would have more free time. Second, they would be recharged with energy for the next day. Also, that would help them learn how to manage their time when they are working.\n\nThe students would have ample time to do what they love and want. Also, they could have more fun with their families. If the student arrives home earlier, he can take a rest during that time by sleeping, eating, or chatting with his friends. He can also engage in his favorite activities, like practicing his hobbies or going out with his family. For example, my sister likes to dance ballet in her free time, but she doesn't have time after school. So, she practices at night or on the weekend. In addition, many parents cancel their appointments or picnics because their children have school at that time. So, the parents will go out without their children, but in their hearts, they have big hopes to take them to create new memories together.\n\nA shorter school day can help students have the energy to continue the day. In many cities, the school day is too long for students. When they arrive home, they can't move because they are tired. First, they wake up early at 7:00 AM and wait for the school bus until 7:40 AM. Second, they have more than four subjects in the day, all of which are hard enough to exhaust their minds and make them tired. Also, the school day ends at 3:00 PM. Most of the students feel like they are in jail, not a school. So, how can students continue their day with such low energy?\n\nA shorter school day can help students learn to manage their time, especially when they study and work simultaneously. Some students work after school to save money for their college costs. If the school day were shorter, they could rest before working and spend time with their families or use this time for homework. In my class last year, there was a boy who worked after school until midnight. So, our teacher asked him, \"Why didn't you do your homework?\" He answered that he didn't have enough time to do it because he had to work to save money for his college and to support his family. He could have done his homework if he had more time after school.\n\nFor these reasons, the school day should be made shorter by extending it by two hours. It can help them earn more time for their favorite activities. Also, it helps them to have more energy to continue the day. In the end, they can balance their day between studying, working, and resting.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

Some view it as negative, while others see it as positive. Many appreciate technology because it is used for work, games, and various other activities. It is utilized positively for children, as some parents implement parental controls on their phones or tablets, ensuring the devices turn off at a certain time. I believe people perceive technology positively because it helps them work diligently, stay active, and avoid spending all day on the phone.\n\nHowever, when people don't choose one opinion, they often consider the other. Some argue that technology has negative effects, such as causing poor eyesight or even blindness. They believe that children and adults alike will become less active due to technology. That's why I think technology is positive.\n\nPeople work hard at their jobs using computers or laptops. They rely on technology every weekday for their employment. At home, technology aids in work, and while jobs have no time limit, some apps are blocked, for example, YouTube and video games. Access is typically granted through a work ID, like a card or pin.\n\nTechnology is also used for exercise. People use apps to work out at home or outside for running. They stay active with their phones, but not all day. It's even used for eating the right foods, with people turning to YouTube to help them prepare meals.\n\nWhile technology is used frequently, it isn't used all the time. People make phone calls or send messages. They also use it for entertainment, such as YouTube, Netflix, and other sites. Parental controls are important for children, whether they have their own phone or use their parent's, to block certain apps.\n\nThis is why people should view the effects of technology on their phones positively. Parental controls should always be in place on children's phones or iPads.

We have scientists, doctors, firemen, pilots, policemen, chefs, etc. There are some people who are always trying to do their best in order to improve our society, and every day new people are born to live in the world they are creating. Just like everybody else, they will start from zero and the same question will appear in their minds when they grow up, \"What do I have to do to get what I want?\n\nWe grow up seeing and hearing different events that happen around the world, but also, at the same time, these events start to give form to our thoughts. All these factors make us think about our own future and also motivate us to start making decisions that will affect our lives.\n\nWhat is the problem with all this? You might be wondering. As I said before, most people don't know what to do to get what they want. Once they've grown, sometimes people don't know which decisions they should make in order to have a pleasant life. This is when they start to ask themselves if they should ask for help or do it all on their own.\n\nI've seen this situation a long time ago. I still remember when Generic_Name, my older brother, told me he had decided to be a doctor. He graduated from high school and was ready to take the next step in his life, work as a doctor, and be successful. My family and I were wondering which college Generic_Name had chosen, so he could learn everything a doctor needs to know.\n\nWhen the time came and my mother asked him which college he had chosen, he said that he was not going to study at any college because he was going to learn all by himself. My mother was furious but she let him do it; she knew he was going to realize sooner or later that it was a big mistake.\n\nMy older brother has always been like that; he would try to do everything by himself, following his instincts and doing what he thought was right, until that day. One year had passed and Generic_Name hadn't made any progress. He saw how all his friends were learning how to be doctors in college while he was wasting his time reading books and articles on the internet, which was good but not good enough. His friends always told him that he had to go to college if he really wanted to be a doctor, but he didn't listen just because he thought he would spend years of his life by going; he thought that he could become a doctor faster in his own way.\n\nTime passed, and he never made it; he never could be a doctor. His friends were making progress until they finally made it; they graduated while my older brother, through the years, never changed his attitude and decided to take a different direction in his life. Today, there are some occasions where he tells me how much he regrets his attitude back in those days.\n\nWith this story, I just want to make something clear: the fact that we can lose all our dreams, what we have always wanted, just by being obstinate, thinking that we are always right. I'm not saying that you, a person, cannot be successful by doing and learning everything by yourself. Of course, there are ways to do it, but are you really sure you can do it? Because making sure of who you are and what type of capacities you have is what will decide how well you will do it by yourself.\n\nAnyhow, it is also important to know that asking for or looking for help will never be something bad. There are people with tons of experience in this world who can teach us how to be an excellent person; they can teach us how to be the person we want to be. No one has to learn or make decisions by themselves because there will always be somebody.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

First, we shouldn't have to participate if we don't want to.\n\nSecond, we can make our own decisions instead of having an adult make them for us. For example, if someone does something without your permission, they are making decisions for you. However, if that person asks, 'Hey, there's a really cool sale on hoodies, and they want to ship the first hoodie for free. I just want to know if you're okay with me telling them your address.' If you say no, you are making the decision not to share your address. The same principle applies to school. If an adult tells you to do something you don't want to do, then don't do it and don't listen to them, unless it's beneficial for what you need to do.\n\nSince our principal made the decision that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity, he or she is, in a way, forcing us to stay after school and do things other than our homework or projects. Some students play sports outside of school. For instance, if I had to stay after school for an activity, I might miss my football game this Friday or Saturday. Missing it could jeopardize my chance of demonstrating my abilities to the coaches.\n\nBecause of this, I might not be able to join an outside football team. There are times when you have to listen and do what you're told.\n\nEven though I'm not fond of people making decisions for me, since the principal has decided we must stay after school for an extracurricular activity, we might as well do it. I can engage in an activity until I completely lose interest in the subject. Since it's only one activity, how hard can it be? However, my stance remains: I disagree with the principal about staying after school for an extracurricular activity. Some students might think, 'Oh well, I need to stay after school to get my grades up,' but the only club that might help with grades is the homework club, which is for people with a lot of homework. Since that isn't considered an extracurricular activity by the principal, you might as well stay after school and go to that club either way.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

I agree that having an extended school day would provide students with more learning time and longer weekends to recover. However, they might struggle to find time for personal activities.\n\nOne reason why schools should extend the school day is that it would allow students to learn more in their classes. With longer class periods, students would have less homework, as they could complete more work during class time. Teachers could review units more thoroughly, ensuring students understand the material better. Schools would not fall behind in teaching; instead, they would be ahead. Longer class times would also mean more hands-on activities in subjects like science. Students with limited class time often struggle on test days, only grasping the main points of the units. Extended days with more class time would allow for teaching all the points in depth.\n\nA second reason why having an extended school day for four days is beneficial is that students would enjoy a longer weekend. They could sleep in on Friday mornings without the worry of going to school. During the extended weekend, both students and teachers could spend more time with their families. Students would also have time to engage in sports or other active pursuits. With a three-day weekend, there's even the possibility of going on a short vacation. The break would help them recover from the week's stress, including tests and homework. Additionally, students could catch up on schoolwork if they missed a day, using the weekend to their advantage. Teenagers old enough to work could do so on weekends.\n\nA third point to consider is that although students would spend more time in school, they might not have enough personal time. Sports and part-time jobs could suffer during the week. High school students who prefer to work might consider dropping out due to the increased stress, potentially leading to a decline in their grades. With such a tight schedule, some might prefer to skip school altogether. Younger children in elementary school could become exhausted with the early starts and late pickups; it is not ideal to force them to learn for so many hours.\n\nTeaching and learning for 10 hours over 4 days, followed by a long weekend for students and staff, is an idea worth considering. I agree that a longer school day and weekend could enhance learning and provide much-needed breaks. Nevertheless, it is important to balance these benefits with the potential for students to struggle in finding time for themselves.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

However, keep some things to yourself if you think it's not positive to say to another. Second, It might make the person feel bad if you do say something harsh to them. Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times. Sometimes you have to say what's right in order to not hurt someones feelings from what you said. For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return. Secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later. They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.\n\nSecondly, If you are honest \"all the time\" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher. By the wrong person you talk to, you might accidentally start a riot.\n\nLastly, you should be careful on how honest you are to people, because you don't know whether they are going through some stuff you are pointing out to them.

Why? Because if people remain busy and take advantage of their time, they will get a lot more done rather than not doing anything with their time at all. Staying busy and being active can take up a lot of time, but the results an individual is looking forward to are also very important. That's why it's a lot better to stay busy and accomplish what you're working hard for. Being on track and remaining busy can take up a lot of time but also help in many things. Busyness can take away the bad energy and keep people from doing many wrong things. The results people get from staying busy or being on task are much better than those of someone who prefers to be inactive rather than active and feels way better accomplishing what they're working hard for. Inactivity damages and takes away so many great things in life that people don't come across to notice, whereas in such a small amount of time, you can realize that it's very easy to ruin your life. Thomas Jefferson has the best way possible of saying, 'It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing,' because it's mesmerizing how possible it is to get so much done in so little time, and even inactivity can serve a purpose for times where people want free time or time to relax. Inactivity has multiple meanings, and it's up to individuals to take it as wasting time or a time to calm their mind and soul in order to get back up again and remain active. Personally, in life, I have made many mistakes where I'd think I have nothing to do when really, there's always something to do in order to better yourself or to improve anything possible. Learning from those mistakes, I've realized that no matter how good or bad anybody is at something, it can always be fixed by being active and staying busy, which is why I think Thomas Jefferson had the perfect idea of writing this quote in the best way possible.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

For example, in our jobs, people who work with us can be rude and can make you do many more things than you are supposed to do. The majority of managers and bosses fire people or they make their coworkers respect other people, but\n\nmany other managers agree with the idea of what their coworkers are doing to the person who is not like them. However, there are more nice people than bad in this world, and in our generation, there are many people with different styles and many more things that can cause people to become rude.\n\nHow can people be rude and problematic with our own people to the extent that the anger makes them kill innocent children and teenagers? It doesn't make sense. But now there are many institutions and rights that protect people from our own community. People can be like that because the 'different' people they call different are often more intelligent, happy, and grateful, and that makes racist and bad people angry.\n\nThere are many more reasons why people do not like those who are different from them. For example, immigrant people who came to this country to have a better life and better opportunities face a higher percentage of discrimination and racism from people who may prefer to kill innocent people instead of respecting them or just not talking to them. But don't go too far with your anger because they are progressing or have a better life. Another example is Donald Trump, who does not like immigrant people from any part of the world, nor the Latino community; that's why he wants to build a big wall between the two frontiers.\n\nSociety is not going to do or be something that other people want it to be because they are not going to move to their violent country, change their race, change their religion, or be what other people want them to be just to make racist people happy. Just respect others no matter where they are from and what their culture is. But now, thanks to freedom of speech and freedom of religion in this country, people can loudly proclaim their sexuality, religion, and many more cultures that they can have from their country, no matter what other people think. Because no matter what, there is always going to be at least one person who is not going to like it, no matter if we are in the year 3000; something is always going to be like that. Furthermore, having a positive attitude is always going to benefit your life and is always going to be your greatest happiness, no matter what other people think or say about it.\n\nPeople from different religions, sexualities, or who have different cultures are free to do what makes them happy, and that's what matters.\n\nThanks to the rights of the people and how Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, being yourself in this world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment. In addition, you always have to wake up with a positive manner and a positive attitude; that way, you can be successful in life, and that way, people who do not like different people may learn not to hate just because people dress up differently and have other cultures.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

If the classes are required, it's not going to be beneficial for students; as a result, they are going to have bad grades.\n\nElective classes give the opportunity to those students who are willing to learn and acquire more skills in life. Taking one of these classes during your school year is beneficial because you will have the opportunity to get a better job and find one more easily. These classes can also help you earn extra money throughout your life, even if you are not interested in the specialty. For example, you choose an art class and learn to draw beautiful designs. One day, a company announces that they are looking for someone who wants to earn extra money by creating designs for their next catalog. You see the announcement and seize the opportunity to earn extra money that really benefits you. Opportunities like this can make you more versatile in life.\n\nSome students choose these classes because they are easy, fun, and helpful. This makes them attend class with positivity and more effort. In the last two years, I took a music class, which was guitar. It was a fun class, and playing each chord made me feel relaxed after all those hard classes. I finally found one that engaged me. I say it was helpful because I got A's, and it helped me raise my GPA. Some students, like me, choose these classes for these reasons. It is better to have these classes as electives because that gives you the opportunity to select the classes that you really need. This year, I decided not to choose an art class because I wanted to complete all my subjects and get the advanced diploma; that was my goal. If these classes were required, I would not have been able to complete the classes that I needed.\n\nBeing able to choose the classes that make you feel confident is a big step in your education. Some students want to major in one of the arts. This is a great opportunity to start gaining experience in a major field and see if you are good at it or if you should consider a different path.\n\nFor example, one student decided to major in music and was very sure about it. In his freshman year, he selected the music class. The first day he was happy, but by the second class, he felt insecure about it because it was hard for him to read the music sheets, so he decided to change classes. He realized that he was not good in that major field. It was great that he realized that in time.\n\nSome people might say that allowing students to select an art class is not a good idea because every student should have an extra skill and learn something new. However, I think that each student should choose to learn that extra skill. It is better to let students decide if they want an art class or not because some of them are not interested in that field and they don't put the effort into those classes. In the end, they get bad grades, which affects their GPA and their chance to graduate.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly.

In my opinion, we accomplish more if we are always doing something. For example, students have to graduate to be finished with high school and to get their diploma. Students go to school every day so that they can achieve their goals of graduating so that they can get good jobs, good money, and also to get accepted into Universities or Colleges. Thomas Jefferson wrote this quote so that people can understand that if you put anything into your mind, you can achieve it and you can make something out of it because at the end of the day hard work pays off and it is better than no work. Also, it doesn't matter how long you take or how little you take, it is still about the amount of effort someone puts in if we are always doing something. Another example would be, Thomas Jefferson always did something random and he would make the best out of it. Inactivity, in my opinion, doesn't serve a purpose because inactivity isn't something that can help you accomplish more because you really are not doing anything. Finally, accomplishing goals in your life is a big deal for the future for you and your family. These goals will help you become the person who you really want to become and it wants you to inspire others that they also can be like you if they set their mind and intentions on to what they are doing. In conclusion, not everyone is the same and not everyone is going to get there as fast as others because everyone has obstacles in their life and it may slow them down but it is probably for the better and maybe their guardian angel is sending them a sign that they don't need to rush anything because you can watch your mistakes, focus on other things, and most importantly is to focus on your family.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

We are the ones to make the decision to do something to change the future; we make that decision to try new things every day, even if we end up learning from our mistakes. When we make mistakes, sometimes it could lead to a new start, or other times it can lead to something bad, but we always learn from our mistakes.\n\nPeople all around the world make decisions that are not the best, but you get to learn from your mistakes. Experts, authorities, doctors, teachers, lawyers, judges, priests, probably even the president\u2014each and every one of these people, who has had a degree or done well in school, have made mistakes all the time. Even if it's something you might learn from, people still make mistakes, and nobody is perfect. No one can be perfect to the point that they never in their lives had ever made a mistake because the majority of the people around the world have made at least more than one mistake, and sometimes people don't realize that they have made them. For example, doctors can make the mistake of diagnosing the wrong patient; yes, it's risky and dangerous, but you learn from your mistakes, even if there are consequences at the end. Lawyers can make the mistake of accusing an innocent person during court; yes, people can be innocent before proven guilty, but what if they were scared to tell the truth and it turns out they really are innocent? People make mistakes all the time; some can be due to poor decision-making, but you still learn from everything you do.\n\nThe reason why people make their own decisions and not authorities is that some people hate having someone tell them what to do, and that is not a hypothesis\u2014that is a fact. People genuinely like doing whatever they want, even if it's harmful or smart, but we end up learning the hard way about everything. People all around the world have the chance to make decisions to change the future for themselves or for their country. Some people have the right to be able to save lives with some of the decisions they make. Others can decide to help the homeless or be foster parents to help children or anyone out. Some decisions can be for good use, and others can be for greed, revenge, mistakes, or just a bad decision that could get you into some consequences. Every day, people make decisions, even if they're small decisions. Mistakes can happen all the time, but it's up to the person if they want to learn from their mistakes or not.\n\nLife is not easy because you have lots of decisions to make every day without always knowing the outcome of that decision. Some people have it easy in life because of their decisions, and others have it really rough. Experts may or may not understand what someone is going through because they have never experienced it. People make their decisions for so many reasons. For example, a man might be going through stage three cancer and just wants people to understand that this is it; no more making decisions because he just wants to go. Experts would have probably said to take the treatment and be there with your family, but it is not the family's, friends', experts', or doctors' decision\u2014it's the man's decision and his wishes. Experts do not have the right to make our decisions in life because the decisions that we make as an individual are unique in our own way. People may judge, consequences may happen, but it is you making the decision, thinking about what you feel is best for you, even if you want to make bad ones. No one has the right to make your decisions or your ideas; they cannot tell you what to do, no matter how much they want to, because in the end, it's you making the decision to listen or to ignore.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

I think these programs help students to start a relationship with work or college one year earlier. Students who are interested in this program have to take courses during the summer or evenings. I believe these types of programs enable students to connect with college or work in the shortest possible time and can learn more about studying. However, sometimes there are students who can't take these types of courses. I think offering such courses is a good idea for high school students because they can develop their work skills or learning capacity in a short time. For example, if a student knows something about a job, he can finish high school and start to develop it. Or if the student is a genius in a class, he can go to college sooner and begin to demonstrate what he knows. I agree with these types of programs because they allow students to finish high school quickly, start working towards their goals sooner, and potentially achieve a better quality of life.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

It's a good idea because that way there will be fewer phones taken away, and you won't have to bother calling parents to come to school and pick up phones. Also, it's a good idea because that way your students won't have to sneak around with their phones. Some students argue when their phones are taken away. So, Policy 1 is a better solution than the other one. Plus, us kids don't have anything to do during our free time, so we could just text friends or our parents, telling them when we feel sick or something. In class, they will not abuse it because they know they can use it later on during lunch or when they have their free time. And if you take phones completely away, students will be very upset and will not pay attention in class, getting caught with their phones out.\n\nSincerely,\n\nSTUDENT_NAME\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

I disagree that extending school hours is a good idea because students would have less time at home, and it would be overwhelming for students to learn so much in one day.\n\nStudents shouldn't be in school for more than seven hours unless they are staying after school because they won't have time to relax at home. For example, if students are in school for six to seven hours, then they would have at least seven to eight or more hours to relax at home and do whatever they want. However, if we extend the day by one and a half hours, they would have at most six hours to relax at home before returning to school the next day. Additionally, students would have less time to do their homework, and if they don't complete it, they could get in trouble. Teachers might require them to finish their homework during lunch or stay after school. Furthermore, they would have less time to spend with their family members. Some people cherish their time with family and dislike having to leave them for school, work, or travel far from their parents' home.\n\nIt is not beneficial for students to learn too much because it could negatively impact their health. When students are overloaded with information, their brains may struggle to comprehend and solve problems, leading to stress and frustration. This could result in students wanting to give up, which is not a solution. Moreover, students might forget the material and then need to ask the teacher for help, which could lead to frustration on both sides. Another issue is that students might fall asleep in class due to boredom or exhaustion. If school hours are extended by one and a half hours, students might sleep in and arrive late, which is not desirable for teachers.\n\nThe school board should not add one and a half hours to each school day because it would reduce students' time at home and be detrimental to students like us to learn so many things during school. Therefore, students should not be overloaded with education because then they might forget everything and could eventually fail a grade, a test, a class, or even an SOL.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

Problems mark your life and make you strong and confident about yourself because you are showing the world you can do it, and that you have the power to do it, and that no matter what gets in your way, you will overcome your problem. 2. Problems make you strong, and the harder the problem, the stronger you will get. Now, sometimes you will feel like you can't do it anymore, but giving up is not a choice. You have to keep on trying and think positive thoughts because if you have negative thoughts, you are going to fail to your problem, and you won't be able to get any stronger, neither will you show your best. 3. Showing the world you can do it and that you are strong is what is going to make people see you as a role model. Because when people see that you are a positive person and that you try, and if you fail, you keep on trying, and that nothing stops you, they will start to admire you.

For example, I had a friend who always likes to drive when hi was drunk at hing speeds in the highways at night, One night he had car accident because he was driving drunk and at a high speed he is dead now.\n\nThirdly, curfew can prevent teenagers from doing things that they are not supposed to do. They might be doing drugs or hanging out in the streets with people that are doing drugs or are in gangs, they can be influenced by bad people from the streets to do drugs. Insulation, my cousin who use to do spent a lot of time in the streets with her friends, she and her friends went to jail because they were doing drugs.\n\nIn conclusion, curfew prevents teenagers from getting in trouble, it may prevent teenagers from getting in drugs, also from getting kill in cars accidents. It will keep them away from bad influences, they will stay away from danger people in the streets, but the most important is that this curfews will keep them safe.\"\n\nExample essay 3 of score \"2.0\":\n\"Yes i agree for that all we have that be our selves for put to go out a head we live in the own world where the people judges our behavior and not sees its errors. because in this world to be bieng you yourself and don't matter how you are, you have that yourself, always we need remmerber that you can change the world, not the world change you.\n\nall of them we have a problem but we need learn, follow our dreams i want graduate this year sometimes i think i can't anymore but i have a son i need to follow because he follow me i want change the world for my son he need make a better person because he need help other people i want that he follow her dreams.\n\nwe need change our to think for that change the world we need make major people i need make better people i need help to the people poor, and the ancient people we need change our character because we want a better future for our children they need learn to be bette people they knoe our future.\n\nin the school i learn about no judge the people if we have a different type of skin and different color and nationality don\"t matter in this world all the peole are the same.\n\ni don't change my manner of to think because you need to be yourself. don't chage your ideas to be a big person in the world in conclusion don't worry be happy because the life is short you need live the life don't matter that the people think follow your dreams \" i want study in the university i want to pass my tests i want a be a big person that my son see that all can you can make whattever you want if you can and you want you can.\n\nWe can change the world for a world better. \"\n\nEssay to score:\n\"I think that everyone in this world has a hidden talent or skill.

You may buy it from him, fix it, and then sell it for even more money.

If not, you should know that camping is the most adventurous thing in the world. It will be a new world to you, where you'll see a lot of nature and animals that you might have thought existed only in movies, but they are real! Another reason is that it will bring you closer to your family; you can do fun things together, and camping can teach you valuable lessons.\n\nFirst of all, have you ever gone camping with your family where there was no internet at all? If yes, I assume that you went crazy because you can't live without your phone. But think for a moment: does a phone matter more than spending time with your loved ones?\n\nIf you say 'yes,' let me tell you that you are really wrong because spending time with family or friends is incredibly valuable. A family trip is meant to foster communication, to enjoy fun activities, and to support each other. For example, you can work together to set up a tent or to make a fire. Even though none of you may know how, it will still be a funny moment to see how each one of you tries to make it work.\n\nSecond, camping can teach you important lessons during the time you spend there. It can make you realize that living in the woods is not easy. You have to create your own shelter, make a fire to keep warm, and there is no electricity to communicate with someone. These challenges make you appreciate that many people around the world live in these conditions.\n\nFinally, you will do a lot of fun things. For example, you can explore the woods to look for edible food, or you can search for animals such as a bunny, raccoon, or even a big brown bear if you are adventurous.\n\nAfter that fun and adventurous mission, you can gather with your family in a big circle to tell scary stories that will make all your hairs stand on end. Or, if they don't like scary stories, they can share memories of all the happy moments they've experienced. And if you want to add more joy to the moment, you can enjoy s'mores made with two cookies, marshmallows, and delicious chocolate. That sounds good, right?\n\nIf you have never been camping before, I think you should give it a chance. Camping will give you some of the best memories with your family, show you more of the wilderness, and introduce you to the realities of camping. And I am sure you would like to eat a chocolatey marshmallow cookie, right?\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

Online classes are not like regular classes you take. Online classes have their own specific time that you have to be on your computer, and also how long you have to stay on your computer. The one thing that's hard about homeschooling is that you're not going to have friends. You're going to be by yourself all the time. But after saying all that, there is a little benefit of online school. The one reason why students want to take homeschooling is that you have until 11:59 PM to turn in your work; that means you have all day to do schoolwork, and also you can search things up when you don't know. I know all this because I took English 11 online this past summer.\n\nHomeschooling doesn't have a lot of benefits. Homeschooling means that you take your classes online; it means you're going to be on your computer all day, and that's going to affect your health. It's going to affect your health means that it's going to make you wear glasses, and you're no longer going to see well without your glasses. The number one thing homeschooling doesn't benefit you is that it's a lot of work; it's like doing twenty times more work than school a day. The second thing homeschooling doesn't benefit you is that there's no one to control you like a teacher does, and you're not going to have help when you need help, like staying after, and teachers always try to make things easy for their students. The last and the third thing is that you're not going to have a lot of friends as you would in school, and you're not going to have a lot of fun like no prom, no homecoming; you're going to miss a lot of experiences taking classes at home, and you're going to struggle.\n\nStudents want to take classes at home because they think it's going to be easy. There are some benefits to taking classes at home; the one reason a lot of people take classes at home is that you have all day to do your work, and also you can wake up late if you want. You're not going to have a schedule like school does; when I say you can wake up any time you want, it's like you go on Blackboard, you get the worksheet for the day, and you have until 11:59 PM to do the work, and after you finish, you turn it in on Blackboard, so you have time to sleep and have fun. But the problem is that the worksheet takes around seven hours to do. The second benefit of homeschooling is that you can search anything you want, and there's no one there to control you, and no one is there to yell at you and tell you what to do.\n\nI believe students should not take online classes at home. Online classes are not like regular classes you take. Online classes have their own specific time that you have to be on your computer, and also how long you have to stay on your computer. I don't recommend anyone to take homeschooling. I recommend going to school with your friends, having fun, and learning with your friends, getting help from teachers, and also the experience of school is way more important than you think for your future life because in your future life, your kids might ask you how was school in your days. So going to school is way more important than you think.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

However, one might wonder if there are better ways. Presenting a good example is a significant challenge because not everyone may be influenced by what you do or say. In this essay, I will discuss how people might relate to influence, the types of personalities people have, and people's perspectives about others.\n\nPeople might relate to influence in ways that may seem crazy, but it's true. There are a lot of people who really need help, and we never see that because we only focus on ourselves and what we want. We seldom consider putting ourselves in someone else's situation, understanding what they are going through, or what they have to deal with every single day. We all go through difficult times and want to talk about it with someone, but it's so difficult to do because we are scared of what people might think or say about us, or sometimes we might not trust them. Those who can influence others might feel amazing knowing that by helping others, they help themselves too. Influencers help people open up to the world and let go of the stuff they have been through. Sometimes there are better ways to do it, but just by talking about a situation that you have been through, a lot of people can relate.\n\nThe kind of personality people have is a big argument because, nowadays, people do not really appreciate what others have done for them. Sometimes they just forget about the people who were there to help them or the ones that they helped in opening up to the world and letting their problems go away.\n\nYour kind is one of the big words to represent yourself as an influence to people because you really want to help them, and they can relate to you. When you do something, it's because you really want to, not just for fun. For example, a lot of YouTubers nowadays have told the world a lot of stuff because they just wanted views or they pretended to be something they are not. Sometimes people might relate to their stories and support them, or sometimes people might not trust them. But in time, they have become important to the world. Sometimes they go over the line because they have become important. They start acting differently, and their fame makes them someone different just because they wanted the views and to become famous. Never forget who was there for you and how people related to you many times, because your kind of personality is what makes you significant.\n\nPeople's perspective about others is a big issue nowadays because people judge them based on their looks or the way they act. They judge them because that's how they were raised, but they are wrong because they are not giving people the opportunity to know them or talk to them. How can people ask for help when they are suffering or going through a difficult time if they do not want to open up to others because they are judged by their appearance? However, they are not putting themselves in others' shoes. People like to judge, and they even think they are bad people. One day, when they want to become an influence to others, people might not want to relate to them because of their behavior towards others. What people never consider is that the person they judge might help them even more than they imagine because that person might be the one who can relate to their problems and solve them for you. And of course, there are always different ways to help.\n\nIn conclusion, influence yourself first, and then with your behavior, help others relate to you. But do not expect something from people who do not want to help. Expect from people in the same way. Nowadays, anyone can become an influence, but not everyone will relate to your influence in better ways than you can do by yourself. In my opinion, I agree with Albert Schweitzer because, based on what I have been through, I relate to the idea that setting a good example through my own behavior will help me influence others, and in certain ways too.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

Some schools offer the convenient choice of allowing students to study from home via online courses or through video. Some students are fortunate enough to learn from their own home, so they wouldn't go through these minor setbacks. Many students wish they were able to learn from home and not have to go to a public or private school. Students could also take courses that are necessary for them and could help them with things that are really needed for the rest of their lives. For these students, learning from home brings many benefits because students would not worry about getting to school, they would still be able to learn while sick, and they would learn at a pace they need.\n\nFirst, the students wouldn't worry about how they were going to get to school. Students could relax a lot more knowing that they did not have to make those sacrifices to get to school. Having to make it on time to school adds an immense amount of pressure to a student because they know that their teacher would be angry for being late to class, but when taking online courses, they would be able to learn from home and not worry about making it on time. Being in a public school is all about timing because being late could result in lectures for hours on end and could get you in trouble with your administrator. This is why when you learn from home, you could do it any time throughout your day because it's an online course and it's available at all times. When you also learn from home, you're able to take your time on certain activities and other tasks. Depending on the weather, that could be even more time-consuming; for example, if it's snowing, you would have to warm your vehicle up in order to be able to drive it, and for people who walk to school, they suffer the most because they have to either sweat or be so cold on the way to school and on the way back.\n\nSecond, students wouldn't have to make it to school even when sick. Many schools suggest that students should stay home when sick in order to prevent the sickness from spreading to every other person in the building. When a student takes an online course, they could still learn from home without getting anyone else sick. Missing school could probably be one of the worst things because of the amount of work you would have to catch up on. Students that take online courses are a lot luckier because they are still able to learn from bed with any sort of sickness. Some students miss an important day like test days, but when they do, they have to wait to take the test and get a zero in the grade book until they complete the test on whatever makeup day is assigned to them. When students who take online courses miss the test day, they could complete it whenever, just because it's online and it won't have to be taken on a hard copy.\n\nLastly, the student would be able to learn at the pace that they desire. Students who attend public schools know that they don't always move at the desirable pace because there are many others learning with them. For example, when a student sits down in math class, the teacher is either really quick or really slow. But when online, you could ask the teacher to please repeat themselves and move at the pace you would really like. When a teacher has a class of twenty-plus kids, he or she really can't give you undivided attention because there are so many students in that class. For students who take online classes, they could have the full attention of the teacher because every student has one specific teacher assigned just for them; with this, they are able to learn a lot more and are able to move from subject to subject a lot quicker. The students who take the online class will also move at a much faster rate because they wouldn't have any sort of distractions but would give the teacher a lot more attention than they would in a public class.\n\nSome schools across the United States offer students the choice to take online courses from home. This helps many students who have problems getting to school and home, it allows students to learn at the pace they will be more successful at, and would help when a student is not feeling well enough to go to school. Many of the students wish they were able to take an online course, which is much better than an online school.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

Without energy, we cannot survive because most people use it daily, and our businesses rely on it. Therefore, I strongly disagree with this choice for several reasons: We will be using more energy than what we actually use on a daily basis; moreover, students will have to spend more time in classes, which is too much for their brains to handle or concentrate for that long. However, looking further and searching for alternative sources that we can use in the near future is a good start.\n\nThe first reason I believe is that we will be wasting more energy than we usually do. If we add the number of hours that we waste on energy that we consume now, it will be less than in a four-day work week, which eliminates it for now. Also, there will be more pressure on electronic machines than we usually exert, which could cause damage and cost money. Coupled with that, workers and students will spend more time at work than usual, which seems more exhausting than what they currently experience.\n\nSecondly, students will spend more time in school. With the current schedule, students encounter some troubles that make them struggle with the time they wake up and leave school. Some students suffer from laziness during school because of the long extended schedule. So, adding four more hours to their regular day will decrease their ability to concentrate in class, which leads to a huge increase in the number of failing students every school year, which parents do not wish for. Other than that, we can find alternative resources that can be renewable or nonrenewable to maintain power.\n\nLastly, looking for other sources that have the same quality is essential. In general, the world has a lot of renewable and nonrenewable resources that can help us keep the energy as it is. For example, CCT, which is clean coal technology, is based on burning coal using developed vents with filters that can reduce air pollution. Moreover, we can use solar cells to make resources even in case we need an alternative.\n\nLast but not least, people should try their best to conserve energy and resources to make life better for themselves and the next generations. Extending school and work hours to ten days is a below-average solution to solve our issue, but humans can find different ways to maintain energy.\n\nHuman beings can be creative if we use our nature to find resources that can make our lives easier.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

The world is life, and life hits us with unexpected things, but you know what? We can fight it, no matter how hard it hits us because us human beings are stronger than we think we are. Most importantly, we are strong when we come together and fight together as human beings.\n\nIn addition, some people would just give up when life finally hits them; they don't keep going because they don't have that motivation in them, or they don't have anyone to motivate them. That's why we, as humans, should come together so more people can have that motivation, and so we can start spreading that motivation. That word, motivation, is key because that's one of the things that keeps us going in life. Always repeat that in your head, and if you don't know what it means, look it up and read what it says because then you would understand why you do the things that you do, why you behave the way that you behave. You have no motivation and don't think that you have nothing that motivates you; everyone in this world has something that motivates them. You just haven't opened your eyes wide enough to see it yourself, but one day you will, and when that day comes, you will feel like you have made the biggest accomplishment of your life. I'm very grateful for what I have in life and very grateful for who I am today, an eighteen-year-old high school student trying to do what I'm going to do in the future and not letting the world, also known as life, take over me.\n\nLastly, being myself, who I am today, is the biggest and greatest accomplishment of my life because I stood my ground and took on life. If it wasn't for my motivations, I wouldn't have made it to where I am today and loving the things I love to do. I would say that I had a rough start in life, but that's the thing; most people have rough starts, but they come back from it, and gratefully, that's what happened to me, and I'm very, very grateful for that. For the people that are still hanging in there, find your motivation, find what you love to do because once you find it and love to do it, that's your motivation, and that's what you can do to get back up again and to be yourself again. It's never too late to start, and it's not as easy as you think, but it is sure as hell worth it. All you have to do is stop what you're doing and go find it now. Ralph Waldo Emerson is a wise man, and what he is saying in this quote is very true, and I agree with him on it.\n\nThe world ain't all sunshine and rainbows; it's a very mean and nasty place, and I don't care how tough you are, it will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it. You, me, or nobody is going to hit as hard as life, but it ain't about how hard you hit; it's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward, how much you can take and keep moving forward. That's how winning is done. Now, if you know what you're worth, then go on and get what you're worth, but you have to be willing to take the hits and not point fingers saying you aren't who you want to be because of him, or her, or anybody. Cowards do that, and that ain't you.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

People can check out books, shop, and play games without conversing with another person. Technology negatively impacts people's lives because in-person communication has diminished. Technology has transformed how people live; they now remain indoors, glued to their computers, tablets, and phones. The adverse effect of technology is evident as few people wish to engage in face-to-face conversations. Instead, they prefer to communicate via their cellphones. \n\nTechnology provides all the necessary information to complete tasks without the need to inquire directly from another individual. It guides you through each step required to finish work, a project, or research independently. While technology enables us to find everything, it does so without the need for communication with a teacher, tutor, or manager for assistance. \n\nPeople can obtain books, shop, and entertain themselves without human interaction. Individuals increasingly rely on technology to acquire desired items without the need to walk or drive to stores. The convenience of apps that deliver goods to one's doorstep in mere hours or minutes discourages people from leaving their homes. The impact of technology is detrimental as it fosters addiction to phones and computers. Most concerning is the potential loss of interpersonal communication skills. \n\nThe decline in face-to-face communication is a direct result of technology's influence. People have become accustomed to phone calls as a substitute for in-person interactions. Some may avoid direct conversation due to fear or shyness, opting instead for text messages or phone calls. Those who are reticent to talk may prefer texting or calling the person in question. \n\nThe pervasive use of electronic devices at home has altered daily life. The negative consequences include potential vision impairment from prolonged screen exposure and a lack of awareness of one's surroundings. Relying solely on technology for learning, without leaving the house, limits educational experiences. Moreover, people may be at a loss when technology is unavailable, even temporarily. \n\nIn conclusion, technology hinders face-to-face communication and prevents us from seeking assistance from teachers, tutors, parents, or friends.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

This question arises after considering the conservation of energy and resources, along with the benefits and disadvantages of a four-day school week.\n\nNowadays, the conservation of energy and resources is more common in enterprises and businesses because these resources are depleting very quickly. However, these companies are reflecting on the damage that could occur if they do not take action. Many companies have adopted a four-day work week, with each day consisting of ten hours. On the other hand, schools are also dealing with this new system of work. Are they adopting the same four-day model, but could reducing the time for learning affect the students?\n\nMost schools follow a five-day teaching model with approximately eight hours each day. But now, by adopting the new model to conserve energy and save resources, schools are considering four-day weeks, extending each day by two hours. In my opinion, it is a well-intentioned idea to help conserve the world's resources and energy. However, I disagree with cutting two hours of learning time. We should have more time to study to achieve our future goals, and by having two fewer hours, we are just wasting time in school. For example, a student needs approximately eight hours over five days a week, reviewing four assignments a day, which means for each assignment, the student has to spend an hour and a half to at least retain something. Two hours less does not cover the time we need to study.\n\nRevisiting the viewpoint of saving resources and energy, we know it is necessary for our lives, and our task is to learn how to protect them. However, there are other ways to do this without reducing the school day by two hours. For instance, businesses or environmental organizations could dedicate a day solely to the planet Earth. Companies could divide tasks such as cleaning rivers, picking up trash, planting trees, and turning off power plants that emit smoke. Additionally, implementing renewable energy in schools can help; for example, solar panels on the school's roof can contribute to the development of renewable energy and save a lot of resources. In my opinion, this is the correct approach to take without changing any schedules in schools or businesses. Arctic countries implement this kind of model; they conserve resources, and people work a manageable schedule. That's why Arctic countries have a high standard of living and are known as some of the most beautiful places to visit and live.\n\nAs I said before, the school does not need to extend the day by two hours. Extending the school day is not about avoiding penalties; it's about making students leave home early, spending their time on games or hanging out on the streets with untrustworthy friends, instead of being in a classroom gaining knowledge and discovering new things that can help them build their future. Working on tablets at home will not help students learn as effectively as they do in school; most students do not even use a tablet to work because they are either lazy or they do not understand the topic and need a teacher, which would not be possible with two fewer hours of learning time. That's why I disagree with this model of conserving energy and resources, which can be addressed in other ways, as I mentioned earlier.\n\nIn my humble conclusion, schools should operate as usual because it is where students forge their futures, and it is one of the few places where they are mostly safe. Therefore, extending the school day by two hours would be a waste of time and not provide enough time to educate the students. On the other hand, while energy and resources are vital for the world to function, there are other ways to manage them without affecting businesses, factories, enterprises, and schools with limited hours of study. I believe that everything is possible, and if we really want to make a difference with renewable resources, we can do so without affecting the schools. Let the students spend more time in school, not wasting the rest of the day doing nothing.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

I think it isn't, and here are three reasons why. The first reason is that the student could only learn from and talk to the teacher. The second reason is that the student could leave whenever they wanted to because there is no one to tell them no. The last reason why they should not do online school and video conferencing is that the student could cheat on anything, like tests, quizzes, exams, and the school wouldn't have a clue if it was true or false. That's why I think they should not do online school and video conferencing.\n\nThe student would only learn from and hear the teacher and wouldn't hear anyone else's thoughts. The student might be afraid to ask questions or make comments to the teacher. The student would not get help from anyone else but the teacher. The teacher could be rude and disrespectful and might teach too fast or too slow. The student might not be able to understand what the teacher is talking about. The teacher might be frustrating the student without even knowing it. The student might just walk away from the computer. That's why I think that one benefit you will lose in online school.\n\nThe student could leave at any time and not have to do the hours of requirement that students in school have to.\n\nThe student would be able to do anything because there is no one there to tell the student what to do and what not to do. Here's an example: the student could be on their phone, have their tabs open, and the teacher on the other side of the screen would have no clue. The student could take the computer wherever they want. So, for example, they could be doing the schoolwork in fast-food restaurants, libraries, and other places, and the teacher couldn't tell them what to do because the student wouldn't care at all. The only thing the online teacher could possibly do is report the issue to the corporation. That is another issue that only online school will have and not with regular schools.\n\nThe student could cheat without the teacher knowing at all. There are a lot of things the student could cheat on, like homework, quizzes, exams, and tests. I will give you an example: a student is doing a test and does not want to fail because their family needs them to pass to help them out in the future. In school, they couldn't cheat because the teacher would see them. But online, there could be a friend or family member helping them cheat on the test so they can pass and help their family out in the future. There are many situations where the student could cheat; it could help them or their family, or it can be bad for them, but either way, it is still bad to cheat in any case. That is another reason what you can do in online school that you can't do in regular schools.\n\nThose are my thoughts on why you should not have online school. They are great in some ways, but overall, I think they should not be necessary unless needed, and that's the only reason I know of. But that is my overall thoughts on why not to have online school. You could cheat on tests, homework, quizzes, etc. You could go wherever you want to go. The only person you could talk to is the teacher. That's why I think that they should not have online school or video conferencing rather than regular school.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

It made them get into trouble because of you. You did it so they could learn from their mistakes and not do it again. Also, there are times when people have to do the right thing to get the job done, fix it, and help other people out.\n\nNo act of kindness, no matter how small, is ever wasted. You can't get it back. There was this one time when my dad had a bad day because of what happened at his job. I asked him what happened. He said that his friend needed some help, so he helped him out. Then his friend said that he would be moving to another state because his other friend supported him to get out of there. So he did, because that friend wanted him to come to New York, which is a great city to live in, so he could be close to his mom. That was how my dad was sad because his friend was moving away from this state to another state. In addition, there was an impact on his friend that made him move away from his other friend to another state because of someone else's opinion to move to his mom's house. My dad had helped his friend out and still had a bad day.\n\nActs of kindness can have an impact on people. In addition, I snitched on my sister.

For example, my mom took away her phone for a month so she could learn from her mistakes and not do it again. There are words that can get someone in trouble.

They can choose other paths in their lives that they never tapped into, so they can cut down the time and give them some words so they can listen to and not do it again.\n\nThere are steps that people can change by other people's words. When someone you like tells you something that hurts, it can create pain in you that makes you stronger. People's words can change other people if the change was good for good, or if the change was bad for bad. It depends on how the situation is.

Inactivity certainly serves a purpose because if you work yourself too hard, you can get sick, and it allows you to spend more time with your family.\n\nFirst, when you work too hard without rest, you can become very sick. Working excessively often leads to stress, which can result in anger towards everyone. Therefore, for the sake of your health, it is beneficial not to overwork yourself.\n\nSecond, by not working excessively, you will be able to spend more time with your family. For example, many children grow up without their parents around. The question is: Why? It's because their parents are working a lot and not spending time with their children, who sometimes desperately need their parents' attention.\n\nFinally, some people may not think they are wrong for not spending time with their children, but the consequences of neglecting to spend time with them will inevitably arise. Of course, work is important, but being present in their children's lives is also crucial for the family's well-being.\n\nIn conclusion, I agree with the statement because people don't have to grow under adverse circumstances. There are many things that can help one grow as a person, but the most important is the family. That is when you really have to give your all. However, you can do this by spending time with your family, which should always be a priority.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

Should students be required to take a class in the arts, or should such classes be electives? Students can take those classes if they choose to because they have the right to do so. Conversely, if they do not wish to, they have the right to select other elective classes as well. Indeed, these classes should be electives, allowing students to choose based on their interests, such as drawing, singing, or acting, or any other elective they wish to pursue. There are reasons why they might opt for elective classes.\n\nThe first reason why they should take elective classes is to fill up their schedules. After completing their core classes like math, science, and history, students need electives. These classes provide knowledge about subjects that students might not have encountered before. For instance, in music, they might learn how to play an instrument or sing correctly, while art class could teach them various drawing and coloring techniques.\n\nThe second reason is that electives contribute points to their GPA for their high school diploma. Students have the right to choose their elective classes rather than having them assigned by a counselor. If students are not interested in a class, they may not attend or engage with the material. Electives could potentially lead to future musicians, artists, and actors, but we cannot predict this. Some elective classes, such as computer information, may be directly beneficial for future careers.\n\nThe third and final reason students need elective classes is for entertainment and to take a break from their other academic responsibilities. Electives can provide fun and create memories. For example, in my last year of high school, I am enjoying the elective classes I have chosen. In my opinion, students often take elective classes because they need them to graduate, but sometimes they do not because they already have all the credits required.\n\nIn conclusion, students can take elective classes if they wish, or they can choose others, as they have the right to do so. Students are required to take them to complete their schedules and to graduate. Elective classes are beneficial because they offer the opportunity to learn about a variety of subjects. Ultimately, electives can provide us with memories to cherish in the future. Some students take them out of interest and a desire to learn more about the subject. However, in the end, students must take them to graduate and perhaps to enjoy their experiences in these classes.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

How are you doing? I hope you're doing well.\n\nI know, I know. We're close to Thanksgiving, and all we want to talk about is what we're going to do on this holiday. I mean, at least, that's what I want to do. Five days without school\u2014that's going to be awesome.\n\nBut there are other things that matter more than that, like energy and resources conservation, don't you think? So, let's start with this prompt.\n\nFirst of all, do you know what conserving energy and resources means? I'm sure you do. But I'm going to tell you anyway, just in case you don't. It means to reduce or try to use less energy and resources.\n\nJust so we're clear, this is the first time I've heard that some businesses have adopted a four-day workweek with each day consisting of ten hours, in order to reduce the consumption of energy and resources.\n\nEnergy.\n\nTwo more hours of school means a lot more energy consumption than what we have now: more computer use, more smartboard use, air conditioning use, and more lighting. Because those things consume energy. Every time you have a light on or any other electrical device on, you are consuming energy. So if the school doesn't want to lose energy, adding two more hours to the school day is a bad idea.\n\nWater.\n\nWater is the second thing that the school is going to consume more of. The students like to go to the bathroom a lot. Sometimes they just go because they don't want to be in class or they want to use their phone, and they start to play with the water as if they paid for it. And I don't know about you, but I don't like to waste water, because water is not free in this country\u2014somebody is paying for it.\n\nMy opinion? If the school wants to conserve energy and resources, I don't think that the school should follow this model by extending the school day by two hours. Because instead of conserving energy and resources, the school is going to use more of it every day.\n\nWritten by\nGeneric_Name\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

However, keep some things to yourself if you think it's not positive to say to another. Second, It might make the person feel bad if you do say something harsh to them. Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times. Sometimes you have to say what's right in order to not hurt someones feelings from what you said. For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return. Secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later. They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.\n\nSecondly, If you are honest \"all the time\" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher. By the wrong person you talk to, you might accidentally start a riot.\n\nLastly, you should be careful on how honest you are to people, because you don't know whether they are going through some stuff you are pointing out to them. Being truthful to someone and saying everything to them might make them upset on how you view stuff in the world also. Honesty is like an opinion that may cause someone that went through something upset them drastically. This is why I disagree that honesty is the best policy. From the situation you are in say respectful stuff towards the person. It might make you a better person if you are not saying negative things towards a person too.\n\nIn conclusion, I disagree with \"Honesty is the best policy\" by the situation you are in with the person and what they are going through.

It's because we should think about our own decisions and decide if they are good or wrong. It's better to follow your own thoughts and not the thoughts of others. It helps you because you can express how you feel.\n\nFirst, people should make their own decisions because they are capable enough to think about them. Second, you should know what's right and what is not, what you shouldn't do and what you should do, and decide if it's right. Third, follow your mindset because if you adopt others' decisions, you are deciding with someone else's mindset. Others don't feel what you feel; they have different mindsets, opinions, and ideas. No matter what, follow your ideas and decisions. People are going to talk about you no matter how well or poorly you're deciding.\n\nI hope people do what they feel and not what others make them feel. If you ever have a problem, ask people you trust for their opinion and listen to what they have to say about it. Then you should analyze and think about it and decide which ideas you should use, but in your own way. Use it to find a way to resolve anything you are dealing with.

I don't think it's a good idea to complete high school in 3 years and graduate early. I believe that 4 years of high school would be a lot better because by then you'd have a clearer idea of what you want your career to be. If you take only 3 years of school, you might have to take classes during the summer, may not be able to take elective classes, or might even have more school hours. That is why I feel it'd be better to have 4 years of school and take things nice and easy.\n\nI'd like to start by saying that if you have only 3 years of high school, you'll be able to graduate early but probably won't know what you want to become; you might not even have an idea of what you want to be. I'm a junior this year, and I still don't know what I'd want to be, whether it's becoming a mechanic or a doctor, and those are only two careers out of the many there are. That is why it is better to have more time to be able to find out what we/you want to be or at least get an idea of what that is.\n\nAlso, if you have only 3 years of school, you'll have to think about the classes. You're going to have to take all your required classes first, meaning you won't have many electives. If you did have electives, you're going to most likely have more school hours, so that would mean less time at home, less time with family, and if you work, you'd have to work late. So, you have to think about how a 3-year school would operate. You can graduate early but will have more hours of school.\n\nSo finally, you might be thinking, \"If I have only 3 years of high school, that means I'll be able to graduate early and attend college early,\" but then again, like I said before, what if you don't know what you want to be? It's better to take your time and think things through and know the classes you'll need in college. You might also say, \"I get to work now.\" Well... you're right, but you can be working while attending school either way. I hope I made you think about your decision and am making you agree with me that it's better to have 4 years of high school instead of 3.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

For example, elective classes that can provide credits include:\n\n- Art Foundations.\n- Dance.\n- Intermediate Band.\n- Chorus.\n\nAnd other classes. If students study these classes, they can be very helpful for passing the school year.\n\nIn school, we have many classes that can assist with this, but sometimes students don't like the elective classes. When they have these classes, they skip them, which is why they fail and can't graduate because they lack the necessary credits on their school record.\n\nAlso, Army is a great elective class, but not everyone likes it, whether it's because of the shoes, the jacket, or the pants. Nevertheless, the school offers many classes or activities that can help every student pass their school year.\n\nFor example:\n\nI have an art class, and I really don't like art, but this class can help me pass my school year, and the teacher is very nice. He always has patience with the students and never gets angry.\n\nSo, elective classes are not always bad; it's just that students don't like to study and don't want to put in the effort to succeed. They want everything to be easy.\n\nIf students want to graduate, we need to be respectful, arrive on time in the classroom, do the homework, participate, and follow everything the teachers say, adhere to the school rules, be sociable with other students, and attend every class without skipping. If we do all these things, we can be very good students at the school. And when the school year is about to end, we can graduate because we followed the school's rules, did everything the teachers said, and were patient and responsible in the classrooms, and of course, respectful to other students and teachers.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

For example, if you are in a bad mood, you can go outside to the park, see all the kids playing, and run around with them.\n\nWhen my little brother is crying or not having a good time, my mom takes him to the park. There, he plays, runs around, and becomes happy. Many kids get bored being home all day without going outside for activities like running or playing on the swing. A lot of kids these days don't go outside to the parks because of technology; they play on their iPods or iPhones and watch TV. I don't think it's healthy for kids to be home all day, not going outside and not enjoying their childhood.\n\nWhen I was little, in my country, there weren't many parks, so I used to just go outside and play. Kids find park activities enjoyable because if they go outside, their minds will open, and they'll be more motivated to play or run and play things like soccer, etc. Even though there were no parks in my country, we would just go outside and play many things like jump rope, tag, or anything that involved exercise.\n\nThese days, kids really need to be outside and play around. My brothers are always playing on their phones. When my mom asks them to go outside, they don't want to because they prefer to play games on their phones, which is not healthy for their minds. My mom always struggles to tell my brothers to go outside. When we were in my country, we didn't have any iPods or phones because we were little, like 6 years old, so my mom didn't even have to tell my brothers to go outside; they would always be outside and come home in the evening when it was getting darker. Now, I barely go outside. I go to school, and when I come back, I just stay on my phone and don't go to the park or anywhere because I'm on my phone. I think it's not good because kids need to enjoy their childhood and have these memories to look back on when they get older. I think someone will enjoy going to the park because they will be open-minded and think of things like playing in the playground, running around, and just exploring. Being home all day can make you feel sick, uncomfortable, and lazy. On the weekends, when I'm on my phone all day, I wonder why the day went so fast, but there are some weekends when I go outside with my family and enjoy being outside. I do enjoy being outside, but only if someone is with me, like my friends or my mom's friends. Last summer, my aunts, my mom, and I used to go outside and walk to the park to enjoy life, but now we just stay home, although sometimes we go outside.\n\nShould kids go to the parks and enjoy their childhood, or should they stay home and be on their iPods?\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

I believe that older students can assist younger ones because they may have already learned the material that the younger students are currently studying.

In conclusion, I think there are numerous ways for older and younger students to support each other during the program.\n\nUltimately, I believe that when older and younger students collaborate, one benefit is that older students can guide younger ones who need assistance with classwork or homework. This is possible because the older students might have mastered the topics that the younger students are now learning. Another way they can support each other is when an older student requires help studying for a test. Younger students can help by quizzing the older students. Additionally, both groups can benefit from sharing tips and strategies to aid one another with any challenges that arise, regardless of whether they are younger or older students.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

Do you agree or disagree?\n\nI disagree because they are still too young to commit to a career as they just enter high school. Being in a career involves a lot of responsibility, and they still need to learn more before embarking on a career path. Learning about a career is akin to learning about a job, and to make an informed decision about what you want to do for the rest of your life, you need to have a broad understanding and be well-prepared. I think that grades should be A, B, or C, and when their grades are good and they are passing, they can consider a career in the 10th grade, but not in the 9th grade. Therefore, I do not agree that students can come to high school and immediately choose a career, especially since 50% of the students in 9th grade are not passing their classes.\n\nFirst, there are some students who just enter high school and still don't understand responsibility. A career is a significant responsibility, typically for juniors and seniors. By the 10th grade, if they have completed English 10, they can sign up for a career and get ready for it. They can choose whatever career they want, like nursing, mechanics, etc., and they will study for it.\n\nSecond, if they are 16 years old, they can choose a career, but if they are not, they cannot. They are still young. Like me, they did not give me a chance. I wanted to be a nurse, but I was not given the opportunity. Now, I think I will go to college and study to be a teacher, or I don't really know because at the same time, I think I want to be famous, like trying to be in a movie. As a junior, I still don't know what career I want because we were not given other choices to study. I wish we could have had other options in school, not just nursing, because not everyone has the opportunity, even if they apply.\n\nThird, I think they should talk with students about careers before they are in 10th grade and ask them if they are ready to commit to a career. However, they are still young and should not be forced to choose at a young age. If they are 16 or older, then they should be allowed to choose a career, but if they are younger, they should not. They should be informed about careers but not pressured into choosing one.\n\nIn my opinion, they should not let students choose a career because they are still too young and need to learn more about responsibility. For example, my best friend, Generic_Name, is in 9th grade and knows about responsibility; she takes care of her little brother and knows what career she wants to pursue\u2014a soccer player. She is good at soccer and is a kind and good friend. There should be more 9th graders like her who understand responsibility. However, there are 9th graders who don't even respect their teachers and families, which shows they don't understand responsibility yet. They should respect their teachers and families because that shows they are responsible. Some students who enter high school don't respect others, even those in 10th, 11th, and 12th grades. That's why they should not be allowed to select a career first; they have to show respect to their teachers, families, and themselves.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

Being physically present at school is important for learning and becoming a better student. However, online classes at home should be optional, as they may be more convenient for some. For instance, a girl who is pregnant or has a baby may have valid reasons for not being able to attend school. Other students might not attend because they are working. Having the option to return to classes at home can be beneficial, especially when classes are suspended due to snow or extreme heat.

Waiting out the four high school years would be the best decision because they would still have time to take different courses and see which course they are really interested in.\n\nBesides school, students have an outside life that they have to deal with, good or bad. It's a very hard thing to manage between school and friendships. Every family has something they have to overcome, and it takes a toll on students. Most of the time, students don't know how to overcome those family challenges. Friendships and dating also take a toll on students because everything is so new to them that they don't know how to deal with it. Transitioning into high school is really where all the dating and friendships start going on. They get overwhelmed by things going on outside of school that it gets hard for them to be focused in school.\n\nDuring the transition from middle to high school, students start to develop and mature their brains. They start to rethink their actions but still don't make the best decisions. Choosing their career when transitioning into high school would not be the best idea. It's too much stress for a young developing brain; students tend to mature the most during their high school years. Not only do they mature and develop, but they also have to adapt to a whole new environment. Adapting to a whole new environment that you've never been in is a very hard thing to do. It would be too much for a young student to have to choose a career.\n\nIdentifying a career by the time you get to high school is not the best idea for students. It already takes time for students that are about to graduate from high school to choose what they want to take as a career. There are things that go on outside besides school that students need to overcome. Their brains aren't fully developed while transitioning into high school. Choosing a career while transitioning into high school is a very risky thing to do that should be waited out until your last year of high school.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

However, keep some things to yourself if you think it's not positive to say to another. Second, It might make the person feel bad if you do say something harsh to them. Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times. Sometimes you have to say what's right in order to not hurt someones feelings from what you said. For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return. Secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later. They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.\n\nSecondly, If you are honest \"all the time\" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher. By the wrong person you talk to, you might accidentally start a riot.\n\nLastly, you should be careful on how honest you are to people, because you don't know whether they are going through some stuff you are pointing out to them. Being truthful to someone and saying everything to them might make them upset on how you view stuff in the world also. Honesty is like an opinion that may cause someone that went through something upset them drastically. This is why I disagree that honesty is the best policy. From the situation you are in say respectful stuff towards the person. It might make you a better person if you are not saying negative things towards a person too.\n\nIn conclusion, I disagree with \"Honesty is the best policy\" by the situation you are in with the person and what they are going through.

Teenagers offended tend to drive at high speeds at night because the might be drunk, it will prevent then to not get influence by bad people, if this law is approved it will really help keep teenagers safe.\n\nTo begin with, in streets at night there are lot bad people, teenagers are expose to a lot of dangers, when they are in the streets at night curfews can prevent this to happen.

This should not be allow because, it can end in car crash, teenagers don't have a lot of experience driving at night. For example, I had a friend who always likes to drive when hi was drunk at hing speeds in the highways at night, One night he had car accident because he was driving drunk and at a high speed he is dead now.\n\nThirdly, curfew can prevent teenagers from doing things that they are not supposed to do.

My cousin has shown wisdom and experience to me by telling me things like, \"Don't do this because things could happen,\" and, \"Listen to what people say.\" Anything anyone tells you is important because if you make a mistake, then you could remember what they said. You won't have to experience what other people go through if someone knows what it's like; you could end up in worse situations than you could already be in.\n\nOne reason I think it's important to learn from the experience of others is that if you make a mistake, then you could go back and remember what that person told you and be like, \"Oh, I should've listened to them.\" When my cousin told me this, I knew I shouldn't be doing bad stuff like he did before. He wanted me to be safe and not be in danger. I've noticed that my family really cares and doesn't want any of their children, nieces, nephews, cousins, or anyone to be in a bad situation.\n\nAnother reason I think it's important to learn from the experience of others is that you won't have to experience what other people go through if someone explains it to you so that you won't end up making bad choices. When you want to do things you know are bad, then ask older family members if they have gone through it, so they could tell you, and you could probably reconsider before doing it. My cousin told me multiple things he has done, and he warned me about them, so I knew that I should listen to him and not risk it.\n\nA third reason I think it's important to learn from the experience of others is that you could end up in worse situations than you could already be in. When you choose to do something bad, first think of the consequences. My cousin always told me, \"Think first.\" It always stayed in my head, that certain saying. Always remember what your family is telling you because then you can end up telling your kids or little family members that you'll end up having. The things that could happen to you could most likely be bad, and you don't want that.\n\nThese are reasons why it's important to learn from the experience of others. Your family knows what's best because they have maybe gone through it. Always trust them; don't do things you may think that you can't handle. Do things that are good for you. Maybe life is different for others, but you need to trust what people say because it could influence you in life somehow.

We have to be honest; people just want everyone to look perfect in their eyes.\n\nFor instance, we can talk about all the pretty models. They have to be thin and have the perfect size and all that stuff. But do you really think that they are happy? I mean, who doesn't want to be a top model, right? But it's not that easy, and just because you see all the beauty, that's what you want to see because that's all that we care about. We never see or try to see more than what they show us, and guess what? We buy all that because we want to be more of what they want to see; we try to be more than them.\n\nNow, that was about our appearance, but what can we say about how we really feel about it? Well, famous people, do you really think that they are honest with us? Let's see, all these famous people that try to show us their \"real life.\" Do you really think that is the real them? They just pretend to be what we want to see. However, that is what we like to see, and we want to be like them, buy whatever they have, live how they live, and just try to be \"perfect\" as we think they are. But what about our feelings or their feelings? How can we show love when we don't love ourselves first? Why do I say this? Because if you do not accept yourself, how can you love it?\n\nSo, when we think about how we can show the world who we are, we have to think, \"Do I really be who I want to be?\" People always have something to say about you, no matter who you are or who you want to be. And it's hard because sometimes you have to pretend to be someone completely different just for your job, school, family, and everyone around you because you're afraid to lose their company or what they bring to you.\n\nAnd that is how our world works. It's complicated, but that's how we live, and not because we prefer it. It's because everyone has a different concept of freedom, and most of them think that they can make you and don't let you make yourself. In my opinion, that is why \"to be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.\"\n\nSincerely, Ralph W.

Have you ever experienced a program that involves both older and younger students, or wondered if the students would be able to admire each other? Older students have more experience than the younger ones, which makes it easier for them to handle problems. It also helps them to build stronger relationships since they come from different backgrounds. It will be easy for them to bring up ideas for a particular project because they both have different experiences. The program will help both groups of students because they can have things like competitions, and they can also learn from each other and achieve the goals they have planned for that class, particularly if they work as a team.\n\nFirstly, such a program will benefit both older and younger students because they can have things such as competitions. Both groups will try their best and put in much effort because either they want to be ahead of each other, or they want to succeed in that program. They make sure that they value their time and make their books their 'best friend.'\n\nThere is a quote that states, 'Education is the key to success.'\n\nWhen students try to compete with others, they study harder to attain their dreams and also to make people believe in them. Such competitions make students study harder and also make them successful.\n\nSecondly, such a program will benefit both students because 'they can both learn from each other.'\n\nFor instance, if I have been paired with someone who is three years older than me to do an assignment, it makes it easier for us to complete the assignment. It is because we are both from different backgrounds and also raised and trained by different people. That alone will help us learn from each other because we will not want to work with each other without getting to know ourselves. When we realize we are from different places, we will be interested in knowing a little bit about each other's background and how we do our things. Learning from each other benefits both of us, especially when we know about our likes and dislikes.\n\nLastly, both students benefit from such a program because they can achieve the goals they have planned for that class, particularly if they work as a team. There is a quote I remember that says, 'Two heads are better than one.' For example, if one person can carry twenty out of fifty books, then two people will be able to carry all fifty books or even more. The students have goals and dreams they want to acquire in life. However, since they both have the same purpose, they will decide to work together to help each other reach their goals.\n\nConclusively, both students will benefit from such a program because they can compete against each other and put in much effort to reach their dreams, to also learn about each other, and to help each other strive for their goals. The effects of a program that helps both older and younger students to pair up and help each other have been listed in the essay above. Students can be assisted by people who are older, younger, or even of a different race or gender.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

Parents always tell us the good and the bad in our lives and always want the best for us in school and out of school. They will also make sure that we are doing well in school, will help us make the right decisions in our lives, and to never give up. They will encourage you to keep trying harder so you can reach and accomplish your goals for the future and to be someone you want to be.\n\nSecond, our character traits are influenced by our society because the society surrounding us tells us what is happening around the world, and they will always be there to help you with what you need and to make you feel you are important to them in their lives. They will also make sure that you move forward in your life and tell you that you are a good person. Society helps you navigate the world and have good experiences in your life.\n\nThird, our character traits are influenced by our peers because our peers sometimes encourage us to do things we are not supposed to do. Peers influence you by leading you in the wrong direction in your life and they also entice you to make bad decisions that you have never made before. They will tell you to do what they want you to do. Peers can also make you feel bad and take you where they go, making you partake in bad decisions in life. Peers will not always help you in life; they may lead you the wrong way instead of the right way.\n\nIn conclusion, John Lubbock wrote that our character will be what we ourselves choose to be.

I remember that the school year was almost over, and my English teacher hadn't assigned any books to read. The hard part was when summer ended and we started school again; I didn't remember any English at all. For the following summer, my counselor spoke to my new English teacher and told her that I needed to read a lot in English. My counselor also asked my English teacher to give me books to read during the next summer, and she did. That helped me a lot to improve my second language skills; I didn't forget anything at all. Some people say that summer projects should not be designed by teachers because students will not have time to learn things that they want to learn by themselves. Actually, summer projects should be designed by teachers because they will create specific projects to help students prepare for the next school years, and students will not forget what they learned before because they will continue learning.\n\nMany people say that summer projects should not be designed by teachers because if teachers design projects for students, the students will not have the opportunity to design projects for things they want to learn. For example, students get very stressed during the school year and they want to do something fun like watching TV, playing video games, and going out with their family. However, students can do all that they want to do when teachers design projects for them. Students have the whole day, so they can do the projects that teachers assign them and still have fun.\n\nThe first reason teachers should design summer projects is that it will help students prepare for the next school year. Teachers know what students will need to know and how difficult the class is going to be if the student is not prepared for the next year. For example, some students are very bad at math and they don't get any projects designed by teachers during the summer. When the student is back to school and he gets a higher math class, he will have a struggle because the teacher didn't assign any project for the student during the summer. Also, teachers should design projects for students because students don't know about the new classes that they will take. It's hard for students to create their own projects to learn.\n\nThe second reason is that teachers should design projects for students because that will help students not forget what they learned the year before. If teachers design projects, it will help students to review what they learned and not forget a lot because students will continue learning. Some students are very far away from home because they are on vacation, but they can do everything from where they are. The projects that teachers design may be on computers, and students can take 10 to 15 minutes to work on projects, so they are learning and having fun during the summer. Teachers' designed projects will help students to continue learning during summer, which can make it easier for students the next year.\n\nIn conclusion, teachers should design summer projects for students because that will help students prepare for the next school year. Students can't design summer projects because they don't know how hard the class is going to be. Also, students will continue learning as they're doing the projects that the teachers design for them. I think if teachers don't assign summer projects for students, they will not study. Teachers know what the students need, and the summer projects will help students over the summer. That's why I think teachers should design students' projects.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

This is a question many students ask, and today I'm going to explain why these activities are important. Extracurricular activities are indeed significant, and they offer numerous benefits. Students should engage in extracurricular activities because they provide opportunities to exercise, learn new things, and meet new people.\n\nStudents get to exercise. Playing a sport requires physical activity. When someone participates in sports, they must exercise regularly and maintain a healthy diet to enhance their performance. This can lead to increased strength. Being part of a sports team often involves strength training, which can help students become stronger and lead healthier lives. You will likely feel more relaxed and healthy after you start playing a sport. For these reasons, I believe students should participate in extracurricular activities.\n\nYou get to learn new things. You could choose an activity that is unfamiliar to you. Participating in a new activity can help you discover whether you enjoy it. Finding an activity that you like can make you more proficient at it. Your knowledge base can expand. Learning new things can lead to a broader understanding of the world. Because of all these reasons, I think students should engage in extracurricular activities to broaden their horizons.\n\nI understand that sometimes students are reluctant to participate in extracurricular activities. It can be challenging. However, try something that you think you might enjoy. You can meet new people. You will have the chance to make new friends who share the same interests and activities. This is why I believe students should be involved in extracurricular activities.\n\nIt is beneficial for students to participate in an extracurricular activity as it helps them learn new things. Students should take part in extracurricular activities because they can get fit, explore new interests, and forge new friendships. Because of all these benefits, I strongly support the idea that students should participate in extracurricular activities.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

I believe that students should identify a career choice by the time they are in their freshman year. Choosing a career early helps you to focus on schoolwork and on your future.\n\nFirst, students should choose a career that benefits them. For example, they should choose a career that pays well and that makes them happy. The courses they need to accomplish their goals will be provided by the school. These courses can be hard at times, but never give up. Giving up will not help you reach your goals in the future.\n\nNext, schools should provide courses for the students' career choices. These choices can range from high-paying careers to low-paying careers. For example, a doctor is a high-paying career choice for students, so schools should have the resources and courses for becoming a doctor. Schools should give opportunities for students to win scholarship money for college. It can help pay for their college and pursue his or her career after high school.\n\nHowever, students might want to change their career choice after starting their courses. Schools may not have the courses or resources for some career choices. For instance, some schools do not have enough resources and courses for becoming a professor. Sometimes they even don't have enough teachers to teach the course. These are some of the disadvantages of having students pick their courses by the time they enter high school.\n\nAfter starting your career choice, you can change it after one year of experience. Some schools may not have the courses, but you can transfer to the ones that do have the courses and the resources you need. You can take online classes if there isn't a teacher to teach your career choice.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that students should identify a career choice by the time they are in their freshman year. Choosing a career early helps you to focus on schoolwork and on your future. Giving up should not be an option because giving up will not help you accomplish your goals. These are some of the amazing reasons to think about your future and to choose a career by the time you enter high school.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

Some might say that having some rest is good, but too much rest is not beneficial all the time. The phrase 'being active' has different meanings for different types of people. For me, I define it as studying, doing my homework, or even completing my chores, but for some people, it might involve doing their jobs, researching, or even helping out others.\n\nBeing active has changed as time has changed. Long before technology, many people worked actively; they didn't have social media, phones, computers, or even emails. They did everything by hand. But nowadays, almost everyone sits at home and lets technology take control. This has both bad and good effects, but the bad side has the majority effect. These adverse effects have brought health problems like obesity, diabetes, and so on. Being active can also mean working out.\n\nI believe if someone works actively towards achieving their goals, they can accomplish anything they want (if it is realistic, of course). We can see some famous scientists like Albert Einstein, Stephen Hawking, and Thomas Edison who worked day and night to prove something for society, and I believe these people changed the way we are living right now.\n\nHaving said all this, I am such a lazy person that completely agrees with what Thomas Jefferson wrote. So, in conclusion, please don't be lazy all the time. Think about your future, your health, and the things that you can accomplish. So get up and be active.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

For example, students often arrive late to class because they are hanging out with their friends in the halls and paying less attention to their timely schedule at school. If a student arrives late to class, they have missed part of what they are supposed to learn for the day and distract others from their learning.\n\nAnother reason why students could benefit from being homeschooled is that there would be no attendance policy, and they could learn things faster. This is true because there are always those students who arrive at school or class late and have already missed out on half of the lesson because they couldn't get themselves up in the morning to get to school. Also, walking into class late not only ruins your learning time but also distracts others who are trying to learn. If you are homeschooled, you are also learning things faster because you don't have anybody holding you back from your learning time, and you get to move at a faster pace than others. For example, if some students cannot figure out how to complete a lesson, it just makes it slower for the class because everyone has to understand the subject in order to move on to the next portion of the lesson.\n\nHowever, there are reasons why I do not think students would benefit from being schooled at home. One reason is that the amount of learning time set up at home would be different than at school; for example, students might get too comfortable at home and think they can get up from bed at whatever time they please. Another example of why a student would not benefit from being schooled at home is that the homeschool student might be distracted by their surroundings. Since the student is very familiar with their environment at home, it would be very hard to pay attention and listen to what they are learning because they are distracted by their familiar surroundings.\n\nIn conclusion, these are all the reasons and examples as to why I think students should benefit from and be allowed to be homeschooled.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.\n\nSecondly, If you are honest \"all the time\" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher. By the wrong person you talk to, you might accidentally start a riot.\n\nLastly, you should be careful on how honest you are to people, because you don't know whether they are going through some stuff you are pointing out to them. Being truthful to someone and saying everything to them might make them upset on how you view stuff in the world also. Honesty is like an opinion that may cause someone that went through something upset them drastically. This is why I disagree that honesty is the best policy. From the situation you are in say respectful stuff towards the person. It might make you a better person if you are not saying negative things towards a person too.\n\nIn conclusion, I disagree with \"Honesty is the best policy\" by the situation you are in with the person and what they are going through. May cause them to dislike themselves in a way you wouldn't know.\"\n\nExample essay 2 of score \"3.0\":\n\"CURFEWS SAVE TEENAGERS\n\nBy Generic_Name\n\nCurfews are a great way to keep teenagers safe and out of trouble.\n\nTeen teenagers who spend too much time on the streets are more likely to get in drugs, curfews will prevent teenagers from spending too much time in the streets.

But when we have confidence in ourselves and try, and even if we fall but stand up again and try, we achieve what we want.\n\nIn life, sometimes we have to take risks; like, for example, to love, to help, to give a smile to the person that is next to you, to not go in the same direction as everyone else, to be different than the others, to be yourself.\n\nBecause if we are afraid and we don't take risks, we won't be happy, we won't live happily. We will feel like slaves to everyone else, to the society that tells you every single second of your life that if you do the same thing as them, you will feel complete in your life. And many people have followed the instructions of society and haven't felt complete or that they have done what they want in life. They have desired to die because they don't feel there is any reason to live; they often feel confused.\n\nI found myself when I met someone transcendental, with God, and from that day to this, I have been living happily. And when there is a problem confronted, I still feel happy and relaxed. I have seen other people meet with Him and completely change their lives. He is the way, the truth, and the life. Don't be scared to meet with Him.\"\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

However, sometimes the teachers need to show us children more respect because we deserve it. Just because the teachers are older than us doesn't mean they should treat us differently; no one is perfect. Everyone in life has ups and downs, so never judge a book by its cover because you never know what someone is going through in life.

In the future, I would like to become a track star because track is what I love, and it pays a lot of money as well. But track is so hard because it takes everything out of your body. Running track will make you want to give up on life, make you feel like you are less than others, and make you so angry that if someone says you are not good, you might want to lash out. But the best part about track is when you win races at your track meets; it will put a big smile on your face and let you say in your head, 'Yes, this is what I work so hard for.' Track can lead to sleepless nights because your legs are so cramped you can't even sleep; you just have to stay up all night, cry, and ask God why He is doing this to you. But if you really want something in life, all you have to do is work hard because one day all the hard work is going to pay off, and best believe it is going to pay off because God has our back, and He always will.

However, I believe that giving examples is not the only way that we, as humans, can learn from. Because as humans, we have many special abilities for learning, we can learn and influence ourselves based on what happens in our lives\u2014all the good moments and the bad moments that we go through. For example, being caught stealing or breaking into private property puts our lives in a bad situation. We can go to jail, and from being in jail, we can influence ourselves to become a better person.\n\nSchools and teachers should organize more tours for students and take them to the saddest and poorest parts of the cities where people sell drugs, where there is a lot of crime, the streets are full of trash, and people are living on the streets. This is to show them and, at the same time, encourage them that if they don't apply themselves in school, they could end up like these poor people. Students will learn and change their minds and take school more seriously because, as humans, we have the power to control our minds and change the way we think. When students see these poor people living in extremely bad conditions and surrounded by all types of crimes, they understand that their lives could end at any moment because there is no police protection when they are being attacked. These tours may be a good way to influence students to study and prepare for their future with a wealthy life.\n\nI believe people can influence their lives in many ways, like being in prison for a minor charge. Prison is a good way and a good place to influence and encourage people to change their lives for the better and help them make good decisions when they are free again for a second chance in the real world. While being in prison, people can learn so much because if they did not receive any kind of school teaching, I believe many prisons allow prisoners to take some school for those who are trying to remake their lives. When they are free, prisoners will be more prepared and ready to not waste the second chance of being free. Prison can influence people not to commit crimes again because people will know that being in prison is not the best and smartest way to spend our lives on earth. That's why prison is a good place to influence people.\n\nA good way to influence people is by creating programs or activities with people who don't have legs or some of them arms, but they still can do a lot of things and a lot of them don't depend on others to have a life. This will influence people who have a complete body. We complain about our bodies; it's important to teach people that no matter if we are missing an arm or a leg, we can still have a normal life. Sometimes we say that we cannot find a job or that we cannot do certain types of jobs, when people who don't have a complete body can find jobs. These programs can influence people to stop complaining because we have everything, while people who don't have legs can still do everything without complaining.\n\nExamples of life behavior are not the only way that can influence people. There are many ways that can change a person's life, like being charged with crimes of stealing, assaulting someone, or entering private property, and being sentenced for a couple of years in prison. It can also encourage their lives from others who don't have a complete body because they were born without a leg or an arm. That's why I believe that examples of life behavior can be a good way to influence people, but there can be more ways to make people change their lives and make better decisions.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

However, keep some things to yourself if you think it's not positive to say to another. Second, It might make the person feel bad if you do say something harsh to them. Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times. Sometimes you have to say what's right in order to not hurt someones feelings from what you said. For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return. Secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later. They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.\n\nSecondly, If you are honest \"all the time\" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher. By the wrong person you talk to, you might accidentally start a riot.\n\nLastly, you should be careful on how honest you are to people, because you don't know whether they are going through some stuff you are pointing out to them. Being truthful to someone and saying everything to them might make them upset on how you view stuff in the world also. Honesty is like an opinion that may cause someone that went through something upset them drastically. This is why I disagree that honesty is the best policy. From the situation you are in say respectful stuff towards the person. It might make you a better person if you are not saying negative things towards a person too.\n\nIn conclusion, I disagree with \"Honesty is the best policy\" by the situation you are in with the person and what they are going through. May cause them to dislike themselves in a way you wouldn't know.\"\n\nExample essay 2 of score \"3.0\":\n\"CURFEWS SAVE TEENAGERS\n\nBy Generic_Name\n\nCurfews are a great way to keep teenagers safe and out of trouble.\n\nTeen teenagers who spend too much time on the streets are more likely to get in drugs, curfews will prevent teenagers from spending too much time in the streets. Teenagers offended tend to drive at high speeds at night because the might be drunk, it will prevent then to not get influence by bad people, if this law is approved it will really help keep teenagers safe.\n\nTo begin with, in streets at night there are lot bad people, teenagers are expose to a lot of dangers, when they are in the streets at night curfews can prevent this to happen. Teenagers could be kidnapped or raped when they are in the streets at night and some cases they can be forced to do drugs or join gangs, if they dont do this things they might be beaten to death until they do it.\n\nSecond reason, There are teenagers at night who tempt to drive at high speeds when they are drunk. This should not be allow because, it can end in car crash, teenagers don't have a lot of experience driving at night. For example, I had a friend who always likes to drive when hi was drunk at hing speeds in the highways at night, One night he had car accident because he was driving drunk and at a high speed he is dead now.\n\nThirdly, curfew can prevent teenagers from doing things that they are not supposed to do.

I believe that students should work in groups because studies say that working in a group can help bring more ideas in. I think groups of students can get more work done in an amount of time.\n\nA few years ago, I was in an English class, and the teacher would ask the class how they would like to work. Some students raised their hands to work alone, while others preferred groups. I chose to work alone, and while I was working, I was struggling. I was not getting any clue on what I was supposed to do, and other students who were working in groups were done in the right amount of time.\n\nTeachers should make students work in groups because it helps students brainstorm with each other's ideas. However, some students prefer to work alone because they think working in a group can cause distractions among peers. It is understandable if they want to work alone, but the point is, in a group of students, you can gather information and bring it to one conclusion. It is very common for a group of students to have side conversations; that's why we have administrators if any student is causing problems in class. So, I believe students should work in groups because with each other, they can come up with one big topic with many pieces of information and many ideas. Moreover, it is a better way to learn because studies show that high school students are more open when they are talking with their peers. Students get together and work.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

You go inside and feel bored. Once more, your family is busy doing things, and you are at home with nothing to do. This has happened to many people who don't do any after-school activities. I think all students should do at least one after-school activity. It helps them meet new friends, find a hobby they love, and gives them something to do. \n\nIf you want to make new friends, after-school activities are a good choice. It's easier to become friends with people who like the same things as you. You will find it easy to talk to someone in the same club because you both like the club's topic. Doing the same thing and being in the same place makes you want to talk to others. At swim practice, I talk to the people swimming with me because we are together for a long time. This is how I made new friends outside of school. I also hang out with them outside of swimming. Making new friends is just one good thing about after-school activities, but there are more. \n\nIt's hard to find out what you love if you don't try new things. You might find out you love robots when you join a robotics club. If you find something you love doing, your life will be more fun and full. It can also help you know what job you want in the future. People like to work in jobs that match their interests. So, knowing what you love early on makes it easy to choose a job. My dad signed me up for theatre, and I was nervous at first. I am shy and didn't think I'd like being on stage. But I loved it and went to theatre camp for three more years. I also started piano lessons thinking it would be boring. But I was good at it and liked making music for my family and friends to enjoy. After-school activities help you find what you love and give you things to do. \n\nDoing an after-school activity is a good way to spend your time. Many students waste time online or watching TV because they're bored. It's bad to find out your child watched TV for hours. An activity gives them something to think about or do. When I'm not busy, I play the piano. It's a good way to spend extra time, and I like it. When I'm not at swim practice, I feel like I have too much time. But I have other activities like math team or piano lessons. These stop me from feeling very bored. These are a few reasons why students should do after-school activities. They have many benefits. \n\nIn the end, students should do after-school activities. They are a good use of time, help you find what you love, and let you make new friends. Every student should pick one activity because of the many good things it brings. Suddenly, you remember today was the first day of track practice. You quickly call a friend to pick you up and take you back to school. When they get there, you jump into their car and wait to get back to school. Once there, you rush to the track. You're lucky because the coach just started with stretches. You put down your bag and stretch with the team. During practice, you laugh with a new friend you met because you joined the track team.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

Some may think it's okay to do nothing and wait for chances to come later. But I think that if we are active, we will find more chances. Being active makes us better at things, keeps us healthy, and leads to a world full of chances and wins.\n\nTaking action helps us keep going. For instance, it makes us better at what we do. By taking action, we get better or learn new things. This puts us ahead of those who do nothing. It also lets us earn money by doing what we like. That's why getting better and learning new things is key in life.\n\nBeing active is very important for everyone. It also matters for our health. Moving and exercising are good for us. If we don't move, we might get sick, even with serious illnesses like cancer. This is another reason why I think taking action matters so much.\n\nWorking on something can lead to a successful life. Being active helps us learn new things. These things can open many doors, making it easier to win in life. This might be the main reason to keep working on something.\n\nIn the end, I think that pushing ourselves can be tough, but the rewards are big enough to keep us going. Health, new chances, and getting better are big parts of life. We can choose to be active or not. The outcomes are obvious.

This can happen when they find out about bad or good things in their lives. I don't agree that our views are always different. Often, our views come from what other people do. You might think something is terrible, but if you look closer, you might see it's not that bad. So, your view can change. Views can change, this is true. We can change our views when we see something good or bad. We might think what we see is true, but we don't always know what's really happening. Our first view of someone isn't always right because we don't know them well. We shouldn't say bad things about them. We should get to know them first. Then we can judge them right. Bad views can hurt people. For example, if someone has health problems and hears very bad news, they can get very sad or not want to do anything. We also have great views sometimes, like when we start a new job. At first, everything seems great. But this can change. Maybe you start having problems with the people you work with. Your view of them can change. It's normal for our views of things or friends to change over time. At the start of the year, I had a friend I liked a lot. She was my best friend. But she changed. She was mean to me and did bad things. So, my view of her changed. I don't know if others feel this way. I change my views fast when I see things I don't like.

Even though some say students should use their cell phones for school research, in truth, cell phones distract because students use them to play games and watch shows like Netflix and YouTube.\n\nSome people say students should use cellphones in school for learning. They say students need them for missed work or emergencies. I think students misuse their cell phones when they can use them in class.\n\nStudents are losing focus in school because of games. Social media says a game called Fortnite is popular worldwide. Kids are hooked on playing Fortnite and other games. They lose focus when bored. Teachers are upset when they try to teach, but a student is not paying attention because they are gaming on their phones. Students ignore their work and don't do homework because they are busy with games or other fun things. Some kids stay up until 3 AM playing games online. They are too tired in school and fall asleep in class. Many think games like Fortnite grab these students' attention.\n\nWhat's next on the show? What's new online today? Netflix and YouTube are big distractions for some students. They can't wait to see the next part of a show on Netflix or a new video from a YouTuber. Teachers say kids hide to watch stuff during class. They don't pay attention to what's happening around them when watching a show.

It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing.' This makes us ask: do we do more if we are always busy, or is there a good reason to do nothing sometimes? Many people think that doing nothing sometimes is good because it lets our brains rest. Without rest, we could pass out from being too tired, and our brains wouldn't work well. \n\nOne reason people think doing nothing is good is that it lets our brain rest. For example, after a hard day at work, you might want to just relax at home. This rest helps your brain recover and think better. You'll go back to work feeling fresh and ready for a new day. Also, when I was in 10th grade, I was very stressed about not moving up to the next grade. After I took a day off from school work, I found out I could get extra help after school. This showed me that doing nothing sometimes is helpful. \n\nAnother reason doing nothing is important is that without rest, you could pass out from being too tired, and your brain wouldn't work well. There are cases where people have passed out because they worked too hard and didn't sleep enough. If you don't rest your brain, it won't work its best. It's a fact that 95% of people who pass out do so because they are too tired. \n\nSo, this is why you should rest and take breaks to relax sometimes. \n\nSome might say that you do more by always working, like learning more. But it's a fact that people pass out from not sleeping enough because of work or school. Also, you shouldn't risk your health just to learn more. \n\nIn conclusion, doing nothing is very important for your mental health. It lets you rest. Without enough rest, you could pass out from being too tired, and your brain wouldn't work well. This is why doing nothing sometimes is important in life.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher.

I say this because these things can harm your lungs. You might have trouble breathing and need an oxygen tank. If you keep using them, you could get hooked and not stop for your whole life. Also, you could make your friends want to try them, and they could get hooked too. My second tip is to stay out of trouble. If you get into trouble a lot, you might get six broken pillars. Then you have to meet with your parents and teachers. If you get six broken pillars, you can't eat lunch with your friends. You have to sit alone, which isn't fun. You also want to avoid the Behavioral Intervention Program (BIP). BIP is a place you go if you've been bad. Third, don't do silly things like running in the halls, pretend fighting, or being rude to a teacher. These are dumb ways to get in trouble. You could also be late to class. If you're late, you get a broken pillar unless you have a note or a good reason. Fourth, join school sports like basketball, track, soccer, or volleyball. Playing sports is good for your muscles. Also, work hard to keep your grades up. If they drop, you can't join in on fun events. And if you're in trouble, you could be kicked off the team. In the end, it's best to avoid trouble. Your parents might get mad and stop you from doing things you like. Work on getting good grades so you can do well in life. You might get a better job, house, or car.

At home, you might focus better. But it might be easier to cheat by looking up answers on Google or from others. I'm not sure how online classes or video calls for school work exactly. \n\nMany students take classes online or through video calls because they are close to finishing school. They might only need one or two more classes to graduate. But not all schools have this option, only some high schools do. Our parents work and want us to look after our younger brothers and sisters. Studying from home is helpful because we don't have to go to school. We can also sleep in if our classes start later. My older sister is doing her NOVA classes online. She finds it easier because she works in the morning and studies at night. She only has classes on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.

More schools should have this three-year option because it helps students remember their lessons better.\n\nThe main reason the three-year option is good is that it saves time. High school students need to know how to use their time well to succeed. The three-year plan helps students not waste time. They can finish high school faster and start college or a job a year sooner.\n\nStudents in the three-year plan also remember what they learn better. They don't have a long break like summer vacation. Their classes go one after the other. This means they don't forget things easily. Teachers also don't have to spend as much time going over old lessons.\n\nBut the three-year plan isn't perfect. Students who go to school for four years have more time to save money for college.\n\nIn the end, the three-year plan is better than the four-year plan.

Some people think curfews will help teenagers stay out of trouble for these reasons. But others feel that curfews are not fair because they stop young people from seeing what the world is like at night, going to movies, and having fun as teenagers. I believe curfews will help teenagers stay safe by stopping late-night parties, outdoor play at night, and visits to friends' houses after dark.\n\nFirst, curfews will help teenagers stay safe by stopping late-night parties. These parties can lead to trouble; teenagers might smoke or drink too much. If they do, they could make unsafe choices like driving drunk, which could cause car accidents or get them chased by the police. This is why curfews are important.\n\nNext, curfews will help teenagers stay safe by stopping them from playing outside at night. When teenagers are out late, they might make bad choices and do unsafe things. For example, when I was in Liberia, we used to play outside at night. One night, a boy threw a rock into the air, and it hit a girl on the head because it was too dark to see it coming. She got hurt. This shows why it's not safe to be outside at night. Curfews can prevent these kinds of accidents.\n\nHowever, not everyone thinks curfews are good. Some people say curfews are not fair to young people. They think teenagers should be able to explore the night, go to after-parties, and have fun. But I think curfews are helpful. Going to a friend's house at night can lead to trouble. Teenagers often don't make the best choices, so a curfew can guide them.\n\nIn conclusion, curfews can help teenagers stay out of trouble. They stop late-night parties and visits to friends' houses after dark. Some people might not agree. They think curfews are not fair to young people. But when teenagers go out at night, they can do unsafe things like drinking too much. Curfews can help prevent this.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

We all share some things, like hair color, skin tone, or eye color. But each person is unique. Being true to who you are can be hard but it's a big achievement today. Being yourself is great because people and the world often try to change you. It's also how we learn who we are and what we want to do with our lives. If you stay true to yourself, the world supports you, and you can make a difference. This is why I think Emerson was right when he said being yourself is the greatest thing you can do. People can be good or bad for us. They can make us do things if we let them control our lives. For example, in the US, there are many shootings at schools and stores. Often, more than one person does them. The main person gets more jail time. But both should be responsible. This shows we need to be careful about our friends and family. They can lead us to do bad things. If we do what they want, we lose ourselves. We need to know who we are and what we want in life. It's hard to know everything about yourself. Sometimes I do things I didn't expect. I think about the saying, 'If you don't know yourself, how can you know others?' We copy what we see in the world, like violence and crime. But if we have a goal, like becoming a doctor, we focus on that. We ignore the world's problems and work on our goal. When you know who you are, the world helps you, and you make a difference. Having a positive personality and a good heart helps. If you know yourself and your goals, the world supports you. This helps you and others succeed. Take Malala, for example. She fought her government for the right to go to school. Women in her country couldn't study. Malala believed in herself and her goal. She succeeded, and now women can get an education there. Malala shows that being yourself is a big achievement. In the end, the world and people can be obstacles. We need to understand ourselves and others. Having a goal helps us focus and ignore world problems. Then we can find out who we are. When we believe in ourselves and know our goals, things change. The world supports us, and we can help make it better. I believe that being true to yourself, despite the world's pressure, is the greatest thing you can do.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

We do more because we start to understand what we are doing and how to do it. Our minds start to work, and when we do something we've done before, we know how to do it from experience. We also do it quicker. This way, we do more than just one thing. Thomas Jefferson once said, \"Determine never to be idle... it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing.\" This means we should keep busy to do more than we think we can because with hard work, we can do a lot.\n\nWe can do many things. We can build schools for poor people so they can learn. We can make parks for kids to play and for people to walk or run. We can help animals by making a National Park for them to live safely. We can use less natural resources to keep our environment clean and safe. We can do many things, but we are not doing enough. We just think about these things and never actually do them.\n\nSome people might say we do more when we are still because we think more. But they are wrong. What's the point of thinking if we don't do what we think about? It's good to think, but not good to keep ideas in your head. I think people who don't act don't do as much as those who are active.

But now, it has bad effects on our lives. People talk less with their family, friends, or others around them. It also hurts their body health and mind health. Technology makes people not focus and causes trouble. For example, when people use their phones to play games, watch videos, or text at school or work, they don't listen well. This makes it hard to talk to teachers or bosses. It can lead to online school or work, which stops people from meeting new people and learning about new chances in life. Technology makes people pick easy ways. For example, not many people use books to look up things, go shopping, eat out, or play board games with family or friends. They do these things on TV, computers, or phone apps instead. People prefer to stay home and get things the easy way. This is bad because they get lazy and miss chances to talk and share with family or people close to them. Technology hurts our body health and mind health. Some people have eye problems from using phones or watching TV a lot. Others have ear problems from listening to loud music with headphones for too long. These problems make it hard for people to talk because seeing and hearing are ways we talk to others. In the end, technology has bad effects on our lives. It changes how we talk, how we grow, and our body health.

But it's not good for schools. Some students can't handle being in school for ten hours, four days in a row. They might like a shorter week, but staying two extra hours each day is too much. They would be in school all day and only have time to sleep when they get home. Many students have jobs after school or look after their younger siblings. They would get too tired. Schools should not make the school day longer by two hours. Students need time for homework and fun activities. They also need to spend time with their families. If they are at school for ten hours, they won't have time for things like video games or sports. They won't have time for homework or enough sleep. If they sleep right after school, they might not sleep well at night. This could make them sick. Students need to rest and play after school. If they are too tired from a long school day, they won't be able to do their work or understand what they learn. They might fail their classes. They need time to study for tests and to rest their minds. So, schools should not make the school day ten hours long. Some students work after school to save money for college or to help their families. If school ends later, they might lose their jobs. This would be very hard for them. They would not have time for anything else. If they lose their jobs, they might stop trying to reach their dreams. They might have to work late and not have time for schoolwork. Schools should not make the school day longer because it's bad for students who work. Schools should also not make the school day longer because students need time with their families. If school ends later, they won't see their families much. They will be too tired to do anything but sleep. They might have a three-day weekend, but they will be too tired to enjoy it. They might get more homework, too. This could make them unhappy and not want to talk to anyone. Being with family helps students feel better. If they don't have family time, they will only think about school. So, schools should not make the school day longer. In the end, schools should not add two hours to the school day. Students need time for homework, sports, and family. The longer hours would hurt students who work after school.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

Take this example: if you break a jar of honey and tell your mom it was you, she will be upset because she has to clean it up. But if you find someone's credit card and return it, that's a good thing because it doesn't belong to you. I personally believe that being honest is very important. Lying is wrong, and sometimes you can even end up in jail for it. But when you're honest, you can get rewards. For instance, the police offer money for information when they're looking for someone. Some people think honesty is bad because it can hurt others. But honesty is useful in many ways. You need to be honest when you're getting a job, especially during the interview. Your honesty shapes who you are. If you're honest, you're seen as a good person. But if you lie, people might think you're not good. Being honest is better because then people can trust you, unlike those who lie.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

I think we pick our own character traits. It's all about our actions. This means we decide how to behave. Others judge us by our actions. Our choices can be good or bad. We pick our own choices and actions.\n\nOn March 7th, 1999, the Washington Post talked to people from a local school. They found that students who made good choices at school and home turned into better people. This showed that their choices and actions shaped their character. Students with good character became more successful later. They did better because they had good traits and a nice personality.\n\nThis is true for schools and jobs too. For instance, having a good character can help you get a job over someone with a bad character. I saw this when I went for a job interview. I dressed well and made a good first impression. My boss liked that. I worked hard by staying late and learning more. What I learned about having a good character is that making a good impression and working hard can make you better. I think everyone should work on being better by working on their character. I say this because it's been shown to be true. Doing good things makes you a better person. I think everyone should try harder with their character. When people make good choices, they might have a better future. This could help them get a good job because of their good actions.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe we pick our own character traits. I think everyone, including me, should work on improving their character. When people do this, everyone will have a better character.

As a leader, you must speak clearly and set a good example for your city, county, or state. When a leader is a good example, people live well together. They have good reasons to help each other. A community that sticks together is strong.\n\nThird, to get attention, you don't need to be perfect at speaking to inspire others. Not everyone can be powerful in a community. Some want to be a school principal or a country's president. Being a president or in charge of others is hard. It's tough to keep control and everyone's attention.\n\nIn conclusion, leaders of a country or school must give good reasons and talk clearly to people. They should show a good way so others can find better chances to improve.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

You might find out you like something or are good at it. For example, you can try new sports or practice them outside. Community parks are good because they are close to home. They let you try new things. State parks are popular with teens. They have carnivals with games and rides. You can go there with friends and family. This is better than being bored at home. Water parks are also fun, especially in the summer. There are many state parks to enjoy, like Kid's Choice. National parks are very exciting. But they can cost money, which some people don't have. I love going to Disney World. It has rides, a zoo, and shops. You can eat out with friends and family. Spending time with them can make you happy and change how you feel. Going out is not just about leaving your house. It can change how you live. It can be about the fun things you do and how much fun you want. It can help your health if you start hobbies. It can also help your mind. Sometimes you need to find something you like. Don't just stay at home. Have fun outside in parks.

What do they want to do later in life? Schools should work with companies because it helps students know what is best for them, like what they like doing, gives them chances to see the world, and helps them talk better with others.\n\nOne reason this is good for students is that they can find out what they like. If students can do internships, they can work with many different people. Working with people from other places teaches them to work together and deal with different situations. They can follow their interests and learn from the experience. Many students don't know what jobs they want in the future. An internship can help them decide. Often, they can't try out what they really like. Some students pick classes just because their friends do, even if they are not interested. This can lead to them leaving the class later when they realize it's not for them. This also makes extra work for school counselors who have to change the students' schedules, which can be hard. But an internship can make it clear what they like, stopping future problems.\n\nThe next reason is that students get many chances to see the world. It's not common for students to learn about the world by seeing it themselves. Many students want to do this, but not all can. Learning about other cultures and making new friends is very helpful. When they see the world, they might learn new languages, which can make it easier to get a job. In the United States, companies often look for students who can speak many languages because it helps the company work better. Students who speak more than one language usually find it easier to talk to others and feel they can reach their goals.\n\nThe last reason is that internships help students talk better. Often, students know a lot but are too shy to speak. They might feel unsure of themselves. Doing internships can make them more sure of themselves. By working and talking with others in an internship, they will get over their shyness and become more sure through practice.\n\nTalking well is very important in life; without it, students might not understand what's going on around them, which can hurt their learning. Having good talking skills is important both in school and outside. Talking well helps share ideas and makes students feel okay to speak up. As they talk more, they'll feel more sure and worry less about what others think.\n\nSome say that internships might not fit all students because they have other things to do like sports or jobs after school. But if schools make deals with different companies, it could give students a great chance to try out their interests, see the world, and become more sure and better at talking. This experience can show students they can reach their goals.\n\nIn the end, working with companies can make students more sure when making choices and help them stop being shy. It can also help them figure out what they want in life. These deals give students the chance to learn new things and languages, which would be hard without an internship. I think students should be able to do these internships to help them grow and get better.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

But if you have a good attitude, you'll see life differently. When you're nice, people trust you and want to be your friend. People with good attitudes also get better chances in life than those who are mean and not thankful.\n\nIf you want people to trust you, you have to be kind and caring. They will think, 'I like this person; they are nice.' You can make friends who believe you are trustworthy. When I was 11, my sister had a 2-year-old baby named Generic_Name. She came to take our mom to the doctor. They couldn't bring the baby because she would cry. My mom and sister trusted me to take care of her. It was just me, my niece, and my younger sister, who didn't help much. After 2 hours, they came back and said they could trust me.\n\nHaving a good, confident attitude can help you get better chances, like getting into college or a good job. They usually choose the person who is generous, kind, and confident. Once, my brother Generic_Name applied to college. He was confident when he sent his application online. Later, he got a letter saying, 'We want to meet you to see if we want you at our school.' My brother is very generous and confident. I was sure he would get in. And he did. Now he goes to Generic_School.\n\nThis means that good attitudes and a positive view of life can bring you trust from others and better chances.

However, keep some things to yourself if you think it's not positive to say to another. Second, It might make the person feel bad if you do say something harsh to them. Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times. Sometimes you have to say what's right in order to not hurt someones feelings from what you said. For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return. Secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later. They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.\n\nSecondly, If you are honest \"all the time\" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher. By the wrong person you talk to, you might accidentally start a riot.\n\nLastly, you should be careful on how honest you are to people, because you don't know whether they are going through some stuff you are pointing out to them. Being truthful to someone and saying everything to them might make them upset on how you view stuff in the world also. Honesty is like an opinion that may cause someone that went through something upset them drastically. This is why I disagree that honesty is the best policy.

If they don't try new things, they won't grow. They will stay the same, doing what they are good at. It's good to try new things to learn instead of just doing what you know. I think when people do different things, they learn new skills, improve, and go past their old limits. After you are good at one thing, you should learn another. This makes you better and helps you succeed in life. If you keep doing what you are good at, you miss the chance to learn new things that could make you better and give you more experiences in life.\n\nStudents often have the same classes they are good at. They could be learning new things to be better at everything. But they miss out on new experiences. Doing the same thing all the time can make you tired of it. You might feel like you missed out on learning different things. It might feel like you wasted time that you could have used to try new things.\n\nI agree with Emerson's idea. He tells people to try new things and not just focus on one thing. He says to move on after you are good at one thing, so you can grow and be successful. Emerson means that if you do what you are good at all the time, you won't grow.\n\nIn conclusion, people should do new things besides what they are good at. This helps them grow and learn, which leads to success. People won't get better by doing the same thing over and over. They should try new things and not stay in one place. Emerson's words remind us to move forward in life and try new things beyond what we are good at.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

You walk toward the voice and find yourself in the center of the mall. A girl is singing loudly and playing the guitar. Suddenly, you want to sing and play the guitar too. Everyone has a talent or skill they use often. Some talents people use every day include singing, playing the guitar, playing the piano, doing magic tricks, and making people laugh. Many people sing to earn money. I really like Shawn Mendes and how he sings. Playing the guitar is also something people do daily. Some play it while singing, and others just play. It sounds so nice that it relaxes me. Playing the piano is also fun. I enjoy calm piano music. Magicians are amazing. I can't figure out their tricks. When I watch a magician on TV, I'm always excited by the end. Comedians are great too. They make me laugh until I cry. Sometimes, I laugh so hard that my stomach hurts. Other skills people have include being good at math, keeping things tidy, playing sports, getting top grades, and doing makeup. Many people are good at math. It's tough, and I admire those who are great at it. I'm okay at math, but not the best. Staying organized is hard. Not everyone can do it. It needs time, responsibility, and patience. Sports are tough too. You need many skills and to be fit. For example, ice hockey is hard because you need to balance well on the ice. Getting top grades is hard. I've tried and I'm still trying. You have to believe in yourself and work hard. Doing makeup is like art on your face. It's not easy, and it looks beautiful. Everyone has a talent. There are many skilled people out there. Some are famous, and some are not. Many people share their talents online. But new creators often get overlooked because they don't have many views or followers. Social media is big, like Instagram and TikTok. Many share their talents there. My talent is baking. I bake a lot. When I come home from school, I bake what I want. I learned to bake from my dad. He made tasty cupcakes for his business. I asked to help, and he said yes. Now, I bake almost every day. It's fun and helps me relax. When I'm bored, I bake. I can't stop baking! I make cakes, cupcakes, and more. My dad loves it when I bake. He thinks everything I make will be great. That's my talent, baking.

Everyone needs help from these people today. They are very important to us. Without them, things could get out of hand. It's okay to need or ask for help. Some need it more than others. That's why schools have counselors. If you can't talk to a parent, you can talk to them. Or if you need legal help, you can get a lawyer. We need help all the time, even with small things. It's not smart to let people do whatever they want. They might think they don't need help or advice. But just following your own ideas isn't the best way. We can't predict what some people might think of doing. People should make their own choices. But getting advice can help. Sometimes you really need help from someone like your mom, a police officer, or a lawyer. It's hard to ask for help with big decisions. But if we just followed our ideas and instincts, the world would be very different. It might be worse. Some people don't care about their actions or who they hurt. If we all just did what we felt like, the world would be chaotic. We can't just follow our feelings. That could cause trouble. We should ask for help when we need it. Even asking for advice can help a lot. We are told what to do for a reason. We need help and rules. There are many people we can talk to. Asking for help is good. It can change how we think about small and big things. Some people think they don't need help or advice. But they might need it the most. For example, in a TV show, a girl took her life. She didn't ask for help. She seemed happy, but she wasn't. Not everyone thinks the same way. Getting help from a professional can give us answers we can't find ourselves. It's important to know we can't just do anything we want. There are consequences. Imagine if everyone did whatever they wanted without rules. What if a friend got hurt because they were too proud to ask for help? I wouldn't want to see that. In conclusion, I support getting help from experts. People should talk to someone about their problems, big or small. Those who don't want help are choosing to struggle alone. They live in their own world. I ask for advice every day. It helps me feel sure about my choices. I hope others do the same. Asking for advice is good. There are people ready to help. Many need to know it's okay to ask for help.

I have, especially from my mom. My mom keeps me safe. Once, my friend and I wanted to go to the store alone. We asked my mom if we could. But she said no because she was afraid we might be kidnapped. She almost got kidnapped once when she was out walking. So we stayed home. It's good to listen to what others have been through. This way, you don't make their mistakes. Sharing stories is helpful and matters a lot.\n\nThe first reason to listen to others is to avoid making their mistakes. You can choose better. For example, I had to get a flu shot. I didn't want it because I hate shots. But my mom told me she skipped her flu shot once and got sick. So I got the shot. It's not good to repeat others' mistakes. If someone warns you, it's smart to listen. People mess up and learn. But you don't have to mess up if you've been warned.\n\nThe second reason is to learn from others. They can show you how to do things right. Once, I was doing something wrong. My teacher helped me and taught me a better way. It's easier to do things right. If you can't do something, don't give up. Try again or ask for help. Learning is part of every day. Like when I didn't know how to bake a cake. My aunt showed me, and it turned out great. Learning is fun and exciting.\n\nThe third reason is to keep you from bad things. Bad things don't end well. My sister and I once hit our little sister because she hit us first. We thought it was okay. But we got in trouble and couldn't go swimming anymore. If you're not sure about doing something, ask someone. They can help you avoid trouble. Helping others stay out of trouble is good too. Bad choices don't lead to good things. It's best to work hard.\n\nIn the end, stay away from bad things and ask for advice. Learn from mistakes and find easier ways. Sharing stories helps us make better choices. Simple things can get better. Try new and better things every day. People become better when they get good advice. There's always someone with good advice to share.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

Some parents might worry about this, but others think it's a good way for kids to learn what they need. Some schools let kids choose to learn from home. This means they can study and do other things at the same time. They learn through the internet or video calls. Their teachers can watch them work. Even though some people think learning at home is not good, it can help students. They can get help for as long as they need, pay better attention without getting distracted, and learn what they need for life.\n\nOne good thing is that students can get help for as long as they need. If a student is having trouble with homework or studying for a test, they can ask a teacher for help. The teacher can show them what they did wrong and help them until they get it right. Students have a lot to do and can get stressed, but with help, they can take their time and do better in class.\n\nAnother good thing is that students can pay better attention without distractions. When they learn from home, they can be in a quiet room. They won't get distracted by other students. Teachers want their students to do well and understand the lessons so they can do better on tests.\n\nAlso, students will learn what they need for life. Some people might not see the point in what they learn in school, but teachers try to teach things that are useful. What some see as a distraction, others find helpful for helping family and friends. For some, this learning is a goal; for others, it's an achievement that helps in tough and good times.\n\nSome people think that students won't learn enough at home to do well in life. But the benefits are clear. Students can get the help they need, focus better, and learn important things for life. If schools let students choose to learn from home, it can help them do better and even help others who have trouble learning.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

This is because school activities can be dull, and only those who are more active like to stay later. They stay for sports or to learn more. People might find it fun if they tried, because staying after school isn't always bad. You can join your favorite club. I would play soccer, and others might see it's fun. Some stay for extra classes to improve their grades. Others might visit a club or the computer room because they think it's cool. The principal probably wants students to have fun instead of being bored at home. The principal might want them to enjoy themselves for a day, try new clubs, have fun, and meet new friends. This way, they don't always talk to the same people. Meeting new people is good for sharing what you love about your activities. But I also don't agree because some people don't like staying after school. It's not fun for them, so they go home. Some are too tired or need to help at home or look after siblings. Or they are just bored of the school and don't want to stay. Some say they'll stay but never do. Others promise to stay but then don't. Some don't want to be at school all the time; they come to learn and then go home. But others stay because they're bored at home and want to have fun at after-school activities.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

This can be good for the students too.\n\nThe second reason is that students can become better at talking to others. This can help them get jobs in the future because they feel more sure of themselves. Feeling sure of themselves can help them do better in all their classes.\n\nThe third reason is that schools can still be used like normal if they're okay. They are important for students. Some people say that learning from home can give students a more flexible schedule. But I think this could mess up their learning. This is especially true if they don't have Wi-Fi or a way to get to places like the library. This is why I don't support online classes.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

You can shape who you are, whether it's good or bad; it's up to you. This has its own rewards: you will discover what you love, be with the right people, and have no regrets in the end.\n\nYou will discover what you love. It's tough to find what you love, so start looking early. \"If you find something you love to do, you won't feel like you're working,\" Kobe Bryant said. To discover your love, you must be true to yourself. Many people don't find what they love. \"If you hate waking up to go to work, do something else. I was lucky to find what I love,\" he said. And if you pick a path just because your friends do, good luck. They may enjoy their work, but you might end up tired and unhappy. Everyone has their own space; yours may not look like mine, but you should enjoy what you do in your own space.\n\nFind role models and be one. Once you know what you love, it's easy to find role models or inspiration. My role models have changed, but my love for basketball stays strong. I liked basketball, but started to lose interest until I learned about Kobe Bryant. He made me love basketball again. Now, I love everything about it: the smell of the ball, the bounce sounds, and the feel of the ball. I learned a lot from Kobe's playing and his life outside the game. Now, I encourage kids to practice their skills.\n\nHaving regrets is terrible. If you chase someone else's dream or path without knowing it's wrong, you'll regret it when you stop working. You'll wish you had followed your own dreams and built your own identity. \"I have no regrets. I gave my all every day, so now that I'm retired, I have no regrets,\" Kobe Bryant said. Find what you love, be the best at it, and you'll have no regrets when the day ends.\n\nSome say you need role models to work hard; I think so too. But it's useless to seek role models if you don't know what you're looking for. Be yourself; you'll find what you love, get the role models you need, and end with no regrets. Go and create your own identity.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

Working towards a goal takes time. I know that reaching a goal is one of the best things we can do for ourselves. But, thinking and working on a goal every day is not the best plan. This is because we need time for ourselves, we need to rest our minds to keep going, and stress will come into our lives. First, to do well in this world, we need a plan with useful tasks and also time to do what we like. We need time to relax and enjoy life. Five years ago, my parents were too busy to take a day off and look after me during school. My dad worked at a building company from Monday to Saturday, and my mom was studying at college. We didn't have time to talk a lot and enjoy a day at home. We needed a break, but when Spring Break came, we stopped our usual things. My parents and I were happy because we had time for fun, and we stopped worrying about school and work. After the break, we were ready to start our usual things again. Taking a break helps us get ready to start again. Second, people can reach big goals, but it takes time. In middle school, my teacher let us take breaks to rest. My teacher said doing nothing gives us energy and helps us keep going with schoolwork. This helped me because I could focus better on school. Also, when my friends were tired, they asked for a break to clear their heads from worries. My friends and I needed time to meet new people. Meeting someone new makes me feel important to them. We need time not just for tasks and duties but also to rest and stop worrying about work to rest our minds and do well. Finally, stress can lead to feeling very down. Life can be hard. By focusing more on must-do tasks than on fun, you see the bad side of life. Some people might give up their goals by not having time for themselves. For example, when my older brother went to college, he needed money for school and things. He had to work at a restaurant to make money. When he started college and work, I saw he was very tired, stressed, and quiet. He felt he couldn't finish college. After a few days, he left college and his job because not having time for himself made him stop trying. He could have reached his goal, but too much work and stress made him very down. Breaks are as important as tasks in our lives. Many say that starting tasks early and fast gives you more chances to finish them. Also, some think breaks are not needed or good for reaching a goal; however, taking a break can change your life. Because you have time to rest your mind, you also have time for yourself, and stress doesn't hurt your health. Life is short; don't let tasks make you feel down. Take a break and start again.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

For example, excited and dedicated people have more chances to succeed than those who are not. People who are very successful have often failed a lot before. They learn from failure, so they don't repeat their mistakes. For instance, when we mess up, it's because we don't know something. We need to learn from it to make better choices next time. In the end, our failures in life are not important. We are more than our failures and just need to get past them. They don't stop us from reaching our dreams and being happy.

They think change is a good way to do well in life. I agree with the saying; I believe that being myself in a world that is always trying to make me something else is the greatest success. This is true because being yourself means you are honest, confident, and people like you for who you really are, not for someone you are pretending to be.\n\nFirst, I think being honest all the time means being yourself. Honesty lets you stay true to who you are. Being honest is good because people believe what you say. If you do something good, they might do the same. Some people lie to look better to others. This is bad because lies will always come back to hurt you. I think if people really enjoy being with you, they will forgive your mistakes. It's like when you meet someone new and tell them about yourself.\n\nSecond, being confident in who you are means being yourself. People think changing themselves can erase the past or change how they acted before. They think changing how they look can change how they treated others. But many change because they were hurt and don't want to remember bad times. Others are happy with who they are and don't want to change because they feel confident.\n\nLast, people will like you for being yourself and not for trying to be something else. People respond to you based on how you act. If you are real with others, they will trust you. People like those who are true to themselves and how they treat others. If you hide who you are, others might not believe you, even when you are honest. But if you are yourself and honest, they will trust you more.\n\nAs you can see, I agree with the saying because that's what I believe. I feel that being yourself in a world that tries to change you is a success. Often, people think they want to change for the better. Life can be tough, and you change because of it; it makes you stronger. I believe staying the same is a good way to be happy with what you did right before. That's why being yourself is a success.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

Sometimes we can't dress up for an event, or we don't know what the event is. Still, people expect us to dress right for different events. I learned this when I started my first job; I wore formal clothes.\n\nYou can change how people see you, and not just by how you dress. You should show your smarts and how well you work with others. That's part of who you are.\n\nYou should wear the right clothes for different times. For a job interview, you should dress up. People remember your first impression when they think of you. It's tough to not want to change for new chances later on. Many people don't agree because they think differently. It's hard to choose when people won't help you because they got a bad first impression of you. Everyone has their own views. I think your clothes show who you are and how you feel.\n\nMy experiences have taught me this. I dress right for school in the morning because you should be a good person, a good student. But if you dress right and make bad choices or say mean things, it ruins your first impression. Your first impression is like your 'picture'; it shows who you are. But you can change your 'picture' with what you do. You should show your true self. If you have a role model and want to be like them, that's okay. I want to be like my grandpa and my mom. He has strong views on life and work. My mom is kind and has lots of experience. She's always been good at her job and very responsible. That's a good 'picture' for people to remember.\n\nBeing smart is more than how you look. You can change. People do change, even if some think you can't change first impressions. Some people are selfish and judge you by your looks or where you're from. Everyone has their own culture and ways; some people like other cultures and ways. People judge a book by its cover. Being smart is key to getting ahead, but if your first impression was bad, that's not good. You have to keep going and try to make a better impression on others.\n\nIn conclusion, it's wrong to say that first impressions can't be changed. They can change. For example, when I started my job, I was nervous at the first meeting, but I wanted to make a good impression on my boss. I work in a restaurant, and I sometimes talk to customers. My first impression and how I talk are important for doing better with different people. Your impression makes people judge you, for good or bad. Impressions matter for many reasons. I don't think first impressions are fixed, and I believe people who think they can change them have more confidence and can change how others see them. Just be yourself.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

I believe this view on being unique because it pushes you to be bold enough to show your heart, who you are, and how you really feel without worrying about others' thoughts or words. Do what makes you happy without letting others get in the way or try to change you.\n\nStaying true to yourself in this world is hard because you face challenges every day that try to alter who you are. Take parents, for instance. Some parents push their kids to pick a job they don't like just because it's the job the parents wanted but couldn't have. They forget that everyone has the right to make their own choices, to pick a job that excites them, feels right, and makes them proud of what they've done.\n\nYou'll meet many people who'll try to change you. Like with friends, when one of your so-called 'friends' tries to get you to do bad things or make poor choices because they do them too. If your friends teach you to smoke or steal from stores and it feels wrong, don't do it just to fit in. Don't let others lead you down a bad path if you know you're not like that. Be yourself; true friends will get that you don't want to do wrong and will like you for who you are.\n\nIn the end, being true to yourself despite many challenges is the biggest thing you can do in life, and not many people manage it. Being yourself means you're at ease with who you are, and you follow your heart without anyone else butting in. Don't let challenges shake up your core and who you want to be. Share your thoughts, do what you enjoy, trust in yourself first, take pride in your identity, and be joyful in being you.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

I think that facing a problem is a chance for you to get up and try a different way. When you have a problem, you can learn from what you did wrong. You can also see what did not work and ask for help from someone who has done well, to find a better way to help you. You can also watch and think about what people who have done well before did. Learning from your mistakes by watching people who have done well is not bad. It's a chance to start over, knowing that the way you tried before did not work. You also know what to do differently before you try again. For example, you might have a hard project. You need to keep trying, even if you make mistakes, to really understand it. If you mess up in a relationship, it does not mean you have to end it. You can fix the problems, try to get better, and learn from what happened. At some point, you will face a hard time that makes you try over and over. This is a time to think and decide how to do better than before. When you have a problem, you should not worry by yourself; ask for help from someone who has had the same problem. Their advice can be very helpful. For example, scientists make mistakes but keep trying until they get good results. Math teachers may have hard questions, but they keep working on them until they get the right answer. We all have problems every day, but we do not give up. We keep going until we fix the problem, no matter how long it takes. When you have a problem, it's your chance to do well by asking for help and learning from your mistakes. Often, when students work on a project from their teachers, they may not be sure if they are doing it right. How can you know if you are on the right path if you have not asked the teacher or someone who has done well? I agree that a problem is a chance to do well because it lets you ask for help from friends or to learn from your mistakes and watch others. It's important to talk to a friend or someone you trust about your hard times and how they can help and make you feel better. By not making the same mistakes, you can learn and find answers to your problems.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

For example, if you're not sure your work is right, you've tried to fix it many times, and you still don't get it, talk about it with a friend from class. Look at how you both did the work and what you found out. See if you both think the same thing in the end. It's good to get ideas from more than one person. This helps you find mistakes and learn new ways to solve problems. It's always smart to ask for help. It helps you understand how different people think.\n\nGetting different opinions can help you make a better choice and see things from other points of view. It lets you think about ideas that you might not come up with on your own. When you get advice, you learn what other people think. This can help shape your own ideas. You can ask for advice in many situations. It could be when you're stuck on a problem, picking the best milk at the store, or choosing what to wear to school. For instance, if you're not sure about what you're wearing, you could ask a family member what they think about your outfit.\n\nIt's thought that more than 90% of people ask others for advice. This doesn't just make talking to each other better. It also lets people share ways to handle things. You can use these ways in different parts of life. They can help you deal with problems that you might not understand at first.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times. Sometimes you have to say what's right in order to not hurt someones feelings from what you said. For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return. Secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later. They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.\n\nSecondly, If you are honest \"all the time\" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher. By the wrong person you talk to, you might accidentally start a riot.\n\nLastly, you should be careful on how honest you are to people, because you don't know whether they are going through some stuff you are pointing out to them.

Honesty is like an opinion that may cause someone that went through something upset them drastically. This is why I disagree that honesty is the best policy.

They have the skills for the job. They know what school they need. They understand what the job is like.\n\nStill, some people don't like picking a job in high school. They might not want a job because their parents do it. I understand them. But some people must work in jobs they don't like. They need money to help their families.\n\nThese are my thoughts on this topic.

Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times. Sometimes you have to say what's right in order to not hurt someones feelings from what you said. For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return. Secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later. They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.\n\nSecondly, If you are honest \"all the time\" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher. By the wrong person you talk to, you might accidentally start a riot.\n\nLastly, you should be careful on how honest you are to people, because you don't know whether they are going through some stuff you are pointing out to them.

Teenagers could be kidnapped or raped when they are in the streets at night and some cases they can be forced to do drugs or join gangs, if they dont do this things they might be beaten to death until they do it.\n\nSecond reason, There are teenagers at night who tempt to drive at high speeds when they are drunk. This should not be allow because, it can end in car crash, teenagers don't have a lot of experience driving at night. For example, I had a friend who always likes to drive when hi was drunk at hing speeds in the highways at night, One night he had car accident because he was driving drunk and at a high speed he is dead now.\n\nThirdly, curfew can prevent teenagers from doing things that they are not supposed to do.

Learning online or through video calls can help students because it is easier for them to join classes. Even though there are good things about going to school, learning from home means students don't have to deal with bullies, being late because they don't have to travel, and not having food at school.\n\nGetting up early for school every day can be hard. Students have to shower, brush their teeth, some girls put on makeup, and then get their bags ready. Often, they feel too tired to get up, which can make them miss the bus. Then, they might have to stay home, wait for someone to drive them, or walk. Most students don't sleep enough, which makes it hard for them to pay attention in class. Being hungry can also make it harder to focus. When learning online, students can pick the best time for them and stay home, so they don't have to worry about how they look.\n\nLearning online means no classmates are around, which can be good. Without classmates, students can focus better because there's no noise or other things to disturb them. They can't be bullied, teased, or judged if they're not in a real classroom. Bullying can make some students feel very sad at school, whether it's about their clothes, looks, smell, or what they did before. This can make them not want to go to school. So, in online classes, students work by themselves, which can help them focus more on their studies.\n\nWhat's good about going to school in person? At school, students can talk to others and make friends. They can get extra help from teachers or friends. Since the student is not at home, parents can save money because the electricity bill will be less. Going to school lets students join sports or clubs that may help them decide what job they want, instead of staying at home all the time.\n\nIn the end, online classes can be good for students. It is the best way to learn for those who want to be safe from bullies, have no distractions from other students, always have food to help them stay focused, and be able to choose when to have classes.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

Some students get bored quickly, lose interest, and have less fun. They can't focus and there are many reasons they might want to quit a job and look for another. Some students know what they want, but others feel lost and stuck. That's why young students should not pick a job path. They still don't know what they want. Even if they think they do, they might not stick with it. They can change. Young students have their whole lives ahead. They are like babies, still learning to think, feel, and dream. They might expect things to happen one way, but life can be tough. It's not always easy to handle problems. They still think life is like a fairy tale.

Sometimes you have to say what's right in order to not hurt someones feelings from what you said. For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return. Secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later. They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.\n\nSecondly, If you are honest \"all the time\" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher. By the wrong person you talk to, you might accidentally start a riot.\n\nLastly, you should be careful on how honest you are to people, because you don't know whether they are going through some stuff you are pointing out to them. Being truthful to someone and saying everything to them might make them upset on how you view stuff in the world also. Honesty is like an opinion that may cause someone that went through something upset them drastically. This is why I disagree that honesty is the best policy. From the situation you are in say respectful stuff towards the person. It might make you a better person if you are not saying negative things towards a person too.\n\nIn conclusion, I disagree with \"Honesty is the best policy\" by the situation you are in with the person and what they are going through. May cause them to dislike themselves in a way you wouldn't know.\"\n\nExample essay 2 of score \"3.0\":\n\"CURFEWS SAVE TEENAGERS\n\nBy Generic_Name\n\nCurfews are a great way to keep teenagers safe and out of trouble.\n\nTeen teenagers who spend too much time on the streets are more likely to get in drugs, curfews will prevent teenagers from spending too much time in the streets.

They use other people's thoughts in schools, religion, and their communities. They take both bad and good thoughts and make new ones that fit what is right in their country or community.\n\nFirst, in schools, a big issue is immigration. People have two main views and follow two groups called Democrats and Republicans. Some support letting more people come into the country and fight for it. Others disagree, do not want more people coming in, and think it causes unfair treatment and racial issues.\n\nNext, in religion, people have different beliefs about God. Many countries, like Iran, have fights with other countries or with their own people. This happens when people disagree with the country's religion.\n\nLastly, in communities, there are issues with laws that some people don't agree with. In Venezuela, when the president changed the laws, people who agreed with him were fine. But those who didn't agree faced death, hunger, and trouble with the police.\n\nIn the end, people take or make up their own thoughts based on what's happening in their country or community. They need to deal with problems that affect schools, religion, and their community. And they need someone who really knows the problem to help them come to a good decision.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

Usually, community parks are places where everyone can go and spend time with their family. National parks have fun things for families and sometimes special things to do on holidays that you and your family can join in on.\n\nI think parks in our community, state, and country can have lots of fun things to do. A national park might let your kids or your whole family do things, including things on holidays. State parks might have things for families and could have events like a fishing contest or a boat-making contest to see if the boats can float. Community parks may have summer things to do, like a 'mud run,' where there are lots of things to try, including a race through mud.\n\nI believe parks are valuable because they have different things to do, but it depends on the park. A community park might have things to do, or it might just be a place to have a cookout, where you can take your kids to play, walk with your friends, or play sports like soccer or football. Community parks often have fun summer things for people looking for something to do.\n\nAnother reason is that parks offer different experiences. A community park is a place for fun and family time. A state park might have fun things for families and kids, and it could be a fun place to go. State parks might also have holiday things to do or just be a place for families to get together and find fun things to do. State parks often have cool things to do in the summer that friends, families, or kids can enjoy.\n\nMy last reason is that each park offers something special. A community park is for fun and family time. A state park may have things for kids and families, while a national park has many things for families to try. National parks might also have holiday things for kids and families. In the summer, national parks have lots of things that friends and families can enjoy, and they are big enough for everyone doing the things.\n\nIn conclusion, parks in our community, state, and country each have their own special things. While some may not have as many fun things, they all are places where people can go to have fun with their families. National parks, especially, are known for their many fun and interesting things that can be enjoyed with friends and family, including on holidays.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

It's amazing what we can do if we keep busy.\" This is what Thomas Jefferson said. He meant that being lazy won't help us reach our goals. We should always be busy and work hard towards them. It's surprising that the best way to get something done is to stay busy. Some think we do more when we're not busy because we can plan our goals better. But in truth, we do more when we're busy. This is because we have more time to work on our goals and reach them faster. We also don't waste time that we could use to work on our goals.\n\nSome say we do more when we're not busy because we can plan our goals. They think being still is good because it gives them time to think about what they want in life. They have their goals planned out. The New York Times says people who take breaks are often sure about what they want in life. They know what goals they want to reach. They also feel more driven and work harder on their goals.\n\nBut, we do more when we're busy. This is because we have more time to work on our goals and reach them faster. Being busy is the best way to reach our goals. A study from Generic School shows that all successful people were busy with their goals. They never stopped to wait for success to come. We must always be working. Our goals won't come easy. As we work on our goals, we will reach them faster.\n\nWe do more when we're busy because we don't waste time. When we work hard on our goals, we might think we need to stop and rest. But we shouldn't. That would waste time we could use to work more. My dad is a good example. When he was young and finished school, he wanted to be an Industrial Engineer. But he didn't go to college right away. He wanted to take a year off. That was a mistake. He didn't work during that year. He spent some of the money he saved for college. Now, he's not an Industrial Engineer. He didn't reach his goal because he wasted time he could have used to reach it.\n\nEven though some think being still is better for reaching goals, being busy is the best way. This is because we can reach our goals faster and we don't waste time. To sum up, being lazy is not the best way. The truth is, by staying busy, we can reach our goals and get many great things. Taking a break might feel good, but it's not as good as getting what you want in life. Doing things that show our hard work and commitment is better.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times.

For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return.

For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly.

But students should work on feeling good about what they do. This is important because being confident helps them learn better. Also, some people say that you need to achieve things to feel good about yourself. Without success, they think you can't be confident. Students should learn to face their fears to feel more sure of themselves. While some praise students no matter what, others think this praise can hurt learning because it makes standards lower. Many say that feeling good about yourself comes from success. We should work harder so students can become experts and feel good about themselves. Sometimes, students don't try to do well because they think it's not important to feel confident in things they're not good at. Life is tough, and feeling confident isn't always easy. That's why people should try hard things. Then, when tough times come, they'll know how to handle it. I've seen that life is tough because it always pushes us to do well. Life makes us deal with hard things. For example, looking for a job can be hard if you don't have experience or confidence. That's why people who teach you something difficult will show you how first, then let you try on your own. If students don't like doing the right thing, it's okay. We're trying to help them do well in life. Not everyone is ready for life's tough parts, but the main thing is to try. The best way to do well and feel confident is to work hard. I think students should try harder and not be scared or shy. Even if they're not giving their best, some say that lacking confidence is a common challenge. Other students thought about starting a club for students to join. It was a smart move to start this club. Students should do things to overcome their fear and become confident; they could join a club or talk to their parents. But if students don't try because they're scared, they should know we're doing this for a good reason, not to upset them or be mean. In the end, we should all try our best because it's very important. Then we can say we faced our fears and now we're more confident.

Schools have fun things to do for classes. Teens can make a lot of friends at school. Even though some schools have online classes, going to school is usually better. At home, students might not work hard, but at school, they can do fun things with friends.\n\nLearning at home isn't the best for a student. Most students have a phone or a device that can distract them from class or homework. Cheating can hurt their future because they won't learn what they need for big tests like the SOL and the SAT. They might not work hard. Online classes might not teach them important life lessons or have fun things to do.\n\nSchools offer more than online classes at home. At school, students can get help with questions right away, without having to search for answers. They can make friends and join in many activities. There is no cheating on tests and quizzes.\n\nOnline tests are not great for students; they might not be as interesting. Students don't have to get up as early as they do for school. Their online classes are shorter. The best thing is that they are always at home.\n\nStudents get more good things from being at school than from online classes at home. Online classes can make students not work hard and not do their homework. At school, students have friends and can do fun things.

Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times. Sometimes you have to say what's right in order to not hurt someones feelings from what you said. For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return. Secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later. They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.\n\nSecondly, If you are honest \"all the time\" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher.

I believe we should trust our own feelings, thoughts, and choices. We don't always need to get advice from experts to improve our lives. Everyone is different and special. Being independent means you can solve problems, think of new solutions, and always try to be positive and better. Some people say you should decide for yourself or get advice from experts if you're unsure about life. The most important thing is love from family, friends, and God. Live like you have forever, but pray like it's your last day. Be happy and do your best. Be unique and make a difference. For many, the best thought is to 'work to live, not live to work' because time with loved ones is important. Things are not as important as love. Make your own choices, but think first. Be smarter and remember we only have one life. Live it well and help others if you can.

Now, which one is nicer? Telling the truth can hurt a lot. Sometimes, people don't tell the truth to be a good friend or to support someone. Saying what you really think can help, but so can saying something that's not true. Lying can be useful in many cases. Take parents, for example. They can't always tell their kids the truth. If a child dresses up, a parent can't say they look bad. They must say the child looks like the character they're pretending to be. Also, when you go out with friends or other couples, you can't tell them they don't look good. You have to say nice things. Some people think telling the truth helps others improve or do better. Friends often want to know what you really think, and it can help them. Maybe their clothes don't match, or there's something off about their look. Telling the truth can stop them from feeling silly later. What if someone's shirt shows a cartoon character they like? You need to tell them before others notice. Take therapists as an example. They must tell the truth because that's their job. They give their patients the truth about what's wrong. Life has many times when you need to give your true opinion. Being honest can help people do better, and lying can save someone's feelings. In the end, both telling the truth and lying can help with feelings, problems, and finding answers. Which would you pick, honesty or not hurting someone's feelings?\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

At school, kids are told to chase their dreams and keep going. I like to draw. In my art class at school, I felt bad about my drawings compared to others. I wanted to quit art class. But my art teacher told me not to compare myself to others. She said to think about my progress and what I still want to do. In gym class, I couldn't run for more than five minutes. My teacher challenged me to run for ten minutes. It seemed too hard. But after walking one mile every day, I managed to do it. My teacher said there's no limit to what we can do if we try hard. Some people think small steps don't help much. But I believe every step towards our goals is important, no matter the size. Life is like a game.

Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times.

For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher.

For example, I skip breakfast before school because I'm in a hurry, or else I'll miss my bus. It's normal to see a student running late for the bus, and when I chat with others, they often say they're hungry. So, online classes could really help us. Also, some students want more credits to get a better degree. Online classes would make it easier for them. It could also help students who need to repeat a class to graduate. Friends sometimes tell me they have to take a class again, or they won't finish school. This is one more reason why online teaching is a smart idea. Students might need to go to the hospital, get sick, or handle other things in life. They will miss school, and it can hurt their grades.

Being honest with yourself means you can be honest with your family, friends, and others who support you. They will help you when you have problems. You should be honest with the people you love. If you start lying to them, you might keep lying. This can cause problems. If they trust you, don't lie to them. If you do, you might lose them. They are the ones who help you when you need it. Lying can ruin relationships. People who lie to each other don't trust each other. They might keep lying because they don't know how to be honest. This can hurt people. When you hurt someone, it's like hurting yourself. You can't take away their pain. So, think carefully before you say something that could hurt someone. Consider how they might feel. If you are honest, you will live a normal life without lies. For example, if you lie in a job interview, it won't end well. If you keep lying, you won't get the job. Lying to others is like lying to yourself. Be honest with your friends, family, and those who support you. If you want to say a lie, don't say it. Think twice. Do your best and don't live with lies. In the end, you'll see that lying was wrong. People you love won't trust you if they find out you lied. My mom told me a story about a man with sheep. He lied about a wolf attacking him. The town's people came to help, but there was no wolf. He laughed at them. He lied again the next day. The third time, a wolf really came, but no one believed him. The wolf ate his sheep, and he was left alone. This story taught me to be honest. If you lie too much, people won't trust you. So, be honest with yourself and others. If you can't say something true, don't say anything.

You might know one from Michelangelo. He was a great artist who said, \"It's more dangerous to set our goals too low and reach them than to aim too high and miss.\" I don't agree with this because the real danger is when we aim too high and miss. Michelangelo's words can stress us out and lead to bad behavior in different ways.\n\nAiming too high and missing is dangerous because it causes stress. High goals can overwhelm us and make us want to quit. If we quit, we'll feel hopeless and won't try again. Stress also makes us tired and lazy. This can lead to overthinking and negative thoughts. These are ways high goals can stress us out.\n\nAiming too high and missing is also dangerous because it leads to bad behavior. Focusing on high goals can make us forget important things. For example, we might not spend time with family and friends. We could lose touch with them if we only focus on one goal. Also, we might act badly and forget to be polite. If we work on our goals all day, we might not sleep well and get cranky. These are examples of how bad behavior can happen when we aim too high.\n\nSome people say it's worse to aim too low and reach our goals. They say this because if our goals are too easy, we won't care much about them. For instance, if we just want to rest, they think we don't care about finishing tasks. They also think we won't focus on important things if we don't reach our goals first. They believe we seem uninterested in our goals and life. Even though they might be right, I still think aiming too high and missing is worse. It causes more problems.\n\nMichelangelo's statement is bad because it can stress us out and lead to bad behavior. High goals can overwhelm us and make us want to quit. They can also ruin our sleep if we focus too much on them. That's why I disagree with Michelangelo. He thinks it's worse to aim too low and reach our goals.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times. Sometimes you have to say what's right in order to not hurt someones feelings from what you said. For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return. Secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later. They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.\n\nSecondly, If you are honest \"all the time\" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher.

When it does, students hurry to catch their buses home. They dream about fun activities like flying kites or playing football, not school. But imagine if they lost one and a half hours of free time. This could happen if the school board decides to make the school day longer. Most students would not want an extra one and a half hours of school. Opinions differ on this issue. I would only agree to a longer school day if it started later. I'm a student too, and I think exercise is important. A longer school day would cut into exercise time. Schools usually finish at three o'clock. With the extra time, they would end at four-thirty p.m. More school time could be good. Students would learn more instead of wasting time. It could help kids who are homeless or without parents. They could learn more and improve their lives. Parents working nine-to-five wouldn't have to leave their kids alone. Students might work harder and be more disciplined. They might get less homework since they'd have more class time. But I don't agree with a longer school day. It would harm students, the local economy, and taxpayers. Teachers would need higher pay for longer hours. The local government would have to pay them, which means higher taxes. People would protest the extra taxes needed for the longer school day. So, a longer school day would hurt students, the economy, and taxpayers. The school board should find a plan that helps students, parents, and the economy. There are a few good points to a longer day, but mostly bad ones. I hope the board leaders think carefully before making the school day longer.

The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher. By the wrong person you talk to, you might accidentally start a riot.\n\nLastly, you should be careful on how honest you are to people, because you don't know whether they are going through some stuff you are pointing out to them. Being truthful to someone and saying everything to them might make them upset on how you view stuff in the world also. Honesty is like an opinion that may cause someone that went through something upset them drastically. This is why I disagree that honesty is the best policy. From the situation you are in say respectful stuff towards the person. It might make you a better person if you are not saying negative things towards a person too.\n\nIn conclusion, I disagree with \"Honesty is the best policy\" by the situation you are in with the person and what they are going through.

Some people think it's better to work alone because it helps you become responsible and sure of yourself. But this isn't true. Even though some believe working alone is better, working in a group is actually better because we can finish our work fast and learn more. \n\nThe first reason working in a group is better is that we can finish our work fast. For example, in my history class, some students did their work alone, and others in a group. The first one to finish would get a prize. The group finished first and won. Working in a group is better because without the group, we wouldn't have finished fast and won. Another example is a man who had to fix many cars in two days to pay his rent. He couldn't do it alone, so he asked his friends to help. They worked together, and he finished fast and paid his rent. Working in a group is better because if he hadn't fixed the cars, he would have lost his home. But with the group's help, he finished fast and paid his rent. \n\nThe second reason is that working in a group lets us learn new things. For instance, I didn't know how to make a pie chart for my chemistry project. My friends helped me learn in a group, and I got a perfect score. Working in a group is better because if I hadn't made the pie chart, I would have failed. But I learned with the group and got a perfect score. Also, a girl didn't know how to swim. Her sister and brother taught her in a group. She learned to swim. Working in a group is better because if she hadn't learned, she might have drowned. But they taught her together, and she learned. \n\nSome might say working alone is better because it makes us responsible and sure of ourselves. But we can be even more responsible and confident when we work in a group. For example, many kids were learning to ride a bike together, but one kid who was very sure of himself tried alone. He was 11 and thought he could ride without the group. He fell and hurt his leg. Working in a group is better. If he had learned with the group, he wouldn't have fallen. Another example is a boy I know who wanted to live alone in a big house. He couldn't pay the rent. Working in a group is better. If he had shared the rent with others, he could have afforded it. \n\nSome might think working alone is better, but working in a group is actually better because we can finish our work fast and learn more. \n\nWorking in a group is better because it's not as good to work alone. In a group, we are safer, can do things easier, finish fast, and learn new things. Working in a group is better for success.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

Some people go to another country or state in the United States because they don't like the cold; they like warm places. I don't agree with some teachers who say we should have school all year with a short 3-4 week break in the summer, a longer winter break, and a week off in the spring. But we already study for about 8-9 months; why do they want us to study more?\n\nIf they want a longer winter, how can we have fun? Winter has snow, it's very cold, and we can only stay inside. This can make us stressed. I like a longer summer break because we can play sports, visit the beach, and have barbecues (like carne asada).\n\nPlaying sports is healthy, and we can do it in the summer. We enjoy sports like soccer, baseball, and running in the street with friends. Soccer is a game we can play in the summer. You can join a team and play in a big league, meet new friends, and if you're good, maybe join a famous team like Barcelona, Galaxy, or Real Madrid. Playing sports is good for your health. You won't be staring at your phone, which can hurt your eyes. You'll be happier, less stressed, and stay fit instead of getting fat in bed. You can also learn new sports. If your friends know how to play, they can teach you. Once you learn, you'll feel good talking about it with your friends.\n\nAnother fun thing in the summer is going to the beach with your family. You can enjoy the sun, the sand, and watch sharks in the sea. Seeing the sunrise over the ocean is amazing. If you have money, you can go to countries with coconuts or palm trees, like Mexico. There, you can drink coconut water or relax under a palm tree. You'll forget about bad things like work, study, and problems for a while. That's why I want a long summer: to forget my worries and get ready for a new school year. Last summer, I had three months off. I went to different countries to enjoy the sea. I made sandcastles with my brother and ate lots of shellfish. I like shellfish because my dad said they make you strong with lots of vitamins. I didn't like them at first. But my dad said I had to eat them or I wouldn't get anything else to eat. So I tried them and now I love them. Whenever we go to the beach, my family orders shellfish at the hotel.\n\nBarbecue, or 'carne asada', is something else I do in the summer. To have a barbecue, you need clear weather because you cook outside. I can't do this in the winter because it's too cold. That's why I like a long summer. I can have many barbecues and share them with friends or family. We can also go to the park and cook there. It's great when my whole family comes over, and we share stories. When my grandpa talks, we all listen. He talks about his past and his hopes for our future. We can dance to any music we like. I can't forget these times because in winter, they're over.\n\nSummer is a time most people enjoy because you can do a lot, spend time with family and friends. In winter, you're stuck at home, watching TV, using your phone, or playing games like Fortnite. I don't like those things; I want to enjoy being young. When you're young, you should explore, make new friends, and you can't do that at home; you'd get bored without friends. That's why I want a long summer. If I only get 3-4 weeks, I can't do much, and I won't want to go back to school; I'll be bored. Summer is when we can have fun and get ready for winter because in winter, you can't work or travel. So summer is very important.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

It's like getting an extra day off from work or school. So, schools should start having a four-day school week. They can do this by making the school day two hours longer. The good things about a four-day school week are saving energy and money, doing better in school, and having more time for homework.\n\nSchools use a lot of energy and resources in a week, more than we use at home. This includes things like electricity and water. The more we use, the more the school has to pay. Having one extra day off can cut down on costs for food, buses, and keeping the school running.\n\nA four-day week doesn't just save energy and money. It also gives teachers and students an extra day to rest each week. With less stress about school, students can relax more at home before coming back to school. This rest is key to helping them do better in school.\n\nBesides saving energy and getting rest, students will have more time for homework. Many students say they don't have enough time at home to finish their homework. If this keeps happening, their grades could suffer. An extra day off gives them a longer weekend. This means they have more time to get ready for tests and study at their own speed.\n\nMoving to a four-day school week can make a big difference.

While some don't like the idea of online classes, others think it's good. They say online classes save time, so students can do other things. Also, students who have trouble getting to school will find it easier to learn from home. \n\nFirst, online classes at home are better because they don't take as long. For example, these classes happen at set times. A class must end when the time is up. Students can then plan when to study and when to work. In the USA, many students borrow money for school. Working while studying online can help them pay back these loans. It's clear that online classes are helpful. \n\nAlso, for students without cars, online classes are the best choice. In the USA, not having a car is a big issue, especially for students. They rush to catch buses or trains every morning to get to school on time. Sometimes, they might miss class because of this. Online classes can fix these problems. Students can then spend more time on their studies instead of worrying about travel. \n\nIn the end, online classes save time and let students work to make money. They also help students be on time for class when they might be late because of travel issues. This means students should take classes from home using the internet or video calls.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

This is important because it gives you more help. I know a guy who is a teacher and he is 23 years old. He picked a job early, and he or someone else helped him pick a good job for him. The school is like a friend because it helps you pick the job you want. The school helps you with your classes and homework. The school helps you with other things too, but I don't know what else to think. \n\nMy brother has a friend who finished school last year at Generic School, and now he is in college. I don't know what he wants to do, but he told my brother that they write a lot of essays. First, they write an essay of 1,000 words, then one of 2,500 words, and then one of 5,000 words. They have one week to write each essay. If they don't finish an essay, it gets thrown away and they get a zero. You have to finish your work on time. If you have to do an essay in 2 days, you need to do it. \n\nMy school will help me choose what job I want. Whether I want to study art or something else, my teachers will help me. I don't care what my friends or others say about me. They think I won't finish high school. But if I want to, I can finish and do more. I can get a good job. I might not go to the best college, but I can go to college. There, I will work hard to pass all my classes and pick the right job for me. The best job is the one that makes more money because we need money for food and water. \n\nI am from Generic City and now I live in the United States. These two places are 95% different. Only 5% is the same: the money. It's easier to make money in the United States. In Generic City, you work one day and get 5 dollars. Here, you work one day and get more than 100 dollars. Here, college costs about 40,000 dollars. There, it costs about 1,000 dollars, I think.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

I believe teens should be allowed to be out at 10 P.M. during the week and at midnight on weekends. The City Council should not make this curfew rule for all teens. Curfews don't stop teens from getting into trouble. Teens are like adults; they can make their own choices about what they want to do any day. This is just not fair to young people! Take my life as an example. I get up at 5 A.M. to get ready for school. After school, I work from 4 P.M. to 11 P.M. I only work for 7 hours because I need time for homework, to talk to my friends on my phone, and to read my favorite books. If this curfew starts and I'm out at 11 P.M., I would be breaking the law! Some teens don't have parents; their parents are far away or have left them. So, they have to work after school and sometimes work more hours. I don't agree with this curfew because not all teens out late are just hanging out; they are working for a better future. It's tough to decide if this curfew is good or bad. The City Council won't keep teens out of trouble with it. Teens control their own lives. Some might say the curfew will keep teens safe. But the best way to keep teens safe is to teach them to stay away from drugs and alcohol. If teens use these things, they might not listen to their parents. Parents should teach them to be good at home, at school, and outside. On weekends, most teens and adults like to go to parties, and others stay home with family. If they go to a party and come back at 12 A.M., the police will arrest them for breaking the curfew. The City Council should not make this curfew rule; it won't help teens learn about life, including working at night.

It's better than letting students bring them and use them when they are not in class. I say this because phones can hurt learning. For example, one student was texting about something that happened at another school. She had to stop texting to go to class. That day, they were learning something very important. But she was not thinking about the lesson. She was thinking about the text. So, when there was a test, she did not do well.\n\nThe other student who was texting in class also did not focus. She did not just hurt her own learning. She might have hurt other students' learning too. She also did not do well on a test about what they learned that day. This shows why we should not let students bring phones to school. Also, phones can cause problems. Like if someone forgets to turn off their phone and it makes noise, it can bother the whole class.\n\nI also think that all schools should have a rule that says 'No phones in school.' Students should never bring their phones. I believe this is the best rule for schools.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

Going to school is very important to learn, but sometimes you can't go. For instance, you might miss the bus and have no way to get to school, or you might be too tired from a part-time job to go to school the next day. Bad weather can also make it unsafe to go outside, so you stay home to be safe. But you can still keep up with school by taking classes online from your house. This is helpful because you can learn from home. But it can be hard if you don't have the internet or if you're confused about something and can't ask your teacher right away. You'll have to wait for help. When you learn from home, you also miss out on school events, field trips, spending time with friends, and joining clubs or sports teams. These are things you can't do if you're not at school in person. Even with these downsides, learning from home has benefits like regular school, just in a different way. To sum up, you can keep going to school from home using the internet. There are downsides, but there are good things too. You might have to try harder to learn new things. I believe learning from home is a good option.

This change could be good for the students' work. First, the students would get more free time. Second, they would have more energy for the next day. Also, it would teach them to use their time well when they work. Students would get enough time to do things they enjoy. They could also spend more fun time with their families. If a student gets home earlier, he can rest by sleeping, eating, or talking with friends. He can do things he likes, such as hobbies or going out with his family. For example, my sister loves to dance ballet, but she can't after school. She dances at night or on weekends. Also, many parents miss out on fun times like picnics because their kids are in school. If school ended earlier, parents could make new memories with their kids. A shorter school day means students won't be so tired. In many places, the school day is too long. Students are too tired to do anything when they get home. They wake up at 7:00 AM and wait for the bus until 7:40 AM. They have more than four tough subjects that tire them out. School ends at 3:00 PM. Students feel trapped, like in jail. How can they keep going if they're this tired? A shorter school day also helps students manage their time. This is important for those who study and work. Some students work after school to save for college. If school ended earlier, they could rest or do homework before work. Last year, a boy in my class worked late. Our teacher asked why he didn't do his homework. He said he was too busy working to pay for college and help his family. He would have done it if he had more time after school. So, we should cut the school day by two hours. This gives them time for fun things. It also gives them energy for the rest of the day.

It's hard, but if you keep your eyes on your goals, you can do anything and handle both work and school. It can be hard to do both. Some students work because they don't live with their parents but with other family. They work to help at home or to get what they need. This is even more true for those who live in a new country or city. Being away from family is hard because you miss them. Sometimes it's tough for these students because they don't have anything where they are staying. Some students work because they like to, or they don't like being at home. They work for fun or because they want a phone. They work to get the things they want. Other students work because they have to. They live by themselves and really need to work to pay for what they need. These people work and go to school, and they often do well in school or college. In college, we have more things to take care of, no matter where we live. Some people think we should say nice things about a student's work to make them feel good, even if it's not their best.

If you just do what others say you should do, you won't be truly happy. For instance, my parents wanted me to work in healthcare as a doctor or nurse. But I love computers. I enjoy taking them apart and fixing them. In my junior year of high school, I found out about cybersecurity. I knew right away that I wanted to work in that area. I told my parents, and they were a bit sad. They had different plans for me. But I didn't let that stop me. I learned more about cybersecurity to understand it better and to explain it to my parents. We talked about it over dinner. They told me they would support me no matter what. Now, I'm a senior and I plan to go to a local college to save money. I want to do what I love, which is working with computers. Sometimes, people might try to discourage you. You should keep going and ignore them. If you always try to please others, you won't be happy. I think people should care about their own happiness more. In the end, you should do what makes you happy. If it doesn't make you happy, don't do it. Choose the job you like. Do small things that bring you joy. Wear what you like and be confident.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

When people try new things, they can feel bad if they mess up. But a mentor will tell you to keep going and learn from your mistakes. Mentors also make you feel confident.

It comes down to how you speak to them at the start. They might be mean, like being rude or ignoring you. This makes them see you in a bad light. But if you're friendly and nice, they'll think you're good. They believe you're ready to work hard and do things right. This is important when you're trying to get a job. First thoughts stick, and I say this because nobody likes someone who's always down. If you seem down in a job interview, they probably won't hire you. When you meet someone new, will you be down or upbeat? Most will say upbeat. Why? Because they don't want to look silly. If you're down, you'll wish you weren't. People won't want to talk to you; they'll say bad things like 'That person's not nice' or 'They have a bad mood.' But if you're upbeat when you meet people, they'll like you. They'll want to talk more if you're nice to them. First meetings also often lead to talking about jobs. That's great because you can have a real, relaxed talk. Just answering questions isn't really talking. Talking is when you learn about each other and share what you enjoy. So, always make a good first impression. It helps in life.

Some don't talk in person at all. It's tough to talk to someone you can't see. People chat on the phone. They don't meet up to talk; they just use tech. For instance, when you go to a new country, you must talk in different languages. You can't just use tech to talk to them. Tech can be good or bad, depending on how you use it. It can help send emails quickly, make calls, chat, and shop online. But it can also fill your head with too many games, too much phone time, and less talking to people. The biggest way tech changes us is in how we talk. Many people don't speak to each other because they're busy with tech. They stay home and spend hours on their phones. We need to talk more, not just use phones. Tech is getting bigger every day. In ten years, people might not talk to each other at all. They'll just use phones or other tech. The second big change from tech is with kids. When a kid cries, parents often give them a phone or some tech to quiet them. This isn't good. Their brains will learn to want a phone every time they're upset. Parents let their kids use phones even during meals. It seems okay now, but later on, it won't be. They won't know how to talk to people without tech. In the end, I think tech is good. It's fine to use it, but not always, and not just to talk. Don't let your kids use tech all the time. It's bad for them. Tech makes them turn to phones instead of talking face to face.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

It's good to stay after school for things like sports or to work on the yearbook. You can also get help with your homework. This is good because you learn about your school and can show school spirit. It also helps you stay fit. Most kids at school don't join in because they're lazy or they have to look after their brothers or sisters. For example, when I was in fifth grade, I played basketball and joined a club called 'On My Road.' We did our homework and then played different sports outside. I really enjoyed after-school activities because I could take a break from my sisters and my mom, who is always cleaning, which bothers me. As soon as I get home, my mom tells me to clean my room and the bathroom. After cleaning, I hardly have time for homework. Some activities can help you later on. For instance, you might go to college for free if you're good at school and sports. I think sports are fun because you meet new people, get better at the sport, and play against other schools.

Also, you shouldn't hurry to make your dreams come true. But if you hurry and fail, you must keep going and not quit. Some might think they can reach their goals without effort. But in life, you have to work hard to get anything because nothing comes easy; you have to work for it.\n\nFirst, being down-to-earth is very helpful. If you are, many people will like you. And if you want a job, being down-to-earth can make them more likely to hire you. This quality will help you in school and in working hard to meet your goals and other things in life.\n\nHowever, hurrying to meet your goals won't help you succeed. For me, and others, life is about the right timing. If you want to be someone, it will take time and effort. Life is tough, but that doesn't mean you stop trying or give up. You have to work for many things in life.\n\nLastly, some might say they can meet their goals without effort. But you have to work to get things because no one will give you a job if you don't try or do what you should. Young people often say this, but they don't understand life after school. They don't really know what they're saying because they think life won't change.\n\nFor these reasons, I agree with Michelangelo because life depends on how you behave. If you are truly down-to-earth, your dreams will likely happen. But if you are arrogant, it's hard for your dreams to come true. Life is about achieving; no one gets things without hard work.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times. Sometimes you have to say what's right in order to not hurt someones feelings from what you said. For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return. Secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later. They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.\n\nSecondly, If you are honest \"all the time\" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher. By the wrong person you talk to, you might accidentally start a riot.\n\nLastly, you should be careful on how honest you are to people, because you don't know whether they are going through some stuff you are pointing out to them.

A first impression can be a positive or negative way to start. People react in many ways to first impressions. This could happen on a first date, at a job interview, or during your first performance on stage. Feelings play a big role in first impressions. They can stop worse things from happening. \n\nStay calm and control your emotions. For instance, when you meet someone new, don't be nervous and try to be happy. This is hard for some, while others are naturally upbeat. If you're not, you might mess up and wonder why your first impression didn't go well. \n\nAlways look at your mistakes. Make sure your clothes are clean and without spots. You can always make a better impression if you try hard enough. Send out positive signals. And before you go out, double-check everything. This is key because you don't want to make a bad impression. \n\nBe nice and have a good attitude. Being polite can help make a good impression and change what others think of you. Be eager and kind to people. There are many ways to fix a first impression, good or bad. \n\nSome think it's nearly impossible to change a first impression. They say what's done is done, and you can't change it. But I believe you can work on it. You can't undo it, but you can look at what went wrong. Ask for help or think about what you did wrong before. \n\nEveryone has their own view on whether we can change a first impression. I think we can. It depends on how we react and, most importantly, our behavior. Think carefully before you act. And if you think you can't change a first impression, just try your best. Make it your goal.

It's hard to work with people who are negative. They often act mean, shout, and are difficult to work with. They don't help with team tasks. You can find these people everywhere. For example, in school, students do projects or work in teams. Often, one person with a bad attitude can make things hard for everyone. Even negative people know that working with positive people is easier. Positive people make better leaders because they are more patient when explaining or teaching. Usually, negative people don't like how positive people act. Being too positive can be annoying, so it's important not to go too far. Negative thinkers keep their bad outlook on life. This can make their minds foggy and stop them from wanting to do things. Staying positive is important for trying hard and reaching your goals. Some people like to test themselves, which is good. But some start with a bad attitude. If you work with negative people, they might change if they see your positivity. Some say that being positive doesn't help you succeed. They think it gives false hope and doesn't really help in achieving goals. But, being positive is really the key to success. In the end, being positive is important for success. This is because it's nicer to work with someone who is positive.

Kindness is a big part of life. It helps us grow and have a good, loving heart. We should be kind every day. It helps people who are sad or having a tough time. I know because I've been there. Last year, at my private school, I felt lost. The people I thought were friends were not real. They only cared about themselves. They called me 'shy girl' because I was quiet. When you're new, you feel out of place. I thought, 'This isn't my school.' I needed a real friend to be kind and say, 'It's going to be okay,' or 'I'm here for you.' I cried a lot. They judged others by looks or actions. I felt alone. Until... \n\nIn seventh grade, I moved to a public school. I felt great. People were kind. I made real friends. They cared and asked about my day. They said nice things like 'You are beautiful,' 'You are amazing,' and 'What's wrong?' Their words made me happy. I felt I belonged. I am still happy. I am thankful for any kindness. \n\nTrust me, being kind to someone can make their day. It shows they're not alone. \n\nKindness isn't everywhere. But if you feel you belong and have a purpose, you have kindness. And so do the people around you. Keep kindness in your heart. One day, you might change someone's life. Kindness is like a light switch. Without it, it's dark. With it, everything is bright. If you're kind, it will come back to you. \n\nI hope people are kind. It helped me, and I help others. Any small act of kindness is remembered and valued. I always say, 'Be kind to everyone.' Kindness and respect can change lives. It's the right thing to do. Always be kind.\"\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

However, keep some things to yourself if you think it's not positive to say to another. Second, It might make the person feel bad if you do say something harsh to them. Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times. Sometimes you have to say what's right in order to not hurt someones feelings from what you said. For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return. Secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later. They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.\n\nSecondly, If you are honest \"all the time\" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher. By the wrong person you talk to, you might accidentally start a riot.\n\nLastly, you should be careful on how honest you are to people, because you don't know whether they are going through some stuff you are pointing out to them. Being truthful to someone and saying everything to them might make them upset on how you view stuff in the world also. Honesty is like an opinion that may cause someone that went through something upset them drastically. This is why I disagree that honesty is the best policy. From the situation you are in say respectful stuff towards the person. It might make you a better person if you are not saying negative things towards a person too.\n\nIn conclusion, I disagree with \"Honesty is the best policy\" by the situation you are in with the person and what they are going through.

I believe it's great because it helps students get their homework done sooner.

They might have brothers or sisters who bother them and don't let them work, or they might not feel like doing homework at home. Also, students might not want to work at home because no one is there to encourage them.\n\nAnother reason I think an after-school homework club is a great idea is that some students are having a hard time in certain subjects and don't understand the material. They can get extra help after school from teachers or other students. I believe students learn better when someone is there to guide them. It's also good because students can be around others who want to do well, and that can inspire them to work hard!\n\nFinally, I think it can be a fun idea because students can talk to each other after they finish their work. They can talk about what they've learned and maybe even teach each other new things!\n\nIn conclusion, an after-school homework club is a great idea because it helps students finish their homework at school and helps them with subjects they are struggling with.

For example, in jobs where you talk to customers, you need to be nice. This is why it's good to have a good attitude at work. It's also good to be positive in life. When you hang out with friends, being nice helps you meet new people and start important projects. In the end, I think that attitude is very important for getting a job or making friends.

It helped me a lot in seventh grade.\" I think starting a homework club at my school is a good idea for many reasons. It is good for me and other students. It will also improve our country and save students time.\n\nI think starting a homework club at my school is good because it helps students. First, it will help many students get better grades on tests, classwork, and homework. This will make them happy and like school more. It will make their parents happy too. Parents feel happy when their kids are happy. Second, students can talk to their friends while doing homework. They can also stay after school to talk about group projects. Last, students can get help from teachers when they need it. In short, homework clubs help students get better grades, talk to friends during homework, and get teacher help.\n\nStarting a homework club is also good for America's future. It will help more people get better jobs. This means the U.S. will make more money. A character in a movie I saw said, \"Your future depends on what you did before.\" So, if we study hard now, we will get good jobs later. This will help our country. Also, more students will get good grades. When people think of America, they will think of a place with many chances. Overall, a homework club will help our country because more people will get good jobs, more students will get good grades, and it will make us proud.\n\nStarting a homework club also saves students time. Students can finish homework early. Then, when they go home, they don't have to do more work. They can enjoy time with their family or do what they like. The best part is they can join activities outside of school. This keeps them healthy and strong. It also stops them from getting tired at school. So, a homework club saves time because students can finish homework at school, spend more time with family, and stay healthy.\n\nSome students think a homework club has many bad points, but they are wrong. I agree with starting a homework club at my school. It helps students who find some subjects hard or who want to finish homework early. It is also good for our country and saves students time. A homework club will be a great help to many students, including me.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

First, because we should always keep trying. We know that nothing is easy; we must keep trying. For example, I had a friend who did not like school because of his math class. He felt dumb because he could not understand what the teacher was saying. But he did not stop trying. He worked hard in school and got better at math. Now he is a math teacher. He tells me to never stop trying and to believe in myself.\n\nSecond, I want to say that success is hard to achieve. If we want to succeed, we must expect many hard times. But if we stay hopeful and positive, we will make it one day. If we do well, we can show others how to keep going. We might inspire someone. For instance, I failed my driving test two times. But I did not quit. I knew getting my license would be hard. After lessons and practice with my parents, I passed on my third try. I was very happy and proud that I kept trying.\n\nThird, I want to say that failure teaches us important things we will always remember.\n\nThese experiences are good for us. We can share them and encourage people who quit too soon or think they can't succeed after one failure. We should never stop trying. Success won't come to us; we have to go after it. We need success; it doesn't need us.\n\nIn conclusion, I agree that success is about not giving up, even when we fail. First, because quitters don't succeed. Second, because success is not easy. And last, because success teaches us important life lessons.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

Being yourself means you can do what you want. You can choose your own way and take steps to succeed. I don't agree that being yourself means getting the biggest success. A person alone can't move forward. They can't reach the top success they want. A person alone is not whole. Everyone needs help to find the right path and get their biggest success. \n\nA person can't make their biggest success alone. Everyone needs advice from family, a close friend, or someone else. This help can change their life. The start of every successful person is listening to their family or friends. They care about their advice on how to be strong and how to be someone who achieves great things. \n\nBeing yourself, you can't get to the top alone because life is hard. Everyone needs help from someone who can guide them. For example, think about how families help us from when we are babies. They teach us about life. Our family is the strongest influence. They help us grow and try hard to be someone who can find the biggest success. \n\nA person alone is not whole. No one is perfect. This means everyone needs a good helper. Like when we start school, teachers are very helpful. They teach us and guide us to the top. They also show us life's challenges and tell us to never give up. They help us achieve what we want. So, we all need a best friend to support our choices and help us find success. \n\nIn the end, I want to say that no one can do anything without help from family and friends. When we are alone, we are not perfect. The best way to improve is to talk to others. This helps us grow and be able to do what we want. It helps us be someone who can help others achieve their dreams.

If you fail a thousand times, it's fine. Don't be upset because one day you might achieve your dream. Failure is just a part of your life. I agree with Churchill's idea that failing is important when you want to succeed. This is because you learn more, stay hopeful, and learn to admit when you're wrong.\n\nFirst reason: learning more. When you fail, you learn things that can help you reach your dream and be successful. For example, if you had a bad boyfriend and the relationship ended, you wouldn't date someone like him again. You've learned from that bad time, and it helps you make better choices.\n\nSecond reason: staying hopeful. You should think of failure as something good. You can't let yourself feel sad or hopeless when things don't work out. For example, my mother wanted to drive, but she kept failing the driving test. She was upset at first, but she didn't give up and finally passed.\n\nFinal reason: admitting when you're wrong. It's hard to say it's your fault when you fail. For example, if you fail a test because you didn't study or listen in class, you might not want to say you were wrong. But when you start to admit your mistakes, you try harder not to fail again.\n\nIn conclusion, I think we should keep trying even when we fail because we live in a place with many chances to do something. Failing teaches us about life, helps us learn, and makes us admit our mistakes.

It's a great idea for all of us. Why? Because getting to your fourth year is hard. I'm not saying three years would be easy. We'd still feel the pressure. But, it would be great if students could finish high school in three years and start college. Or, if they're not going to college, they could work sooner instead of waiting another year. For example, my Hispanic friends often say they want to leave school. They don't mean they're going to a different school. They want to work as soon as they can. But for those who really care, finishing high school in three years, including summer school, is perfect. School and graduation are a path we know how to follow. We just need a little push. Schools should let students pick the classes they really want. Every school says you need certain classes to graduate. But if you want to be a doctor, you should get classes that help with that. It's better to choose seven classes you're really into. It's not fair that hardworking students can fail because they miss one credit. Meanwhile, students who cheat all year can pass and graduate. Schools need to be stricter about this.

For example, if your mom says to go to your room and study for your test tomorrow, but you don't and she punishes you for a week, you'll probably learn to do better. Next time, you will listen to your mom. \n\nDealing with problems directly can help others deal with theirs. It's smart to ask your parents how to fix your problems. When you face a problem, do your best to handle it. Solve your own problems before you ask others for help. \n\nIt's good to fix your problem because you know it best. No matter how tough the problem is, try hard to fix it. Don't lose hope because it's tough or no one helps you. Your family is there to support you. And if others make fun of you for your problems, keep trying and listen to your parents. They are older and have more experience. \n\nDon't let others make you feel bad because you are strong and smart. Don't get mad about what people say about you. Instead, face your problems and trust yourself. Deal with your issues, and let your mind grow. Then, when a new problem comes, you can fix it easily. For example, if you start a company and a big problem comes up, the leader has to fix it, or the company might fail. Some problems are small, and some are big. Everyone has problems, even kids, so if you're having a hard time, don't quit. You can handle a problem without knowing it. Sometimes problems can make you sad. For example, if your girlfriend cheats on you and you don't know what to do, you can ask your parents or someone you trust for help. Some problems are about family, like being sad because a family member died. You can rest for a few days, then tell your parents how you feel, and they will help you get through it. A problem might be hard to move on from, but once you do, you will be okay. You won't have any problems again because you'll be ready for any challenge.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

In this essay, I will say that finishing high school in three years is better and easier. You get an extra year to do something that can help you later on. We don't all have to be the smartest. To reach our goals, we just need to work hard and want it enough.\n\nFirst, an extra year means you can work harder. You can start working a lot. Then you will have money for college in the future. Your parents won't have to worry about whether you go to college. They also won't have to worry about having enough money to help you save for your things. College is very expensive and takes a lot of work.\n\nSecond, starting school with good grades makes everything turn out well. Students can join the military or go to college a year early. Doing things when you are young is better. Young people usually don't have many responsibilities at home. So, they don't have much to worry about. They just need to know that school is most important.\n\nThird, I once knew a boy in Brazil named Generic_Name. He was very poor and sometimes didn't have food for his brothers and sisters. But he was smart and had big dreams. He wanted to make a lot of money and buy his sick mother a house. She had cancer and couldn't work. She felt bad because her older son had to work to feed the family. Generic_Name said, \"I am going to be someone incredible in life, I will succeed.\" That gave him the energy to work hard and finish high school a year early. Family can make us thankful people.\n\nSome people think finishing high school in three years is the same as four years. But they are wrong. If you finish early, it's because you worked hard for good grades. It's not the same. In the end, try to do all you can. Then no one can tell you what to do. Keep moving forward for better results.

I believe that having a friendly and open nature can change the people you are with a lot. Also, if you show that you work hard and give a lot to your community, it can make others want to do the same. \n\nWhen you act well and are friendly, it can change the people you hang out with. For instance, if you have a friend who acts very nicely, it can make you want to act better too. Another example is when people see what kind of person you are and how you help others with what they need, it can make them feel good in many ways. This could make them want to do nice things later on. \n\nIf you show that you work hard and do a lot for your community, it can change others in a good way. If you help the community by setting up fundraisers or keeping the area clean, it makes the community better and gets others to do the same. Also, if you show that you work very hard at something, it can show what kind of person you are.

However, keep some things to yourself if you think it's not positive to say to another. Second, It might make the person feel bad if you do say something harsh to them. Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times. Sometimes you have to say what's right in order to not hurt someones feelings from what you said. For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return. Secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later. They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.\n\nSecondly, If you are honest \"all the time\" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher. By the wrong person you talk to, you might accidentally start a riot.\n\nLastly, you should be careful on how honest you are to people, because you don't know whether they are going through some stuff you are pointing out to them.

Some might not agree because they think differently. I think being positive is very important for success. Many people are in a bad mood often. This can turn into negative feelings and a bad attitude. With a bad attitude, people don't care much about their actions. They may not know what they can do in life. They get angry fast and give up. Giving up won't help them succeed. But people with a good attitude are different. They have a lot of energy and can do great things. They don't stop trying because they see good in everything. They look for good results or better things to come. Let's look at two people: one with a good attitude and one with a bad one. If the person with the bad attitude tries to play the guitar and fails, they will get upset and stop trying. But the person with the good attitude will keep trying until they can play it. This is because they always think positively. Being positive is good for you and the people around you. You might not notice it, but it's probably true. I believe that being positive is the secret to a good life.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

I think it's a good idea to start thinking about a job when you're young, like when you enter high school. This way, you can learn to be responsible and start planning for your future. Kids can learn about jobs and think about what they want to do later, like going to college.\n\nFirst, kids can learn to be responsible for their future. They can think about jobs they might like, such as being a pharmacist, doctor, vet, or teacher. But some kids think starting a job young is too hard. I worry about this because kids should think about their future and what job they want when they grow up.\n\nSecond, kids can learn how a job can help them. Many schools let high school students start learning about jobs, and I think this is very helpful. But some students say this can make them stressed. I believe not being ready for a job later can cause even more stress.\n\nMy last point is that kids can think about what they want and get ready for college. They can prepare for a good job when they go to college. They can feel proud that they worked hard to find what they want for college. Also, many students think they can learn more in college. But I think they can learn a lot about jobs in high school, which will make things easier later on.\n\nIn conclusion, I think starting to work towards a job when you're young is very helpful for the future. It teaches you important things and how to be responsible. I believe it's a good idea for students to start early. They can learn a lot, and when they grow up, they can be the person they want to be.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

No one should tell you to change if it doesn't feel right or good to you. Some people who are racist bother others who are different in race, religion, or sexuality. At work, some coworkers can be mean and make you do extra work. While many bosses make sure everyone is treated well, some agree with the bad treatment of those who are different. Still, there are more kind people than mean ones today, and people have many different styles. Why do some people get so angry at others that they hurt children and teenagers? It's wrong. But now, we have laws and groups that protect us from such harm. Sometimes, people are mean because they are jealous of those who are different but also smart, happy, and thankful. People might dislike others who are different for many reasons. For example, immigrants who come here for a better life often face hate and racism. Some people would rather harm them than respect them or ignore them. They might be angry because the immigrants are doing well. Like Donald Trump, who doesn't like immigrants or Latinos and wants to build a big wall. But society won't change for the worse just to please racist people. We should respect everyone, no matter where they're from or their culture. In this country, we can speak freely about our sexuality, religion, and culture, even if some don't like it. There will always be someone who disagrees, but that's okay. Being positive is good for you and makes you happiest, no matter what others think. People with different religions, sexualities, or cultures should do what makes them happy. Thanks to our rights and Emerson's words, being true to yourself is a big achievement. Start each day with a positive outlook. This can lead to success and might teach those who dislike differences to stop hating just because people are different.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

They take extra classes in the summer or during breaks to move ahead or to finish school early. This can be good because it lets people move on to college for a better job or life. But some who come to South or North America might need one or two more years to finish high school because of the language barrier with English. So, it's a good idea to keep going to classes and finish for a better future, to start college, and to get a job. But life can be tough and often needs us to depend on ourselves and others, so we must always try hard.\n\nWhen you speed up your classes and finish high school in less than four years, you're ready for college. With an extra year, you can work to save money for college or to get ahead in your studies. But during this time, you must stay focused to finish your education and start a job, using this time well for a better life for you and your family. But remember, success doesn't come easy; it takes hard work and help from family and friends.\n\nYou can work and save money for college, paying for your classes. Some might think this is just a little bit of money, but after you graduate from college and get a good job, you can get back all the money you spent and more, and use it for you and your family. It's important to think about the future, like needing a car, a house, and savings. When you're older, you'll want to relax and be with loved ones, whether that's family, friends, or pets. The main thing is to be happy with your choices.\n\nAfter finishing high school or college and getting a good job, you can have a good life with your family and friends, enjoying your money, traveling, and seeing the world. Enjoy your retirement and the rewards of your hard work, and remember those who helped you.\n\nSome say the usual four-year high school time is best, while others like the quicker three-year way, using the extra year to work or start college early. After you finish your job, you can relax and enjoy life. It's important to think about what's best for you and your future, and what you want in life.\n\nUse your time well, thinking about your future. Have fun and celebrate after you reach your goals. Study hard, whether it's during breaks or the school year, and don't waste time.\n\nSometimes you might not pass all your classes or be the best at every subject, but with focus and hard work, you can do something in life, get a good job, or buy a house where you can relax. A good life with family and friends who support you means focusing on your life, a good job, and a loving family. Think about how you want to spend the important three or four years of high school and whether to go to college or start working.\n\nTake the time you need; there's no rush. Use all the time you need to reach your goals in life.

Looking into their eyes, being polite, and how you talk are things that people notice when they meet you. You should always be polite and show respect when you meet someone new. Making eye contact shows you are paying attention and are really listening. Even if you don't make a good first impression, you can still change it later. Sometimes, a person might seem nice at first but then act badly later. This can ruin the good first impression. Or, someone might not seem great when you first meet them but get better later. It's hard to fix a bad first impression, but it's possible. This is like saying 'don't judge a book by its cover.' We can't know what someone else is thinking or feeling. People often get nervous when they meet someone for the first time. This can make it hard for them to make eye contact. Usually, meeting someone once is not enough to know what they are really like. People might not be as friendly until they feel comfortable. It's not fair to judge someone after just one time. It's usually best not to judge someone from the first time you meet them. But sometimes, if they are mean, sarcastic, rude, or act better than you, they might always be like that. If someone doesn't pay attention to you when you're talking, like if they text or listen to something else, or if they cut you off, they are probably always rude. This is not polite and it's hard to change that impression. Even if someone seems rude, you shouldn't decide what they are like after just one time. People should have more than one chance to show who they really are. You should wait until you have met them a few times before you decide. Give people a few chances to show they are good.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

Paragraphs are easy to see. The main question is if students can take classes from home. They can. For example, if a doctor says a student must stay home for a month, they must do it. This is important because many people have the same issue. Without rest, they can get sicker and the problem gets worse. They could even die in a few days. If a student misses school, the school should call them. They should find out what's wrong and why the student didn't tell the school about their problem. Many students follow rules because it helps them. My essay talks about solving problems to get these benefits. I checked my essay to make sure it shows what I mean. It's about finishing the details in the paragraphs. The details must be perfect. We must work hard to finish the details, solve the problem, and use our experience. This helps us meet old standards. Older students have other choices. They can take classes online and get grades by email. Or they can go to school and get grades there. They can also graduate. But they must give correct details on the school's website to get their diploma. This can lead to college and a better life and money. But not everyone can go to college and get a scholarship. Not all colleges offer the same help. Some people must pay a lot to finish college. They don't have the same chances. This is why some people give up their dreams in this country. They can't afford it and don't know about scholarships or how long it takes to take classes online or go to college. But the help is not the same for everyone.

The boss of 'SaleHouses' thinks it's a good idea to work two extra hours because the workers like it. Since they started doing this, the company works better, gets more customers, and makes more money. He says schools should do the same, because, \"I think schools can get better grades.\" This could really help students learn and understand their lessons more. It's also good for students who work on weekends. They can do their homework on Friday and then work without stress on Saturday and Sunday. First, having school for two more hours is good because students can learn and understand their lessons more. For example, students in the English 11 class at Generic_School are getting better grades now that they have two extra hours. They are more into English 11 and understand it better. So, they get good grades and the school's average grade goes up. This helps students focus and helps schools get better grades. Second, more school hours are good for students who work on weekends. Like my friend Generic_Name, who is 17 and works at 'Brickhouse.' He likes his schedule because the extra school hours mean he has more time. He does his homework on Fridays. So, Generic_Name has enough time for everything and likes the two extra hours at school. It lets him finish his homework on Friday and work without worry on the weekend. This helps students who work on weekends have enough time for homework. But, some people don't like the idea of two more hours. They say students might sleep in class because it's too long, and it's hard for teachers who travel far. They also worry more students might quit school. They don't agree with adding hours. But they are wrong. More hours would help students and schools. Students would learn and understand better, and it would help those who work on weekends. In the end, there are good and bad things about having school for two more hours. Some say it's bad because students could sleep in class, it's hard for teachers who live far away, and more students might quit. But others think it's a great idea because it helps students learn and understand more, helps those who work on weekends, and makes the school's grades better.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

They learn better in person at public schools. It is also good for them to be taught face-to-face instead of using online videos or calls from home. Many people choose between public school and homeschooling for their kids. But some places don't make them choose. The state should say that all kids must go to public schools. Kids pay more attention when someone teaches them in person, not on a computer. It is also good for them to sleep 8 hours. Homeschooled kids might sleep at different times. The leaders should pick what is best for everyone, including kids. About half of our kids learn at home. Parents and leaders should think about what is best for the kids. In schools, teachers and principals help kids who used to learn at home. They let them play sports, join clubs, and do fun things. Kids understand better how to act and learn around others. Some places don't let kids go to public schools. They have to learn at home. People and places spend a lot of money on education. But the leaders should make the rules. Learning at home can be bad for kids' brains and how they use technology. Kids should not have to learn from home. They might sleep late, use computers too much, and not do enough activities. Kids need to sleep 8 hours. But many don't because they use their phones or computers a lot. They also do homework late, watch TV, or play sports that finish late. They join online groups that change when they sleep. Video games can make them stay up by talking and playing all night. Kids who learn at home might not focus on school because of technology. They use social media, play games, and text a lot. Kids at home might not move enough or play sports. Some parents don't know how to set up activities. Homeschooling doesn't always push kids to join clubs or like sports. Kids learning at home might not talk to friends much or learn well. Parents should let their kids learn more from good teachers and schools.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

However, keep some things to yourself if you think it's not positive to say to another. Second, It might make the person feel bad if you do say something harsh to them. Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times. Sometimes you have to say what's right in order to not hurt someones feelings from what you said. For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return. Secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later. They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.\n\nSecondly, If you are honest \"all the time\" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher. By the wrong person you talk to, you might accidentally start a riot.\n\nLastly, you should be careful on how honest you are to people, because you don't know whether they are going through some stuff you are pointing out to them. Being truthful to someone and saying everything to them might make them upset on how you view stuff in the world also. Honesty is like an opinion that may cause someone that went through something upset them drastically. This is why I disagree that honesty is the best policy.

The principal says every student must join one. I don't agree because most students won't want to. They might just sit there, do nothing, or fall asleep. There are more reasons why we shouldn't force students to join activities.\n\nThe principal made this rule, but students who don't want to join will get in trouble. Too much trouble can hurt their lives and grades. Students should choose what they like. For example, they may need to stay late for an activity but can't. Extracurricular activities can be fun for hanging out with friends. But if you can't join, it makes students upset. I wouldn't join because I have no time after school. Students get upset when teachers make them do things they don't want to.\n\nAll schools in Generic City have good and bad rules. They don't let you do what you want, and you can get in trouble for skipping activities. Students often don't have time or don't think activities are important. They might also be scared of being bullied. There are many reasons why we shouldn't force students to join activities. If a student chooses a sport like soccer, they could get hurt. People get bored listening to the teacher. They can get distracted and then get in trouble for talking. Teachers can be too strict; they get mad over small things like chewing gum in class.\n\nTeachers should make fun activities so students can enjoy time with friends. Some students are too lazy to think about joining activities. People have different opinions; not everyone thinks the same. The county should make more exciting activities so students can learn and see that activities can be good. Students might seem distracted, but maybe they just don't know how to do something in the activity.

Many people think that finishing in three years is bad. They say that staying in school for four years is better because students learn more and can figure out what job they want after college. First, students who are in high school for four years learn more. They finish all the needed classes and can take extra ones they like. Being in school clubs helps them get new skills and learn to speak up. Some students join groups that help others at school. They meet lots of people and get better at many things. They might even get college credits for this. Also, students from other countries or those learning English might need more time to get better at English before they finish school. High school teachers are there to help these students learn faster. The second point is that students can find out what job they want. They can pick classes that match their job goals. For example, if they like Marketing, they can take special Marketing classes. Schools have meetings where students can talk to college people about jobs. Counselors give a lot of help with skills, grades, where to live, how much school costs, and scholarships. This helps students pick the right job for their future. Even though students can finish school in three years, they might feel too much pressure. But they can save a year to do other things, like start college early, get used to college life, work, and make money for college costs. However, these students might not have enough experience and could be unsure about their job in college. They might not have thought about it enough, which could waste time later on. In the end, students should finish school in four years. They get help from more people at school, learn from different classes, get better at talking to people, and use these skills for their job or life. They also won't waste time looking for the right job with the help of counselors and teachers. In short, finishing school in four years is good because it gives students more chances for their future jobs.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

For instance, I didn't pass my driving test three times. I wanted to pass so I could drive. I kept trying and finally did it. Every time I failed, I felt bad, but I didn't stop trying. I studied a lot and didn't quit. In the end, I reached my goal. For me, failing isn't the end. It pushes me to improve every day. To be successful, you need to love what you do and be excited about it. Many people work hard on what they love. For example, my stepfather, Generic_Name, had a tough start with his business. His company wasn't known and didn't sell much. It even went bankrupt once. But because he loved his work and didn't quit, he worked hard and made his company a success. Now, his company, IMPAK, is very well-known for selling plastic products in the U.S. Some people think you don't need to fail to succeed. But, 98% of successful people have failed before they reached their big goal. Loving what you do and not quitting is the main way to succeed in life. In short, don't stop going after your dream just because you fail sometimes. Keep going to succeed.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

However, keep some things to yourself if you think it's not positive to say to another. Second, It might make the person feel bad if you do say something harsh to them. Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times. Sometimes you have to say what's right in order to not hurt someones feelings from what you said. For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return. Secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later. They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.\n\nSecondly, If you are honest \"all the time\" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher. By the wrong person you talk to, you might accidentally start a riot.\n\nLastly, you should be careful on how honest you are to people, because you don't know whether they are going through some stuff you are pointing out to them. Being truthful to someone and saying everything to them might make them upset on how you view stuff in the world also. Honesty is like an opinion that may cause someone that went through something upset them drastically. This is why I disagree that honesty is the best policy. From the situation you are in say respectful stuff towards the person. It might make you a better person if you are not saying negative things towards a person too.\n\nIn conclusion, I disagree with \"Honesty is the best policy\" by the situation you are in with the person and what they are going through.

Teachers teach you many things that will help you later, like getting ready for a job, being responsible, and respecting others.\n\nAnother reason why teachers are good at sharing experiences is that they went to school to learn how to teach us. They know a lot and have more experience than students.\n\nTeachers are also important because they help you when you need it.

Some companies now work only four days a week, with each day being ten hours long. Should your school do the same by adding 2 extra hours to each school day?\n\nMany companies have changed to a four-day workweek.\n\nSome people think this is good, while others do not. What would happen if schools did this? In this essay, I will discuss the good and bad points of this idea. I will look at school schedules, costs, transportation, and whether a four-day school week is good or bad.\n\nFirst, having less school days can make students come to school more. With fewer days to miss, students might not skip as much. They would also be more eager to learn because they have more time to rest and get ready. Research shows that students came to school 20% more over two years.\n\nWith a four-day week, students get less homework. So, more students can hand in their work on time. Teachers also benefit because they have more time to plan and get ready for the week.\n\nTeachers would also have more free time. They would not have to work on weekends as much. Students could go to school events on their day off.\n\nSaving money is another plus. Schools would use less energy because they are open one less day a week.\n\nI think a four-day school week is better. Students would want to go to school more, and teachers would be less stressed. I support this change and believe many students would agree. A four-day week would make life simpler and school a better place to learn.\n\nIn conclusion, a four-day week is good for students and teachers. They would have more time for other things and do their jobs better.

But you can choose for yourself. I believe you should trust your own choices instead of letting others decide for you. One reason is that you can do what you like without anyone else's input. Another reason is that making your own choices helps you become more confident and less afraid to speak your mind. Would you rather decide for yourself or let others decide for you? I want to show you why it's better to decide for yourself. \n\nMy first point is that making your own choices lets you do what you enjoy. You don't need to listen to others. If you want to play soccer, football, baseball, or basketball, just go for it. Don't ask others what to do. They might suggest something you don't like or have already done. When you decide for yourself, you can choose what's right for you. You learn and have fun by making your own choices. \n\nMy second point is about gaining confidence and not being afraid to speak out. Many people are too shy or scared to say what they think. But if they made their own choices, they wouldn't feel this way. If you let others decide for you, you'll always be afraid to speak out. I used to be shy and let others decide for me. When I started making my own choices, I became more confident. Now I'm not so shy and can decide for myself. \n\nSome people think it's better to get advice and let others decide for us. They say experts know best because they've done it before. They can give us good tips to make things easier. They might help us decide or even decide for us. This could help us try new things and see if we like them. If not, we can get more advice to help us decide. \n\nI still believe it's better to make your own choices. I've given you two reasons why I choose for myself. I've also explained why some people prefer others to choose for them. I hope this essay helps you decide whether to make your own choices or let someone else do it for you. Both ways can help you in life, but I think making our own choices is better.

This helps us value what we will get in the future. I agree with Churchill's idea. It's often tough to achieve our dreams, but if we really want something, we can get it. Anything is possible. For instance, I once wanted to learn to draw. I wanted to make art from anything. But I almost gave up on this dream for many reasons. I believe failing can lead us to good things. If we don't try, we won't know what's possible. Failing shouldn't scare us. It can teach us things that help us succeed. These are lessons only life can give. For me, failing is a chance to try again with more excitement. When I began to draw or paint, I didn't have the tools to make art. This was hard because my country didn't offer many chances. But I kept trying and ignored the bad. Now, I'm better at drawing and have the tools I wanted. I'll keep improving. It wasn't easy, but it was worth it. I still have much to learn. I'll keep chasing my dream. One day I'll say, 'I FINALLY DID IT.' Another reason I agree with Churchill is that we often don't value what we have until it's gone. Failing can help us succeed by giving us life's lessons. If we mess up, we can't change the past. But we can learn and do better. Failing shows us how hard it is to get something important. This helps us value what we have or what others do for us. It's harder to learn from others than from our own experiences. So, we shouldn't fear trying new things. No one is born knowing everything. Life teaches us. We shouldn't fear making mistakes. Life is about trying new things. It's okay to be imperfect and make mistakes, as long as we learn from them. Years ago, I was scared to leave my country. I didn't think I'd succeed. But I wanted to see my father after 18 years. I was afraid to fail, but I saw it as a great chance. I'm not perfect, but I'm proud of some past choices. I learned from my mistakes and will keep learning. The toughest things are always worth it. I agree with Churchill because you must struggle before you win. Life is the best teacher. Failing is not losing. It's a chance to do better. It's okay to fail before finding success.

But what does it really mean? Only 5% of students finish school in three years instead of four. A survey shows that most don't know what to do after they graduate. In high school, students are not mature enough to make big choices. So, they end up unsure about their future. High school is tough. It's hard for students to finish early. They must cram four years of work into three. This means summer school, extra classes after school, and night classes. They will be very busy and won't have time for a job or to relax. Being busy all the time can lead to stress. Stress is bad for students. It hurts their grades and stops them from being calm and happy. Graduating early is hard and not needed. It doesn't let students grow up fully, gives them too much work, and causes stress.\n\nThe usual four years in high school let students grow up properly. They get physically and mentally stronger. They learn about life and what they want for their future. They learn what is good and bad, what they can do well, and how to use their skills. Most young people don't know what they want to be when they grow up. After high school, they must start living on their own. They are not kids anymore. They must make big choices, like going to college, getting a job, or even becoming President. Thinking about the future is hard. It's even harder if you have to decide too soon. It's easy to dream, but students must be realistic. Education should help students find out who they are. They must use what they learn in real life after school.\n\nMost students choose not to finish high school early. It's hard to do four years of work in less time. It's more stressful. Students say that graduating early means working all the time, even on holidays. As Frida Kahlo said, \"Life isn't a race; there is time for everything.\" If you can finish in four years, why rush? High school is important. It's where you find out who you are. You shouldn't have too much homework and stress. Students should enjoy life, learn from mistakes, and have fun. If they are always studying, how can they work to make money? How can they enjoy time with family and friends if they are never free? School is not a race. You can take your time.\n\nExperts say stress is a big problem for young people. It can cause health issues, lack of sleep, and even lead to suicide. Students shouldn't have to deal with so much stress. They should go at their own pace and enjoy school. Learning should be fun, not harmful.\n\nFor these reasons, letting students graduate early can do more harm than good. High school students should learn and grow the best they can. But they should also enjoy being young. They are not adults yet. They should have time for fun and making memories. They shouldn't rush into big life choices if they're not ready. They also shouldn't have to deal with the stress of too much work. School is important, but it should be balanced. It shouldn't be the only thing in your life. Remember, life isn't a race. You have time to do everything. You can make mistakes, learn, and try again. You can do what you want because you have time. But you only live once.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

Why? Because if people use their time well and stay busy, they will finish a lot more than if they do nothing. Being busy takes time, but it is worth it because of the good results we want. It is better to be busy and reach our goals. Staying on track and busy helps in many ways. It can stop bad feelings and keep people from making mistakes. The outcomes from being busy are much better than from being lazy. They make us feel good about our hard work. Doing nothing can cause us to miss out on many good things in life. People often don't see this. But in a short time, doing nothing can really harm your life. Thomas Jefferson said it best: 'It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing.' This means it's amazing how much we can do quickly. Sometimes doing nothing is okay when we want to rest. Doing nothing can mean different things. It can be a waste of time or a chance to rest and then be active again. I have made mistakes by thinking I had nothing to do. But there is always something to improve ourselves or other things. I learned that no matter how good or bad we are at something, we can always get better by being busy.

Some think it's bad, while others think it's good. Many like technology because they use it for work, playing games, and doing other things. It can be good for kids too. Some parents set up controls on their kids' phones or tablets. This makes sure the devices turn off at a set time. I think people see technology as good because it helps them work hard, stay active, and not use their phone all day long.\n\nBut when people don't pick one side, they might think about the other. Some say technology can be bad because it might hurt our eyes or even make us blind. They worry that kids and grown-ups will move less because of technology. This is why I believe technology is good.\n\nPeople work hard using computers or laptops. They need technology for their jobs every weekday. At home, technology helps with work too. Even though work can take a long time, some things like YouTube and video games are blocked. Usually, you need a work ID, like a card or a pin, to use them.\n\nTechnology is also used for exercise. People use apps to exercise at home or to run outside. They stay active with their phones, but they don't use them all the time. Technology even helps people eat better. They watch YouTube to learn how to make healthy food.\n\nEven though people use technology a lot, they don't use it all the time. They make calls or send texts. They also use it to watch things like YouTube, Netflix, and other websites. It's good for kids to have parental controls on their phones. This can block some apps.\n\nThis is why people should think technology on their phones is good. Kids' phones or iPads should always have parental controls. People use phones for things that keep them active and help them do good work.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher.

They are also told to stick to one job choice early on. This is not a good or fair thing to do. There are many reasons why this is not fair. For one, it's not right to ask a young student to choose one job when they could look into many different areas. They might find other things they like more. It's hard to know which job is the best fit when you're young and like many things. Once you pick a job, you have to focus on certain classes and subjects. Young students have to decide on a job early. They must think about their classes and how these will help them in their job. They might feel too much pressure from all the work they need to do. They will also have a lot of stress from homework and not enough time to do it. This is too much for young students. They will also worry if they chose the right job. Making such a big choice is hard. It makes you second-guess your decision and worry about the future. You might wonder if you should have picked something else that fits your interests better. You might find the perfect job later when you know more about what you want to do. In the end, choosing a job when you're young is not a good idea. It's hard to pick the right job and to know if it's the best for you. You have to think about the results of your choice. This choice can greatly affect your life. You might wonder if you should keep going or give up if you chose wrong. I believe it's a bad idea to decide on a job when you're young without knowing what will happen in the end.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

We have scientists, doctors, firefighters, pilots, police officers, cooks, and more. Some people always try their hardest to make our society better. Every day, new people are born into the world they are making. Like everyone, they start from the beginning. As they grow, they wonder, 'How do I get what I want?' We grow up watching things happen around the world. These things shape our thoughts. They make us think about our future and push us to make choices that will change our lives. What's the problem? You might ask. Well, many people don't know how to get what they want. When they're older, they're not sure which choices to make for a good life. They wonder if they should get help or do it alone. I remember when my older brother, Generic_Name, wanted to be a doctor. He finished high school and was ready for the next step: to work as a doctor and succeed. We all wanted to know which college he picked to learn to be a doctor. When my mom asked him, he said he wouldn't go to college. He wanted to learn on his own. My mom was angry but let him try. She thought he'd see his mistake soon. My brother always liked to do things alone. He trusted his gut and did what he thought was best. But after a year, he hadn't gotten anywhere. His friends were learning in college, but he was just reading books and articles online. That wasn't enough. His friends said he needed college to be a doctor, but he didn't listen. He thought it would take too long. Time went by, and he never became a doctor. His friends graduated, but he never changed his mind and chose a different path. Now, he sometimes tells me he wishes he had acted differently. I want to make it clear with this story: being stubborn and thinking we're always right can make us lose our dreams. I'm not saying you can't succeed on your own. There are ways, but are you sure you can? Knowing yourself and your abilities is key to doing it alone. But remember, it's okay to ask for help. There are experienced people who can teach us to be great, to be who we want to be. We don't have to learn or decide alone.

The thing I like to watch change the most is technology. It has grown a lot in just the past 10 years. For example, now, you don't have to leave your house to get some food. It's not just changing on its own. It's also changing us and how we live. We don't even notice how much technology has helped us. Having less human contact because of technology is good for us. It has made life easier, more comfortable, and very interesting.\n\nTechnology has made our lives much easier. We use it every day to help us. It has really changed how we live, work, and relax. Now, you don't have to go to a library and look through many books for an answer. You can find it in 2 minutes without moving or asking anyone. You don't have to feel shy in front of a girl when asking her out. It's easier to just send a text.\n\nIt is also very comfortable. Technology makes us feel at ease, and our work too. Sometimes, we can't say things to someone's face. But technology lets us send an email instead. It has had a great effect on our lives. It also makes getting around easier. For example, a cell phone is small but does so much for us.\n\nLastly, technology is very interesting. It can do many things for us. It can teach us what people can't. People can only teach us what they know. But technology can teach us anything we want to learn. It's a great way to learn because it always gives you a full explanation, but people don't.\n\nIn conclusion, technology has a good effect on our lives. It makes life more interesting, comfortable, and easier. If you can't find an answer with a person, you can find it with technology. You don't need to talk to anyone to get an answer anymore. It has made our lives better. I am excited to see how it will grow and get better.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times.

For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return.

For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher.

But using your phone during lunch isn't smart. After lunch, students won't want to put their phones away. It's better to turn off phones and put them in lockers. One reason is that you might cheat on a test with your phone. Another reason is you could take photos of others in class. It's not bad to bring phones to school. It can be good because something unexpected might happen. But when the teacher is teaching, students often don't listen if they have their phones. This makes the teacher angry. I believe the rule should be to bring your phone but keep it in your locker. If I were a teacher and saw a student using their phone, I wouldn't be angry. I would just take the phone.

He was right; a talking machine took his job. Technology is making life tough for those without education, and even for those with it. I believe that less human contact because of technology is good for us. Not long ago, a robot built by humans took the jobs of twenty-four scientists. If we didn't control technology, we could lose even more. First, technology that limits contact helps everyone today. For instance, not all have good education, so not relying too much on technology isn't bad for many. This means more people can keep their jobs. People can use technology to talk or work without going into debt. Then, for safety, we should keep some technology, like self-driving cars, away from people. Take Tesla's self-driving cars. They can catch fire more easily, and escaping from them is hard. There's also a big risk of bad crashes because humans, who make errors, create these cars. Some argue that technology helps us live longer. It speeds up farming and lets us trade with other countries easily. But before technology was big news, humans lived for ages without it. They walked or rode horses to trade with other countries. So, we shouldn't rely too much on technology. We survived before it, even if it was harder. In the end, to save our planet and keep it livable, we must limit technology. Otherwise, we might make dangerous robots by mistake and risk wiping out humans.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

These can include a kids' play area, walking on trails, and jumping out of planes with a parachute. Most parks have these kinds of things to do.\n\nOne fun thing is the kids' play area, also known as a playground. It's mostly for kids up to 12 years old. It's handy because you can let your kids play there while you relax on a bench. Why do kids like it? It's a place for them to go out, meet other kids, and maybe make new friends. It's also good for them to move around and get some exercise.\n\nAnother thing to do is walking on trails, or hiking. You won't find trails in community parks, but you will in state and national parks. Walking on trails is enjoyable. You get to be close to nature. But be careful, you might see a dangerous animal like a bear or a snake. That could ruin your day. But most times, you'll have a wonderful time.\n\nThe last thing is jumping out of planes with a parachute, known as skydiving. It might look scary, but it's exciting once you get the hang of it. People like it because it feels like flying. It's also a brave thing to try. If you're not afraid of heights, you might like skydiving.\n\nIn summary, these things to do are great for parks, especially big national ones. Playgrounds are best for little kids. Walking on trails is good if you like nature and don't run into bears. Skydiving is for those who are brave.

First, we shouldn't have to join in if we don't want to. Second, we can choose for ourselves instead of letting an adult choose for us. For example, if someone uses your address to get a free hoodie without asking, they are choosing for you. But if they ask and you say no, you are choosing not to share your address. This is like school. If an adult tells you to do something you don't want to, then don't do it unless it's good for you. Our head of the school said all students must do one after-school activity. This means they are making us stay late and do things besides our homework or projects. Some students have sports outside of school. If I have to stay for an activity, I might miss my football game. Missing it could mean I won't show my skills to the coaches. So, I might not get to join a football team outside of school. Sometimes you have to do what you're told. Even though I don't like others making choices for me, since the head of the school says we must do an after-school activity, we should do it. I'll join an activity until I'm not interested anymore. It's just one activity, so it shouldn't be too hard. But I still don't agree with the head of the school about after-school activities. Some students might think it's okay because they need to improve their grades. But the only club that helps with grades is the homework club. Since the head of the school doesn't count that as an after-school activity, you might as well go to that club anyway.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

Thomas Jefferson always tried new things and did his best with them. I believe doing nothing is useless. It doesn't help you achieve more because you're not active. Reaching goals is important for your future and your family's future. These goals let you become who you want to be. They encourage others to believe they can do the same if they focus on their actions. In the end, not everyone is the same. Not everyone moves at the same speed because they have challenges.

Imagine you have a phone; you can call someone for a ride. On your way, you can read books, watch movies, play games, shop, and listen to music. You can do all this with technology; it's amazing. Does technology make people's lives better?\n\nI believe technology makes our lives better because of what it lets us do. For instance, I just got back from camping and forgot my camera's tripod. So I ordered a new one on Amazon. I love technology because you can choose fast shipping on some shopping sites. I always choose this fast option. Technology makes people's lives better.\n\nTechnology is powerful because it helps people buy things like car parts, shoes, clothes, and home goods. Imagine you move into a new home and need to buy stuff for it. You go to the store and get most things. But you still need two more items. What if you can't find them in any store? I would use my phone to buy them online.\n\nSome think technology is bad for us, while others say it's good. For example, imagine a person and his friend get a taxi. The driver talks to them. The friend feels it's rude to ignore the driver. This is because he was busy on his phone with headphones on. When the driver asks a question, he doesn't answer. His friend has to tap him to get his attention. This shows how technology can be bad for us.\n\nIn conclusion, I think technology is more good than bad for us. Sure, there might be some bad effects, but mostly it's good. For me, it will always be good. I think technology is wonderful. The people who create technology are changing the world.

I think that a longer school day would give students more time to learn and longer weekends to rest. But, they might not have enough time for their own activities. One reason schools should make the school day longer is that students could learn more. With more time in class, students would get less homework because they could do more work at school. Teachers could go over lessons better, so students would understand more. Schools would keep up with teaching; they might even get ahead. More time in class would also mean more hands-on learning in subjects like science. Students who don't have enough class time often do poorly on tests, only learning the main ideas. More class time would let teachers cover everything well. Another reason a longer school day for four days is good is that students would get a longer weekend. They could sleep more on Friday mornings and not worry about school. During the long weekend, students and teachers could spend more time with their families. Students could also play sports or do other fun things. With a three-day weekend, they could even take a short trip. The break would help them relax after a week of tests and homework. If they missed a day, they could use the weekend to catch up. Teenagers who are old enough to work could do so on weekends. A third point is that even though students would be in school more, they might not have enough time for themselves. Sports and jobs could be hard to do during the week. High school students who want to work might think about leaving school because of the extra stress. This could make their grades worse. With such a busy schedule, some might want to skip school. Younger kids might get too tired with the long days. It's not good to make them learn for so many hours. Teaching and learning for 10 hours over 4 days, with a long weekend after, is an idea to think about. I agree that a longer school day and weekend could help with learning and give needed breaks. Still, it's important to make sure students don't have a hard time finding time for themselves.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher.

But I believe that to succeed, I must learn from my mistakes first. I agree with the idea that success is moving from one mistake to another without losing your excitement. Making mistakes doesn't mean you should stop chasing your dreams. You should use your mistakes to help you achieve your dreams. People learn from their failures. If you've never failed, you won't know how to handle it when it happens. But if you've failed before, you should get up and use that feeling to push you toward success. My mother said, 'When you try hard, you will find success too.' Many people, including me, don't like to fail. No one enjoys failing. But in this world, you can't avoid making mistakes. Everyone must try to deal with failure. I failed a math class once. It stopped me from being an exchange student. Being an exchange student was my dream. I wanted to study in an American high school. But I failed. After that, I worked harder every day. Now, I am doing well in math, and I can be an exchange student from Thailand to America. Today, the big reason people fail is because they are lazy. This makes them not want to succeed. People are scared to be excited because they don't want to fail again. So, I think everyone should keep trying. If you work hard and don't stop chasing your dream, you will succeed.

We decide to try new things every day, and sometimes we learn from our mistakes. Mistakes can give us a fresh start or cause problems, but we always learn from them. People everywhere make poor choices, but they learn from them. Smart people like doctors, teachers, and even the president make mistakes. No one is perfect. Everyone has made mistakes, often more than once, and sometimes they don't know they've made them. For instance, a doctor might diagnose the wrong person. It's risky, but it's a chance to learn, even if there are bad results. Lawyers might wrongly accuse someone in court. What if that person was too scared to tell the truth and was actually innocent? Mistakes happen for many reasons, but we learn from everything we do. People make their own choices because they don't like being told what to do. This is true, not just a guess. People like to do what they want, even if it's not safe or wise, and they learn the hard way. People everywhere can make choices that change the future for themselves or others. Some save lives, help the homeless, or become foster parents. Choices can be good or bad, and they can lead to trouble. But every day, we make choices, big or small. We can choose to learn from our mistakes or not. Life is hard because we make many choices without knowing what will happen. Some people's lives are easier or harder because of their choices. Experts might not understand what someone is going through. People choose for many reasons. For example, a man with serious cancer might decide he's done making choices because he wants to let go. Experts might say to keep getting treatment. But it's not up to family, friends, or doctors. It's the man's choice. Experts can't make our choices for us. Our choices are our own.

I think these programs are good because they let students start jobs or college early. To do this, students must take extra classes in the summer or at night. I feel these programs help students get to college or a job fast and learn more. But, not all students can join these classes. I still think it's a good idea for high schoolers. They can quickly get better at working or learning. For instance, if a student knows about a job, he can leave high school and get better at it. Or if a student is really smart, he can go to college early and show what he knows. I like these programs because they help students finish high school fast, work on their dreams sooner, and maybe have a better life.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

Music, drama, and art should be choices because not all students like these subjects. If they have to take them, they won't do well and will get poor grades. Optional classes let students who want to learn new things do so. These classes are good because they can help you get a better job and make extra money. For example, if you learn to draw in art class, you might make money by drawing for a company's catalog. This can make you more flexible in life. Some students pick these classes because they are easy and fun. They go to class happy and try hard. I took guitar class for two years. It was enjoyable and helped me relax. It also helped me get good grades and improve my GPA. Students like me pick these classes for these reasons. It's better to have them as options so you can choose what you really need. This year, I didn't take art because I wanted to finish my subjects for an advanced diploma. If I had to take art, I couldn't have done that. Choosing classes that make you feel sure is important. Some students want to study art in college. They can start learning about it in high school to see if they like it. For instance, a student picked music but changed his mind when he found it hard. He realized music wasn't for him. Some think all students should learn art to gain a new skill. But I believe students should decide if they want to learn it. If they're not interested, they won't try and will get bad grades.

I think it's a bad idea to make the school day longer because students will have less time at home, and it will be too much for them to learn in one day. Students should not be in school for more than seven hours. If they are, they won't have time to relax at home. For example, if students are in school for six to seven hours, they will have seven to eight hours or more to relax at home. But if we add one and a half hours to the school day, they will have only six hours to relax at home before they have to come back to school. Also, students will have less time to do their homework. If they don't finish it, they might get in trouble. They might have to do homework during lunch or stay after school. They will also have less time with their families. Some people really value their family time and don't like to be away from them for school, work, or travel. It's not good for students to learn too much. It can hurt their health. When students have too much to learn, they may find it hard to understand and solve problems. This can make them stressed and upset. They might want to give up, which is not a good thing. They might also forget what they learned and need to ask the teacher for help. This can make both the student and the teacher frustrated. Another problem is that students might fall asleep in class because they are bored or tired. If we make the school day one and a half hours longer, students might sleep in and be late to school. Teachers won't like that. The school board should not make the school day one and a half hours longer. It will cut down on students' time at home and make it hard for us to learn so much at school. So, students should not have too much schoolwork. If they do, they might forget everything and could fail a grade, a test, a class, or even an SOL.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher. By the wrong person you talk to, you might accidentally start a riot.\n\nLastly, you should be careful on how honest you are to people, because you don't know whether they are going through some stuff you are pointing out to them. Being truthful to someone and saying everything to them might make them upset on how you view stuff in the world also. Honesty is like an opinion that may cause someone that went through something upset them drastically. This is why I disagree that honesty is the best policy. From the situation you are in say respectful stuff towards the person.

They could use them when it's lunchtime or when they are not in class. The phones should be off during class, though. This is a good plan because then you won't have to take away as many phones. You also won't need to call parents to get the phones back. Plus, students will not try to hide their phones. When phones are taken, some students get mad and argue. So, letting us use phones at certain times is better than not at all. We kids often have nothing to do when we are not in class. We could use our phones to text friends or tell our parents if we feel sick. We won't use phones in class because we know we can use them later. If you don't let us have phones at all, we will be unhappy. We might not listen in class and try to use our phones anyway.\n\nSincerely,\n\nSTUDENT_NAME\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

You prove to others that you can handle anything that comes your way. 2. Problems build your strength. The tougher the problem, the stronger you become. Sometimes, you might feel like giving up, but you can't. You must keep trying and stay positive. If you think negatively, you will lose to your problems and won't get stronger or show your best. 3. Proving to others that you can handle problems makes them see you as a leader. When people notice that you stay positive, keep trying, and don't let anything stop you, they will look up to you.

If not, you should know that camping is the most exciting thing in the world. It will be like a new world to you, where you'll see lots of nature and animals that you might have only seen in movies, but they are real! It also helps you get closer to your family. You can have fun together and learn important things.\n\nFirst, have you camped with your family where there was no internet? If yes, you might have missed your phone a lot. But think about it: is your phone more important than being with your family?\n\nIf you think 'yes,' you are wrong. Being with family or friends is very important. A family trip helps you talk more, have fun, and help each other. For example, you can all try to put up a tent or start a fire. Even if you don't know how, it will be fun to try.\n\nNext, camping can teach you big lessons. It can show you that living outside is hard. You need to build your own place to sleep, start a fire to stay warm, and you can't use electricity to talk to someone. These hard things make you thankful that many people in the world live like this.\n\nLastly, you will do many fun things. You can walk in the woods to find food, or look for animals like a bunny, raccoon, or even a big brown bear if you're brave.\n\nAfter your fun adventure, you can sit with your family and tell scary stories that will make you all shiver. Or, if they don't like scary stories, they can talk about happy times they've had. And for more fun, you can eat s'mores made with cookies, marshmallows, and tasty chocolate. That sounds great, doesn't it?\n\nIf you've never camped before, you should try it. Camping will give you great times with your family, show you the wild, and teach you about camping life.

Online classes are different from regular classes. They have set times when you need to be on your computer. When you learn at home, you won't have friends around. You will be alone a lot. However, there is one good thing about online school. Students like online classes because they can turn in work until 11:59 PM. This means they have the whole day to work on assignments. They can also look up answers online. I know this because I took an English class online last summer.\n\nLearning at home doesn't have many good points. It means you will be on your computer a lot. This can hurt your eyes. You might need glasses. The biggest problem with learning at home is that it's a lot of work. It feels like doing twenty times more work than at school. Also, no one is there to guide you like a teacher. You won't get help when you need it. You won't have as many friends as you would at school. You will miss out on fun events like prom. You will miss many experiences and it will be hard.\n\nStudents want to take classes at home because they think it will be easier. There are some good points. You can do your work any time before 11:59 PM. You can sleep in. But the work can take about seven hours a day. You can also look up anything you want. No one will tell you what to do.\n\nI think students should not take classes online at home. Online classes are not like regular classes. They have set times when you need to be on your computer. I don't think anyone should learn at home. It's better to go to school. You can have fun with friends and get help from teachers. School is important for your future. One day, your kids might ask you about your school days. So, going to school is more important than you might think.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

But some may ask if there are better ways. It's hard to set a good example because not everyone is affected by what you do or say. In this essay, I will talk about how people respond to influence, the kinds of personalities they have, and how they see each other. \n\nPeople respond to influence in ways that might seem strange, but it's true. Many people need help, but we don't see it because we're too focused on ourselves. We rarely try to understand what someone else is going through. We all have hard times and want to share our feelings, but fear of judgment or lack of trust can stop us. Those who can influence others feel great because they help themselves by helping others. They encourage people to share their experiences and move past their troubles. Talking about your own experiences can help many people relate. \n\nPersonalities are important because these days, people often don't value what others have done for them. They forget those who helped them share their problems with the world. Being kind is a powerful way to influence others because you truly want to help, and they can connect with you. For instance, many YouTubers share stories for views or pretend to be someone they're not. People might support them or not trust them. Over time, they become important, but fame can change them. They act differently because they want fame. Remember those who supported you and how they related to you, because your personality is what makes you stand out. \n\nHow we see others is a big problem today. People judge based on looks or actions. They judge because of how they were raised, but this is wrong. It stops them from getting to know others. How can people seek help if they're afraid to open up due to judgment? But they don't try to understand others. People like to judge and may think others are bad. If they want to influence, people might not connect with them because of how they treat others. They don't realize that the person they judge might be the one who can understand and help them the most. There are always different ways to help. \n\nIn conclusion, start by influencing yourself, and then help others connect with you through your actions. But don't expect anything from those who don't want to help. Expect the same from others. Today, anyone can be an influence, but not everyone will connect with your influence better than you can yourself. I agree with Albert Schweitzer. From my experience, I believe that being a good example will help me influence others in many ways too.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

Being true to yourself in a world that always tries to change you is a big win, and I'm thankful for that. The world tries to change us, but we shouldn't let it. We should keep going after our goals because we can achieve what we decide to. Life brings surprises, but we can handle them. We're stronger than we think, especially when we support each other. Some people quit when life gets tough because they lack motivation or support. That's why we should help each other to stay motivated. Remember, motivation is important. It helps us keep going. If you don't feel motivated, learn about it. It will help you understand your actions and feelings. Everyone has something that drives them; you might just need to look harder. When you find it, you'll feel like you've done something great. I'm 18 and still in high school, but I'm working towards my future without letting life control me. Being who I am is my biggest achievement because I stayed strong. My motivation helped me love what I do. Many people have tough starts, but they get better. That's what happened to me, and I'm very thankful. If you're struggling, find what drives you. Once you find it, you'll get back up. It's never too late to start. It's hard, but it's worth it. Stop and search for it now. Emerson was right, and I agree with him. Life is hard and can bring you down if you let it. No one can hit as hard as life. But winning isn't about hitting hard. It's about getting hit and still moving forward. If you know your value, go and get what you deserve. But be ready to take the hits and don't blame others for your problems. Don't be a coward.

Some schools let students learn from home using online classes or videos. Many students are lucky to study from their own place. They don't face the small problems of getting ready for school. Lots of students wish they could learn from home instead of going to a regular school. They could pick important classes that help them in life. Learning from home has big pluses. Students don't stress about reaching school on time. They can keep learning even if they are sick. They can study at their own speed. First, students don't worry about how to get to school. They can relax more without the need to rush. Being on time for school can be stressful. If you're late, teachers might get mad. But with online classes, there's no rush. You can learn any time. You don't have to hurry. Bad weather can slow you down too. If it snows, you might need to warm up your car. If you walk, you might get too hot or too cold. Second, students don't have to go to school when they're sick. Schools say to stay home to stop germs from spreading. With online classes, you can still learn without making others sick. Missing school is hard because you fall behind. Online students are lucky. They can study from bed when they're ill. If they miss a test, they can take it later. They don't get a zero while waiting for a makeup test. Lastly, students can study at their own speed. In regular schools, you can't always go as fast or slow as you want. There are other students, and the teacher can't focus on just you. But online, you can ask the teacher to repeat things. You can move faster through subjects. Online students can focus better without distractions. They can give the teacher more attention than in a regular class. Some schools in the United States let students take classes online.

This question comes up when we think about saving energy and resources. It also makes us think about the good and bad points of going to school for only four days each week. These days, saving energy and resources is something businesses do a lot because these resources are running out fast. But these businesses are also worried about the harm that could happen if they don't act. Many have started working only four days a week, but for ten hours each day. Schools are now looking at this new way of working too. Are they going to use the same four-day plan? But what if having less time to learn hurts the students? Most schools teach for five days a week, about eight hours each day. But now, to save energy and resources, they are thinking about four-day weeks and making each day two hours longer. I think it's a good idea to save the world's resources and energy. But I don't agree with cutting two hours of learning time. We need more time to study to reach our goals. With two hours less, we're just wasting time at school. For example, a student usually needs eight hours over five days to look at four assignments each day. That means they spend an hour and a half on each one to remember anything. Two hours less is not enough time to study. When we think again about saving resources and energy, we know it's important for our lives. We need to learn how to protect them. But there are other ways to do this without making the school day two hours shorter. For example, businesses or groups that care about the environment could make a special day for the Earth. They could do things like clean rivers, pick up trash, plant trees, and turn off factories that make smoke. Also, schools could use renewable energy, like solar panels on the roof, to save resources. I think this is the best way to do it without changing school or work schedules. Countries in the Arctic do this. They save resources and have work schedules that are easy to handle. That's why these countries are nice places to live and visit. Like I said before, schools don't need to make the school day two hours longer. It's not just about avoiding trouble. It's about keeping students from leaving home early and wasting time playing games or hanging out with bad friends. They should be in class learning and finding out new things to build their future. Working on tablets at home is not as good as learning in school. Many students don't use a tablet for work because they are either lazy or they don't get the topic and need a teacher. This wouldn't work with two hours less of learning time. That's why I don't like this plan to save energy and resources. We can find other ways, like I said before. In my simple conclusion, schools should stay the same because it's where students get ready for their future. It's also one of the few safe places for them. Making the school day two hours longer would be a waste of time and not give enough time to teach the students. While energy and resources are important for the world, there are other ways to handle them without changing how long businesses, factories, and schools can work and study. I believe we can make a difference with renewable resources without changing schools.

Should students have to take an arts class, or should they be able to choose? Students can pick these classes if they want because they have the right to. But if they don't want to, they can pick other classes instead. These classes should be ones students can choose, based on what they like, such as drawing, singing, or acting, or any other class they want to take. There are reasons why they might pick these classes on their own.\n\nThe first reason they should choose their own classes is to fill their schedules. After they finish their main classes like math, science, and history, students need other classes. These classes teach them about things they might not know yet. For example, in music, they might learn to play an instrument or sing the right way. An art class could show them how to draw and color in different ways.\n\nThe second reason is that these classes add points to their GPA for their high school diploma. Students should pick their own classes instead of someone else choosing for them. If students don't like a class, they might not go or pay attention. These classes could lead to new musicians, artists, and actors, but we can't be sure. Some classes, like computer information, might help them in their future jobs.\n\nThe third reason students need these classes is for fun and to take a break from hard study. These classes can be enjoyable and make good memories. For example, in my last year of high school, I am having fun with the classes I chose. I think students often take these classes because they need them to finish school. But sometimes they don't take them because they already have enough credits.\n\nIn conclusion, students can pick these classes if they want, or choose different ones, as they have the right to. They need to take them to fill their schedules and to finish school. These classes are good because they let students learn about many different things. In the end, these classes can give us fun memories. Some students take them because they are interested and want to learn more. But in the end, students must take them to finish school and maybe to enjoy their time in these classes.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

They can borrow books, shop, and play games alone. This is bad because people talk less in person. Now, they stay inside, looking at their computers, tablets, and phones. Not many people want to talk face to face. They would rather text or call on their phones. Technology gives all the info needed to finish tasks alone. It shows how to do work, projects, or research by yourself. You don't have to ask a teacher, tutor, or boss for help. People get books, buy things, and have fun without meeting others. They use technology to get what they want without going to stores. Apps bring things right to their door quickly. This makes people not want to go out. It's bad because it makes them hooked on their phones and computers. They might also lose their skills in talking to others. Less talking in person happens because of technology. People use phone calls instead of meeting. Some are scared or shy, so they text or call. They don't want to talk directly. Using devices at home changes how we live. It can hurt our eyes and make us not notice what's around us. Learning only from technology at home is not as good. If there's no technology, even for a short time, people don't know what to do.

Being busy or taking breaks, both are important. Taking breaks is important because working too much can make you sick. It also gives you more time with your family. First, if you work too much without stopping, you can get very sick. Working a lot can make you stressed, which can make you angry at everyone. So, for your health, don't work too much. Second, if you don't work all the time, you can spend more time with your family. For example, many kids grow up without seeing their parents much. Why? Because their parents are always working and not being with their kids. The kids often really need their parents to pay attention to them. Finally, some people don't think it's bad to not be with their kids. But, if they don't spend time with their kids, problems will come. Work is important, but being there for your kids is also very important for the family to be happy. In the end, I agree with the idea because people don't have to have a hard life. Many things can help a person grow, but family is the most important. That's when you need to do your best.

Secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later. They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.\n\nSecondly, If you are honest \"all the time\" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher. By the wrong person you talk to, you might accidentally start a riot.\n\nLastly, you should be careful on how honest you are to people, because you don't know whether they are going through some stuff you are pointing out to them. Being truthful to someone and saying everything to them might make them upset on how you view stuff in the world also. Honesty is like an opinion that may cause someone that went through something upset them drastically. This is why I disagree that honesty is the best policy. From the situation you are in say respectful stuff towards the person. It might make you a better person if you are not saying negative things towards a person too.\n\nIn conclusion, I disagree with \"Honesty is the best policy\" by the situation you are in with the person and what they are going through.

Simple words can change many lives. Every nice thing you do fades away; it becomes less and less until it's gone. It won't come back because it's not just one error that caused trouble. You can't undo it because it's done, and it affected others. It caused them problems because of you. You did it so they could learn and not repeat their mistakes. Sometimes, people must do the right thing to finish a task, fix something, and help others.\n\nNo kind act is too small to matter. You can't take it back. Once, my dad had a rough day because of work. I asked him about it. He said he helped a friend. Then his friend decided to move states because another friend encouraged him to leave. So he moved to New York to be near his mom. That's why my dad was upset; his friend was leaving. Also, his friend moved because someone else suggested going to his mom's place. My dad helped his friend but still had a bad day.\n\nKindness can touch people's lives. Also, I told on my sister. What I said to my mom got my sister's phone taken for a month and grounded her for a week. For instance, my mom took her phone to teach her a lesson. Words can get someone in trouble. They can make her feel sad and angry. Words can upset people so much that they stop talking to their siblings. They might choose new ways in life, so they can learn and not make the same mistakes.\n\nPeople can change because of what others say. Hurtful words from someone you care about can cause pain but also make you stronger. Words can change people for better or worse. It all depends on the situation. Words can affect people, but sometimes you need to say things that can help others.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

I don't think so, and here are three reasons why. First, a student can only learn from and speak with the teacher. Second, a student can leave anytime because no one is there to stop them. Third, a student can cheat on tests, quizzes, and exams without the school knowing if it's true or not. That's why I believe online learning and video calls are not good options.\n\nA student in online classes only hears the teacher and misses other students' ideas. They might be too scared to ask questions or talk to the teacher. They can't get help from anyone but the teacher. If the teacher is mean or teaches too fast or slow, the student might not understand. The teacher could upset the student without realizing it. The student might just leave the computer. This is a benefit you lose with online learning.\n\nA student can stop learning whenever they want. They don't have to stay for a set number of hours like they do in regular school.\n\nA student can do anything because no one is watching them. For example, they could be on their phone or have other websites open, and the teacher wouldn't know. They can take their computer anywhere, like to a fast-food place or library, and the teacher can't control them. The most a teacher can do online is report the problem to the school. This problem doesn't happen in regular schools.\n\nA student can cheat easily online. They might cheat on homework, quizzes, or tests. For instance, a student might get help from a friend or family member during a test to pass and help their family. Cheating can happen in many ways. It might seem helpful, but it's always wrong. This is another thing that can happen in online learning but not in regular schools.\n\nThese are my reasons against online school. It has some good points, but I think it shouldn't be used unless there's no other choice. You can cheat, go anywhere, and only talk to the teacher.

How are you? I hope you're well.\n\nI know, Thanksgiving is coming, and we all want to talk about our plans for the holiday. I sure do. Five days off school\u2014that will be great.\n\nBut there's something more important than that, like saving energy and resources, right? So, let's talk about that.\n\nDo you know what it means to save energy and resources? You probably do. But I'll explain anyway. It means to use less energy and resources.\n\nI just found out that some companies work only four days a week. They work ten hours each day. They do this to use less energy and resources.\n\nEnergy.\n\nIf we have two more hours of school, we will use a lot more energy. We will use computers, smartboards, air conditioning, and lights more. These things use energy. When you turn on a light or any electrical device, you use energy. So, if the school doesn't want to waste energy, it shouldn't make the school day two hours longer.\n\nWater.\n\nWater is another thing we will use more of at school. Students go to the bathroom a lot. Sometimes they go just to avoid class or to use their phones. They play with the water, even though they don't pay for it. And I don't know about you, but I don't like to waste water. Water costs money here\u2014someone has to pay for it.\n\nMy opinion? If the school wants to save energy and resources, it shouldn't make the school day longer by two hours. If it does, the school will end up using more energy and resources every day.\n\nWritten by\nGeneric_Name\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times. Sometimes you have to say what's right in order to not hurt someones feelings from what you said. For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return. Secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later. They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.\n\nSecondly, If you are honest \"all the time\" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher. By the wrong person you talk to, you might accidentally start a riot.\n\nLastly, you should be careful on how honest you are to people, because you don't know whether they are going through some stuff you are pointing out to them.

Honesty is like an opinion that may cause someone that went through something upset them drastically. This is why I disagree that honesty is the best policy.

I don't think so. I think staying in high school for four years is much better. After four years, you will have a better idea of the job you want. If you finish in three years, you might need to take summer classes. You might miss out on fun classes or have to be in school more hours. That's why I think it's better to stay for four years and not rush things.\n\nI want to say that if you're in high school for only three years, you might graduate without knowing what job you want. I'm in my third year of high school, and I still don't know what job I want. I could be a mechanic or a doctor, but there are so many choices. It's better to have more time to figure out what job you want.\n\nAlso, with only three years in high school, you have to think about your classes. You'll need to take all the important classes first. This means you won't have many fun classes to choose from. If you do take fun classes, you'll be in school longer each day. This means less time at home, less time with family, and working late if you have a job. So, think about how a three-year high school plan would work. You might finish early but you'll be in school more.\n\nFinally, you might think, 'If I'm in high school for only three years, I can go to college early.' But what if you still don't know what job you want? It's better to take your time to figure out what classes you'll need in college. You might also think, 'I can start working now.' That's true, but you can work while you're still in high school anyway. I hope I've made you think about your choice. I believe it's better to stay in high school for four years instead of three.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

If students take these classes, they can help them pass the year. In school, we have many classes that help, but sometimes students don't like the electives. They skip them and then they fail. They can't finish school because they don't have enough credits. Also, Army is a good elective class, but not everyone likes it. Maybe they don't like the shoes, jacket, or pants. But the school has many classes that can help students pass the year. For example, I have an art class. I don't really like art, but it helps me pass. The teacher is very nice. He is patient with us and never gets mad. So, elective classes are not always bad. Sometimes students just don't want to study or work hard. They want things to be easy. If students want to finish school, we need to be on time, do our homework, take part in class, and listen to the teachers. We must follow the school rules, be friendly, and go to every class. If we do these things, we can be good students.

No matter what, people will talk about your choices, whether they are good or bad. I hope people act on their feelings, not on what others want them to feel. If you have a problem, ask trusted people for advice. Hear them out. Then think about it and decide which ideas to use, but do it your way. Use this to solve any problems you have. That's why I think people shouldn't just follow what others say. Why not trust your own ideas?\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times. Sometimes you have to say what's right in order to not hurt someones feelings from what you said. For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return. Secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later. They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.\n\nSecondly, If you are honest \"all the time\" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher.

Yes, they should because this helps them stand on their own two feet and not need help from others. Also, people should trust their own gut and thoughts, not copy others. But not everyone thinks this way. Some say we should ask for advice from those who know more when it comes to big life choices. They believe this leads to better choices. For example, without expert advice, people might not do as well in life. Still, some think it's better to get advice, but they are mistaken; we should listen to our own thoughts. When you trust your own thoughts and gut, you don't need others to help you. For example, those who trust themselves are more likely to do well. We should stick to our own thoughts because they are often the best for us. Not everyone always makes the best choice or has the best thought. But if it's your own, you should go with it. Don't always follow others because they aren't always right or the best. Someone who always copies others and doesn't believe in themselves might not do well. Like a student who cheats and gets caught, they face trouble. It's the same here, but instead of trouble, it shows they can't do things alone. Be yourself and trust your own choices. Value your own gut and thoughts. This makes you independent and you won't need others to make choices for you. Trusting yourself and not copying others is key to doing well and being true to yourself.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

For example, if you are feeling sad, you can go to the park, watch the kids play, and join them. When my little brother is upset or not happy, my mom takes him to the park. He plays there, runs around, and starts to feel happy. Many kids get bored staying home all day. They need to go outside to run or play on swings. But these days, many kids stay inside because of technology. They play on their iPods or iPhones and watch TV. I think it's not good for kids to stay inside all the time. They should go out and enjoy being young. When I was young, we didn't have many parks in my country. So I would just play outside. Kids like park activities because they are fun. They can run and play games like soccer. Even without parks, we played games like jump rope and tag. Kids need to go outside and play. My brothers always play on their phones. They don't want to go out when my mom tells them to. They would rather play on their phones. This is bad for their brains. My mom has a hard time getting my brothers to go outside. When we were in my country, we didn't have iPods or phones. We were only 6 years old. So my mom didn't need to tell us to go out. We would always be outside and come back in the evening. Now, I don't go out much. I go to school and then stay on my phone. I don't go to the park. I think this is bad. Kids should enjoy being young and make memories. Going to the park can make you feel happy and creative. Staying home all the time can make you feel sick and lazy. On weekends, when I'm on my phone, the day goes by quickly. But when I go out with my family, I have a good time. I like being outside if I'm with friends or my mom's friends. Last summer, my aunts, my mom, and I would walk to the park.

In the end, I believe there are many ways for older and younger students to help each other during the program. In the end, when older and younger students work together, one good thing is that older students can help younger ones with schoolwork or homework. This works because the older students often know the subjects that the younger students are just starting to learn. Another way they can help each other is when an older student needs to study for a test. Younger students can help by asking them questions.

For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return. Secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later. They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.\n\nSecondly, If you are honest \"all the time\" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher. By the wrong person you talk to, you might accidentally start a riot.\n\nLastly, you should be careful on how honest you are to people, because you don't know whether they are going through some stuff you are pointing out to them. Being truthful to someone and saying everything to them might make them upset on how you view stuff in the world also. Honesty is like an opinion that may cause someone that went through something upset them drastically. This is why I disagree that honesty is the best policy. From the situation you are in say respectful stuff towards the person. It might make you a better person if you are not saying negative things towards a person too.\n\nIn conclusion, I disagree with \"Honesty is the best policy\" by the situation you are in with the person and what they are going through. May cause them to dislike themselves in a way you wouldn't know.\"\n\nExample essay 2 of score \"3.0\":\n\"CURFEWS SAVE TEENAGERS\n\nBy Generic_Name\n\nCurfews are a great way to keep teenagers safe and out of trouble.\n\nTeen teenagers who spend too much time on the streets are more likely to get in drugs, curfews will prevent teenagers from spending too much time in the streets.

But, having online classes at home should be a choice. It can be easier for some people. For example, a girl who is pregnant or has a baby might have good reasons for not going to school. Some students might not go because they have jobs. Being able to take classes from home can help. This is true when classes stop because of snow or very hot weather. I believe the main thing is to keep studying. You can do this with online classes or homework. The big goal is to finish school and get a diploma.

It's a choice that affects your whole life. Students are too young to know what they want to study. They need to grow up more. They should try different classes in high school before making a choice. If they have to choose too soon, they might pick a career they don't like. It's better to wait until they have tried various classes over the four years of high school. Then they can find out what they really like.\n\nStudents have lives outside of school that can be tough to handle. Balancing school with friendships is hard. Every family has problems that affect students. Often, students don't know how to handle these problems. Starting high school is when a lot of dating and friendships begin. This can be overwhelming and make it hard for them to concentrate in school.\n\nWhen students move from middle to high school, their brains grow and change.

Do you agree or disagree?\n\nI disagree because they are too young to pick a job as they start high school. A job needs a lot of responsibility, and they need to learn more before choosing a job path. To choose what you want to do for your whole life, you need to know a lot and be ready. I think that if students get good grades, like A, B, or C, and pass, they can think about a job in the 10th grade, but not in the 9th grade. So, I don't think students should come to high school and pick a job right away, especially since half of the 9th graders are failing.\n\nFirst, some students who start high school don't know about being responsible yet. A job is a big deal, usually for older students. By the 10th grade, if they pass English 10, they can pick a job and prepare for it. They can choose any job they like, such as nursing or fixing cars, and then study for it.\n\nSecond, if they are 16, they can pick a job, but if not, they can't. They are too young. Like me, I didn't get a chance. I wanted to be a nurse, but I couldn't. Now, I think I'll go to college to become a teacher, or I'm not sure because I also think about being famous, like acting in a movie. As a junior, I still don't know what job I want because we didn't get to study other things. I wish we had more choices in school, not just nursing, because not everyone gets a chance, even if they try.\n\nThird, I think they should talk to students about jobs before 10th grade and ask if they're ready for a job. But they are young and shouldn't have to choose so soon. If they are 16 or older, they should be allowed to pick a job, but if they're younger, they shouldn't. They should learn about jobs but not be pushed to pick one.\n\nIn my opinion, they shouldn't let students pick a job because they are too young and need to learn about being responsible. For example, my best friend, Generic_Name, is in 9th grade and knows about responsibility; she looks after her little brother and knows she wants to be a soccer player. She is good at soccer and is a nice and good friend. We need more 9th graders like her who know about being responsible. But there are 9th graders who don't even respect their teachers and families, which shows they don't know about being responsible yet. They should respect their teachers and families because that shows they are responsible. Some students who start high school don't respect others, even those in higher grades. That's why they shouldn't pick a job first; they need to show respect to their teachers, families, and themselves.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

My cousin has taught me a lot by saying things like, \"Don't do this because bad things could happen,\" and, \"Listen to others.\" What people tell you matters. If you mess up, you might remember their advice. You can avoid trouble if you listen to someone who knows about it. You might avoid bigger problems.\n\nOne reason I think learning from others is important is that you can think back on their advice if you make a mistake. My cousin's warnings showed me not to make the same bad choices he did. He wanted to keep me safe. I see that my family wants to protect all of us from harm.\n\nAnother reason is that you can learn from others' stories without making the same mistakes. If you're tempted to do something wrong, ask your family if they've been through it. They can advise you, and you might think twice. My cousin shared his mistakes with me to keep me from taking risks.\n\nA third reason is to avoid worse problems. Before you act, think about what could go wrong. My cousin's advice, \"Think first,\" sticks with me. Remember what your family says. One day, you might pass this wisdom on to your kids or younger relatives. Bad things can happen, and you want to avoid that.\n\nThese are reasons why learning from others is important. Your family often knows best from their own experiences. Trust them and avoid things you can't handle. Do what's good for you. Life may be different for everyone, but trusting others' words can help you. Think about your actions and make the best choices for yourself.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

This is because they have jobs after school. If they are in school for 10 hours, they can't go to work. It's tough for students to work at night and then get up early for school. They get too tired.

But is that really true?\n\nImagine this: if you dress in all black and look scary, can you work at a daycare? We must admit; people want us to look just right for them.\n\nTake the beautiful models, for example. They need to be skinny and have the perfect body. But are they happy? Everyone might want to be a top model. But it's hard. We only see their beauty because that's what we care about. We don't try to look beyond what they show us. And you know what? We fall for it. We try to look like them because that's what we think we should do.\n\nNow, let's talk about our feelings. Do you think famous people are real with us? They show us their \"real life.\" But is it really them? They act the way we want to see them. We like that. We try to copy them, have what they have, and live like they do. We aim for what we think is \"perfect.\" But what about how we feel? How can we love others if we don't love ourselves? I say this because if you can't accept yourself, how can you love yourself?\n\nSo, when we show the world who we are, we must ask, \"Am I really being who I want to be?\" People will always judge you. It doesn't matter who you are or who you try to be. It's tough. Sometimes, you must act differently for your job, school, family, and friends. You might be scared to lose them or what they give you.\n\nThat's how our world works. It's not easy. We live this way not because we want to, but because people have different ideas of freedom. They often try to control you instead of letting you be yourself. I believe that being true to yourself, despite the world's pressure, is the biggest success.\n\nSincerely, Ralph W.

I believe we can't fully control who we become. Our parents, the people around us, and our friends shape us.\n\nFirst, our parents shape who we are. They guide us on what to do. They teach us right from wrong and want us to do well in and out of school. They help us make good choices and tell us to keep going. They push us to work hard to reach our dreams and become who we want to be.\n\nNext, the people around us shape us too. They tell us what's going on in the world. They are there to help and make us feel valued. They help us move forward and remind us that we are good people. They guide us to have positive experiences.\n\nAlso, our friends influence us. Sometimes they push us to do wrong things. They can lead us to make bad choices we haven't made before. They might tell us to follow them, even into trouble. Friends don't always guide us correctly. They might lead us down the wrong path.\n\nIn the end, John Lubbock said we can choose who we are. But I think who we are is shaped by our parents, the people around us, and our friends. Lubbock said we can be who we want, but I think we are shaped by things we can't control. Our parents, the people around us, and our friends have a big impact on us. We can't just choose who we are because we are always being influenced by others.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times. Sometimes you have to say what's right in order to not hurt someones feelings from what you said. For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return. Secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later. They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.\n\nSecondly, If you are honest \"all the time\" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher. By the wrong person you talk to, you might accidentally start a riot.\n\nLastly, you should be careful on how honest you are to people, because you don't know whether they are going through some stuff you are pointing out to them.

Have you ever seen a program that includes both older and younger students, or thought about if they would like each other? Older students know more because they have been around longer, which helps them solve problems. They can also make better friends since they come from different places. They can think of good ideas for a project because they have different life stories. The program is good for both groups because they can do things like contests, and they can learn from each other to reach the goals they set for their class, especially if they work together.\n\nFirst, this program is good for both older and younger students because they can do contests. Both groups will try very hard because they either want to win or do well in the program. They will use their time well and focus on their studies.\n\nThere is a saying, 'Education is the key to success.'\n\nWhen students compete, they study more to reach their dreams and to make others believe in them. Contests make students work harder and help them succeed.\n\nSecond, this program is good for both because 'they can learn from each other.'\n\nFor example, if I work with someone three years older than me on a project, it's easier to finish it. We come from different places and were raised by different people. This helps us learn from each other because we will want to know about ourselves. When we find out we are from different places, we will want to learn about each other's lives and how we do things. Learning from each other is good for us, especially when we understand what we like and don't like.\n\nLast, both students benefit from this program because they can reach their class goals, especially if they work as a team. There is a saying I remember, 'Two heads are better than one.' For instance, if one person can carry twenty out of fifty books, then two people can carry all fifty books or even more. The students have goals and dreams. But since they want the same thing, they will work together to help each other reach their goals.\n\nIn conclusion, both students will gain from this program because they can compete and work hard to achieve their dreams, to learn about each other, and to help each other aim for their goals. The benefits of a program that pairs older and younger students to support each other are listed above. Students can get help from those who are older, younger, or even from a different race or gender.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

Many students wonder about this. I'm here to tell you why it's a good idea. After-school activities are very helpful. They give you chances to work out, learn new stuff, and meet people. Students should do these activities because they are good for your health, your brain, and your social life. When you play sports, you move your body. You have to work out often and eat well if you play sports. This makes you stronger. Being on a sports team means you might lift weights. This can make you healthier. You will feel better and more relaxed if you play sports. This is why I think students should do after-school activities. You can learn new things. You might pick something you don't know much about. Trying a new thing can show you if you like it. If you find something you enjoy, you can get really good at it. You will know more things. Learning can help you understand the world better. This is why I say students should try new activities. I know some students don't want to join these activities. It can seem hard. But try to find something fun. You can meet people. You can make friends who like what you like. This is why I think students should get involved in after-school activities. It's good for students to do an activity outside of class.

Fashion is important today. Every young person tries to follow the latest shoe trend, and it's the same with clothes. Your store would do better if you started selling fashionable items. Selling both shoes and clothes would be a new thing. Not many stores offer both, and I think people are bored with the usual brands. It would be exciting to have new options now. \n\nClothes and shoes are more than just things you wear; they show who you are. Some people like wearing pink, and some don't.

I learned a few words in my English class. The school year was almost done, and my English teacher had not given us any books to read. The tough part was when summer was over and school began again; I had forgotten all my English. The next summer, my counselor talked to my new English teacher. She said I needed to read a lot in English. My counselor asked her to give me books for the next summer. She did, and it really helped me get better at English. I didn't forget anything. Some people think that teachers should not make summer projects because students won't have time to learn what they want on their own. But I think teachers should make them. They can make projects that help students get ready for the next year. This way, students won't forget what they learned because they keep learning. \n\nMany people say teachers should not make summer projects. They say this because students won't get to choose what they learn. For example, students are stressed during the school year. They want to relax by watching TV, playing games, and spending time with family. But students can still do these things when teachers make projects. Students have the whole day. They can do the projects and still have fun. \n\nThe first reason teachers should make summer projects is to help students get ready for the next year. Teachers know what students need to learn. They know how hard the class will be if the student is not ready. For example, some students are not good at math. They get no projects in the summer. When they return to school and take a harder math class, they struggle. This is because they had no project to work on in the summer. Also, students don't know what they will learn in new classes. It's hard for them to make their own projects. \n\nThe second reason is that projects from teachers help students remember what they learned before. If teachers make projects, students can review and keep learning. Some students are far from home on vacation. But they can still do projects from anywhere. These projects might be on computers. Students can spend 10 to 15 minutes on them. So, they learn and have fun in the summer. Projects from teachers help students keep learning. This makes the next year easier for them. \n\nIn conclusion, teachers should make summer projects for students. This helps them get ready for the next year. Students can't make their own projects because they don't know how hard the class will be. Also, they keep learning with the projects from teachers. I think if teachers don't give students summer projects, they won't study. Teachers know what students need. Summer projects help students during the summer. That's why I think teachers should make the projects.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

Some people think it's good to rest, but resting too much isn't always good. 'Staying busy' means different things to different people. To me, it means studying, doing homework, or finishing housework. For others, it might mean working, researching, or helping others. In the past, before technology, people were more physically busy. They didn't have social media, phones, computers, or emails. They did everything with their hands. But now, many people sit at home and use technology a lot. This can be bad or good, but often it's more bad. It has led to health problems like being overweight, diabetes, and more. Staying busy can also include exercising. I think if you work hard, you can reach your goals, as long as they are possible. Famous scientists like Albert Einstein, Stephen Hawking, and Thomas Edison worked very hard. They changed our lives.

I think that students should pick a job path in their first year of high school. Picking a job early helps you pay attention to your schoolwork and your future. First, students should pick a job that is good for them. They should pick a job that pays well and makes them happy. The school will offer the classes they need to reach their goals. These classes can be tough, but don't quit. Quitting won't help you meet your goals later. Next, schools should have classes for the jobs students want. These jobs can pay a lot or a little. For example, being a doctor pays a lot, so schools should have the right classes and resources for that. Schools should also help students get scholarship money for college. This money can help pay for college and let them follow their job path after high school. But, students might want to switch their job path after they start their classes. Some schools might not have the right classes or resources for all jobs. For example, some schools don't have what's needed to become a professor. They might not even have enough teachers for some classes. These are some downsides of choosing your classes early in high school. If you start on a job path, you can change it after a year. If your school doesn't have the right classes, you can move to one that does. You can also take online classes if there's no teacher for your job path. In conclusion, I think students should pick a job path in their first year of high school. Picking a job early helps you focus on your schoolwork and future. You shouldn't quit because quitting won't help you reach your goals.

I believe it's key to make a good first impression. You never know who you might meet out there. Your future can depend on it. First impressions matter a lot. From what I've seen, you should always try to make a good impression. That's what my mom taught me. You might meet your future spouse or your next boss. For times like these, you need to look nice. My mom has said this to me since I was little. I still follow her advice. I also share it with my friends. Once, my boss came to the store where I worked. It was the first time I met him. I went up to him, said hello politely, and made a good impression right away. I have a friend who gets up late and sometimes skips brushing his teeth or taking a shower. His parents get mad when he doesn't clean up. He gets upset and fights with them. I try to give him my mom's advice, but he won't listen. He's not doing well in life. First impressions are a big deal. They can shape your life. They help you meet and talk to people. But if you ignore this advice, you might end up like my friend: not doing well.

I think students should learn at home because there are fewer things to distract them than in regular schools. I say this because schools have many things that take away attention. Students might not learn well or might fail because of this. For instance, students often get to class late because they spend too much time with friends and don't watch the clock. When they are late, they miss learning and also stop others from focusing. Learning at home is good because there is no rule about when to be there. Students can learn quicker. Some students are late to school because they wake up late. Being late means missing lessons and bothering others who are trying to learn. At home, you can learn without waiting for others. If one student doesn't understand something, the whole class has to wait. This slows everyone down. But, there are also reasons why learning at home might not be good. One reason is that at home, students might not have a set time to study. They might wake up late and not study much. Also, at home, things around them might be too familiar and cause them to lose focus. In the end, these are my thoughts on why students should be allowed to learn at home.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

Some go to school just to pass time and do nothing. School is important, and we kids need to realize this and not waste the teachers' time. I know school can be tough, but it can also be simple if you try, because you can do anything if you set your mind to it. But sometimes, teachers should treat us kids with more respect because we deserve it. Just because they are older doesn't mean they can treat us badly; nobody is perfect. Everyone has good and bad times, so don't judge someone by how they look because you don't know what they're dealing with. Life is hard, so we shouldn't waste time in school. It will be even harder in the real world when it's our turn to succeed. I love track and field; I run for my school, and it's very hard. I want to be a track star in the future because I love it and it pays well. But track is tough because it's very tiring. Running can make you feel like giving up, feel bad about yourself, and get so mad that you want to react badly if someone says you're not good. But winning races makes you very happy and proud of your hard work. Track can also cause pain and sleepless nights, making you wonder why this is happening to you. But if you want something badly, just work hard. All the effort will be worth it one day, and I believe it will because God is with us. So work hard for your dreams; if you want something, go for it.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

This helps them teach and affect others. But I think that giving examples is not the only way we can learn. We have many ways to learn. We can learn from everything that happens to us, the good and the bad. If we do something wrong, like stealing or trespassing, we can get into trouble. We might go to jail. In jail, we can decide to be better people. Schools should take students on trips to see the worst parts of cities. They will see where drugs are sold, where there is a lot of crime, dirty streets, and homeless people. This will show them what could happen if they don't work hard in school. They will want to do better in school because we can change our thoughts. Seeing people in bad situations, with crime around them and no police help, will make students think about their future. They will want to avoid living like that. I think we can change our lives in many ways. For example, going to jail for a small crime can make us want to improve. Jail can be a place where people decide to make better choices. Some prisoners can go to school while in jail. This helps them when they get out. They don't want to waste their chance to be free. They learn that crime is not a good way to live. That's why jail can be a place that changes people. Another way to change people is by having programs with people who are missing arms or legs. They still do many things and don't always need help. This teaches us to be grateful for our bodies. We should not complain. We can work and live well, even if we are missing a part of our body. People with disabilities can work without complaining. So, we should too. Life actions are not the only way to change people. Many things can change a person's life. Getting in trouble with the law can change us. Meeting people who live well without an arm or a leg can also change us. That's why I think life actions can help, but there are other ways to change and make good choices.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

The teacher asked us if we wanted to work alone or in groups. Some wanted to work alone, others in groups. I chose to work by myself. I had a hard time and didn't know what to do.

They work better together.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times.

The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher.

You enter your and house sigh with boredom. Once again, the rest of your family is out participating in activities, and you are left alone at home with nothing to do. This situation has occurred to many people that don't participate in any extracurricular activities. I believe that all students should participate in at one least extracurricular activity because students will able be meet new to people, a find passion new, it and gives something them to do.\n\n If are you looking to meet new people, joining an extra activity curricular is great a it way do to. Is it to easier friends make with people whom share you common with interests. , so it be will less difficult for you to talk to has someone who joined the same club as you all because of the in that people at least club share the common interest of subject the of the club. Participating in the same activity and being in the same room encourages you to talk to people. When I swim am practice at, I am encouraged to talk the to people my in lane because are we swimming together for one and a, half hours so why get to not know them? Because of this, I have made new friends outside of school, and I regularly spend time with my new friends outside of swim practice as well. New people meeting only is one of activities benefit extracurricular, however, there are many more.\n\n Is it hard to hidden discover if passions you ' don t new try and activities different. These through, new activities you could that discover you strong have a in interest robotics that you were not of aware before. If you find an activity that you are passionate about, your life will be much more exciting and enriching. It can also help you figure out what type of career you want to pursue when you grow up. Naturally, people will want to pursue careers that are related to subjects they are interested in. So, it will be much easier for you to decide because you have discovered your passions and talents at an earlier age. My father signed me up for theatre one year, and when he first told me, I was apprehensive. I am naturally a shy person, so I didn't think that I would enjoy being on stage in front of a large crowd of people. But I, up ended really enjoying the whole participated experience and that theatre in for camp three more years. Also, when first I started piano taking lessons, I that thought it be would a waste huge of time. But, I found that I was quite talented at playing the piano, and I enjoyed creating music that my family and friends would loved listening to. Extracurricular activities help you uncover new passions, and they also provide you with something to do.\n\n Participating in an extracurricular activity is a productive way to use your time. Students many come home and waste on time the or internet social media because they have better nothing do to. There is nothing worse than coming and finding home out that your child spent hours four watching a cartoon. on TV Give an activity would them something to think about or allows to them their spend time somewhere. productive When I have nothing to do at home, I play the piano because it is a great way for me to use excess time and I enjoy doing it. On the days that I am not at swim practice, I would feel like I have too much time on my hands. But, I have other activities extracurricular scheduled for days those. like meeting with my math team or piano lessons, which prevent me from experiencing painful boredom. These are only a few reasons why students should participate in extracurricular activities, and it can be seen that there are significant benefits.\n\n In conclusion, students should participate in extracurricular activities because they give you something productive to do, they help you find new passions, and allow you to meet new people. Every student should choose one extracurricular activity to participate in because of the plentiful benefits these activities provide.

I think that some parks do have activities that you can do like in a state parks they have fun and interesting activities that you can do with your family. community parks may have some interesting activities that you and your family can do, but in some community parks don't have interesting and fun activities that you and your family can do. community parks only have were everybody can go to the park and have time to spend with family. A national parks do have interesting and fun activities that you and your family can do, and a national parks may have some holiday activities that you and you family can try.\n\n I that think community parks, state parks, and national parks can provide wide a variety fun of and interesting activities, for example a national park have some activities that can your let kids it try or the whole family try it can together, and they have can a holiday activities where you and your family can try it together. in a state parks they have might some activities you that can try with your family, and they have might a father son and completion, like a fishing completion how are to build an boat and can you try it to see and if work it to see if it floats on water. a community parks may have some activities that you can try in the summer, like for example a community park may have an activities like the '' mud run'' is were they are lots of activities that you can try and they have a race were you have to run throw mud and everything.\n\n My first reason about community parks, state parks, and national parks is that some have activities that you can do and some don't, for example a community park maybe have some activities that you can do or maybe they don't have activities because it is a community park were everybody can go and have a cookout or were you can take you kids and play or walk with you friends or do whatever you want. community a park is were you can like do somethings go for walk a you or can or swim a have family time or maybe you can a pay sport like there soccer football or or anything that you want to do. community have parks may interesting some activities in the summer you can that do if you don ' have t to nothing do summer this.\n\n My next reason is that community parks sate, parks, national and parks have things different, like for example community park a where people is have go and fun or if they having are a family time. A state park may have some activities interesting that you can try your with or family kids, and could it be fun. a state park could have a holiday activities or just a park that people could go and spend time with family and maybe they can spot some interesting activities they see. A state park may have really cool and interesting activities that can you with try friends or or family with kids your in the cause summer they put fun interesting really and activities that you can try with your friends or kids family or.\n\n My final reason is community parks, that state parks national, and parks different things have, like for example a park community people is where go and have fun of having a family time. a state park is where they could have some activities for kids and family. a national park is where they have lots of activities that you and your family could go and try it. And they might have a holiday activities that kids and family can try. A national park is where there is lot of activities that you can try, like in the summer they have lot of activities that you can try with your friend and family and you might like it. A national park may have so interesting activities that you can try and the park might be big for everybody that are coming an trying the activities.\n\n Community parks, state parks, and national parks have different thing, like for example a community park is where everybody goes and have fun. A state park is were they might have interesting activities that you can try and you family can try to. A national park is they where have can and interesting that fun activities can with try your and kids family. parks community, state parks, and parks national from are different each other cause don some ' interesting t have activities.\n\n Community parks, state parks, national and parks so have different many things that parks some don t ' have, like a community park are people were go have and fun family with. their State a park may some have interesting activities that you and your family try can. A park national has interesting fun and activities that you do can with friends your and family.

Mom helps my me preventing from bad things. For example, one day my friend and I wanted to go to the store walking by ourselves and we asked my mom if we could go but, my mom didn't let us because she said we could get kidnapped. Like day, my mom and her friend were walking by their self 's and they almost got kidnapped so, we didn't go. It is important to know people's experiences so, you won't do the same mistake as the other person did, learn from their experiences, and help you from preventing bad things. Experiences are always shared. Are they very. important\n\n The first reason why you should share experiences with people is to prevent yourself from doing the same mistake as the other person. You can also choose a better choice. Example for, one day, I went the to I doctors and had to get flu shot the , but I didn ' want t because I it ' don t like shots. Then, my mom told me that one day, she had to get the flu shot and she didn't want it so, she didn't get it and the next day she got sick so, then I decided to get the flu shot. Doing the same mistake as the other person is not as fun so, listening to people's experiences is a great way from preventing the same mistake. Many people make mistakes and from learn them. Mistakes are always made but not when you have already been warned.\n\n The second reason is to learn from experiences. From learning another s person ' experience help can by you how knowing to do something good. Like one day, I was doing something wrong and my teacher came to me and talked to me so, I wouldn't do it again and showed me how to do it in a better way. Doing in things better a way be can much easier more. Never give up when you can ' something do t, Just keep or trying ask for help. Something learning is new everyday a thing. Another example, is when didn I ' t know how bake to cake a and aunt my me and help the was cake very baked. good Is learning a very fun and exciting experience.\n\n Reason third so is, they help can from you preventing bad. things Bad things never take somewhere you good. One time, My sister I and misbehaving were and we thought we wouldn ' get t in trouble we and hitting were 3 my old year sister because she hit us with a, bat playing around and we got grounded we afterwards and couldn ' t go to the pool anymore. When you need a opinion you whether should something do not or anyone just ask so, would you prevent doing something bad. Help anyone from preventing something bad. Bad things never come out the best. Working hard is always the thing best to do.\n\n Finally, Prevent doing everything that is bad and ask for opinions on whether if you should do it or not. Also learn from your pass mistakes and do something better and easier. Sharing experiences can help people choose a better choice. Things easy become can in better life. Try something new everyday and better. Change people better into people get when they the best advice. People always have the best advice to give.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times. Sometimes you have to say what's right in order to not hurt someones feelings from what you said. For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return. Secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later. They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.\n\nSecondly, If you are honest \"all the time\" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher.

The reason I'm telling them to not do this is because their lungs are going to get ruined,and they will not be able to breath good and they might need an oxygen tank. Also if they do it over and over again they will get addicted and probably they're going to do it for their whole life. Another to not reason do it is because if they might give to one it their of or friends them tell try to and it they might addicted get to it.\n\n My second lesson to tell is to not get in trouble specially when you're about to get six broken pillars because the you're going to have to go to a meeting with your parents and all your teachers or sometimes just you and your teachers. Also if you do get the six broken pillars then you are to going have lunch and detetention hang not out with your friends at and lunch you will probably want to hang out with friends and your just not stay there and stay quiet for the lunch whole. Another rason you don't want to go is BIP why? you ask well BIP is a room where you go if you did something bad.\n\n Third don is ' t do dumb like stuff get in for trouble running in hallways the, fighting play, or talking back a teacher to. The all of I things said the are dumbest reason get to for in trouble specially when you ' re a on rush to get to or class lunch. Other reasons to get in trouble is being tardy and if you're tardy you will get a broken pillar unless you have a note from a teacher or an excuse.\n\n Fourth is reason to involved get school in activitys basketball like, track, soccer, volleyball, or play you whatever. It is because good helps it yoiur muscles be strong you help stay strong. Also to try keep your grades up not and bring them because down you then re not ' to going able be participate to in events specially important in events.

If you are to honest self your then can you honest be with your love ones like youre family, friends, and the all people are that there you for when you need them or when you have a problem will they always help you.\n\n thats shows to be honest with the you ones love because you once lie to them you wont stop laying, that and can you get to have consequences only because you just can ' t be honest with your friends, and family, and the all people that are you around if they are there for you and if the trust you dont pay them back laying with to them just be honest because if you lie to them you will lose the family that was there for you you when need them those friends that were there to help you when you have a problem.\n\n like for example laying is the reason why many people ruin there relationships. laying is the reason why people dont work out because, they dont have trust on each other that the only thing that they think about is to to lie each other because they just can ' t find a way to be honest and however some people might end up because hurt you were just laying to them the whole time and sometimes someone when is hurting another person is like hurting self them because they can ' t fix all that pain that they to did others thats why think about what are you going to do or just say take time and about before saying something that it would other hurt thats people why think about it twice not just acting like nothing happen think about what other people can feel, think or say.\n\n if you are honest to others you will have a normal life with honesty not just with lies and all that stuff that can hurt other people . another if example you go an to of work interview if you there get and the boss starts giving you a question to answer, and the to question first the boss gives you or who ever is doing the interview to that first question if you say a lie to that question is not going to end up good because if the person who is doing the interview keeps on asking questions you and you are just saying lies then thats not, going to work at all because now you cant stop laying can you can ' t your control self after saying a lie then you will not have the job because you were just laying and laying to others is like laying your to self.\n\n all i got to say is to be honest with your friends, and family and all that people that has been there for you when you need them. just be honest if you re going to say something that is not honest and a its lie then don t ' say think it about it twice anyway try youre best on what you do don ' t your life life lies with because the at end you realize will what you said was wrong and it was en the truth then you will see at the end that what you did wasn ' t honest even that some people think that laying is the best and when you say a lie and another lie and that people that you love your family, and friends your once they Belize you and when they find out you that lie just to then they would never believe you again.\n\n i think it would happen on the same story that my mom told me once she said that a long time there was a guy who used to have sheep's he lived in Small town and she told me that the guys one day that he was outside feeding his sheep's he started screaming for help saying that the wolf was trying to attack him, and then everyone in the town went outside to help him but when half of the people that lived in the town got where the man was they saw that there was nothing, then the man with the sheep's started luffing because the people of the town actually believed him then the next they the man with the sheep's started screaming again and saying the same thing he said before the people of the town believe him again then the people of the town got mad at hi and then they left next the he day started screaming gain and this time the men was truth saying the but it was too late because no body of the town came out to help him becuase they were thinking that if he lie to them two time he might be doing it again then the man was scared and keep on screaming that the wolf was eating he's sheep's but no body help him because they thought the he was just laying again then at the end the wolf eat all the men's sheep's and no body of the town believe him ever again and the man stayed all alone because no body believe him.\n\n i learn a give lessen only because of this story because this story is telling me to be honest with others, if you say a lie and you keep on saying it they won't believe you because you were laying all the time so be honest with your self and others.\n\n you can if ' say t something don honest ' t say you that something retreat will, and thing about it before you of wait you will hurt. others\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases;

Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times. Sometimes you have to say what's right in order to not hurt someones feelings from what you said. For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return.

They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.\n\nSecondly, If you are honest \"all the time\" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth.

It is better to work alone,the other side say that it is better to work alone because we can be responsible and confident ,how ever it is not .Although people some argue might it is to better work, alone actually it better is to work in group because we can finish work our and quickly can we learn get more or more get knowledge.\n\n The first reason that explains that it is better to work in group because we can finish our work quickly. For example in my history class some of the students to choose there do there work own and some of them choose them to do work by a group the student finish that early will get a price the and students choose that work to in group earlier finished and the got price. It is better to work in group if we because would have done not the group in work would not finish early and won the price because we have done our work group in won we the price. it to is better work in group finish our to work quickly. It is to better work in group, the second example support that this is; there was man who had to fix a lot of cars ' in two days, and get money for his house rent could he not do it by his own so called he his friends to him help and helped they him they did the work he in group and finished his work quickly and also he payed for house his rent. It is is better to work in group because if the man had not finish fixing the cars' he would have been on the street but because he worked in group he finished his work quickly and payed his rent. It is better to work in group to finish our work quickly.\n\n The reason second It is is to better work in group because we know can or learn new things. For example i didnt know how to do pay chart for my chemistry presentation and i asked my friends to help me and they say lets teach each other i group and and they though how to do it and i did it i got on it 100. it is better work to group in to know new things, because if do i didnt pay my chart and present i it would have got 0 my in grades but because worked i in and group i learned got i 100. It better is to work group in to new learn. things it is better work to in group to learn more the second that example support this there is was a girl she did know how not to swim and her sister and thought brother how her to swim and also they teach each other how to in swim ways different in group and learned she how to swim. it is better to work in group to know or learn new things if she did not learn how to swim she could have got in the water and died and she would not know how to swim in different ways but they taught her in group and she learned how to swim. Is it better to work in group we so can learn things more.\n\n The other side might say it is better to work alone because we can be responsible and confident however we can be more responsible and more confident if we work together in group. For example there was a lot of kids that was learning how to learn a bike but there was on kid that fell confident and he did not want to learn with them, he was 11 years old he was so confident that he can ride a bike by him self but he could not ride the bike cause he was not not in the group to learn how to ride a bike, so he feel when he ride the bike and hurt his leg. It is better to work in group, the if kid learned had how rid to a bike in group the he would not feel but felled he his hurt and leg, because he though he could do it self by him. Is better it work to in group. Is it to better work to alone be responsible the second example that explains this is was boy there that i know he wanted leave to by him self and got in to big a house but he could not the afford rent. it is better to work in group if the boy had worked in group and payed the rent with the group he would have afford the rent and leave there but choose he work to so alone he could afford not it.\n\n Although some people might argue it is better to work alone, actually it is better to work in group because we can finish our work quickly and we can get more experience or get more knowledge.\n\n It is better to work in group ,because working alone is not better than working in group, when we work in group we will be more safer we can accomplish things easily , finish quickly and learn a new things, it is better to work in group to susses.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

Some people think being that else in something this world an is. accomplishment Feel they that change is a good way to succeed life in. I agree with the, quote I to believe be myself in a that world is trying constantly make to me something else is the greatest is accomplishment a truth because being help yourself you to be honest, to be more secure of being who you are and people love you you because show and yourself you not are trying to be someone else.\n\n Firstly I, believe being honest the all time has to being with do yourself, and makes honesty be you yourself. Being honest is good because people believe in your words, and if you are doing something good people are going to do it too. Some people are always to lying someone be else to impress people other, and lie to other impress people is not good every in because lie final the will affect your life. I think if people like really be to close of will you they accept mistakes your, it is like you are when starting to know someone and tell you him how you are.\n\n Secondly, to be secure of how you are is being yourself. Think people that changing way the they are is going to change the past, they what or did how they look before. They think that just because they change their faces they will change the bad way they treat people, but a lot of them change because someone hurt them and they don't want to go back to the past full of bad memories. Love other people how they are and they t don ' want change to anything because they secure feel.\n\n Lastly, just because you are yourself people will love you and because you don't try to be something else. People treat you as you show what kind of person you are. You demonstrate if yourself to they people not will doubt. People love people who show their self, how they really treat other people or how they really act. When you don ' t show yourself to people they think will you lying are and maybe are telling you them truth the but you are being not yourself, but you when being are yourself and you are telling the truth they have will confidence more with you.\n\n As you have read I agree with the quote because that's the way that I think. I feel that being yourself in a world that try to make you something else is a accomplishment, but most of the time a lot of people think they want a change, but to a better way. People hurt you in life and you change because of them, they make you more stronger. I feel that don't changing is a good way to feel satisfy of what you did right in the past, and that is why being yourself is an accomplishment.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times. Sometimes you have to say what's right in order to not hurt someones feelings from what you said. For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return. Secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later. They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.\n\nSecondly, If you are honest \"all the time\" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher.

Know I that achieving a goal it is one proudest of the we activities for can make ourselves. But thinking and working about a goal everyday it is not the best idea. We do have because not time for ourselves also, need we to recharge our minds in to order continue an activity doing, and stress come will to our lives.\n\n , firstly to become in world successful this, we a need routine based productive on things and also for time to ourselves do what desire we. We need time for ourselves to relax an enjoy what this world offers us. 5 years ago I remember when my parents were too busy to have a day off and to take care of me during the school year. My dad was working in a construction company from Monday through Saturday, and my mom was studying at the university. We did not have time for ourselves to have a deep conversation and enjoy a day off at home. We needed a break time during that moment, but once the Spring Break came, we stopped our routine. My parents and I were happy because we knew that we have time to make some fun things, and we stopped worrying about school, work and study. After the break we were ready and exhausted to start our routine again. Having a break between activities help us to give time to restart our minds.\n\n , secondly Humans are great able to accomplish goals, but time is. required When I was in middle school, my teacher always gave us time to relax and stop what we were doing at the classroom. According to my teacher, inactivity provides us energy it and a way is going to to be able continue to or classwork activities at. school\n\n Practicing this helpful activity was to me, because I concentrate could on even more my activities school at. Additionally, when classmates my were tired they, ask the teacher for break a because they need to that clear time their from minds worries and stress.\n\n Friends and my needed I time a where we can interact others with. When I get to know with a new person it makes me feel important to that person. We need time not for only activities and responsibilities, we also need time to rest and stop worrying about work in order to recharge our minds and become successful.\n\n , finally stress can you lead to. depression Is it to hard how imagine hard life can. be Concentrating by more even on your activities required fun than activities, here it comes side its negative. People some might quit their by goals not having time. for themselves Example for my; when brother big went, to college he needed money to pay college and utensils. He was to required at work a restaurant to earn some money. Once he started going to college and working at the restaurant. I noticed that he was super exhausted, stressed and quiet. He he felt was able not to college finish. After a couple of days he quit college and his job, because of not having time for himself he stopped trying to reach his goal. He could reach his goal but too much activity and stress led him to depression. Breaks are important as activities in our lives.\n\n Many claim that the more early and rapidly you start doing your activities, the more chances you have to get things done. Additionally, some believe people breaks are that not important and beneficial on a achieving goal and, it should not be required to us; however, taking a between break your activities it is to change going your life. Because you have time to recharge your mind, also you have time for yourself, and stress does not affect your well-being. Life is short do not let activities lead you to depression take a break and start again.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

Think I that having a problem is a chance for you to get back up try and again when because having a problem not only you can learn from your mistakes but you see can what you did and wrong ask that someone succeeded has to find a better way of helping you. You can also observe and look through what others around you have done before.\n\n You can from learn your mistakes by observing the what people around you have done that has made succeed them. Learning from your mistakes isn ' t always as bad as it you think might be, it ' s a place for you to over start with a fresh start knowing that the skill you have before tried ' doesn t work, and that you know what to do before working on the work previous you had done. For example one day you might come across a challenge on a project that you will certainly find hard, so you have to make mistakes over and over to build up a good relationship with that project. If, you had a relationship with someone and you made a mistake, that doesn't mean you have to end your relationship you can work things out and practice on being a better person and learning from your mistakes. You will have a certain point in life where you face a challenge and have to try again over a thousand times because that's a time in life when you need to see where you are going with yourself and how you want those mistakes that you have done go in life therefore, that's how you learn from your mistakes.\n\n When you across come a problem you shouldn ' t always be the putting worry on yourself, you can someone ask for help in fact you need to someone that ask went has already through a problem as similar as so yours can you ask for advice on they how dealt with that situation. Asking someone for help you can feel make better because someone already has dealt with problem the you that are through going and they enough have on experience problem that. For example are there scientist who across come mistakes and they get back up and try their very best for a long time so that they can get good a result, Math teachers some face hard questions they fail, get back up and do the they best over can and over again until they the find right problem to solution the question. We all come across problems everyday, but that doesn't mean we give up we fight back until the problem has been solved even if it takes days we still try our best to solve the problem. We when face a problem is our that time to our get and chance do best our asking by people for and help from learning our mistakes. Usually when people are working on a project that has been assigned to them by their professors or teachers they seem to ask themselves if they are doing the project right or they second guess themselves, how would you know if you're doing it right or not when you haven't asked the person that has assigned you that project, or someone that has already proceeded to succeed.\n\n I agree that a having problem is a to chance your do best because that you way can proceed to succeed asking by peers you around for help or you get can up back learning by from your mistake and observing others do you what ' re doing. You should always tell a friend or someone that you feel comfortable with about what you are going through and how they can help you and comfort you.

Second reason is that to be your, self important is find to out we who are? and what is the purpose that we want to achieve in our life thats one step. Last reason is that if you are your self the world is on your side with that you have a big weapon to make a different. Thats why I agree with Emerson statement that \" To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishments\".\n\n The world constantly trying is make to us become something else, the but world humans is us.\n\n One or a group or persons can be either good or bad influences to our life's .They literally can push us to do anything if we given them the control of our lives .For example in the United States we have a higher percentage of shooting in high school's and stores. Majority the of them are commitment by or two more persons. The police reports I that had, they read constantly give more years in jail the to main responsible. One to me of them a was influence bad, they become a for obstacle selves them and for that they those kill. fairly of both get them to for pay what have they. done However thats why we need to know who do we call friends and family because they can push you to do things that maybe you don't want to do they become obstacle. Furthermore if you do get to anything that they, want you totally your lose self and always be the way that they want you to. be Thats why we need to find out who we are find, our self and purpose a.\n\n Important is that we find out who are we and what is the purpose that we want in to achieve our. lives To me in personal is hard to know everything about me, some times I do things that I never though about it. There is phrases that one is me inside it of \" say If don you ' t yourself know how you pretend to others know \". That phrases reflects to me how do we pretend to go against the world if we don't even know who we are? We basically do what we see on the world .There is violence ,murders,economical problems ,rapists,robbers, and more. In addition this how important include to is us give a purpose. Is important it because if you are focus goal on your. For example you want to be a Doctor you spend a lot of time in studying and working that you would forget about what is going on in the world , you going to ignore problems and others people lives and be focus with yourself to achieve your purpose. You ones get to yourself be the is world on side your with and you that made a different and that a big becomes accomplishment.\n\n The personality works better when is positive and you have a good heart, you get to support others and they support you .If you have everything under control you know who you are ,and your purposes ,the world would be on your side. That makes different a to you others and, successful and become great a to influences others. The for example majority us of have read documentaries about persons that the had impact world become to better.\n\n For example Malala , she was a young lady who decides to fights a against her government to get the right to study, in her country women wear not allowed to go to school. Malala was very confident in believing in her self and she knows what the purpose was, pass the time Malala achieve her accomplishments now thanks to her and all those that give their support ,women are allow to have education. Is malala great to believe example be that yourself is a accomplishment greatest.\n\n In conclusion, the world and people behaviors can be a big obstacle to us, it can be friends or families members, thats why we need to know our self and learn how to know others. It is important to give our self a purpose,so we would get focus and ignore the problems that are going on in the world and while that time we would be founding our self .\n\n Ones have confident we about our self know and the in purpose our lives would everything be very. different The world be would on our side thats a and big supports weapon to others and help the to world become better. In my opinion agree I with the idea that be your self a in that is constantly to trying make something you else the is greatest accomplishments.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

However, keep some things to yourself if you think it's not positive to say to another. Second, It might make the person feel bad if you do say something harsh to them. Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times. Sometimes you have to say what's right in order to not hurt someones feelings from what you said. For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return. Secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later. They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.\n\nSecondly, If you are honest \"all the time\" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher. By the wrong person you talk to, you might accidentally start a riot.\n\nLastly, you should be careful on how honest you are to people, because you don't know whether they are going through some stuff you are pointing out to them. Being truthful to someone and saying everything to them might make them upset on how you view stuff in the world also. Honesty is like an opinion that may cause someone that went through something upset them drastically. This is why I disagree that honesty is the best policy. From the situation you are in say respectful stuff towards the person. It might make you a better person if you are not saying negative things towards a person too.\n\nIn conclusion, I disagree with \"Honesty is the best policy\" by the situation you are in with the person and what they are going through.

They what to want do in? future Schools should partnerships with companies because it helps students to know what's best for them for example, what they are interested in, get opportunities to explore the world, and helps students to communicate with others.\n\n One reason why it's beneficial for students is that they get to know what they are into. If students get a chance of this internship, it allows them to work with other people. When they'll work with different people with different cultures, it will let them know how to work and handle other people. They'll be able to do what they want to and they'll have an experience too. There are many students who don't know what they want to do or what they want to be. Joining this internship will help them to work and decide what is best for them. Many times they don't get an opportunity to know what they would like to do. There are many students who would just take any class with their friends even if they don't like because they are in difficult situation and don't know what they want to do. So, they just decides to go with friends and have an experience if they like it or not. Later on they quit that class because they feel it's not what they like. It also is a trouble for school because counselors then have they change to students schedule is which trouble very making sometimes. The on other if they hand get chance a through it internship help will them sure for to know what they are in interested. So in the future they won't get confused what they wanted to do but didn't get an opportunity to know.\n\n Next reason that is students get so opportunities many explore to the world. It is difficult or very to close impossible that get students a to chance learn about world the. This is great to explore the world and learn new things which many students want, but bad luck not everyone get to explore. Exploring world the or learning new things is for really students good. It them to allows know how the and is world what they can get future in with working other people. Getting an opportunity from this internship is very beneficial to explore the world because this makes students know how to work with other people. It helps them learn to different about and cultures make friends new. When they explore the world they can get to learn new languages which makes so much easier for students to get job anywhere they want to. If know they different languages will people accept their for application internships or for jobs. In United, States most the of times people for look students who speaks than more language one because helps it them to their make companies effective more in good way. Students ' don t hesitate to others to talk especially, they when know so many languages different which them makes feel they can achieve anything want they to.\n\n Last is that students reason will be to able communicate and understand is it how to talk others with from this internship. It happens most of the times students might know so much about what's going on but they don't get to talk. A there is reason they don ' talk t with others is that they feel shy or not confident on are. themselves Schools if let them go or participate for internships will it allow them to more become. confident When students will get an internship to work and talk with other people they won't feel shy anymore and will feel confident by practicing.\n\n Communication is the most important part of our lives if students don't talk they won't understand what's happening, which can destroy their school lives. In schools or outside the schools, communication skills be must improve best to yourself. If don students ' communicate t don they ' get t or ideas don t ' learn really new things. Communication students allows get to chance the and gives to them right speak. When they will speak they'll feel confident and won't care what other thinks.\n\n Many people argue thats it's not great for some students because it already have so many things to do like they have games or jobs after school. However, if schools have partnership with different this companies could the be best for students opportunity experience to what they interested are in, world discover the, and and become confident communicative. Make this will know students that they can what do want they to.\n\n In conclusion, by working with other will companies help students to make their more decisions confidently and not feel shy to about them. It also could help them to know what they wanna do in their lives. This partnership allows students to learn new things and languages which I think is very difficult without internship. I think students should get internship this improve to help and themselves.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

They think of all the things they can do when they get home. like fly a kit or playing football, not thinking about school in the sliest. One now take a and half hours of those students ' free time them from away. May this a be realty if the board school there gets way.\n\n If I asked students if they wanted one and a half hours added to there school day they most of them would say no. ' people s toughs may vary when it comes to topic like a this. I would only approve one and a half hours being added if school gets a later start time. As a student my self I would say that exercise is very important, but extending school time will take from that time. Most high schools end at three o'clock, if the board adds one and a half hours schools will end four thirty p. m.\n\n May this be a good because thing students will more have to time instead learn of doing of nothing. Some children are worst of then others some are homeless and some are with out parents this would be a good time to learn so they could be better off. That parents work nine five to jobs wont have about worry to leaving there unsupervised child. Will they be more increases in work and ethic discipline. Less homework will be assigned because the student will have more time in there classes.\n\n The reason I disagree is because this would hurt not only the student but also the local government's economy and the tax payers. If the teachers work they more hours then have to will be payed more money. if the local has government to them pay more money there going then to people tax more. That means there that income tax will be higher. Tax payers would boycott the the additional tax comes that the with one and a half hour change.\n\n This is why adding one and a half hours would not only hurt student but also the local government's economy and the tax payers. In retrospect the board should layout a plan that works for students, parents and the economy. There are some to pros plan this But, there cons mostly. I the hope of head the and members consider board not enacting this time extension.

However, keep some things to yourself if you think it's not positive to say to another. Second, It might make the person feel bad if you do say something harsh to them. Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times. Sometimes you have to say what's right in order to not hurt someones feelings from what you said. For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return. Secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later. They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.\n\nSecondly, If you are honest \"all the time\" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher. By the wrong person you talk to, you might accidentally start a riot.\n\nLastly, you should be careful on how honest you are to people, because you don't know whether they are going through some stuff you are pointing out to them. Being truthful to someone and saying everything to them might make them upset on how you view stuff in the world also. Honesty is like an opinion that may cause someone that went through something upset them drastically. This is why I disagree that honesty is the best policy. From the situation you are in say respectful stuff towards the person. It might make you a better person if you are not saying negative things towards a person too.\n\nIn conclusion, I disagree with \"Honesty is the best policy\" by the situation you are in with the person and what they are going through.

Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times. Sometimes you have to say what's right in order to not hurt someones feelings from what you said. For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return. Secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later. They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.\n\nSecondly, If you are honest \"all the time\" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly.

It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing.\" According to Thomas Jefferson ' inactivity s quote is not way a to achieve our goals and we, might always be and working striving on our goals. It is hard to think that the more effective way to be accomplish is being busy and always doing sometime. Although some people say that we accomplish more when we are inactive than when we are always doing something because we have more time to set our goals, actually we accomplish more when we are always doing something because we have more time to keep working on our goals to achieve them soon and we don't waste time that can be used to work on our goals.\n\n Some people that say we accomplish more when we are inactive than when we always doing are something because we have time more to set goals our. Main the reason why people those say that serve an inactivity purpose important is because they more get time to what think want they to do their in life and their have goals already planned. According to the York New times the people take who a moment of inactivity usually are they and confident sure what about want they to make in their life, and what goals want they to set achieve and. In they addition more are they motivated and more effort at they goals..\n\n We accomplish more when we are always something because doing we more have keep working time to on our goals to achieve them. soon Being always active and working is the best way to achieve our goals. According to a study of Generic_School the, the all people that is now successful, always they working were on their goals and never moment had a they where thought that they to had stop and wait because the accomplishment was to about come. Always we to have be working, our goals will never come easily. While we keep working on our goals, they will came to us soon.\n\n We accomplish more when we are doing always something because we don ' t time waste that be can to used on work our. goals Sometimes when we are working hard on our goals, there's a time where we think that we have to stop and rest, but we shouldn't do that because that would be a waste of time that would be used to keep working. The right person to say that is my dad, when he was a teenager and already graduated, he wanted to become an Industrial Engineer, but he didn't want to go collage after he graduated. He wanted to wait and be inactive at least one year before to enter in collage, but that was a big mistake because at that time he didn't get a job, so he used a part of the money that he would have used in collage. Now he is not Industrial a Engineer, never achieved he because his goal he wasted the that time use he could to achieve goal his.\n\n Though some people say that inactivity is effective more than activity be accomplish to because a is better way to set our goals, activity is best the way to accomplish because be can we our achieve more goals soon and we don ' t waste useful time. In conclusion, as you can see inactivity will not be the best way because the reality is that if we can done our goals and get a lot of wonderful things just being always active. Stop and have a good moment of relaxing might be awesome, but nothing like have what you want in our life and done things that will show out our effort and dedication.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

However, keep some things to yourself if you think it's not positive to say to another. Second, It might make the person feel bad if you do say something harsh to them. Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times. Sometimes you have to say what's right in order to not hurt someones feelings from what you said. For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return. Secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later. They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.\n\nSecondly, If you are honest \"all the time\" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher. By the wrong person you talk to, you might accidentally start a riot.\n\nLastly, you should be careful on how honest you are to people, because you don't know whether they are going through some stuff you are pointing out to them. Being truthful to someone and saying everything to them might make them upset on how you view stuff in the world also. Honesty is like an opinion that may cause someone that went through something upset them drastically. This is why I disagree that honesty is the best policy. From the situation you are in say respectful stuff towards the person. It might make you a better person if you are not saying negative things towards a person too.\n\nIn conclusion, I disagree with \"Honesty is the best policy\" by the situation you are in with the person and what they are going through.

However, keep some things to yourself if you think it's not positive to say to another. Second, It might make the person feel bad if you do say something harsh to them. Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times. Sometimes you have to say what's right in order to not hurt someones feelings from what you said. For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return. Secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later. They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.\n\nSecondly, If you are honest \"all the time\" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher. By the wrong person you talk to, you might accidentally start a riot.\n\nLastly, you should be careful on how honest you are to people, because you don't know whether they are going through some stuff you are pointing out to them. Being truthful to someone and saying everything to them might make them upset on how you view stuff in the world also. Honesty is like an opinion that may cause someone that went through something upset them drastically. This is why I disagree that honesty is the best policy. From the situation you are in say respectful stuff towards the person. It might make you a better person if you are not saying negative things towards a person too.\n\nIn conclusion, I disagree with \"Honesty is the best policy\" by the situation you are in with the person and what they are going through.

Secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later. They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.\n\nSecondly, If you are honest \"all the time\" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher. By the wrong person you talk to, you might accidentally start a riot.\n\nLastly, you should be careful on how honest you are to people, because you don't know whether they are going through some stuff you are pointing out to them. Being truthful to someone and saying everything to them might make them upset on how you view stuff in the world also. Honesty is like an opinion that may cause someone that went through something upset them drastically. This is why I disagree that honesty is the best policy.

So if might you ' heard ve one Michelangelo from. Michelangelo was a great artist that once said \"The greater danger for most of us lies not in setting our aim too high and falling short; but in setting our aim too low, and achieving our mark\". Don I ' t agree with this statement the because greatest danger lies in us in setting aim our too high falling. and short Statement Michelangelo the what is said negatively impacted because it cause can us to stress and make act us different. negatively\n\n Greatest the for danger us most of lies in setting our too aim high and falling of short because stress. By setting our aim too high, stress can make us feel like giving up on what we want to accomplish in our lives. We do if we this will hopeless feel and not try again. Another reason why stress is to related is it because this make can us feel tired and lazy. If we become tired and lazy it can make us overthink and have negative thoughts. These are the reasons and examples of what stress can do to us if we set our aim too high.\n\n The greatest danger for of us most lies in setting too our aim high and short falling it because can make us act different negatively. If we focus so much on setting our aim high it can make us forget important stuff. For example, it can make us forget to have quality time with our family and friends. We would lose the connections towards our family and friends if we are only focusing on one thing. Another is it reason can make act us bad and forget our manners. For example if we focus on setting our aim too high and spending so much on it all day it can ruin our sleeping schedule and cause us too act cranky. These are the reasons and examples of acting different negatively if we are setting our aim too high and falling short.\n\n Some people think greater the danger for most of us lies setting our in low aim too and achieving our mark. They think that because if we set our aim too low we won't be caring so much on what we want to accomplish. For example, if we are just trying to rest or relax for a bit, they think we don't actually care on finishing our tasks. Another reason why they probably think that is because we won't be focusing on important things in life if we don't accomplish our goals first. For example if, we don t ' the show in effort front of them they will automatically assume we don ' t show in accomplishing interest it and think don we ' t really care what we want do life in. Even though this may be true, I still think that the greater danger for us is setting our aim too high and falling short because it can cause more problems.\n\n The statement what Michelangelo said is negatively impacted because it can cause us to stress and make us act different negatively. Make it can us stress if set our we too aim high and making us different act negatively we if focus too much setting on our aim too high and falling short. By setting our aim too high it can cause us to be stressed and make us feel like giving up and not wanting to finish our work. It also can us make stress by not getting enough sleep were if only focusing one on thing. Are the these reasons why I disagree Michelangelo with because he agrees that the greatest danger most for of us lies in our setting too low aim and, achieving our mark.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

They are an important asset to us because without them honestly everyone could potentially be out of control; we need their help and it's not wrong to need or ask for help. Some people may need it much more than others, but that's why their are guidance counselors at school it you don't feel comfortable telling a parent or people who need legal help have lawyers to get help from them we can't just do whatever, we need help all the time no matter how little of a thing it may seem. I don't think it's to wise to just let people do what they want because they feel like they don't need help or advice on something. Going instinct off or just ideas isn your ' the t it way should be. We don't know what kind of ideas some people may have.\n\n Should people be to able their make own choices, but little a of bit guidance making the when decision wouldn ' t anyone hurt. You sometimes really do need the whether it help ' s from your mom, to police a or officer a lawyer. Not everyone likes to seek for help when they need to make a tough decision and I get why it can be difficult asking others to get involved with the things we do. If we were to follow all our ideas and instincts do you really believe this world would be the way it is right now. Not probably, we can humans make some really choices bad not, everyone but we have good a handful of that people don t ' care what about they, do say or they who hurt. If was everyone just going instinct off this world would definitely be up all messed and the over it place ' be d way up more messed than it already is. We are human we can't go off whatever we feel is right in our minds because that could land you in trouble and it may not even be worth it. We have to ask for help when we need it matter no who it ' s from coming. Asking for someone just can advice a make difference in many ways. We told get what do to a for we reason help need and rules. We have people many around us to talk to. Help seeking is it never bad change your can mind about the littlest ideas to really important the ones.\n\n The people that don ' t they think need s opinion anyone or on help a wise making are decision really the people need that most the help. Here is an example in a TV show I watched not to long ago this teenage girl took her life but didn't ask for help from anyone she just wanted people to know she was upset but who was going go know when carrying around a big smile. The point is that not every person has the mentality we all think so differently and getting professional help from someone who sees or hears things like that we may feel or think is normal and they can give us the answers we would never find on our own.\n\n It's really important for everyone to understand that you can't just do whatever we please. Are consequences their absolutely for everyone roaming around wild ideas with and you thinking can just do what your mind telling you is. For instance would you feel comfortable knowing we just do whatever whenever because we don't have limits or rules or would you like to see a friend fall because they put their pride over getting help. I not sure would enjoy a close seeing friend family or getting member dragged down they because were ignorant and decided not to for look with help their when problems they it the most.\n\n In conclusion agree I with help from seeking experts instead of weirdos having go off what they is think right I because won probably ' t think the things same others do. I'd rather see people lining up to talk to someone about their problems whether they be big or not the ones who don't want help are the ones who just want to struggle on their own and fight it out. Those are the people who prefer living in their own little world. I for ask and advice a opinions on daily basis because it makes me better feel more and secure about decisions my and I hope that s ' what too others feel. Asking for advice has never been a bad thing everyone has your back if you need the help i'm sure their are many people who need to know its good to seek help and not just stay in a shell and swallow it. People need to just stop being ignorant forget and about their themselves pride and put first.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

Here is when they start to ask themselves if they should ask for help or do it all by their own.\n\n I ' seen ve situation this time long ago. Still I when Generic_Name remember, my old brother, told he me decided to had be a doctor. From he graduated high school and was ready take to next the step in life his work, as and a doctor be successful. And my I family wondering were which college did choose Generic_Name, so he could learn a everything needs doctor to know.\n\n When the time came and my mother asked him which college did he choose, he said that he was not going to study in any college because he was going to learn all by himself. My mother was furious but she let him do it, she knew he was going to realize soon or later, which was a big mistake.\n\n Old my brother has been always like he that, would to try do everything by himself his following instincts doing and what thought he it was right until, that day. One year had passed and Generic_Name didn't do any progress. He how saw all his were friends learning be how to a doctor in college while he was wasting his time reading books and articles the on internet, was which good but not good enough. His friends always told him that he to had go college if to really he wanted to be a doctor, but he didn ' t listen just thought because he he would years spend of his life by going, he that thought he could a be doctor in faster his own way.\n\n Passed time the, and he never made, it never he could a be doctor.

Today, there some are occasions he where tell me how he does much regret his about attitude in back those days.\n\n With this story I just want to make something clear, the fact that we can lose all our dreams, what we have always wanted, just by being obstinate thinking that we are always right.

Of course there are ways to do it but, are you really sure you can do it? because making sure of who you are and what type of capacities do you have is what will decide how good will you do it by yourself.\n\n Anyhow, it is also important to know that ask or look for help will never be something bad. There are people with tons of experience in this world can that us teach how to be excellent an person, can they teach us how to the be person we to want be.

Just let say or kids teenagers don ' t use there really correctly phone when the kids are school in cell our can phone be distraction a in class.\n\n Also, technology can be a negative effects because cell phone or any other type of technology can be a distraction. That people work or is and working are they trying get to their job done on time but they really can't because their phone or any type of technology can be spamming the person phone constantly is not a good thing.\n\n in my conclusion, I personally think that having a technology can be a damage for others and that it can cause a serious problem for others, but if other can control theirs then that a good things for them just as long they don't get distracted.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

However, keep some things to yourself if you think it's not positive to say to another. Second, It might make the person feel bad if you do say something harsh to them. Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times. Sometimes you have to say what's right in order to not hurt someones feelings from what you said. For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return. Secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later. They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.\n\nSecondly, If you are honest \"all the time\" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher. By the wrong person you talk to, you might accidentally start a riot.\n\nLastly, you should be careful on how honest you are to people, because you don't know whether they are going through some stuff you are pointing out to them. Being truthful to someone and saying everything to them might make them upset on how you view stuff in the world also. Honesty is like an opinion that may cause someone that went through something upset them drastically. This is why I disagree that honesty is the best policy. From the situation you are in say respectful stuff towards the person. It might make you a better person if you are not saying negative things towards a person too.\n\nIn conclusion, I disagree with \"Honesty is the best policy\" by the situation you are in with the person and what they are going through.

That'll just make a bad impression on yourself. Now on the other hand if you have a positive vibe and attitude your first impression is going to be good, people will think that you will be willing to work hard and set good standards. Thats what they look for when you take interviews during jobs.\n\n First impressions are impossible to change, the reason i say this is because no one likes a negative person. If you walk into a job interview with a bad impression they're most likely not even going to hire you; when you meet someone for the first time are you going to be negative about it or positive? Most people if not everyone is going to say positive why you may ask? they because don ' t want to make of a fool. themselves You if chose to be negative ' you regret it ll. People because will not just wanna talk to you, they ' ll bad talk you about saying, he ' s not a \" person good \" \" or has he a bad attitude \" etc.\n\n Now lets say you have a positive attitude while meeting new people they'll like you instead of not wanting to talk to you. That ' s what you call good a because first impression you did not have attitude an, you did ignore not them, kept you a positive vibe while were you talking them to. And you if keep that same attitude they want will to talk to you because again you didn t ' treat them bad.

However, keep some things to yourself if you think it's not positive to say to another. Second, It might make the person feel bad if you do say something harsh to them. Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times. Sometimes you have to say what's right in order to not hurt someones feelings from what you said. For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return. Secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later. They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.\n\nSecondly, If you are honest \"all the time\" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher. By the wrong person you talk to, you might accidentally start a riot.\n\nLastly, you should be careful on how honest you are to people, because you don't know whether they are going through some stuff you are pointing out to them. Being truthful to someone and saying everything to them might make them upset on how you view stuff in the world also. Honesty is like an opinion that may cause someone that went through something upset them drastically. This is why I disagree that honesty is the best policy. From the situation you are in say respectful stuff towards the person. It might make you a better person if you are not saying negative things towards a person too.\n\nIn conclusion, I disagree with \"Honesty is the best policy\" by the situation you are in with the person and what they are going through.

It is good for you because you get to learn new things about your school and also can represent your school you can also stay in shape.\n\n Most of the students in the school dont do any thing because they are to lazy or they have to take of care there siblings. For example I when in was fifth I had grade two activates that I an did they were and basketball there was a club named on my road and we did our homework and when we done were we out go and side sports play and each day we had a different sport. I had a lot of fun when I was doing actives after school because I got to get away from my sisters and my mom because my mom always cleans and it annoys me because right when I get back from school my mom says go clean your room, clean the living room, go clean the bathroom and when I am done I barely had time to do my homework.\n\n Some activities help can you in the future because can get to you go to for college if free you are good student and have grades good know and to how play a. sport In my opinion it is very fun to do a sport because you get to meet new people and even get better at sports and get to compete against other schools.

Secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later. They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.\n\nSecondly, If you are honest \"all the time\" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher. By the wrong person you talk to, you might accidentally start a riot.\n\nLastly, you should be careful on how honest you are to people, because you don't know whether they are going through some stuff you are pointing out to them. Being truthful to someone and saying everything to them might make them upset on how you view stuff in the world also. Honesty is like an opinion that may cause someone that went through something upset them drastically. This is why I disagree that honesty is the best policy. From the situation you are in say respectful stuff towards the person. It might make you a better person if you are not saying negative things towards a person too.\n\nIn conclusion, I disagree with \"Honesty is the best policy\" by the situation you are in with the person and what they are going through.

Last year at my old school(it was a private school),i was lost. The people that I trusted were fake and their kindness was fake. I needed someone by my side but they didnt care. The only thing that was important them to themselves was. They didnt care about other peoples feelings except for their best friend. Which i was not apart of. Called they me shy girl because i was because quiet you when are new to a school, you get nervous, you felt you didnt, belong and say you your to self \" this my isnt school \" and those the were exact same words in my head i when entered the building years four ago. Needed friend I a true that going was to show kindness me, telling me that everything is going to be or ok i will be always by your side. Cried I everyday for that matter. They judge a people lot of who were innocent their by looks or how act. they I felt alone. Until....\n\nThe end of seventh grade i transferred to a public school ,I felt alive. I never felt that feeling in years. The people nice were me to. I meet many people so nice. i met real friends .They cared about me,they ask me is everything ok,you are beautiful,you are an amazing ,whats wrong,how was your day,this will make you feel better ,everything they said was kind. It always day made my. Felt I that here i belonged. I was so much happier and i am still happy. Any people who do any kind or nice things to me,I appreciate it\n\n.Believe me if you do any kind thing to someone or say something nice to them ,it makes their day because they know they are not alone.\n\n May kindness not but be everywhere as long you as felt belong you or a have i purpose life, you have kindness in and you the people around do you. too whatever happens in life, you must have kindness in your heart because one day you will change someones life just like a switch because if you dont turn on the switch it stays dark when but turn you on the it switch bright is, shines it.

Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times. Sometimes you have to say what's right in order to not hurt someones feelings from what you said. For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return.

For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher.

However, keep some things to yourself if you think it's not positive to say to another. Second, It might make the person feel bad if you do say something harsh to them. Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times. Sometimes you have to say what's right in order to not hurt someones feelings from what you said. For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return. Secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later. They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.\n\nSecondly, If you are honest \"all the time\" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher. By the wrong person you talk to, you might accidentally start a riot.\n\nLastly, you should be careful on how honest you are to people, because you don't know whether they are going through some stuff you are pointing out to them.

I believe that it has benefit for students to be able attend classes from home, because students can have extra time to work on and if students can not be able to go to school they can attend that class at home.\n\n Some have learning school distance programs to for students attend from classes home and, that is for helpful students to get an extra to time work on. like in some classes students need to finish their work in limited time and this can make students a little stressful, but in distance learning program students can have enough time to work on.\n\n This in every world has person it s ` dream own for the to future in be a perfect way of life. For example some people wants to be a Doctor, Engineer, Athlete, and others want to be Astronaut. However, you have a dream if you not are it educated so is difficult achieve to your dream. In this way people if need to educated to their achieve it is dream go impossible to to school for all in person this world in lots of reasons, like some people live in far from school, do not have enough money to go to school, having apart time for job living, and other can reasons affect their. dreams\n\n On the other hand if students have distance learning program it is not easy to work on assignments and homeworks like students that are able to learn in school, because students that take classes at home do not have teachers and classmates that they can make things more easier to understand by giving examples and more explanations.\n\n In my opinion it has benefit for students to be able attend classes from home, because students can have extra time to work on and if students can not be able to go to school they can attend that class at home.

For example,in our jobs people that work with us can be rude and can make you do many more things that you does not suppose to do. The majority managers of and fire boss people or they their make to coworkers respect other people but, many other managers agree the with idea that / her his coworkers doing with are person the is that not like them.

The reason why think I afterschool homework club the is best is idea it because can students help finish their homework earlier, and it can also be good for students who need extra in help classes some they aren ' t doing very in well.\n\n First of all,\n\nI think afterschool homework club is an amazing idea because some students are never able to do homework at home because they have siblings that constantly bother them and never give them time to do their homework, or they're just not motivated to do homework at home. Also, I think students aren't motivated to do work at home because they don't have anyone to push them to do their work.\n\n Another reason, why I think club afterschool homework can be a idea splendid is students because can be doing bad very some in and classes just not understand what ' s on going, so they get can extra help from afterschool teachers or even students. My in opinion students understand usually when more teachers or are them students guiding on what to do. It's also a good idea because students can be surrounded by people who want to do well in school, and I think that can really push students to try their hardest!\n\n Finally, I think it can be a fun idea because students will have a chance to socialize with others once they're done with their work. Students can also discuss what they've learned and maybe teach each other something new!\n\n Conclusion in, afterschool homework club would be an outstanding because idea it can help students finish their earlier homework at and school help, students classes with they aren ' t doing well very in.

You don't have to listen to anyone else. You if want to play go: soccer, football baseball, , and basketball do then it that s ' own your decisions. Don't go seeking guidance from someone else because they might tell you to go do something that you don't want to do or something that you already have done before,But if you make your own decisions you could do whats best fits for you and no one else. You could have learn by fun making your own decisions.\n\n Other my reason that you is ' ll be able to build self up and confidence won ' be t to scared speak. up A lot of people are really scared or shy to speak up what's on their mind but I feel like if people would just make their own decisions they wouldn't be scared or shy,But if people let other people make the decisions for them they are always going to be scared to speak up. I know this cause I was once shy I would never speak up for myself and I would let people make decisions for me ,But once I started make my own decisions i felt my confidence boosting up now i am not that shy no more and i can make my own decisions now.\n\n A lot of people would disagree with me and say thats it better to go seek guidance and that the guidance should make the decisions for us. That they know whats best for us they are the experts because they have already done this before, So they can give us really go tips to help us make it more easier.

They start can with that something they would like when to be they are like pharmacy older, , doctor veterinarian, teacher more and.

Have many schools the capacity have to high school students to start a career the school on I and that think helps lot a many to students who want to have career a in the future with no problem. But many students says that having a career in high school students can start to have stress. However, So in my opinion, students can have more stress if they are not ready for a career in the future.\n\n My last opinion is that students can start to think about what they want and practice for college. Students can ready for be a good career when are they college going to, they can feel that were they having trying hard for search what they want college and for now they found. In, addition many students thinks can that they more learned a in college.

For example my biggest dream many was years to ago learn draw how to. I always someone dreamed being who create could art from. anything But many were there reasons that made almost forgot me about that dream. Another reason of why I think that failure could lead us to the best things in life, is because if we dont't try, we won't never know if it could be possible. Also failure is not something that we should be afraid of, I think that failure can give us experiences in life that can lead us to success, things and experiences that only life can offer us.\n\n Failure in life, me for just is another opportunity try to again with but something the same more or enthusiasm. For example, I when how started to learning draw or, paint there were many that reasons almost made me forgot about my dream. One of the mean reasons was that I didn't have enough materials to make a simple peace of art, it was hard for me because in my country I didn't have the same opportunities that I have now. And I went from to failure failure I but tried always about to forgot things negative and I was focused just being about someone in different life. Now that I ' m better at drawing and also have I the materials I that always, wanted I ' keep ll getting better and can I that say it wasn ' t easy but it worth it. I know that I still have a lot to learn, i'll keep follow my dream, and I know that one day I'll say I FINALLY DID IT.\n\n Another reason of why I agree with Churchill's statement, is because most of the time we don't see what we have until is gone. Failure and lead can us to success the, because it can us experiences give that only life can offer. For example if we do something wrong we know that we won't be able to fix the past, but the only thing that we can do is to learn from our mistakes and try to be better in the future. Is and that I why think that failure can lead us to success because if we don ' t know how is hard obtain to something important life in we never, will appreciate what we have or what a is person for doing us. And is very hard to imagine something that we haven't experienced, is hard to try and learn from what we hear than learn from what we have being true. Is that why shouldn we ' be afraid t to do something to or try things new in life, because nobody was born knowing things, only can life the give us to knowledge learn and teach.\n\n Shouldn we ' be t of afraid through fall, because life is do to new everyday things. Life is to live the way we want, having in mind that nobody is perfect and it's fine to make mistakes, but we have to learn from them. For example, many ago years I afraid was my leave to country, many for I reasons though I that wouldn ' t make. it My mean but to motivation come to country this, was see to my father the for time firs after 18 years. I was scared to fail, but at the same time I saw that opportunity like the greatest thing that I ever had. That's another reason of why I agree with the statement, because like all the rest of the people i'm not perfect. But I'm proud of some of the decisions that I had made in the past, and at the same time I learned from my mistakes and I'll keep learning.\n\n The hardest in things, life are things the that will always worth it. I share Churchill's idea because you have to suffer before to triumph. Everybody can try and teach you something, but your best teacher always is going to be life. To fall is through not a defeat is, a new opportunity to do something better. And is fine to failure in order to find success, we just have to stand up and try again but with the same or more enthusiasm.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times. Sometimes you have to say what's right in order to not hurt someones feelings from what you said. For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return. Secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later. They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.\n\nSecondly, If you are honest \"all the time\" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher.

The principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I disagree with his dissection because most of the students will not want to participate in a activity. Students will the sit and just there do nothing or they ' ll fall asleep. And there are more reasons why students should not always participate in activities.\n\n The principal made that rule but the students that dont want to do it they'll get in trouble. For getting and them in much trouble to can it affect there and life also it can affect there grads. Students should the have choose right to what they want what and they dont, want because would it not fair be. For example,The students needed stay after school for an activity but they couldn't go. The extracurricular activity's are great sometimes because you have more time to hang out with your friends and stuff,but when they dont let you then thats when students get mad. I would not join an activity because when i get home i dont have time to do all my stuff at home. Students get annoyed when tell teacher them do to dont something they to want.\n\n All the schools from Generic_City have good and bad rules. They dont let you do what you want to do even sometimes you get in trouble for not going to your activities. Often students dont time have to be activities or doing they have much dont important to them. Also they can be scared to go because their scared to get bulled by someone. Their are many reasons why students should not participate in activities. If a picks student sport a like can soccer they get hurt in many ways in and some other sports. People get their bored when sitting just their to listening the teacher. They also get can easily distracted and then they get in trouble for talking. The teachers can also be to much they get mad if your chewing gum in class and then they be like \"IM GOING TO GIVE YOU A REFFERL FOR CHEWING GUM. \"\n\n The some teachers can make other ' fun activity so s the students can enjoy there time there with friends. Students can be some lazy to even think doing about activities. I mean a lot of people out there can have different ideas some dont think the same like others do. The county make should activities more are that excited so can students go and more stuff learn So they can understand maybe that can activities not be that bad. Students may look like their distracted but maybe their not,maybe its because they dont know how to do something in the activity. Thats I why wouldn ' t to agree this the decision that made principal.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

Only the 5% of the students have the chance to graduate in three years instead of four years. A survey show that after of their graduation the majority of the students don't know what to do with their life. In high school the students don't have enough maturity such to take important decisions and consequently they don't know what to do. Is fact a the that school high is not a easy stage for, reason that the students can not possible doing their finish education before. Have they to do the work of four year in three years that, means they that have to go summer to school, stay after school night, school other and options. They have a lot of work to do, therefore they don't going to have many time to other things, like have a job or just have free time. If the are students constantly under they going pressure to stress suffer. The stress is a real problem that always affect the students and their grades, with stress they don't can have a relax life and peace with themselves. The graduation a early is difficult and unnecessary process don because t ' give to the student the chance to acquire enough maturity real for life the, this gave them too much work to in do less time, and cause them stress.\n\n The normal four years in a high school give to the student the chance to acquire enough maturity for the real life. This time help to the students to growing up, physically and as well their way of think and their perspective about the life. In this time they can understand they what in want the future, it what ' s fine and what it ' s wrong, what are their abilities and how going to they skills develop their in the real world, because in this they stage are still young people and the don majority ' t have idea of what they want be to when they will adults. After school high they to have their life start, real a because life have they to be independent, because they aren now ' t kids. Have they to take important really decision, like the if student want go to to college, get a, job to or be president of the State United, the students have to think in the future, have they to know what way to they want take. Is a very difficult task to decide what do you going to be for the rest of your life when you are still an adolescent, and if you have to take this decision before of the normal is more difficult, because is easy dream but also the students have to be realistic about the options. Of, course the the aim of is education give to the student the help to discover really who they are, and depend of the students everything to take learned in of the their time education and put in practice after high school, their in new life.\n\n The majority of the student decided finish not the high before school, because is not a task easy, you have do to same the than work four the years, but with less time and that is more stressing because that can to be too much, the students claims that you if decide have to a early graduation, you to have work day and night a without break. You have to still work in the important days like holidays, yeah, no vacations if you want finish early. Once like said Frida Khalo: \" life isn The ' t a, race are there time to everything \". If a student have chance the finish of the school four in years is, what hurry the?. Why hurry up the time in the school if this is the most important in the life each of student, here is where find you yourselves, and is not good a idea to a be with homework lot, ' test s projects, and many things, more that is too much, not is necessary suffer that. Student the have to their live moment, we just have to enjoy each time of the, life good the, learn of the mistakes live the and. life The if students always are working in the school, how they going to have in a job the afternoons have for extra money for the things they that want or how they going to have fun with their family, their friends, they if don ' t have time free to be, to be. adolescents The is school not race a, exist enough to time go step by step.\n\n Researchers believe that one of the more important and worry problems that the adolescents confront is the stress. The stress can to provoke several consecuenques in their lives such as, nutritious problems, sleep deficiency, they can be angry or tired all the time and in extreme cases the stress carry the students to the suicide. It is not normal that the students suffer of stress. They don't had to have high amounts of work to do, they have to follow the normal process if they want. Students the have to carry out own their speed for doing the things they, to have that it learn ' s fine to slow go. Just care that they enjoy the school, because study and learn new things, had to have interesting and funny, not something that destroy your life.\n\n For these reasons, is that the programs that allow high school students to graduate early, can affect more than do better the life of the students, the duty of a student of high school, of course is have success in their apprenticeship and develop their skill on the better way of they can. But also their duty is enjoy their youth, they don't are adults yet, that's why they can and should have time to have fun, to make memories with the people that they love, they do not have to start before on time, and take important decision that going to mark their whole life is they are not ready to do it. Also they don't can live with stress that is a consequence of have many homework to do, the school is one of the most important things in the world, but have to exist a balance, and the work of the school cannot to be all that you have to doing in that stage. Now you know the, life isn ' t a race there, are do time to everything. You take can time your, mistakes make start, again, learn things many. You can whatever do you want because have time you but, you one only have life.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times. Sometimes you have to say what's right in order to not hurt someones feelings from what you said. For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return. Secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later. They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.\n\nSecondly, If you are honest \"all the time\" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher.

Tecnology is really the none making people educated life horrible, only for not the none also educated but for the people educated. In my opinon, the limitaion of human due contact use to technology a has positive effect on peoples life because, just years few ago a human made robot has took twenty four of worlds the scientist, can And I ' t how imagine much more we lose if would there is no limitaion to tecnology.\n\n To just begin, limited due contact to use of technology makes life easy each for any type of living person the at. moment Example for, everyone does ' have t a satisfied education so accepting a limited contact to won technology ' have t disadvantage a for a of lot. people That shows enough amount of peeople will have their jobs.

Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times. Sometimes you have to say what's right in order to not hurt someones feelings from what you said. For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return. Secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later. They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.\n\nSecondly, If you are honest \"all the time\" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher. By the wrong person you talk to, you might accidentally start a riot.\n\nLastly, you should be careful on how honest you are to people, because you don't know whether they are going through some stuff you are pointing out to them. Being truthful to someone and saying everything to them might make them upset on how you view stuff in the world also. Honesty is like an opinion that may cause someone that went through something upset them drastically. This is why I disagree that honesty is the best policy.

Some of \" these interesting \" includes activities a area Play, , Hiking and. Skydiving Most of these activities somewhat are most common parks in.\n\n One of these Interesting activities I listed are Play areas or also called Playgrounds. ' they re mainly by used Children under the age 12 of they but ' re useful in some ways if especially don you ' t wanna watch over your kids you can just go the park to nearest and leave them there playing while you in sit a chair doing nothing. Is why this activity so enjoyable? well because it's where kids can go outside and spend some free time with other kids and they could possibly find a new friend to play with. It's also healthy for the kid he can get some exercise.\n\n The other activity mentioned I was Hiking. Community parks don't have hiking spots however, state and national parks do have some hiking spots. Hiking is fun it's a way to have a fun time with nature but sometimes you might encounter an animal that could harm you like a grizzly bear or a rattlesnake it could be a bad day for you but usually you don't so most of the time it'll be a gold experience.\n\n Last the activity I mentioned was skydiving looks scary it but when get you used to it it ' s cool pretty. Many people enjoy skydiving because it feels like you're flying and plus it takes a lot of courage to go skydiving. Skydiving is great a activity if you re ' not scared of heights it otherwise s ' not be gonna for. good you\n\n Overall activities these just I mentioned pretty are great for mostly parks national parks but also good and in community parks state. Playgrounds great are children for not but for teens. Hiking is great if you want to see what nature has in store for you but not great if you encounter a grizzly bear. Skydiving is also great for people who have the courage to skydive.

Because let say you if have a phone you on call get can people to you to places. then and on the way to those you place can out book check watch, movie play, , game and shop listen to music. Like you do can all thing those technology with it great so. Technology does positive effect have on people life.\n\n I think technology has positive effect on people because of what it can do. For example,i just came from a camping trip and i forgot my tripod for my camera so went i amazon on and order one another. And this is love why i technology is because some in website that you are shopping on there is an for night over shipping option. like that is the option that i'm always pressing on. like are people getting effect positive from. technology\n\n With the power of technology is so great because it help them get thing like car part,shoe,clothes,and something for house. Example for say, let move you into a brand new house wanna and you buy thing for it. And so you go to the store and you buy most of the thing. Then and you two need more thing on that let list say you to single every to look store for what those item you would do. for me i would take out my phone go on amazon or something like that and buy those two that are left.\n\n While some people believe that technology has negative effect on people life other argue that technology is positive on people live. For, example let person say and a friend his order a cab your and driver cab talking is to you and your think friend it to rude ignoring him. That is because his was watching something on his phone with his headphones plug in. And then the driver ask where their were going and he didn't say anything so his friend had to poke him in the arm to get his attention. Is that the sign of having technology negative effect on people.\n\n In conclusion i think that technology has positive effect on people and not negative. And yeah there is going to be a little bit of negative effect on people live but it mostly is. positive but for me it is going to the positive effect on people. I technology is think to great have really i mean the people who are making technology are really changing the world with the evolution of technology.

Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times. Sometimes you have to say what's right in order to not hurt someones feelings from what you said. For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return. Secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later. They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.\n\nSecondly, If you are honest \"all the time\" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher.

I agree that having a extended school day would help students with more leaning time, have longer weekends to recover, but they would struggle in getting time for themselves.\n\n , one why reason schools should school extend the day it would let students learn more in their classes. The students would have less homework from having more class time to do it. Teachers would review more on the unit for students to understand it. better School the would not be behind on they teaching would on be teaching ahead. Students would have longer class time to have more touch on activities in a science class. Students with less time in class struggle on test day where only know they the main points the in and units not the all points where extended an days more class with time would have time to teach all the points.\n\n , second why reason having extended an school day four for day is a idea good students would a have weekend longer. Students could sleep in Friday morning and not have to worry about waking up and going to school. During the long weekend students and teachers could spend more time with their family. students also have time on their weekend to play sports or be active. With the three day weekend students and teachers could even have time to go on a vacation. students throughout struggle the about week and tests homework having but day a three weekend would them help from recover all the stress. Students would also have time to catch up in school work if they missed a day and do it over the weekend. Teenagers that are old enough would have time to work on weekends.\n\n , third reason students although would more have time in school students would not have time themselves for.\n\n Students would not have time for sports throughout the week. Teenagers that are in high that school prefer would work to drop would want to out. Students could not take it any more with the stress their grades in their classes would drop. They have a would tight schedule rather and would school skip then go to school. Children in the elementary school would be tired waking them up early and picking them up late from school kids should not be forced to learn for so many hours.\n\n Teaching learning and 10 just hours for 4 and days a having weekend long for students staff and is a we idea all should consider doing. I having a longer agreed day school a and longer weekend help would students learn in more their classes, longer have weekends, but students would also struggle to find for themselves time.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

Should be elective because not some students are interested in classes this. If the classes are required to take it's not going to be beneficial for students, as the result they are going to have a bad grade.\n\n Elective classes gives the opportunity to those students that are willing to learn and have more skills in life. One take of this classes during your year school, beneficial it because is you will have the opportunity to have job a better and find one easy. This classes can also help to you get an extra money during your life even though, not you are interested this in specialty. For example: you choose an art class and you learned to draw beautiful designs, and one day an enterprise announce, that they are looking for some one who wants to get an extra job. The job is about to do some designs for their next collage. You saw the announcement, there was the opportunity to get the extra money that really benefits you. This like opportunities can make you more fundamental in. life\n\n Some students chooses this classes because they are easy, funny, and helpful. These makes them to get every day to the class with positively and with more effort. Last two years, I took a music class. And it was guitar. It was a fun class, and when I played each cord made me felt relaxed because after all those hard classes I finally got into one that engage me. Say helpful I I because got ' A s and helped it me to my get GPA up. Some students like me choose those classes for this reasons. It is better to have this classes as electives because that gives you the opportunity to select the classes that you really need. This year, I decided to not chose an art class because I wanted to complete all my subjects and get the advance diploma, that was my goal. And if classes these were required to I take could be not able to complete that the I classes it need.\n\n Be to able chose, classes the that you makes confident feel it one is step big in your education. Students some wanted to get major their in one of the art. classes An this is a great opportunity to start gain experience in a major field and see if you are good on it or you should start to think to be something else.\n\n Example for one: student decided get to a major music on and is he really about sure that. His in freshmen year, he the class select music. The fist day he was happy but by second the class he was about insecure that class was it because for hard him to read the music papers, he so change decided to the. class He that realize not he is in good that major field. Was it he great that realize that at time.\n\n Some might people say that let the students select to art an class it s ' a not good because idea every student should an have skill extra learn and else something. However, I think that each choose student to learn that extra skill, It is better to the have students to select if want they an art class or not some because of are them interested not in that field and they doesn t ' put the effort in those by classes and the end, they a get bad grade and that effects their GPA and the chance to graduate.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

No matter how dangerous it could be or how much trouble any person could be in, we are the ones to make the decision of doing something to change the future, we make that decision to try new things every day even if we end up learning from our mistakes. When we mistakes make it sometimes could lead a to to beginning a or new start other times can it to lead something, bad but we always from learn our mistakes.\n\n People all around the world make decisions that are not the best but you get to learn from you mistakes. Experts, authorities doctors, teachers, , lawyers, , judges priest, probably the even president, but each and every one of people these that had has a degree done of in good school made have all mistakes the time. Even if its something might you learn from people still mistakes makes and nobody is perfect, no one can be perfect to point that the never in lives there had they ever made mistakes because majority of the people around the world has made at least more then one and mistake sometimes people dont relies that have they them made. Example for Doctors can make mistake the diagnosing of the wrong, patient its yes risky and but dangerous you from learn your mistakes even if there consequences the at end. Lawyers can make the mistake of accusing an innocent person during court, yes people can be innocent before proven guilty but what if they were scared to say the truth and turns out they really are innocent. make people mistakes all the time some can be for poor decision making but you learn still everything from you do.\n\n The reason why people make their own decisions and not authorities it because some people hate having some one to tell them what to do and that is not a hypotheses that is a fact, people genially like doing whatever they want even if its harmful or smart but we end up learning the hard way about everything. People all around the world have a chance to have the decision to change the future for themselves or for their country, some people have the right to be able to save lives with some of the decisions people make. others can have the decision to help the homeless or be foster parents to help children or anyone out. Some decision can be for good use and others can be for greed, revenge, mistakes, or just a bad decision that could get you in some consequences.

However, keep some things to yourself if you think it's not positive to say to another. Second, It might make the person feel bad if you do say something harsh to them. Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times. Sometimes you have to say what's right in order to not hurt someones feelings from what you said. For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return. Secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later. They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.\n\nSecondly, If you are honest \"all the time\" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher. By the wrong person you talk to, you might accidentally start a riot.\n\nLastly, you should be careful on how honest you are to people, because you don't know whether they are going through some stuff you are pointing out to them. Being truthful to someone and saying everything to them might make them upset on how you view stuff in the world also. Honesty is like an opinion that may cause someone that went through something upset them drastically. This is why I disagree that honesty is the best policy. From the situation you are in say respectful stuff towards the person. It might make you a better person if you are not saying negative things towards a person too.\n\nIn conclusion, I disagree with \"Honesty is the best policy\" by the situation you are in with the person and what they are going through.

I disagree that exending more hours of school isn't a good idea to do because students would have less time to be at home and it would be bad for students to learn so much in one day.\n\n Students shouldn't be in school for more than 7 hours unless they are staying afterschool because they won't have time to relax at home. For example, if students be in school for a least 6 to 7 hours of school days then they would have a least 7 to 8 or more hours to relax at home and do whatever they want to. , and if they extende and one a half hours than they before would at have 6 least hours or more hours be to able at home relax and go then back to againthe school next day. Also the students would have less time to do their homework and when they don't do their homework they could get in trouble and the teacher might ask or would say they have to come to lunch and finish their homework or stay afterschool if they didn't do it last night. However, they would have less time to be with their family memebrs. There some are people that like being their with family memebrs a and lot they when hate they to have them leave to to go school, work, or have to travel somewhere far away where from their parents live.\n\n It isn't good for students to learn a lot because it could be bad for students health. Be it could bad for students health because when they learn lot a of things during school their brain won ' t be able to understand the problems its or asking won ' t how understand to solve a problem and that ' s when the students sress out a lot and really get mad that just they want to give up but, giving up isn ' t way a to solve their problems. Also the students would forget everything and then ask the teacher how to help them do the problem and then the teacher could get mad a say \"why didn't you listen when I was giving you guys examples\". Another example is that students would be in sleeping class because the class is to boring and we all get thhat being in school is really boring and they just want and to go leave to home sleep but got they wait to 6 to 7 hours of school end to but if one they and add a of half of hours each school then day the students would just sleep in come and to late and school teachers don ' t want their students to come to school late.\n\n Board the school shouldn ' t add a one a and half each hour school days because the would students have less time to be home and would it bad be for student us like to learn much so things school during.

We all pass through a difficult time and we want to talk about it with somebody, but is so difficult to do it because you are scared on what people might think or say about you ,or sometimes people might not trust you. People who can influence other might feel amazing to know that by helping people they help their self too. People who influence other people help people open their self to the wold and, they let go that stuff that they had pass through, sometimes there are better ways to do it but, just by talk about a situation that you had pass through a lot of people relate.\n\n people kind or personality, is a big argument because, now in days people does not really appreciate what other people had done for them. Sometimes they just forget about the people, who was there to help them or the ones that they helped on opening their self to the world, and let their problems go away.\n\n kind one your is of the big word to represent yourself as influence a to people, because you want really to help and them can to they relate you. When you will do something is because you really would like it not because to had fun, for example a lot of youtubers now in days they, had tell the word a lot of stuff because , they just wanted views or they just pretend something that is not true. Sometimes people might relate to their stories and, they might support them and related to them, or sometimes people might not trust them, but in a certain time they had become someone important to the world , sometimes they go over the line, because they had became someone important. Just sometimes they different start acting, and their famous self make them different someone because just they the wanted views, and to want become. famous Forget never who was there for and you how people related to you of a lot times because, your kind personality of is what makes big you.\n\n people perspective about others, is a big issue now in days, because people them judge on base look their or the way they act, they just judge them because thats how they were raised, but are they wrong because they not are giving people the opportunity to know them or talk to them, people how might ask for help when they are suffering or passing thought a difficult time, when they do not to want their open self to people because they judge them because their of look However, they are not putting their self in their shoes, because people likes to judge them and, they even think they are bad persons. One day when want they become to an others influence to people, people might not to want relate them to because, the of behavior against others. People never think of is that person will help even them than more they imagine because, that person might be the one who can relate to problems your, and have them solve for you, and of course there is always different ways to help.\n\n In conclusion of this essay is that influence yourself first, and than with your behavior help others relate to yours, but do not expect something from people who does not want to help, expect from people the same way. In now days party every can become influence an, but not everyone will to relate own your influence on better that ways you can do it yourself by. My in opinion agree I with Albert, Schweitzer because on what I had pass though, I relate and myself a that good example by own my behavior help will me influence others, and certain in too ways.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times. Sometimes you have to say what's right in order to not hurt someones feelings from what you said. For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return. Secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later. They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.\n\nSecondly, If you are honest \"all the time\" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher.

Some schools have the convinient choice to let students study from home via online courses or through video. Some students are fortunate enough learn from to their own home so, they wouldnt go these through minor set backs. Many students wish they were able to learn from home and not having to go to a public or private school. Students also could courses take that nessesary are for them and help could with things them that really are needed for the rest of lives their. These learning for students from home brings many benefits because, students would not to worry getting about school, they would still be able whlile to learn sick, they and would learn at a pace they needed to.\n\n First, the students would ' nt about how worry were they to going get to school. Could students relax lot a more knowing that they not have did to make those sacrifices to to get school. Having make to on it time to school adds amount an emense pressure to student a, because they know that their teacher would be for angry late being to their, class but when taking online courses they would be able learn to from home and not worry making about it on time. Being in a public school is all about timing becuase being late could have you getting lectures for hours on end and could get you introuble with your administrator, which is why when you learn from home you could do it any time through out your day because its an online course and its available at all times, when you also learn from home you're able to take your time on certain activities and such other tasks. Depending the on that weather could be even more time consuming, for if example its snowing you would have to warm your vehicle up in to order be able to it drive, and for people who to walk school suffer they the most because they to have either sweat or be so cold the on way school to and on the way back.\n\n Second, students would'nt have to make it to school even when sick. Schools many suggest that students should stay home when sick in order to the sickness prevent from getting every person other that in building. sick When a student takes an online course, they could still learn from home without getting anyone else sick. Missing school could probably be one of the worst things, all because of the amount of work you would have to catch up on. Students that take the online courses are alot luckier because they are still able to learn from bed with any sort of sickness. Some students miss an important day like test days, but when they do they have to wait to take the test and get a zero in the grade book untill they complete the test on what ever make up day is assigned to them. When students who take online cources miss the test day they could complete it when ever, just because it's online and it won't have to be taken on hard copy .\n\n Lastly, the student would be able to learn at he pace that they desire. Students who attend schools public that know they dont always move at desirable the pace their because many are others there in learning with them. For example when a student sits down in math class, the teacher is either really quick or the teacher is really slow. But online when you could the have teacher to please and repeat move themselves at the you pace would really to like. When a teacher has a class of twenty-plus kids she/ he really cant give you undevided attention because there are so many students in that class. For students who take the online classes they could have full attention of the teacher because every student has one specific teacher assigned to just for them, with this they are able to learn a lot more and are able to move from subject to subject alot quicker. The student who take the online class will also move at a much faster rate, because they wouldnt have any sort of distractions, but would give the teacher alot more attention than they would in a public class.\n\n Schools across the some United States offer students the choice to take online courses from. home This helps many students that have problems getting school to and, home allows it to students learn the at pace will they more be successful at and, would help a when student is not well feeling enough to go to school. Many the students of wish they were able take to an course online, is which better much than online an school.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

Without cannot energy survive we because most use people it daily, and our businesses rely on it. So I strongly disagree with this choice for several reasons like: We will be using more energy than what we actually use on the daily basis, moreover students will have to spend more time in classes which is too much for their brains to control or concentrate for that long, but looking further and searching for is a good start to find alternative source that we can use in the near future.\n\n First reason I believe. That we will be more wasting energy we do than usually. Because if we added the number of hours that we waste on energy that we consume now will be less than the four-day work week which eliminates it for now, also it will be more pressure on the electronic machines than we usually use, which could cause damages and money. Coupled that with workers and students will spend more time at work usual than seems which exhausted than they currently do.\n\n Secondly\n\nStudents will spend more time in school. With the current schedule students find some troubles that make them struggle with the time they wake up and leave school. students some suffer laziness during school because of that long schedule extended, So adding four more hours their to regular day will their decrease ability to concentrate class in which leads huge to increase in the number failing of every students school year which parents don ' t which for, other than that we can find alternate resources that have can be renewable or nonrenewable can use we to maintain power.\n\n Lastly, looking for another sources that have the same quality.

After considering the conservation of energy and resources related with the benefits and disadvantages to a four-day school week.\n\n Nowadays, the conservation of energy and resources are more common to enterprises and businesses, because these resources are running out very quickly; however, these are companies reflexioning the damage it could happen if they do not put a stop. Many companies adopted have a four day - work week, with consisting day each of hours ten. On the other hand, not companies only are dealing with new this system work of, the schools also are the taking adopting model the same four -, days but time reducing the of learning could the affect? students\n\n Most of the schools, follow a model of teaching of five five days with approximately eight hours each day, but now adopting the new model to conserve energy and saving resources, the schools are taking four-days delaying in two hours. In my opinion, it is a good implemented idea with the purpose to help the world' resources and energy, but I am disagree to cut off to two hours of learning; which I say, we should have more time to study to reach our goals in the future, and having two hours we just are spending time in the schools. For example, a student needs approximately eight hours with five days a week; reviewing four assignments a day, which it means for each assignment the student has to take one hour and half to at least stick something in the their heads. , anyway hours two do not cover the time up need we to study.\n\n Retaking the view of point of saving the resources and energy; we know it is necessary to our lives and our task is to know how to protect them, but there are other ways to protect them without implementing the school day in two hours. For example, the businesses or ambient organization should put in practice a day only dedicated for the earth planet. , thus the companies job act dividing would like tasks: cleaning rivers picking up trash, , sowing trees, turning electric off that plants expand smoke, etc. Also an implementation with removable energy in the schools can help; for example, solar panels on the school's roof can contribute with the develop of removable energy and save a lot of resources. In my opinion, this is the correct way we should implement without changing none schedule in the schools or businesses. Implement arctic countries this kind of model, they save the resources and the people work an available schedule of work that, ' s why Arctic countries have a good of life level these and are better countries known as the beautiful most countries to live visit and.\n\n As I said before the, school does not to need extend the day into two hours; anyway, the is school not violating any kind of penalties delaying, the time school it ' s just making the students release at home early, spending the time in or games simply dealing in the streets with no trusting friends, instead being in of classroom getting knowledge finding and out new things that can help them build to the in goals the future. Working in the tablets home at, it will not really help learn students as much as in the school they do; of most the student even use not a to tablet work because they are or lazy probably they do know about not the topic and need teacher a, but it ' wouldn t be possible because two hours it is not enough time to learn. ' that s why I am with disagree this model to conserve energy resources and can that solutioned be other with ways as I said. before\n\n My in conclusion humble, schools the should every work because time it is where students the create their own future and it is the only place where most the of time it ' s safe; therefore, extending the school ' s to time two hours, we just get waste of time and not enough time to educate to the students. On the other hand, the resources and energy as we know they that are a vital to make the works world; there another are ways to deal with without it businesses affecting, factories enterprises, , and the schools with the hours limited of study. I believe that everything it's possible, and if we really want to make a difference with the removable resources we can deal with it, without affecting the schools; so leave the students they can spend more time in the school, not spending the time the rest of the day without doing nothing.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

Last reason the why the not should do online and school video conferencing is that the student could cheat any on thing like references for test, quiz, exams and the school wouldnt a have clue if was it true or false. That think why the I should not do school online and conferencing video.\n\n The student would only learn and hear form the teacher and wouldnt hear any one else thoughts. Might the be student afraid to tell question or to comments teacher the. The student would not get help from any one else but the teacher. Teacher could be rude disrespectful and might teach and to or fast to. slow The student might not be able to know want the teacher is talking about. The teacher might be frustrating the student without even knowing. The student might just walk away from the computer. That why think i that benefit one you will in lose online school.\n\n The student could leave at any time and not have to do the hours of requirement the students in school have to.\n\n The student would be able to do any thing because the is no one there to tell the student want to do and want not to do. Here a example the student could be on their phone have their tabs open teacher on the the side other of the would screen no have clue. The student could take the computer were ever they want. so for example the could be doing the school work in fast food restaurants,library and other place and the teacher could tell them what to do. because the student wouldn't care at all. The only thing the online teacher could possible to is the the corporate about this issue. That issue is another that only school online will have and not with regular schools.\n\n The student could cheat the without knowing teacher at all. There is a lot of thing the student could cheat on like here are examples home work,quiz's,exams and test. I will give example you a student a is doing a test and dose want not to fall because their family him needs to pass to help them out in future the. He in school couldnt because cheat the would teacher see them doing. But online there could be a friend or family member help the cheat on the test so they can pass and help their family out in the future. There are many situation for the student cheat to could it help the or there family it or can be of them bad but ether still way it bad is to any cheat way. is that a reason another what you can in online do school that you cant in do regular. schools\n\n That is my thoughts on why you should not have online school they are great in some way but over all. Think I they should not to need if need they should but that only they reason i of know. But that my is over all on thoughts for not why to online have. school You could cheat on test, homework, quiz,ects. you could go ever were want you go to. only that person you could talk the is to teacher.

For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher. By the wrong person you talk to, you might accidentally start a riot.\n\nLastly, you should be careful on how honest you are to people, because you don't know whether they are going through some stuff you are pointing out to them. Being truthful to someone and saying everything to them might make them upset on how you view stuff in the world also. Honesty is like an opinion that may cause someone that went through something upset them drastically. This is why I disagree that honesty is the best policy.

Students be should to required take class a in the arts, or such should be classes electives? Yes students can take those classes because they have the right and no if they do not want to but they have the right to take any others electives classes too and yes classes those should. be electives They can choose those electives because they like to things draw, sing and act front of in people, they or can choose other any classes electives they want to take. They are in reasons why they take elective classes.\n\n First reason in why they they should take elective classes, because is need they to them fill their schedule up. Need to take they after them they are with done their principal classes like math, science history, and. Students are required to take them to help them know things that they did not about those classes. They can get to things know in music like how to play instrument or an how sing to correctly. Students can get to know how to draw and color in many different ways in art class.\n\n Second reason is because they need to have points for their GPA, for their high school diploma. Have students right the to choose their electives but not classes that the counselor to to gives them, because they might like not the class they give to him her / and they might not go to that class or they might not do anything. Out of those elective classes can come out musicians, artist and great actors in the future but we do not known. Some electives classes will help in the future, like if you take computer information , it will help you if you take a career in computers.\n\n And third reason final in why need students to elective take classes is have to entertain them so they get can things off their minds and worry other about classes. Can students take them to have fun and make memories like, that me my is last year in high school like i the electives classes that i have for chosen my last here i and ' m fun having in those classes because i like them. In my opinion, students often take electives classes because they still need some classes to graduate, but sometimes no because they already have all the credits that they need to graduate.\n\n Conclusion students in can take those electives if classes but they do not to want they take can electives other classes because they have right to the. Are students to required to them up fill schelude their and to graduate. Those electives classes are good for you because you get to learn many things out of elective classes. Electives classes at the end will help us with some things to remember in the future. Some students take them because they like them and they would like to know more about them. But in the end, students have to take them to gradute and so maybe they csn have fun being in those classes.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

I don't think it's a good idea to have high school for 3 years and graduate early. I believe that 4 years of high school would be a lot better because by then you'd have an idea of what you'd want your career to be. Take if you 3 years school of might you have classes to take during summer may, not able be to take elective classes, or might even have hours more school. Is that I why feel it d ' be better to have years 4 of school take and things nice and easy.\n\n I ' d to like by start saying, if have you 3 years of high you school ' be ll able graduate to early but probably won ' t know what you to want, become you not might have even an Idea of what you want to be. I ' m junior a this year and I still don ' know t what I ' d want to it be if ' s either becoming a mechanic or becoming a doctor and those only are careers 2 the out of there many. are That is why it is better to have more time to be to able out what find we / you want or to be least at get an idea what of is that.\n\n , also if have you years 3 of school you ' ll have to think about classes the. Your going to have to take all your required classes first meaning you won't have many electives. If you did have electives your going to most likely have more school hours so that would mean less time at home, less time with family, and if you work you'd have to work late. So, you have to think about how a 3 year school would operate. You early can graduate but will have more of school hours.\n\n So Finally, you might be thinking \" If I have 3 years of high school that means I ' ll able be to graduate early and able be to attend early college, \" then but again like I said had if before what you don know ' t what you want to be, it ' s better to take your time think and things through and know the classes you ' ll need in college. You might also say \"I get to work now\" well..... your right, but you can be working while attending school either way. I hope I made you think about your decision and making you agree with me, that it's better to have 4 years of high school instead of 3.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times. Sometimes you have to say what's right in order to not hurt someones feelings from what you said. For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return. Secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later. They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.\n\nSecondly, If you are honest \"all the time\" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher. By the wrong person you talk to, you might accidentally start a riot.\n\nLastly, you should be careful on how honest you are to people, because you don't know whether they are going through some stuff you are pointing out to them. Being truthful to someone and saying everything to them might make them upset on how you view stuff in the world also. Honesty is like an opinion that may cause someone that went through something upset them drastically. This is why I disagree that honesty is the best policy.

do you agree or disagree\n\nI'm disagree because they still too young to get a career and they just enter high school, and to be in career is a lot of responsibility, and they still need to learn more to be in career, because learning a career is like they are learning a job, and to learn about a job that you want to do for the rest of your life you need to know more like they did just enter to high school you need to learn more and be preparation and i think the grades has to be A, B, C, I think that how their grade has to be and when they grade are good and they are passing they can be in a career when they are in 10 grade but not in 9 grade so that s ' i why m ' not agree because can they not came to high school and a career get and 50% of the students in 9 grade are they not passing class their to get a career.\n\n First they are some that students just enter high to school they and still don t ' know about responsibility, and career is a lot of responsibility, and it ' s only for junior and seniors and when they are in 10 grade if had they English 10 they can sign in for a career, and get ready a for career, and they can choice what career ever they want like be a nursing, mechanic, and etc and they can choice like to career and what they ever say they that can choice they study will for it.\n\n Second if they are 16 years old they can choice a career, but if they are not 16 years old they can not choice a career they are still young but still like 50% of the students in 10 grade they don't give them a change to be in a career like me they did not have me a change I want to be a nursing but they did not have a change, and now i think i will to college and study to be a teacher or I don't really know because at the same time I think \"I want to be a famous\" like try to be in a movie or I don't really know what career i want to be in I'm junior and I still don't know what career I want to take because they did not have us other choices to study about, I wish we could had other choices to study in school not like nursing because other students that they want to be other things, but if we application to be a nursing it doesn't always have everyone at school a opportunity, they are some students that they want to be nursing and they applicate and they don't have them a chance but if that students doesn't study more, they will not have him/her the opportunity to study for nursing so my opinion is that they should not allow students that they just enter to school get a career.\n\n third I think that they should talk with them about career before they are in grade 10 ask and if them they really are to sign in for a career and they should think about what they career to want be in, but they are still young they should not be in young age if are the 16 old years or older them 17 they should allow to choice a career, if bu they are not older them 16 years old they should not allow what career they want to do they should talk to them about career but leave choice them a career.\n\n My opinion is that they not should let them career choice because a they are still to young and they need to know more about responsibility like they should start learning about responsibility my best friend Generic_Name she is in 9 grade, and she know about responsibility she take care of her little brother and she know what career she want to be she want to be a soccer player she is good in soccer and she is nice so and good friends they should be more grades 9 like my best friends that they already know about responsibility and they are 9 grades that they don ' t even respect the teacher and their family so that means that they don still ' t know about responsibility, and they should respect the teacher and their family because that show they that know about responsibility, some students that they enter to high school they don ' t respect even from students 10, 11 12, grade so ' s that why should they not allow thme selected a first career they had show to to respect they teacher, family, and self their.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

My showed cousin has wisdom and experience by me to telling me things like \" ' don do t this because things could. happen \" And like \" listen to what say people. \" The thing anyone tells you is important because if you make a mistake then you could remember what he said, you wont have to experience what other people go through if someone knows what it's like, you could end up in more worse stuff then you could already be in.\n\n One think reason I ' it s important to from learn experience others of is that if you a make mistake then you could go back and remember what that person told and you like be \" oh I should ' ve listened to them. \" When my cousin told me this then I knew I shouldn't be doing bad stuff like he did before. He wanted me to safe be, not and be in danger. I ' ve noticed that my really family cares and don ' t none want of children their, niece, , nephew cousins anyone, to in be bad a. situation\n\n Another reason I think it's important to learn from experience of others is that you wont have to experience what other people go through if someone explains to you for that you won't end up making bad choices. When you to want do things you know is that bad then ask older members family if they gone have through it for then they tell could you, and you probably could before reconsider it doing. My cousin me told multiple stuff has he and done he warned me about it. so I knew that I should listen to him and not risk it.\n\n A third reason I think it's important to learn from experience of others is that you could end up in more worse stuff then you could already be in. When choose you to do bad first something, of think the consequences. Cousin my told always me \" think first \" it always stayed head in my, saying that certain. Always remember what your family is telling you because then you can end up telling your kids or little family members that you'll end up having. The stuff that could end up happening to you could most likely end up being bad and you don't want that.\n\n These are reasons why it's important to learn from experience of others. Family your knows ' what s best they because have maybe gone through it. Trust, always them don ' t stuff you do think may that you can ' t do. Do that stuff good is for. you Maybe life is different for others but you need to trust what people say because it could influence you in life somehow.

They will also make sure that we are doing good and school will help us make the right decision and are life and to never give up in her life they will encourage you to keep trying more hard so you can rich and accomplish your goal you have in the future and to be someone you want.\n\n Second are, character traits are influence are by society because the society us surround, tell us what around happening the and world they will be always their to help you and what you need to and you make you feel are important to them in their life. They will also make sure that you move forward in your life and tell you that you are good person around them society help you move around the world help you have good experience in your life.\n\n Third, are character trait are influence are by peers because are tell peers us to do the bad thing we are not so to do post, influence peers you by going wrong the direction in your and life they also take to you make bad the thing that have you never done.

However, keep some things to yourself if you think it's not positive to say to another. Second, It might make the person feel bad if you do say something harsh to them. Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times. Sometimes you have to say what's right in order to not hurt someones feelings from what you said. For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return. Secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later. They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.\n\nSecondly, If you are honest \"all the time\" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher. By the wrong person you talk to, you might accidentally start a riot.\n\nLastly, you should be careful on how honest you are to people, because you don't know whether they are going through some stuff you are pointing out to them. Being truthful to someone and saying everything to them might make them upset on how you view stuff in the world also. Honesty is like an opinion that may cause someone that went through something upset them drastically. This is why I disagree that honesty is the best policy.

For, example got students stress very during school and year they want to make something watching fun TV like, video playing games, and go their out with family. However can students do all they what want to when teachers designed do for projects them. Students have the all day, so they can do the projects that teachers assign them to do and have fun.\n\n Reason first, teachers will design summer that projects will help students prepare the next for school year. Know what teachers students will things need to know how and hard class that is going to be if the student is prepare not the for year next. For example, some students are very bad at math and they don't get any project designed by teachers during the summer. When student the to is back school and get he a math higher class have a he struggle year on that class because teacher didn the ' t assign any project for the student during summer the. Also teachers should design projects for students because students don't know about the new classes that they will take. It' hard for students to create their own projects to learn.\n\n Reason second teachers, design should projects students for because that will students help to not forget what things the learn students in the before year. Designed teachers it projects will help students to review that things they learn and not forget a lot because students will continue. learning Some students are very far away from home because they are on vacations, but they can do everything from where they are. The projects that teachers design maybe will be on computers and students can take 10 to 15 minutes to work on projects, so they were learning and having fun during the summer. Teachers designed projects help will students to learning continue during summer that can students make ease for for the next year.\n\n In conclusion, teachers should design summer projects for students because that will help students prepare for the next school year. Students ' t can designed summer projects because don students ' t know how hard that class to is going be. Students also will learning continue as they ' re doing the projects that the teachers dessing them for to do. I think if teachers don't assign summer projects for students they will not study. Teacher know the student what and need the summer projects will students help summer on. That's why I think teachers should dessing students projects.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

However, keep some things to yourself if you think it's not positive to say to another. Second, It might make the person feel bad if you do say something harsh to them. Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times. Sometimes you have to say what's right in order to not hurt someones feelings from what you said. For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return. Secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later. They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.\n\nSecondly, If you are honest \"all the time\" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher. By the wrong person you talk to, you might accidentally start a riot.\n\nLastly, you should be careful on how honest you are to people, because you don't know whether they are going through some stuff you are pointing out to them. Being truthful to someone and saying everything to them might make them upset on how you view stuff in the world also. Honesty is like an opinion that may cause someone that went through something upset them drastically. This is why I disagree that honesty is the best policy. From the situation you are in say respectful stuff towards the person. It might make you a better person if you are not saying negative things towards a person too.\n\nIn conclusion, I disagree with \"Honesty is the best policy\" by the situation you are in with the person and what they are going through.

Teenagers offended tend to drive at high speeds at night because the might be drunk, it will prevent then to not get influence by bad people, if this law is approved it will really help keep teenagers safe.\n\nTo begin with, in streets at night there are lot bad people, teenagers are expose to a lot of dangers, when they are in the streets at night curfews can prevent this to happen. Teenagers could be kidnapped or raped when they are in the streets at night and some cases they can be forced to do drugs or join gangs, if they dont do this things they might be beaten to death until they do it.\n\nSecond reason, There are teenagers at night who tempt to drive at high speeds when they are drunk. This should not be allow because, it can end in car crash, teenagers don't have a lot of experience driving at night. For example, I had a friend who always likes to drive when hi was drunk at hing speeds in the highways at night, One night he had car accident because he was driving drunk and at a high speed he is dead now.\n\nThirdly, curfew can prevent teenagers from doing things that they are not supposed to do.

Example for, Students usually arrive late to class only because they hanging with out their in friends halls the paying and to less attention what their timely scheduele is at school, and if a arrives student late class to, They have missed part of what they are about to for learn the day and distract others from their learning.\n\n Another reason why students could benefit from being homeschooled is that, There would be no attendance policy and you get to learn things faster. I think this is true because, There are always those types of students who always arrive to school/class late and have already missed out on half of the lesson only beacuse they couldn't get thereselves up in the morning just to get to school. Also, walking into class late not only ruins your learning time but it also distracts others who are trying to learn. If you home schooled get you are also learning things faster, Because, you don ' have t holding anybody you back from you learning time and you get to move on in a faster pace then others; For example, if Say some students cannot figure how out complete to a lesson, It makes just it slower the for class because everyone has to the understand subject in order to move on to the next portion of the lesson.\n\n However, Reasons as to why I do not think students would benefit from going to school at home. Reason the why I think this is true is the amount because time of of learning that would set be up at home would be at diffrent home then at school; for example, students might get to at comfortable home and might think they can get from up bed whatever at time they. please Example another why of a student not would benefit going from school to at home is because, the home school would student be by distracted their surroundings. Since the student is familiar are very their with at home enviroment, it would very be to hard attention pay listen and to what you are learning only because you are of distracted your familiar surroundings.\n\n In Conclusion, are These all the examples reasons and as to I why think students should benefit be and to allowed homeschoold be.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

people but i believe that by giving examples is not the only way that us as human we can learn from, because as humans we have many special abilities of learning, we can learn, and inluence our selves on what happens in our lifes all the good moment and the bad moments that we go through we influence our selves from them for example like being caugh stealing or breaking into a private property that puts our lifes in a bad situation we can go to the jail and from being in jail we can influence our selves to became a better person.\n\n Schools and teachers should make more tours to students, and take them to the most sadnes, and poorly part of the cityes where people sell drugs, where there is a lot of crimes, the streets are full of trash, and people living on the streets to show them and at the same time encourage them that if they don't push their selves in school, they will end up like these poor people, students will learn and change their minds and take more seriously school, because us as humans we have the power to control our minds, and change the way we think, and when students see this poor people living in extremely bad conditions and surrounded by all types of cimes but not just that they understand that their lifes could end in any moment because there is no police that could protect them when they are being attacking this tours may be a good way to influece students to study and prepare for their future with a wealthy life.\n\n I people believe can influence their lives in many ways like being in prison for a minory charge, prison is a good way and a good place to influence and encourage people change to their lifes for good, and help them take good decision when they get to being free again for a second chances in the world real, but while being in prison people can learn so much because if they did not get any kind school of teaching i many believe prison allowed prisoners take some school the for ones that are trying to remake their lifes and when they get free prisoners will be more prepare and to ready not waste the second chance of being free prison can people influence for not comiting crimes again because people will know that being in prison not is the best and smartes way to spend our lifes in earth why thats prison its a good place to influence people.\n\n A good way to influence people is programs making or activities with peoples that don ' t have legs, or of some them arms but they still can do a lot of things and a lots of them don ' t depend on any others to have a life but this will people influence that have a complete body we complain about our body its imortant to teach people no that matter if we an arm or a leg can we still have normal a sometimes life we say that we can not find job or that we can not do sertain types of jobs when people don that ' t have a body comlete can find job this progrmas it influence can people to not complain anymore because we have everything while people that don ' t have legs can still do everithyng without complaining.\n\n Examples of life behavior its not the only way that can influence people, theres many ways that can make change a person's life, like being charged with crimes of stealing, punching someone, or entereing in a private property, and being sentenced for a couple years in prison, or can encourage their lifes form others that don't have a total body because when they born without a leg or arm thats why i believe that examples of life behavior can be a good way to influence people but it can be more ways to make people change their lifes and take better decisions.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with

However, keep some things to yourself if you think it's not positive to say to another. Second, It might make the person feel bad if you do say something harsh to them. Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times. Sometimes you have to say what's right in order to not hurt someones feelings from what you said. For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return. Secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later. They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.\n\nSecondly, If you are honest \"all the time\" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher. By the wrong person you talk to, you might accidentally start a riot.\n\nLastly, you should be careful on how honest you are to people, because you don't know whether they are going through some stuff you are pointing out to them. Being truthful to someone and saying everything to them might make them upset on how you view stuff in the world also. Honesty is like an opinion that may cause someone that went through something upset them drastically. This is why I disagree that honesty is the best policy. From the situation you are in say respectful stuff towards the person. It might make you a better person if you are not saying negative things towards a person too.\n\nIn conclusion, I disagree with \"Honesty is the best policy\" by the situation you are in with the person and what they are going through.

The main reason why those people say that inactivity sirve an important porpoise is bescause they gets more tome to think what they want ta wo in their life snd have theres goals alreadly planned. According to the New York times the people who take a moment of inactivity usually they are confident and sure about what they want to make in their life, and what goals they want to set and achieve.

Being always active and working is the best way to achieve our goals. According to a study of the Generic_School, all the people that now is successful, they always were working on their goals and never had a moment where they thought that they had to stop and wait because the accomplishment was about to come. Wie olways have top be working, your goals never will corne easily. While we keep working on our goals, they will came to us soon.\n\n We accomplish more when we are always doing something because we don't waste time that can be used to work on our goals. Sometimes when we are working hard on our goals, there's a time where we think that we have to stop and rest, but we shouldn't do that because that would be a waste of time that would be used to keep working.

Now he is not a Industrial Engineer, he never achieved his goal because he wasted the time that he could use to achieve his goal.\n\n Though some people say that inactivity is more effective than activity to be accomplish because is a better way to set our goals, activity is the best way to be accomplish because we can achieve our goals more soon and we don't waste useful time. In conclusion, as you can see inactivity will not be the best way because the reality is that if we can done our goals and get a lot of wonderful things just being always active.

Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times. Sometimes you have to say what's right in order to not hurt someones feelings from what you said. For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return. Secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later. They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.\n\nSecondly, If you are honest \"all the time\" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher.

What they want to do in future? Schools should partnerships with companies becausa it helpes studients to know what ' s bether ffor them for example, what they ary interested en, get opportunities to explove the world, and helpes students to communicate wath others.\n\n One reason why it's beneficial for students is that they get to know what they are into. If students get a chance of this internship, it allows them to work with other people. When they'll work with different people with different cultures, it will let them know how to work and handle other people. They'll be able to do what they want to and they'll have an experience too. There are many students who don't know what they want to do or what they want to be. Joining this internship will help them to work amd deside what's is besto forth them. Many times they don't get an opportunity to know what they would like to do. There ars namy students who woul'd juste toke any class with their friends evening if they don ' t like because they are in difficaul sitiation and don ' t knows what they wanna to do. So, they just decides to go with friends and have an experience if they like it or not. Latter no they quit that claas because they feel itv ' s net what they ilke. Is also os a toroble for schcool counselors beacurs then they have to change students shedule which is very trouble taking sometimes. Im lhe oder hand if they get a chance thougt inteship it will help them [[por sure fo know what they ar'e interested in. So in the future they won't get confused what they wanted to do but didn't get an opportunity to know.\n\n Next reason is that students get so many opportunities to explore the world. It is verty difficult or close to impossile thet sudent get a chance ton learn about the word's. Thys is great to explore the worl &amp learn new things which many studengts want, but bad Lock not everyon geo to explove. Exploring the world or learning new things is really good for students. It allows them to know how the world is and what they can get in future working with other people. Getting an opportunity from this internship is very beneficial to explore the world because this makes students know how to work with other people. It helps them to learn about different cultures and make new friends. When they explove the world they can get to learing knew languas which maked so much easier for students ho get lob anywhere thery wen to. If they know different languages people will accept their application for internships or for jobs. In United Estates, most ofo ht times peopes look for students who speaks more than one language because I'ts hleps them to make their Company's mores effective ib gppd way. Students don't ' it hestiate to talk to others, especially when they know so many different languages which takes tthem feel there can acieve anything they whant two.\n\n Last reason is that students will be able to communicate and understand how is it to talk with others from this internship. It's happends mora ol the times students maight konw soy much about what ' s going on but they don ' t get to talk. There is'll a reason there don ' t [[talken vith athers is that they feel shy ora are not confindent on themselves. If shcools lef then go or participate for internships ti will allow them to became mpre confident. Wehen students whill get an internship to worK and tolk with anoter people they wan ' t feel shy anymore and wild feel confidence bay practicing.\n\n Communication is the most important part of our lives if students don't talk they won't understand what's happening, which can destroy their school lives. Int schools og outside the schoops, communication skills must ba best to improe yourself. If studends don ' t comunicat whey don ' t got ideas or don ' th rellay learn nwe things. Communication allows students to get the chance and gives them right to speak. When they will speak they'll feel confident and won't care what other thinks.\n\n Many people argue thats it's not great for some students because it already have so many things to do like they have games or jobs after school. However, if schools have partnership vhit different companies this could be the best opporutunity far studients to experinces want they qre interested n, discover the world, and become confidents dnd communicative. This will make students know that they can do what they want to.\n\n I conclution, buying working wit othep companies will help estudents to make their decisions more confidently and nont to feel shy about tem. It alsl cloud help them fot Kwow what threy wanna do in their lives. Thia patnership allows students to lerne new things and langues which I think ara very diffikult without internship.

I think that having a problem is a chance for you to get back up and try again because when having a problem not only can you learn from your mistakes but you can see what you did wrong and ask someone that has succeeded to find a better way of helping you. You can also observe and look through what others around you have done before.\n\n You can learn from your mistakes for observing wath's the people auound yu have done that had mde whem succeed. Learning from your mistakes isn ' t always as beb as you think it migh br, it ' S a place for you to start over with a fresh start knowing that the skil you have tried before doesn ' t work, as thant you know what to dos before working on the previous work yopu had doen. For example one day you might come across a challenge on a project that you will certainly find hard, so you have to make mistakes over and over to build up a good relationship with that project. If, yoy had at relationship with someone and you made a mistaked, that doesn ' t mean you have to And yor relationship you can work things uo and practice on Boeing g better person and learming from ypur mistakes. Your will have an certain point in life where you face a challenge and hobe to truy egaing over a thousand sessions because that ' s a time In life whn you need to see where you are going with yourself and how you want thoose mistakes that o have done go in life therefore, that ' s how you learn from your mistakes.\n\n When you come across a problem you shouldn't always be putting the worry on yourself, you can ask someone for help in fact you need to ask someone that has already went through a problem as similar as yours so you can ask for advice on how they dealt with that situation. Asking someone for help can make you feel better because someone has already dealt with the problem that you are going through and they have enough experience on that problem. For explample there are scientist hwo come across mistakes and they get back up and try the very vest for a long time so that they can get a good result, Math teachers face some ward quatstions they fail, get bak uo and do the best they can over and over again antil Then find the right problem solution to the question. We all come across problems everyday, but that doesn't mean we give up we fight back until the problem has been solved even if it takes days we still try our best to solve the problem. When we face a problem that is our time to get our chance and do our best by asking people for help and learning from our mistakes. Usually when people are working on a project that has been assigned to them by their professors or teachers they seem to ask themselves if they are doing the project right or they second guess themselves, how would you know if you're doing it right or not when you haven't asked the person that has assigned you that project, or someone that has already proceeded to succeed.\n\n I agree that having a problem is a chance to do your best because that way you can proceed to succeed by asking peers around you for help or you can get back up by learning from your mistake and observing others do what you're doing. You should always tell a frien our someoen that you feld comfortable WHITH about what you'll are going through en how they cane help o and comfort you.

Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times.

For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth.

However, keep some things to yourself if you think it's not positive to say to another. Second, It might make the person feel bad if you do say something harsh to them. Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times. Sometimes you have to say what's right in order to not hurt someones feelings from what you said. For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return. Secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later. They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.\n\nSecondly, If you are honest \"all the time\" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher. By the wrong person you talk to, you might accidentally start a riot.\n\nLastly, you should be careful on how honest you are to people, because you don't know whether they are going through some stuff you are pointing out to them. Being truthful to someone and saying everything to them might make them upset on how you view stuff in the world also. Honesty is like an opinion that may cause someone that went through something upset them drastically. This is why I disagree that honesty is the best policy. From the situation you are in say respectful stuff towards the person. It might make you a better person if you are not saying negative things towards a person too.\n\nIn conclusion, I disagree with \"Honesty is the best policy\" by the situation you are in with the person and what they are going through.

Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times. Sometimes you have to say what's right in order to not hurt someones feelings from what you said. For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return. Secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later. They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.\n\nSecondly, If you are honest \"all the time\" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher.

However, keep some things to yourself if you think it's not positive to say to another. Second, It might make the person feel bad if you do say something harsh to them. Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times. Sometimes you have to say what's right in order to not hurt someones feelings from what you said. For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return. Secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later. They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.\n\nSecondly, If you are honest \"all the time\" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher.

Same people nelieve curfew wll keep teenager out of trouble beacurs the will de no midnigth party, no pleying out ata night and n'\u00ba going to friendas house at night. Other peples believe thah curfew unfairly interfere into young peopie life because they needs you. knew how the real world is eat night, Going te movers and also having fun as a teens. I think curfew will keep teen out of trouble because the will be no midnight party, no playing out at night and no going to friends house night.\n\n First, Curfew will kkep tenages out ok trouble because thr will be no mint paty. Mostly at midnight parday tere cav be o lot of troubles pepleo cand even do carry things. For example, When a teen go to a midnight party they will must likely smoker or drink,and when he/she gets high, or wasted they may do something carry. Something like driving back home in the car why dunk and it will most likely lead to car case, or police may case them. Thats is why the curfew is there to keep teenagers out of trouble.\n\n Secondly curfew will help a lot keeping teenager out of trouble because the will be no playing out at night. Wine teens are out an nighgt thy make care discretion and do carry thiks that will get them in la lot of thoublesome. For example, When are was in my county Liberia, we used to out at night and play,but one night something bad happen. The was this boy name Generic_Name he toke a rock trough it in the up in the air. Then that rock starting to come down,but no one was able to see it because it was night. The was thie girl name Generic_Name who with right ander where the rocke wsa coming down at, but didi not konwn I''t. The rok hitted her in there head and Shi starting to bleed. They why playing out at night is not save. Curfew will healp kkep the teenagers save.\n\n However, Not everyone again that curfew will help keep the teenager out of trouble. Some people believe that curfew unfairly interfere in young people life because they will not have the change to find out how the would is a night, Will not have to change to after party at friends house, and massing out to have fun as a teen. Other wise curfew will help keep teenager out of trouble because going to friend house at night is not good a lot of bad things happens in there in the night and must teen dont have the best discretion when it comes to getting out of trouble so the curfew will help they with that.\n\n In colnclusion curfew waill keep teens out of toroble. Nro midnight paryty, and no going to firends house At night. Other may not like that;they may is unfairly interfere young life but is not. When teenager go to parts ao night or just out, Their do a lof of carry thing which they know iwill get tehm ith tj truoble. Like dring, ror event drive after they drink aa lot.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

Well I have many times with my mom. My mom helps me from preventing bad things. For example, one day my friend and I's wanted to go to the salestore walkin my ourselves and we asked my mom if we could go butm, my mom didn ' th left us beuause she sad we could geht kidnapped. Iike dag, my Mum ann her friend were walking by their selft ' S anmnd they almost got kidnappped so, we didn ' at go. IT is important to know people ' so experiences so, you''re won ' t do the same mistake as the other person didd, learn from theys expeciences, and holp jou frem preventing beds things. Experiences are always shared. They''s are veru important.\n\n The first reason why you should share experiences with people is to prevent yourself from doing the same mistake as the other person. You cacb also chice a beter choice. For example, one bay, if went to the dactors and I has to get thi flus shot but, I didn ' t want it's becease In don't ' it like shots. Then, my mom told e than oen day, she has to gut the ful shot and she didn't want it so, she didn't get it and the next day she got sick so, then I decided to get the flu shot. Doing the same mistake as the other person is not as fun so, listening to people's experiences is a great way from preventing the same mistake. Many people make mistakes and learn from them. Mistakes hare always mad but nor when yoou have already been warned.\n\n The secoond rason ske to learn from experiences. Learnig from another person ' s experiense can help you Bye knorwing hwo ton do something good. Like one day, I was doing something wrong and my teacher came to me and talked to me so, I wouldn't do it again and showed me how to do it in a better way. Doing fings in de bettter whay can be much more easier. Never give up when you can't do something, Just keep trying or ask for help. Learning something nwe is I everiday thing. Anthoer example, it's when I didn ' t know how to make a cakr snd my aunty help me e the cakem was baked wer good. Learning is a very fun and exciting experience.\n\n Third reason is so, they can help you from preventing bad things. Bad thngs never take you somewhre gyt. One tiem, MU sister and I werw misbehaving and we thought we wouldn ' t get in trouble andl we were hiting my 3 year old sister because she hit us with a bat, playing arraund and mer got grounded afterwars and we couldn't ' t go ro the pool anymore. When you need a opinion whether you should do something or not just ask anyone so, you would prevent doing something bad. Help anyone from preventing something bad. Bad things never come out the best. Workin hard is alwes the best thing to dou.\n\n Finelly, Prevent doing everything yhat is bad and ask for oppions on whether I you should do iw os bot.

However, keep some things to yourself if you think it's not positive to say to another. Second, It might make the person feel bad if you do say something harsh to them. Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times. Sometimes you have to say what's right in order to not hurt someones feelings from what you said. For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return. Secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later. They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.\n\nSecondly, If you are honest \"all the time\" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher. By the wrong person you talk to, you might accidentally start a riot.\n\nLastly, you should be careful on how honest you are to people, because you don't know whether they are going through some stuff you are pointing out to them. Being truthful to someone and saying everything to them might make them upset on how you view stuff in the world also. Honesty is like an opinion that may cause someone that went through something upset them drastically. This is why I disagree that honesty is the best policy. From the situation you are in say respectful stuff towards the person. It might make you a better person if you are not saying negative things towards a person too.\n\nIn conclusion, I disagree with \"Honesty is the best policy\" by the situation you are in with the person and what they are going through.

However, keep some things to yourself if you think it's not positive to say to another. Second, It might make the person feel bad if you do say something harsh to them. Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times. Sometimes you have to say what's right in order to not hurt someones feelings from what you said. For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return. Secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later. They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.\n\nSecondly, If you are honest \"all the time\" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher. By the wrong person you talk to, you might accidentally start a riot.\n\nLastly, you should be careful on how honest you are to people, because you don't know whether they are going through some stuff you are pointing out to them. Being truthful to someone and saying everything to them might make them upset on how you view stuff in the world also. Honesty is like an opinion that may cause someone that went through something upset them drastically. This is why I disagree that honesty is the best policy.

is like being honest with your self. if you are honest to your self then you can be honest with your love ones like youre family, friends, and all the people that are there for you when you need them or when you have a problem they will always help you.\n\n thats shows to be honest with the ones you love because once you lie to them you wont stop laying, and that can get you to have consequences only because you just can't be honest with your friends, and family, and all the people that are around you if they are there for you and if the trust you dont pay them back with laying to them just be honest because if you lie to them you will lose the family that was there for you when you need them those friends that were there to help you when you have a problem.\n\n like for explample laying 1s zhe reason whay mant people ruin there relationships. laying iis the reason why people dont work out because, they dont have trust no each other that the only thing that then think about is to lie to each other because they just can ' t find a way to be honest ah howere some people might end up hurt because you were just laying to them the whole time and sometimes when someone is hurting another person is likely hurting them sefl because they can ' t fix all that pain that they did to others thats why think about what are you going to do or soy ust take time and about before saying something that it would hurt other people thats why think about it twice not just acting like nothing happen think about what oth people can feel, think or say.\n\n if you are honest to others you will have a normal life with honesty not just with lies and all that stuff that can hurt other people . another example if you go to an interview of work if you get there and the boss starts giving you a question to answer , and to the first question the boss gives you or who ever is doing the interview to that first question if you say a lie to that question is not going to end up good because if the person who is doing the interview keeps on asking you questions and you are just saying lies then thats not, going to work at all because now you cant stop laying can you can't control your self after saying a lie then you will not have the job because you were just laying and laying to others is like laying to your self.\n\n all i got to say is to be honest with yousr friends, an familly and all tahat people that was bean there for y when YOY neeed them. just be honest if you re going to say something that is not honest and its a lie then don't say it think about it twice anyway try youre best on what you do don't life your life with lies because at the end you will realize what you said was wrong and it was en the truth then you will see at the end that what you did wasn't honest even that some people think that laying is the best and when you say a lie and another lie and that people that you love your family, and your friends once they Belize you and when they find out that you just lie to then they would never believe you again.\n\n i think it would happen on the same story that my mom told me once she said that a long thime there was a guy who used to have sheep ' s he lived in Small town and she told me that the guys one day the he was outside feeding his sheep ' s he started screaming for help saying that the wolf was trying to attack him, and then everyone in the town went outside to helf him but when half of the people wath lived in the town got where the man was they saw that there was nothing, then the man with the sheep ' s started luffing because the people of the town actually believed him then the next they the man wint the sheep ' s started screaming again and staying the sama thing he said before tht people of the town believe him again dan the people of there town got mad at hi ahdn the leaved then the next day he'll stardet screaming gain and this time tie men was saying the truth but it was too late because no body of the town came out to help him becuase they were thinking that if he lie to them two time he might be doing it again then the man was scared and keep on screaming that the wolf was eating he's sheep's but no body help him because they thought the he was just laying again then at the end the wolf eat all the men's sheep's and no body of the town believe him ever again and the man stayed all alone because no body believe him.\n\n i learn a give lessen only because of DIS story because this story is telling me tho be honestly with others, if you soy a lie and yous keep on staying it they won ' th believe you because you wer laying all the time so be honest wath your sefl and others.\n\n if you can ' t say something honest don't ' at saying something f you will retreat, cndy think Abut

However, keep some things to yourself if you think it's not positive to say to another. Second, It might make the person feel bad if you do say something harsh to them. Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times. Sometimes you have to say what's right in order to not hurt someones feelings from what you said. For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return. Secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later. They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.\n\nSecondly, If you are honest \"all the time\" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher. By the wrong person you talk to, you might accidentally start a riot.\n\nLastly, you should be careful on how honest you are to people, because you don't know whether they are going through some stuff you are pointing out to them. Being truthful to someone and saying everything to them might make them upset on how you view stuff in the world also. Honesty is like an opinion that may cause someone that went through something upset them drastically. This is why I disagree that honesty is the best policy.

It is better to work alone,the other side say that it is better to work alone because we can be responsible and confident ,how ever it is not .Although some people might argue it is better to work alone, actually it is better to work in group because we can finish our work quickly and we can get learn more or get more knowledge.\n\n The first raison that explein that I'ts is better to work ia group because we cah finishy our work guickly. For example uin my history class smoe of the studengts choose to do there work there own and some of them they choose fo do work by e group the stunent that finish early willl get a price and the students that choose to work in group finished earlier amd got there's price. It is better to work in group because if we would have not done the work in group would not finish early and won the price because we have done our work in group we won the price. it is better to wark in group to finished our wo!rk guickly. It is better to work in group, the second example that support this is; there was man who had to fix a lot of cars' in two days, and get money for his house rent he could not do it by his own so he called his friends to help him and they helped him they did the work in group and he finished his work quickly and also he payed for his house rent. It is is better to work in groop because if the man had not finish fixing the cars ' he wuold have been oon the street but because He worked in group he finished fis work quikly andl played he's rente. It is'll better to wokr in groop to finish our WorK quickly.\n\n The second reason is It is better to work in group because we can know or learn new things. For example i didnt know how to do pay chart for my chemistry presentation and i asked my friends to help me and they say lets teach each other i group and anad them though how to dh it and i did it I\u2019ve gotten 100 on it. ii 1s better to work in group ti know knew things, becauce ih i didnt do my pay chart and present it i would have got 0 jin my grades but bescuse i worked in group [[ann i learned i gotten 100. It is best t work in group tou lornd new things. it is better to work in group to learn more the second example that support this is there was a girl she did not know how to swim and her sister and brother thought her how to swim and also they teach each other how to swim in different ways in group and she learned how to swim. it is better to work in group to know or learn new things if she did not learn how to swim she could have got in the water and died and she would not know how to swim in different ways but they taught her in group and she learned how to swim. it is bether to works iin group so we can tearn more thinks.\n\n The other side might say it is better to work alone because we can be responsible and confident however we can be more responsible and more confident if we work together in group. For example there was a lot of kids that was learning how to learn a bike but there was on kid that fell confident and he did not want to learn with them, he was 11 years old he was so confident that he can ride a bike by him self but he could not ride the bike cause he was not not in the group to learn how to ride a bike, so he feel when he ride the bike and hurt his leg. It is better two work in group, if the kid had learned have to rid aa byke in the group he would net feel bad hs felled sna hurt his leg, because he though he clould do it' by him self. it is better to work in group. it is better ty work alone fot bee responsible the secong example that explains this is there ware boy that i know he wanted to leave by him self and got in tm a big hoause but Hi could dont'n afford the rant. it is beter to work tn group if the boy has worked in group and payed the rent with thi gropu ha wood hace afford the rant and leave there but he choose to work alone so he could not afford it .\n\n Although some people might argue it is better to work alone, actually it is better to work in group because we can finish our work quickly and we can get more experience or get more knowledge.\n\n It' is better tm work in group, because working alone is nt better than working in group, when we work ir grous we will ne moore safer we can accomplish things easily, finish qui?kly and learn de new things, it is better trto work in group to susses.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times.

They are an important asset to us because without them honestly everyone could potentially be out of control; we need their help and it's not wrong to need or ask for help. Some people may need it much more than others, but that's why their are guidance counselors at school it you don't feel comfortable telling a parent or people who need legal help have lawyers to get help from them we can't just do whatever, we need help all the time no matter how little of a thing it may seem. I don ' to think ti ' a to wise tou just let people do what they wat because they feel like them don ' t meed help or advinces own someyhing. Going of instinct or just your idears isn ' to the way i't should [[bi. We don't know what kind of ideas some people may have.\n\n People should be able to make their own choices , but a little bit of guidance when making the decision wouldn't hurt anyone. Sometimes you really do need the help whether it's from your mom, to a police officer or a lawyer. Not everyone likes to seek for help when they need to make a tough decision and I get why it can be difficult asking others to get involved with the things we do. If we were to folllow all our ideais and instincts fo you really abelieve this worls would te the way it ske rigth now. Probably not, we humans can make some really bad choices, not everyone but we have a good handful of people that don't care about what they do, say or who they hurt. If evereone! was just going off instict thois world would definitely be messed up and all ower tie place it ' the be way more messed uo thin ti already os. We are human we can't go off whatever we feel is right in our minds because that could land you in trouble and it may not even be worth it. We have to ask for help when we need it no matter who it's coming from. Asking someone just for advice can make a difference in many ways. We get told whhat to do for o reason Wue neee helps and rules. We have many peopels around us ot talk toa. Seeking help is never bad itv cah chande your mid abut the littlest ideas to really the importat ones.\n\n The people than don ' at thinck they need anyone s opinion or holpe on making a wise decesion are really the pepols that need she moste hepl. Here is an example in a TV show I watched not to long ago this teenage girl took her life but didn't ask for help from anyone she just wanted people to know she was upset but who was going go know when carrying around a big smile. The point is that not every person has the mentality we all think so differently and getting professional help from someone who sees or hears things like that we may feel or think is normal and they can give us the answers we would never find on our own.\n\n It ' is readlly imponant for everyone to understand thats you cav ' t just do whatever wen please. Their are consequences for absolutely ereryone roaming around with wind idears add thinking you can just do what your mid i tell yon. For instance would y feel comforble knorwing we jus do whatever whenever because we don ' t hae limits or rules or would youy like to see o friend falled because they put their pride overt getting helo. I sure would not enjoy seeing a close frinde or faminly menmber getting dragged down Becoses they were ignorant and decided not to looked [[por help with their problems whin they lt dth mosts.\n\n In conclusion I agree with seeking help from experts stead of having weirdos goe oof what hey think vis right because I probably won ' to think ths sama theings others do. I ' d rather see pepie lining ap to talk to someong about their problems wheater they be nig or not the ones who don ' t wanna help are tje one who just want to struggle on thear own and faught it out. Those are the people who prefer living in their own little world. I ask for advice and opinions on a daily basis because it makes me feel better and more secure about my decisions and I hope that's what others feel too. Asking for advice has never been o bat thing everyone has your back is you need the help i ' am sure tey ale many people hwo needs to know its good to seek help and not just stell in a shell and swallow t.

If so you might've heard one from Michelangelo. Michelangelo was a greath artisit that onec said \" The greater danger for most ol usa likes nit in setting your aim too high and falling shirts; but in setting our aim too low, and achieving our market \". I don't agree with this statement because the greatest danger lies in us in setting our aim too high and falling short. The statement what Michelangelo said is negatively impacted because it can cause us to stress and make us act different negatively.\n\n The greatest danger for most of us lies in setting our aim too high and falling short because of stress. Bye setting uor aim to hai, strees can make us feel like giving up on whats we want to accomlish in our leaves. I wie do this we we'll feel hopeless and nont try again. Another reason why stress is related to this is because it can make us feel tired and lazy. If ww become tired ENDE laisy it can make us overthink un have negative toughts. These are the ressons and examples of whah stress cae do to US if we set ourt aime too higt.\n\n The greatest danger for most of us lies in setting our aim too high and falling short because it can make us act different negatively. If we focus so much on setting our aim high it can make us forget important stuff. For excample, it can make uo forget to have quaity time with ower Familie and frienders. We would lose the connections towards our family and friends if we are only focusing on one thing. Another reason is it can make us act bad and forget our manners. For example if we focus on setting our aim too high and spending so much on it all day it can ruin our sleeping schedule and cause us too act cranky. Thes are the resons adn expamples f acting differend negatively if we are setting oue aim too high and falling short.\n\n Somer people think the greater dagerous for mot of is lies in seetting our aim too low andn acheiving our mark. They think that because if we set our aim too low we won't be caring so much on what we want to accomplish. Por example, I we are juste tring to rest or relaxing by a hit, they's think we don ' t actually care on finishig our tasks. Another reason whi thei probably think that us because we wan ' t be focusing on important things in life if wie dog ' at complish oure goals first. For example, if be don ' t show zhe effort in front os the they will automatically assume ww don ' th shows interst in accomplishing it and think we don ' t really care what we wait do in leave. Even though this may be true, I' still thinking that the grethear dagerous for us sh's setting our airm too high anf folling sorts because it can cause most problems.\n\n The statement what Michelangelo said is negatively impacted because it can cause us to stress and make us act different negatively. It can make U.S.A streeses if we sep our airm too high and making usa act different negatively if se focus too much oon sitting owr aim too highest and falling short. By setting our aim too high it can cause us to be stressed and make us feel like giving up and not wanting to finish our work. It can also make us stress by not getting enough sleep if were only focusing on one thing. Thees are the resons why I dissagree with Michelangelo bacause e agrees that the greatest danger for must of us lyes in setting iour aim too low, and acheiving yout mark.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

By the wrong person you talk to, you might accidentally start a riot.\n\nLastly, you should be careful on how honest you are to people, because you don't know whether they are going through some stuff you are pointing out to them. Being truthful to someone and saying everything to them might make them upset on how you view stuff in the world also. Honesty is like an opinion that may cause someone that went through something upset them drastically. This is why I disagree that honesty is the best policy. From the situation you are in say respectful stuff towards the person. It might make you a better person if you are not saying negative things towards a person too.\n\nIn conclusion, I disagree with \"Honesty is the best policy\" by the situation you are in with the person and what they are going through.

For example my biggest dream many years ago was to learn how to draw. I always dreamed being someone who could create art from anything. But tehre were many reasons that almost maed me forgot aboat thant dreames. Another reason of why I think that failure could lead us to the best things in life, is because if we dont't try, we won't never know if it could be possible. Also failure is bot somethnig that we should be afraid of, I think that failure can give us experience un life that cacn leed us to sucsses, things and experiences that only live san ofer us.\n\n Failure ing life, for me \u00ecs just anothers opportunuty to try [[agian something but wiche the same or mare enthusiasm. For example, when I started learning how to draw or paint, there were many reasons that almost made me forgot about my dream. One of tu mean reasons was that I didn ' th have enough materials to make's al simple peas of art, in was hard for me because in my country I didn ' t ahv trhe same opportunties that I have nohow. And I went from failure to failure but I always tried to forgot about negative things and I was just focused about being someone different in life. Now that I'm better at drawing and also I have the materials that I always wanted, I'll keep getting better and I can say that it wasn't easy but it worth it. I know that I still have a lot to learn, i'll keep follow my dream, and I know that one day I'll say I FINALLY DID IT.\n\n Another reason of why I agree with Churchill's statement, is because most of the time we don't see what we have until is gone. And failure can lead us to the success, because it can give us experiences that only life can offer. For exaemple if we do samething rong we know that he won ' t be able to fix the past, but the only think thst we can does is to learn from our mistaks and try to ba better ih the future. And that is why I think that failure can lead us to success because if we don't know how hard is to obtain something important in life, we never will appreciate what we have or what a person is doing for us. And is every hard to imagine something thst we have ' t experienced, is heard ton trie and learn foom what wie hear than learn from wath's wy have being true. Tha is why we shouldn ' at by afraid to do someing or to trie new fhings ih life, because nobody was born knorwing things, only life can give is the knowledge ot learn and teach.\n\n We shouldn't be afraid of fall through, because life is to do new things everyday. Life is to live the way we want, having in mind that nobody is perfect and it's fine to make mistakes, but we have to learn from them. For example, many years ago I was afraid to leave my country, for many reasons I though that I wouldn't make it. But my mean motivation to come tp htis contry, was you. see my fayher fou the firs time affter 18 years. I [[whas scared to fail, but at their some time i'll saw that's opportunity luck the greatest thing that o even had. That ' s othey reasone ofo why hi agree with the satement, because leke all thi rest of th? people i ' m not perfect. But I ' m proud of some o the decions that I had made in withe past, ansd at tne same's time I learned fram my mistakes and I ' I'll keep leaning.\n\n The hardest things in life, [[ara the thinks that w'll alwys worths it. I share Churchill's idea because you have to suffer before to triumph. Everybody can try and teach you something, but your best teacher always is going to be life. To fall through is n't a defead, 1s ein nw opportunity to do someing better. End ti's find to failure in older to filnd success, we just have do stand ut and try again by wihit the same or more enthusiasm.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

Only thay 5% of tje studients have the chance to graduate in shree years instady of four yea.rs. A survey show that after of their graduation the majority of the students don't know what to do with their life. In high school the studengts don't ' t have enough maturity souch to talk important decisions and consiquently threy don ' th know wthat to do. Is a fact that the hagh school as not e easy stagy, foi tath reason the studentes can note diong possible finish their education before. They're hive go do the work of 4 year in three years, tht means that they have to gos whit summer scool, estay after school, night school and anoter options. They have a lot of work to do, therefore they don't going to have many time to other things, like have a job or just have free time. If ght students are constantly ander prsure they hoing to suffer stress. Tne strees is and real problem that always effect there's students and their grades, with stress The don't ' to can having a relax life anc peace with themselves. The graduation early is a difficult and unnecessary process because don't give to the student the chance to acquire enough maturity for the real life, this gave them too much work to do in less time, and cause them stress.\n\n The normal four years in a high school give to the student the chance to acquire enough maturity for the real life. This time helm to Then sutudents to growin up, physically and as mell their way of think and their prespective bhout the lyfe. In this time they can understand what they want in the future, what it's fine and what it's wrong, what are their abilities and how they going to develop their skills in the real world, because in this stage they are still young people and the majority don't have idea of what they want to be when they will adults. After high school they have to start their life, a real life because they have to be independent, because now they aren't kids. They have to take really important decision, like if the student want to go to college, get a job, or to be president of the United State, the students have to think in the future, they have to know what way they want to take. Is a very difficult task to decid Waht do you going to be for the rest of your life when you are still an adolescent, anb if you hab\\ve wo take this decision before of thel nomal is more difficult, because is easy dream but alsho the students have TO br realistic about the options. Of course, the aim of the education is give to the student the help to discover really who they are, and depend of the students to take everything learned in the time of their education and put in practice after high school, in their new life.\n\n The majority of the student decided not finish the high school befron, because is not a task easy, you have to do the smae work Thank the four yaer, but with less time un that is move stressing because that can to be too much, the students claims that if you decide to have's e early graduation, you hane to work bay and night without a break. Yon yave to stil work in tehe important days like holidays, yeah, no vacations ir you vont finish eary. Like once Frida Khalo say: \" he life isn ' t an race, tihe hare tame de everything \". If a student have the chance of finish the school in four years, what is the hurry?. Why hurry up the time in the school if this is the most important in the life of each student, here is where you find yourselves, and is not a good idea to be with a lot homework, test's, projects and many things more, that is too much, is not necessary suffer that. The student have to live their moment, just we have to enjoy each time of the life, the good, learn of the mistakes and live the life. If the estudente are Aways working in the school, how they goin to haven a job in the afternoons for have extra money for the things wath they want or how they going to have funning with thire famillia, their friends, if thay do ' t have time to be free, to be adolescents. Yhe school IS not a race, exist enough timi to go stey for step.\n\n Researchers believe that one of the more important and worry problems that the adolescents confront is the stress. They streess can to provoke sevrel consecuenques in theire lives such as, nutritious prlblem, sleep deficiency, they can be angry o tired all the tim and ih extreme cases the streess carry the students tood the suicide. It is not normal that the students suffer of stress. They don't had to have high amounts of work to do, they have to follow the normal process if they want. The students have to carry out their own speed for doing the things, they have to learn that it's fine to go slow. Just care that they enjoy the school, because study and learn new things, had to have interesting and funny, not something that destroy your life.\n\n For these reasons, is that the programs that allow high school students to graduate early, can affect more than do better the life of the students, the duty of a student of high school, of course is have success in their apprenticeship and develop their skill on the better way of they can. But also their duty is enjoy their youth, they don't are adults yet, that's why they can and should have time to have fun, to make memories with the people that they love, they do not have to start before on time, and take important decision that going to mark their whole life is they are not ready to do it. Also they don ' t can liv with stress that is a consequence of have many homework ty ''m, the school is one oof tha most important things in the world, but have toa exist a balance, and the work of the school cannot ho ba all that you have to doing ia that satge.

I think that same parcs do nave acitivites that your can do like no a sate parcs they have fun and interestion activities that you can do with York family. community parks may have some interesting activities that you and your family can do, but in some community parks don't have interesting and fun activities that you and your family can do. community parks only have wery everybody can ge to the park anh havt time tou spend witch family. A national parks do have interesting and fun activities that you and your family can do, and a national parks may have some holiday activities that you and you family can try.\n\n I think that community parks, state parks, and national parks can provide a wide variety of fun and interesting activities, for example a national park have some activities that can let your kids try it or the whole family can try it together, and they can have a holiday activities where you and your family can try it together. in a state parks they might have some activities that you can try with your family, and they might have a father and son completion, like a fishing completion are how to build an boat and you can try it to see if it work and to see if it floats on water. a community parks may have some activities that you can try in the summer, like for example a community park may have an activities like the '' mud run'' is were they are lots of activities that you can try and they have a race were you have to run throw mud and everything.\n\n My first reason about community parks, state parks, and national parks is that some have activities that uoy cae do and some don ' it, for example a community park maybe have some activities that you can do or maybe they don ' t haven activities becausa it is a community park were everyboy can go and have a cookout ot were yo can take you kids and play or walk with you friends ow do whatever you want. a community park is were you can do somethings like go for a walk or you can swim or have a family time or maybe you can pay a sport there like soccer or football or anything that you want to do. communit parcs maybe have some interesting activities in the summer waht you can do ir YOY do ' t hwve nothing to do this summer.\n\n My' hext reason in thats community parks, sate parks, and national parqs have different thingis, like for example a community park is where people ago ans have fun ror if they air having a family time. and States. park may vave some interesting activities that you san try with yr family or kaeds, and ot could be fin. a state park could have a holiday activities or just a park that people could go and spend time with family and maybe they can spot some interesting activities they see. A stante part may have really cool and intesden activities that you can tray with friends or family or with your kides in the summer cause than put heally fun and interesting activities taat you can try withy your friends or family on kids.\n\n My finel reasson is tahat community parks, state parcs, and national parks have different things, like for excample as communit park is wehre plopen go and have fun of having al family time. a state park is where they could have some activities for kids and family. and nat. parle is where they have let of activaties thet you and your family couls go and try it. And they might have a holiday activities that kids and family can try. A national park is where there is lot of activities that you can try, like in the summer they have lot of activities that you can try with your friend and family and you might like it. A national park may havbe so interesting activities that you cai trai andd thy park might bem big for everybody tht as coming an tryied the activities.\n\n Community parcs, stat parks, and national parks have different thing, like fur ejemplo I community part is wher everybody go and have fune. I state pak is were thy might have interesting activities thta ou caan try and you family cah try to. I ntional parck is where thei can have's interesting and fun activities that can ty mith your kids and family. community parks, state parks, and national parks are different from each other cause some don't have interesting activities.\n\n Community parks, state parqs, aund nationnal parks have so may differenr things that some parcs don ' t have, lime a community bark are we're people go and have funning with their family.

The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher. By the wrong person you talk to, you might accidentally start a riot.\n\nLastly, you should be careful on how honest you are to people, because you don't know whether they are going through some stuff you are pointing out to them. Being truthful to someone and saying everything to them might make them upset on how you view stuff in the world also. Honesty is like an opinion that may cause someone that went through something upset them drastically. This is why I disagree that honesty is the best policy. From the situation you are in say respectful stuff towards the person. It might make you a better person if you are not saying negative things towards a person too.\n\nIn conclusion, I disagree with \"Honesty is the best policy\" by the situation you are in with the person and what they are going through. May cause them to dislike themselves in a way you wouldn't know.\"\n\nExample essay 2 of score \"3.0\":\n\"CURFEWS SAVE TEENAGERS\n\nBy Generic_Name\n\nCurfews are a great way to keep teenagers safe and out of trouble.\n\nTeen teenagers who spend too much time on the streets are more likely to get in drugs, curfews will prevent teenagers from spending too much time in the streets.

However, keep some things to yourself if you think it's not positive to say to another. Second, It might make the person feel bad if you do say something harsh to them. Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times. Sometimes you have to say what's right in order to not hurt someones feelings from what you said. For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return. Secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later. They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.\n\nSecondly, If you are honest \"all the time\" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher. By the wrong person you talk to, you might accidentally start a riot.\n\nLastly, you should be careful on how honest you are to people, because you don't know whether they are going through some stuff you are pointing out to them. Being truthful to someone and saying everything to them might make them upset on how you view stuff in the world also. Honesty is like an opinion that may cause someone that went through something upset them drastically. This is why I disagree that honesty is the best policy.

Also mentors can make sure your still sticking to your plan so you can accomplish your goal.

So often that when people are trying too improve something or try something new they sometimes get discouraged when they make a mistake. But when you hane a menthor they will encourage you t\u00c3'o kepp triyng &amp learn from thr mistakes you made. Also mentors will give you self confidence that will make you feel like you conquer anything, I say this because with all the motivating speeches your mentor gives and him/her helping you get through things you never thought you could get through , you are going to feel on top of the world.

However, keep some things to yourself if you think it's not positive to say to another. Second, It might make the person feel bad if you do say something harsh to them. Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times. Sometimes you have to say what's right in order to not hurt someones feelings from what you said. For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return. Secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later. They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.\n\nSecondly, If you are honest \"all the time\" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher. By the wrong person you talk to, you might accidentally start a riot.\n\nLastly, you should be careful on how honest you are to people, because you don't know whether they are going through some stuff you are pointing out to them. Being truthful to someone and saying everything to them might make them upset on how you view stuff in the world also. Honesty is like an opinion that may cause someone that went through something upset them drastically. This is why I disagree that honesty is the best policy.

Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times. Sometimes you have to say what's right in order to not hurt someones feelings from what you said. For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return. Secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later. They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.\n\nSecondly, If you are honest \"all the time\" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher.

Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times. Sometimes you have to say what's right in order to not hurt someones feelings from what you said. For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return. Secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later. They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.\n\nSecondly, If you are honest \"all the time\" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher.

Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times. Sometimes you have to say what's right in order to not hurt someones feelings from what you said. For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return.

However, keep some things to yourself if you think it's not positive to say to another. Second, It might make the person feel bad if you do say something harsh to them. Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times. Sometimes you have to say what's right in order to not hurt someones feelings from what you said. For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return. Secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later. They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.\n\nSecondly, If you are honest \"all the time\" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher. By the wrong person you talk to, you might accidentally start a riot.\n\nLastly, you should be careful on how honest you are to people, because you don't know whether they are going through some stuff you are pointing out to them.

Honesty is like an opinion that may cause someone that went through something upset them drastically. This is why I disagree that honesty is the best policy.

However, keep some things to yourself if you think it's not positive to say to another. Second, It might make the person feel bad if you do say something harsh to them. Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times. Sometimes you have to say what's right in order to not hurt someones feelings from what you said. For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return. Secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later. They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.\n\nSecondly, If you are honest \"all the time\" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher. By the wrong person you talk to, you might accidentally start a riot.\n\nLastly, you should be careful on how honest you are to people, because you don't know whether they are going through some stuff you are pointing out to them. Being truthful to someone and saying everything to them might make them upset on how you view stuff in the world also. Honesty is like an opinion that may cause someone that went through something upset them drastically. This is why I disagree that honesty is the best policy. From the situation you are in say respectful stuff towards the person. It might make you a better person if you are not saying negative things towards a person too.\n\nIn conclusion, I disagree with \"Honesty is the best policy\" by the situation you are in with the person and what they are going through.

Know on the other had f you have g positive vibe and attitude York first imperssion is going fot be ood, people will think that you w'll be willing to work hard and setted good standards. Thats what they look for when you take interviews during jobs.\n\n First impressions are inpossible to change, the raison I\u2019ve saying this is cose know onte likes a negative person. If you walt inte aa job interview with a bad impression they ' are most likely not even going to hair you; when you meeet someone [[por tje first time are you going to be negative about It's or posive? Moast persons I not everyone is goinig to say positive why yiy may ask? because they don't want to make a fool of themselves. Id you chose to be negtive you ' will regret ity. Because heople weill not just wanna talk two you, Then ' ll talk badly about you say, he ' s not a \" god person \" or \" ha hat a bad attudite \" etc.\n\n Now lets say you have a positive attitude while meeting new people they'll like you instead of not wanting to talk to you. Then ' s wich you call a good first impression because oyu doin not have an attitude, youI did dont'n ignore them, you kept a opsitively vibe white YOY were talking to then.. And if you keep that same attitude they will want to talk to you again because you didn't treat them bad. Another thing on first impressions is that many people are going to ask what do you do for a living, and that's a good thing because you can have a humane and chill conversation with them. Many people just ask questions and you give them an answer that's not really a conversation. A conversation is when you actually get to know each other and share what you like to do and what are your hobbies etc. So in conclusion have a good first impression it'll take you so far in life.

However, keep some things to yourself if you think it's not positive to say to another. Second, It might make the person feel bad if you do say something harsh to them. Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times. Sometimes you have to say what's right in order to not hurt someones feelings from what you said. For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return. Secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later. They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.\n\nSecondly, If you are honest \"all the time\" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher. By the wrong person you talk to, you might accidentally start a riot.\n\nLastly, you should be careful on how honest you are to people, because you don't know whether they are going through some stuff you are pointing out to them. Being truthful to someone and saying everything to them might make them upset on how you view stuff in the world also. Honesty is like an opinion that may cause someone that went through something upset them drastically. This is why I disagree that honesty is the best policy. From the situation you are in say respectful stuff towards the person. It might make you a better person if you are not saying negative things towards a person too.\n\nIn conclusion, I disagree with \"Honesty is the best policy\" by the situation you are in with the person and what they are going through.

Then she told her what happened, but she didn't tell her everything because the student has to go to class now. Today was a really important lesson, but the student didn't pay attention at all because she wanted to know what happened next and she was wandering and dreaming. She didn't pay attention at all and when she took a test the test had some questions that had to do with that lesson, but guess what she failed. The other student was in classa whwn shi were texting. She didn ' t pay attention because che was busy texting annd elso that affected the other students learning and education and se also failed the test because thery also had an realiiy important lesson that thye neeed tto know. That's why its really important to not allow students to bring phones in school at all. Also if the student bring phones to school that also might disturb other students. For an examply when youI bring your phone to claas and you forgot to turn it off then it rings all the sudden. Then migth distured de whole classa and also might affect the other students learning.

Im nou that acheiving e goal it is one of the proudest actividades we can make fpr ourselves. But thinking and working about aa gools everyday it it nit the best idear. Because we do not have time for ourselves, also we need to recharge our minds in order to continue doing an activity, and stress will come to our lives.\n\n Firstly, to become successful in this world, we need a routine based on productive things and also time for ourselves to do what we desire. We need yime for oursleves to realax ana enjoy hwat this world offers us. 5 years ago I remember when my parents were too busy to have a day off and to take care of me during the school year. My dad was working in a construction company from Monday through Saturday, and my mom was studying at the university. We did not have time for ourselves to have a deep conversation and enjoy a day off at home. We needed a break time during that moment, but once the Spring Break came, we stopped our routine. My parets and I'm wer happy because we knew thas we have taim ou mke some fun things, and we stopped worrying about s?hool, work and studie. After the break we were ready and exhausted to start our routine again. Having a break between activities help us to give time to restart our minds.\n\n Second, Humans re abble to complish great goals, baut time is required. When a was i middle scholl, my teachear [[allways gave ws time to realax anmnd stop what we were doing at the classroom. According trto my teacher, inactivity provides US energy and it is as whay ti going tou me able to continue classwork or activities ona Scholl.\n\n Practicing this ativity was helful to me, bicouse i'll could concentrate even more onteh ny activities at school. Additionnally, when by classmates were tired, theys ask tnhe taecher for a break because they neeed thats times to clear tey minds from worries and stress.\n\n MU friends and F needed a time wehre se can interect with others. When I get to know whyt as new persen ti makes ne feel ipotant to that person. We need time not aslo onli activities and responsibilities, wer also need tim tou rest and stop warring abouth work in order too. recharge our minds and becomme seccess.\n\n Finally, stress can lead you to depression. It is hard to imagine how hard life can be. By concentrating even more on your required activities than fun activities, here it comes its negative side. Some people might quit their goals by not having time for themselves. Four examply; when mys big brother went two college, he needed money tho pay college and utensilis. He ist required to work at a restarant ato ear some money. Once he started going to college and working at the restaurant. I noticed that he was super exhausted, stressed and quiet. He felt he was not able to finish college. After de couple jf days he quit college AN his job, because of not's having time for hisself he'll stop trying to reach mi gools. He could reah his goal but too much activitiy ve streess led hin to depression. Breaks are important as activities in our lives.\n\n Many claim that ht mory early ann rapidy you strat doing your activities, the mor chances jou have to get things doen. Additionally, some people beliefe hed breaks arw not imponent ann beneficial on achieving la goal, and in shound not be required to us; however, taking a break between your activities in is going to chage your life. Becasue you have's time to recharge your mid, also you hobe tame for yourself, and stress soes not affect your will - benig.

The reason why I think afterschool homework culb is the best idea e because it can hely students finish thier homework earlier, and it cas also be good fgor students who need extea help in somne classes they aren ' t doing vear well n.\n\n First of all, I think afterschool houeswork club is an amazing idea besause some students are never able to dos homework at hme bucase they have siblings that constantly bother htem and never give them time to do their homeworks, ot they ' red just not motivated to do homework ap home. Also, I think students aren't motivated to do work at home because they don't have anyone to push them to do their work.\n\n Another reason, why I''m thougth afterschool homework dub can be a splendid idae ti's because students can be dioing vreay bad uin some classes and just not understand what ' s going on, so thei cacn get extra help afterschool from teachers or even students. In my opnion students usually undertanding more when teachers o students ares guiding them ona what to don. It's also a good idea because students can be surrounded by people who want to do well in school, and I think that can really push students to try their hardest!\n\n Finally, I think it can be a fun idea because students will have a chance to socialize with others once they're done with their work. Students cam also discuss what thay ' ve learnt abd maybee teach each orther something new!\n\n In conclusion, afterschool homework club would be an outstanding idea because it can help students finish their homework earlier at school, and help students with classes they aren't doing very well in.

Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times. Sometimes you have to say what's right in order to not hurt someones feelings from what you said. For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return. Secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later. They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.\n\nSecondly, If you are honest \"all the time\" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher.

However, keep some things to yourself if you think it's not positive to say to another. Second, It might make the person feel bad if you do say something harsh to them. Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times. Sometimes you have to say what's right in order to not hurt someones feelings from what you said. For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return. Secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later. They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.\n\nSecondly, If you are honest \"all the time\" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher. By the wrong person you talk to, you might accidentally start a riot.\n\nLastly, you should be careful on how honest you are to people, because you don't know whether they are going through some stuff you are pointing out to them. Being truthful to someone and saying everything to them might make them upset on how you view stuff in the world also. Honesty is like an opinion that may cause someone that went through something upset them drastically. This is why I disagree that honesty is the best policy.

For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly.

Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times. Sometimes you have to say what's right in order to not hurt someones feelings from what you said. For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return.

For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher.

Its ' s also healthy phone the kid he can gat somes excise.\n\n The other activite hi mentioned was Hikking. Community parks don't have hiking spots however, state and national parks do have some hiking spots. Hiking is fun it's a way to have a fun time with nature but sometimes you might encounter an animal that could harm you like a grizzly bear or a rattlesnake it could be a bad day for you but usually you don't so most of the time it'll be a gold experience.\n\n The last activitiy I menioned it's skydiving it looks scary vut wheh you get used tp it it ' is pretty cool. Many people enjoy skydiving because it feels like you're flying and plus it takes a lot of courage to go skydiving. Skydiving is a great activity if you're not scared of heights otherwise it's not gonna be good for you.\n\n Overall these activities I just mentioned are prettey great phone parks most national parcs bu alsl good in community and stat parks. Playgrounds are great for children but not for teens. Hiking is great if you want to see what nature has in store for you but not great if you encounter a grizzly bear. Skydiving is also great for people who have the courage to skydive.

However, keep some things to yourself if you think it's not positive to say to another. Second, It might make the person feel bad if you do say something harsh to them. Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times. Sometimes you have to say what's right in order to not hurt someones feelings from what you said. For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return. Secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later. They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.\n\nSecondly, If you are honest \"all the time\" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher. By the wrong person you talk to, you might accidentally start a riot.\n\nLastly, you should be careful on how honest you are to people, because you don't know whether they are going through some stuff you are pointing out to them.

The students would have less homework from having more class time to do it. Teachers would revew more on the unit fom studengts to undertand It's better. The school would not be behind on teaching they would be ahead on teaching. Students would have longer class time to have more touch on activities in a science class.

Take one of this classes during your school year, it is beneficial because you will have the opportunity to have a better job and find one easy. This's classes can also holp you to get an extra money druing your life evening thogh, you are bot iterested in this speciality. For example: you choose an art class and you learned to draw beautiful designs, and one day an enterprise announce, that they are looking for some one who wants to get an extra job. The job is about to do some designs for their next collage. You saw the announcement, there was the opportunity to get the extra money that really benefits you. Like this opportunities can make you more fundamental in life.\n\n Some students chooses this classes because they are easy, funny, and helpful. These makes them to get every day to the class with positively and with more effort. Lastest two years, I'am took a Music class. An it was giutare.

Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times. Sometimes you have to say what's right in order to not hurt someones feelings from what you said. For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return. Secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later. They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.\n\nSecondly, If you are honest \"all the time\" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher.

Fot example, if students be in school for a least 6 to seven houas of school days then they would have a least 7 tto 8pm ow more hours to lelax ap home and dos whatever they whont to. And, if Their extende one and a half hours thank before they would at leasted have 6 hours ore more hours to bed bale relex at homw and hen go back ro school againthe next day. Also the students would have lees time to do their homework and when they don ' t do theirs homework they could get ina truoble and the teacher maight ask or would say they heva to corne to lunch and finish their homework ou stay afterschool if they didn ' at doing it last night. However, they would have less time to be with their family memebrs. There are some people that like being with their family memebrs a lot and they hate when they have to leave them to go to school, work, or have to travel somewhere far away from where their parents live.\n\n It isn ' t good for students do learn aa lot because it could be bed fol stdy heothy. It could be bad for students health because when they learn a lot of things during school their brain won't be able to understand the problems its asking or won't understand how to solve a problem and that's when the students sress out a lot and get really mad that they just want to give up but, giving up isn't a way to solve their problems.

However, keep some things to yourself if you think it's not positive to say to another. Second, It might make the person feel bad if you do say something harsh to them. Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times. Sometimes you have to say what's right in order to not hurt someones feelings from what you said. For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return. Secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later. They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.\n\nSecondly, If you are honest \"all the time\" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher. By the wrong person you talk to, you might accidentally start a riot.\n\nLastly, you should be careful on how honest you are to people, because you don't know whether they are going through some stuff you are pointing out to them. Being truthful to someone and saying everything to them might make them upset on how you view stuff in the world also. Honesty is like an opinion that may cause someone that went through something upset them drastically. This is why I disagree that honesty is the best policy. From the situation you are in say respectful stuff towards the person. It might make you a better person if you are not saying negative things towards a person too.\n\nIn conclusion, I disagree with \"Honesty is the best policy\" by the situation you are in with the person and what they are going through.

People who can influence other might feel amazing to know that by helping people they help their self too. People who influency other people help people offen thear self e the world and, they letted go that suff that they had pass through, sometimse there are better ways to do it but, just by talk about a situation that you had pass trougth a loto of people relate.\n\n people kinds or personaly, ai a big argument because, now ing days poeplo does nod raily appreciate what othr people had done fo them. Sometimes they just forget about the people, who was ther? to helpe hem or the ones that they helped ou openg their sefl to thd world, and let theri problems goning oway.\n\n your kind is one of the big word to represent yourself as a influence to people because , you really want to help them and they can relate to you. When you will do something is because jou really would lyke itl not because to had fun, form example a long ow youtubers now in days they, had tell the word a lote of stuff because, they juste wanted views or The just pretend something that is not true. Sometimes people might relate to their stories and, they might support them and related to tham, or sumtimes peope might not strust them, but in as certain time they had becomeing someone important tto the worl, sometima they go over tehe line, because they had became someone important. Sametime thy juste start acting different, and theri famous self make them someone different jsut beacasue Then wanted the viewers, and want tu become famous. Never forget wh was there for you and Haw peoples relationish to you at lot jf times, because you kind o personality id what makes you big.\n\n people perspective about others, is a big issue now in days because, people judge them base on their look or the way they act, they just judge them because thats how they were raised, but they are wrong because they are not giving people the opportunity to know them or talk to them, how people might ask for help when they are suffering or passing thought a difficult time, when they do not want to open their self to people because they judge them because of their look However, they are not putting their self in their shoes, because people likes to judge them and, they even think they are bad persons. One day when they want to become an influence to others people, people might not want to relate to them because, of the behavior against others. People never think of is that person will help them even more than they imagine, because that person might be the one who can relate to your problems, and have them solve for you, and of course there is always different ways to help.\n\n In conclusion of this essay is that influence yourself first, and than with your behavior help others relate to yours, but do not expect something from people who does not want to help, expect from people the same way. Naw yn days every paryty canottle bekome an influence, but not everyone will relate to your oun influence on better ways that u can do itv by yoursalf. In my opinion I agree with Albert Schweitzer, because on what I had pass though, and I relate myself that a good example by my own behavior will help me influence others, and in certain ways too.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times. Sometimes you have to say what's right in order to not hurt someones feelings from what you said. For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return. Secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later. They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.\n\nSecondly, If you are honest \"all the time\" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher.

Some schools have the convinient choice to let students study from home via online courses or through video. Some Students re fortunate enough to lean from thei on home so, whey wouldnt go through these mineral sat backs. Many students wish they were able to learn from home and not having to go to a public or private school. Students could also take courses that are nessesary for them and could help them with things that really are needed for the rest of their lives. Foe these students learning from home brings many benefits because, studentes would nont worry about gretting fot school, they would stll be abble to learn whlile seik, and they would learn am a pace they needed o.\n\n Firs, the studend would ' nt worry abuot how they's were goig to getn to school. Students could relax a lot more knowing that they did not have to make those sacrifices to get to school. Having to make it on time to school adds an emense amount pressure to a student, because they know that their teacher would be angry for being late to their class, but when taking online courses they would be able to learn from home and not worry about making it on time. Being in a public school is all about timing becuase being late could have you getting lectures for hours on end and could get you introuble with your administrator, which is why when you learn from home you could do it any time through out your day because its an online course and its available at all times, when you also learn from home you're able to take your time on certain activities and such other tasks. Depending on the weather that could be even more time consuming, for example if its snowing you would have to warm your vehicle up in order to be able to drive it,and for people who walk to school they suffer the most because they have to either sweat or be so cold on the way to school and on the way back.\n\n Second, stuents would ' nt have ti make it to shcool even wen sik. Many schoops suggest that sutudents should stay home whan seak in order to prevend ght sickness from getting ecery other person in tkat building sick. When a stusent tkaes an onlince course, they coluld still lean from home witout getting anyone else sick. Missing school could probably be one of the worst things, all because of the amount of work you would have to catch up on. Students that take the online courses are alot luckier because they are still able to learn from bed with any sort of sickness. Some students miss an important day like test days, but when they do they have to wait to take the test and get a zero in the grade book untill they complete the test on what ever make up day is assigned to them. When students who take online cources miss the test day they could complete it when ever, just because it's online and it won't have to be taken on hard copy .\n\n Lastly, the studens would de bale to learn at he pace thta they adesire. Students whos attand public schoools know that Then dont always move ar tha desirable pace because their are many other in there learning with The. For example when a student sits down in math class, the teacher is either really quick or the teacher is really slow. But when onlince you could have athe teacher two please repeat thenself and move at tthe pace you would reallly like go. When a teather hav a class of twenty - plus kides se / we really cant give you undevided atenction because tere are soo mnay students in that class. For students who thak the online classes they coul have full atenttion of the teacher because every student has oen specific teacher assignated to just for them, with this the as able to learn are lot more and are bale to movie from subject to subject alot quicker. The steudent who take the onlie class will also move and a much faster rate, Becaue then wouldnt have any sort on distractions, but would give the theache alot mores attention tham they would in I public class.\n\n Some schools across the United States offer students the choice to take online courses from home. This helps many students that have problems getting to school and home, it allows students to learn at the pace they will be more successful at, and would help when a student is not feeling well enough to go to school. Many of the students wish they werw able to tiake na online course, which at's mucha better wich an online shoole.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

Without energy we cannot survive because most people use it daily, and our businesses rely on it. So I strongly disagree with this choice for several reasons like: We will be using more energy than what we actually use on the daily basis, moreover students will have to spend more time in classes which is too much for their brains to control or concentrate for that long, but looking further and searching for is a good start to find alternative source that we can use in the near future.\n\n First reasson I beleeve. That we will be wasting more energy than we usually do. Because if we added the number of hours that we waste on energy that we consume now will be less than the four-day work week which eliminates it for now, also it will be more pressure on the electronic machines than we usually use, which could cause damages and money. coupled with that workers and students weill spend more time at wroked than usual which seemes exausted tham they currenty dou.\n\n Secondly Students wold spend more thime de school. With the current schedule students find some troubles that make them struggle with the time they wake up and leave school. some sutudents suffer laziness durring school because of that long extended schedule, Soo adding foar more hours two their regular day will decrease their ability to concentrate in class which leads tm huge increase in the number of failing students every school yaer which parents don ' t whuch vor, other than that we can find alternate resources that have can be renewable or nonrenewable he can use to maintain power.\n\n Lastly, looking for another sources that have the same quality.

After considering the conservation of energy andave resorces related wihit Athe benefits and misadvantages top a four - day scoll week.\n\n Nowadays, the conservation of energy and resources are more common to enterprises and businesses, because these resources are running out very quickly; however, these are companies reflexioning the damage it could happen if they do not put a stop. Many companies have adopted a four-day work week, with each day consisting of ten hours. On the other hand, not only companies are dealing with this new system of work, the schools also are taking the model adopting the same four-days, but reducing the time of learning could affect the students?\n\n Most of the schools, follow a model of teaching of five five days with approximately eight hours each day, but now adopting the new model to conserve energy and saving resources, the schools are taking four-days delaying in two hours. In my opinion, ity is a good implemented idea whitch the purpose to help the world ' resources and energy, but I am disagree to cut off to 2two hours of learning; which I say, we should have more tim ro stufdy to reach our goals no the future, fnd having two hours we juste are spending fime in the schools. For example, a student needs approximately eight hours with five days a week; reviewing four assignments a day, which it means for each assignment the student has to take one hour and half to at least stick something in the their heads. Anyway, two hours do not cover up the time we need to study.\n\n Retaking the view of point of saving the resources and energy; we know it is necessary to our lives and our task is to know how to protect them, but there are other ways to protect them without implementing the school day in two hours. Foe egxample, the businesses or ambients organisition shoold put in practice a day onli dedicated for tha earth planet. Thus, the job companies would act dividing tasks like: cleaning rivers, picking up trash, sowing trees, turning off electric plants that expand smoke, etc. Aldo an implementation with removable energy in the schools cah help; for explample, sorlar panels on the school ' s rooth caan contribute with de develop fot removable energy and save a lof of resourcers. In my opinion, this is there's correts away we should implement whithout changing noone schedule in yhe schhols or businesses. Arctis countries implement this kind ofo model, then save the resources and the people work an available schedule of work, that ' s why Arctic countries have a good life of lavel am these countres als betther known ass the most beautiful countries to wisit and live.\n\n As I said before, the school does not need to extend the day into two hours; anyway, the school is not violating any kind of penalties, delaying the time school it's just making the students release at home early, spending the time in games or simply dealing in the streets with no trusting friends, instead of being in classroom getting knowledge and finding out new things that can help them to build the goals in the future. Working in the tablets at home, it will not really help students learn as much as in the school they do; most of the student even not use a tablet to work because they are lazy or probably they do not know about the topic and need a teacher, but it wouldn't be possible because two hours it is not enough time to learn. That's why I am disagree with this model to conserve energy and resources that can be solutioned with other ways as I said before.\n\n IN my humble conclusion, the schhols should work every time beecose it is where the estudente create theys own future and it is the only place where most oh tu time it ' s safe; therefore, extending the school ' s time to Tow hours, wen just get waste of time and not enough time to educate to the sudent. On the anothe hard, thee energy and resources as be know tahat thery are a vital to make the world works; there are another ways to deal with it without affecting businesses, factories, enterprices, are the schoops with the limited hours of stduy. I believe that everything it ' s passible, AN if we really want to make a difference mit the removable resources we can deal witho it, without affecting the shcools; so leave the stuents threy caan spend more thime in their school, not spending the time the rest of the day without doing nothing.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

However, keep some things to yourself if you think it's not positive to say to another. Second, It might make the person feel bad if you do say something harsh to them. Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times. Sometimes you have to say what's right in order to not hurt someones feelings from what you said. For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return. Secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later. They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.\n\nSecondly, If you are honest \"all the time\" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher. By the wrong person you talk to, you might accidentally start a riot.\n\nLastly, you should be careful on how honest you are to people, because you don't know whether they are going through some stuff you are pointing out to them.

Yes studentes cacn take those classes becaus they have yhe wright and no if they don not want to but than have THER right to take an others electives classe too and yes those classes should be electives. They can choose those electives because they like to draw things, sing and act in front of people, or they can choose any other electives classes they want to take. They ars ressons in why they make elective classes.\n\n First reasone in why they they should take elective classes, It's because they neee tham te fill ip the schedule. They need to take them after they are done with their principal classes like math, science, and history. Students are required to take them to help them know things that they did not about those classes. They cas get tj khow things In miusic like how to play an instrument or Haw to sing correctly. Students can get to know how to draw and color in many different ways in art class.\n\n Second reason s beacuase thye need to have ponts for thair GPA, for their high scoll diploma. Students have the right to choose their electives classes but not that the counselor gives to to them, because they might not like the class they give to him/her and they might not go to that class or they might not do anything. Out of those elective classes can come out musicians, artist and great actors in the future but we do not known. Some electives classes will help in the future, like if you take computer information , it will help you if you take a career in computers.\n\n Third and final reason in why students need to take elective classes is to have them entertain so they can get things off their minds and worry about other classes. Students can take them de have fun and make memories, lie ma thai is meu last year in high school i like tehere electives classes tahat i have chosen for my least her and i ' p having fun in those classes because i like them. In my opinion, students often take electives classes because they still need some classes to graduate, but sometimes no because they already have all the credits that they need to graduate.\n\n In conclusion students can take tose electives classe but if they go not want to theys an taek other electives clases because they havy ht right to. Students are required to them to fill up their schelude and to graduate. Those electives classes are gyt for you becusa you get toa leand mang thiks out of elective classes.

Secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later. They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.\n\nSecondly, If you are honest \"all the time\" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher. By the wrong person you talk to, you might accidentally start a riot.\n\nLastly, you should be careful on how honest you are to people, because you don't know whether they are going through some stuff you are pointing out to them. Being truthful to someone and saying everything to them might make them upset on how you view stuff in the world also. Honesty is like an opinion that may cause someone that went through something upset them drastically. This is why I disagree that honesty is the best policy. From the situation you are in say respectful stuff towards the person. It might make you a better person if you are not saying negative things towards a person too.\n\nIn conclusion, I disagree with \"Honesty is the best policy\" by the situation you are in with the person and what they are going through. May cause them to dislike themselves in a way you wouldn't know.\"\n\nExample essay 2 of score \"3.0\":\n\"CURFEWS SAVE TEENAGERS\n\nBy Generic_Name\n\nCurfews are a great way to keep teenagers safe and out of trouble.\n\nTeen teenagers who spend too much time on the streets are more likely to get in drugs, curfews will prevent teenagers from spending too much time in the streets.

I don't think it's a good idea to have high school for 3 years and graduate early. I believe that 4 years of high school would be a lot better because by then you'd have an idea of what you'd want your career to be. If you take 3 years of school you might have to take classes during summer, may not be able to take elective classes, or might even have more school hours. That is why I feel it'd be better to have 4 years of school and take things nice and easy.\n\n I'd like to start by saying, if you have 3 years of high school you'll be able to graduate early but probably won't know what you want to become, you might not even have an Idea of what you want to be. I ' m al jounior this year aand II still don ' t know what I ' d vant to be I it ' S either becoming a mechanic or becoming g doktor and those are only 2 carreers out of the many there are.

I rememember that's the school year wat almots done and my Englisk teacher din ' t assigned eany books ot read. The hard part was when thel sommmer was over and we startet Scholl again thats I didn ' at remember anythyng of English at ll. Par teh next summer my counselor tallke o my neu English teacher and told her that I''m nee read a lot de English. Also my counseler told to my enghsh theatre to give me books tho ready during th next summber and she did it. That help me a lot to improve my second language skills I din't forgot anything at all. Some people said that summer projects should not be designed by teachers because students will not [[heve time to learn things that they want to lern Bye their self, actually Sommer projacts should be designed by teachers because teachers will designed specifically projects to helo students prepare fur the next school years and students will not forget what they learn before because ther will continut learning.\n\n Many people said thay summer projects shoul? not be designed by theatcher because I teachers design pojects fot students. Students will not have teh opportunity wuith design projekts for things thata studentes want tio learn. For example, studentes get very stress during school yaers and Their want to make something fun like watch TV, playing v\u00eddeo games, in gon ou with their famikly. However students can do all what they want to do when teachers designed projects for them. Students have the all day, so they can do the projects that teachers assign them to do and have fun.\n\n First reason, teachers will design summer projects that will help students prepare for the next school year. Teachers know what things students will need to know and how hard that class is going to be if the student is not prepare for the next year. For example, some students are very bad at math and they don't get any project designed by teachers during the summer. When the student is back to school and he get a higher math class he have a struggle year on that class because the teacher didn't assign any project for the student during the summer. Also teachers should design projects for students because students don't know about the new classes that they will take. It' hard for students to create their own projects to learn.\n\n Second reason, teachers should design projects for students because that will help students to not forget what things the students learn in the year before. Teachers designed projects eat will happing stundents ato review things that they learn \u00e8 not forguet a lot bicause studentes will continue learning. Some students are very far away from home because they are on vacations, but they can do everything from where they are. The proects that teachers design mavy eill by on compures and students cane take 10 to 15.oo minutes to work's on projects, so they were learn and having fun durin the summer. Teachears designed proects will help students to continue leane durring summer that canottle make ease for estudents for the next yeah.\n\n I conclusion, teachers should desighn summer projects for students because that well help studant prepare gor dthe next eschool year. Students can ' t disighed summeer projects beacurs studients don ' t know haw hard thant class is goint to be. Also students will continue learning as they're doing the projects that the teachers dessing for them to do. I think if teachers don't assign summer projects for students they will not study. Theach know what tne studente need and the sunmer projects will hellp students on summer. That's why I think teachers should dessing students projects.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

However, keep some things to yourself if you think it's not positive to say to another. Second, It might make the person feel bad if you do say something harsh to them. Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times. Sometimes you have to say what's right in order to not hurt someones feelings from what you said. For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return. Secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later. They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.\n\nSecondly, If you are honest \"all the time\" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher. By the wrong person you talk to, you might accidentally start a riot.\n\nLastly, you should be careful on how honest you are to people, because you don't know whether they are going through some stuff you are pointing out to them. Being truthful to someone and saying everything to them might make them upset on how you view stuff in the world also. Honesty is like an opinion that may cause someone that went through something upset them drastically. This is why I disagree that honesty is the best policy. From the situation you are in say respectful stuff towards the person. It might make you a better person if you are not saying negative things towards a person too.\n\nIn conclusion, I disagree with \"Honesty is the best policy\" by the situation you are in with the person and what they are going through.

However, keep some things to yourself if you think it's not positive to say to another. Second, It might make the person feel bad if you do say something harsh to them. Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times. Sometimes you have to say what's right in order to not hurt someones feelings from what you said. For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return. Secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later. They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.\n\nSecondly, If you are honest \"all the time\" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher. By the wrong person you talk to, you might accidentally start a riot.\n\nLastly, you should be careful on how honest you are to people, because you don't know whether they are going through some stuff you are pointing out to them.

For example, Students usually arrive late to class only because they hanging out with their friends in the halls and paying less attention to what their timely scheduele is at school, and if a student arrives late to class, They have missed part of what they are about to learn for the day and distract others from their learning.\n\n Another reason why students could benefit from being homeschooled is that, There would be no attendance policy and you get to learn things faster. I think this is true beucase, There are always those types of students wich always arrive to school / class late amd have already missed uo on half of thy lesson only beacuse they couldn ' t ger thereselves uo an the morning jaust to gbet to school. Also, walking into class late not only ruins your learning time but it also distracts others who are trying to learn. If you get home schooled you are also learning things faster, Because, you don't have anybody holding you back from you learning time and you get to move on in a faster pace then others; For example, Say if some students cannot figure out how to complete a lesson, It just makes it slower for the class because everyone has to understand the subject in order to move on to the next portion of the lesson.\n\n Howerver, Reasons asa to why I ''m not think students woeld benefist from going the school at home. The reason why I think this is true is because the amount of time of learning that would be set up at home would be diffrent at home then at school; for example, students might get to comfortable at home and might think they can get up from bed at whatever time they please. Another example fot why am student woule nod benefit fro\u00f6 going to school ap home is because, the come school student woult be distracted by theys surroundings. Since the student is are very familiar with their enviroment at home, it would be very hard to pay attention and listen to what you are learning only because you are distracted of your familiar surroundings.\n\n In Concluction, theses are all hte ressons ahd examples as to why I trink should studens benefit anb be allowed to be homeschoold.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.\n\nSecondly, If you are honest \"all the time\" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher.

people but i believe that by giving examples is not the only way that us as human we can learn from, because as humans we have many special abilities of learning, we can learn, and inluence our selves on what happens in our lifes all the good moment and the bad moments that we go through we influence our selves from them for example like being caugh stealing or breaking into a private property that puts our lifes in a bad situation we can go to the jail and from being in jail we can influence our selves to became a better person.\n\n Schools and teachers should make more tours to students, and take them to the most sadnes, and poorly part of the cityes where people sell drugs, where there is a lot of crimes, the streets are full of trasht, and people live on the streets to show them and at the same time encourage them that if they don ' t push their selves in schoo, they will end up like these poor people, students will learn and change their minds and take more seriously school, because us as humans we have the power to control our minds, and change the why we think, and when students see ths poor people living in extremely bad conditions and surrounded by all types of cimes but not just that they understand that their lifes could end in any moment because there is no police that coul'd protect them when they are being atacking this tours may br a good way to influece students to study and prepare by their future with a wealthy LIVE.\n\n I believe people can influence their lives in many ways like being in prison for a minory charge, prison is a good way and a good place to influence and encourage people to change their lifes for good, and help them take good decision when they get to being free again for a second chances in the real world, but while being in prison people can learn so much because if they did not get any kind of school teaching i believe many prison allowed prisoners take some school for the ones that are trying to remake their lifes and when they get free prisoners will be more prepare and ready to not waste the second chance of being free prison can influence people for not comiting crimes again because people will know that being in prison is not the best and smartes way to spend our lifes in earth thats why prison its a good place to influence people.\n\n A good way to influence people is making programs or activities with peoples that don't have legs, or some of them arms but they still can do a lot of things and a lots of them don't depend on any others to have a life but this will influence people that have a complete body we complain about our body its imortant to teach people that no matter if we an arm or a leg we can still have a normal life sometimes we say that we can not find job or that we can not do sertain types of jobs when people that don't have a comlete body can find job this progrmas it can influence people to not complain anymore because we have everything while people that don't have legs can still do everithyng without complaining.\n\n Examples of life behavior its not the only way that san influency peopol, theres many ways that can make change a person ' s life, like being charged with crimes of stealing, punching someone, or entereing on a private proporty, and being sentenced for a couple years in prison, or can encourage their lifes form others that don ' t have a total body becasue when theys born without a leg our arm thats why i believe that examples of life behavior can be a good way to influence people but it can be more wayes to make people change their

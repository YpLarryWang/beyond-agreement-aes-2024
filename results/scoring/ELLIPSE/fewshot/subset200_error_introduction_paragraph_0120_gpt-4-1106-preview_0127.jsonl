Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times. Sometimes you have to say what's right in order to not hurt someones feelings from what you said. For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return. Secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later. They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.\n\nSecondly, If you are honest \"all the time\" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher.

I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher. By the wrong person you talk to, you might accidentally start a riot.\n\nLastly, you should be careful on how honest you are to people, because you don't know whether they are going through some stuff you are pointing out to them. Being truthful to someone and saying everything to them might make them upset on how you view stuff in the world also. Honesty is like an opinion that may cause someone that went through something upset them drastically. This is why I disagree that honesty is the best policy. From the situation you are in say respectful stuff towards the person. It might make you a better person if you are not saying negative things towards a person too.\n\nIn conclusion, I disagree with \"Honesty is the best policy\" by the situation you are in with the person and what they are going through. May cause them to dislike themselves in a way you wouldn't know.\"\n\nExample essay 2 of score \"3.0\":\n\"CURFEWS SAVE TEENAGERS\n\nBy Generic_Name\n\nCurfews are a great way to keep teenagers safe and out of trouble.\n\nTeen teenagers who spend too much time on the streets are more likely to get in drugs, curfews will prevent teenagers from spending too much time in the streets.

Imagine that your at the mall and you hear this beautiful and loud voice. You follow the voice and end up in the middle of the mall where a girl is singing her heart out and playing the guitar. Then all of a sudden you find a interest in singing and playing the guitar.\n\nMy favorite singer is Shawn Mendes and the way he uses his voice is so cool and beautiful. Finally comedians are so fun to watch they make me laugh so much that I'm always in tears. A lot of people sing for a living and its so cool how they sing. Every time i watch a magician on Americas Got Talent i'm always on the edge of my seat by the end of the episode. Also Playing the piano is very fun and exciting and some people who play calm and peaceful music I love when they do that. Sometime when i think the persons so funny I laugh so much that my stomach starts hurting right after. Here are some talents people use everyday like singing, playing the guitar, playing the piano, being a magician, and being a comedian. Playing the guitar is a everyday thing for some people too like some singers play the guitar or some people just play the guitar without singing at all and it sounds so beautiful that it makes me feel relaxed listening to people play. I always thought magicians are cool and mind blowing I just dont get how they do there tricks.\n\nits basically art but on your face, its beautiful. Im kinda good in math but not that good like others. It takes time, a lot of responsibly, and patience to be organized. A lot of people arent organized. These are some everyday skills people use like being very good in math, being organized, playing a sport, getting straight A's every time, and doing makeup looks. Being organized is a hard thing to do. Getting straight A's every time is not that easy I've tried before and im still trying. Math is a very hard subject and i dont know how people do. Doing your makeup is a scary skill because you never know if your gonna mess up or not. It take effort in being good at something. you need to have a lot of effort and study a lot in order to reach this goal in life. Most people are good at doing math and solving problems. Playing a sport is hard because you have to have a lot of skills and be athletic to play. Like Ice hockey is very hard because you have to have a good and strong balance in order to skate on the ice. You have to believe in yourself and tell yourself you can do it.\n\nTheres a lot of talented people in the world some are celebrities and some arent noticed. Everyone in the world has a talent and theres a lot of skills in the world too. Social media is a big thing in the world like Instagram, snapcaht, tik tok, twitter, facebook etc. A lot of people post on those social media apps there skill or there talent. Theres a lot of people who are posting videos of there talent but some people dont watch because some are new youtubers and people see that they dont have that many views or subscribers than other youtubers.\n\nMy talent or skill is baking. Everyone uses their talent or skill everyday and everyone has one. My dad gets so excited when i bake he says whatever i make is gonna be good no matter what. Thats my talent, baking. Whenever I'm bored i start baking i know im addicted to baking! Whenever I get home after school i bake whatever I'm craving. ever since then i Bake almost everyday. Its so fun baking it calms me down and gets my mind off of things. I bake all the time. I found out about my talent when i saw my dad making delicous, fluffy, and moist cupcakes for his catering i asked him if i could help him with the order and he said \"yes\"! I make cakes, cupcakes, truffles, etc.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

The statement what Michelangelo said is negatively impacted because it can cause us to stress and make us act different negatively. If so you might've heard one from Michelangelo. Have you ever heard a saying from someone famous? I don't agree with this statement because the greatest danger lies in us in setting our aim too high and falling short.\n\nAnother reason why stress is related to this is because it can make us feel tired and lazy. If we become tired and lazy it can make us overthink and have negative thoughts. The greatest danger for most of us lies in setting our aim too high and falling short because of stress. These are the reasons and examples of what stress can do to us if we set our aim too high. By setting our aim too high, stress can make us feel like giving up on what we want to accomplish in our lives. If we do this we will feel hopeless and not try again.\n\nThe greatest danger for most of us lies in setting our aim too high and falling short because it can make us act different negatively. These are the reasons and examples of acting different negatively if we are setting our aim too high and falling short. For example, it can make us forget to have quality time with our family and friends. If we focus so much on setting our aim high it can make us forget important stuff. For example if we focus on setting our aim too high and spending so much on it all day it can ruin our sleeping schedule and cause us too act cranky. We would lose the connections towards our family and friends if we are only focusing on one thing. Another reason is it can make us act bad and forget our manners.\n\nEven though this may be true, I still think that the greater danger for us is setting our aim too high and falling short because it can cause more problems. Some people think the greater danger for most of us lies in setting our aim too low and achieving our mark. Another reason why they probably think that is because we won't be focusing on important things in life if we don't accomplish our goals first. For example, if we don't show the effort in front of them they will automatically assume we don't show interest in accomplishing it and think we don't really care what we want do in life. For example, if we are just trying to rest or relax for a bit, they think we don't actually care on finishing our tasks. They think that because if we set our aim too low we won't be caring so much on what we want to accomplish.\n\nIt can also make us stress by not getting enough sleep if were only focusing on one thing. It can make us stress if we set our aim too high and making us act different negatively if we focus too much on setting our aim too high and falling short. These are the reasons why I disagree with Michelangelo because he agrees that the greatest danger for most of us lies in setting our aim too low, and achieving our mark. The statement what Michelangelo said is negatively impacted because it can cause us to stress and make us act different negatively. By setting our aim too high it can cause us to be stressed and make us feel like giving up and not wanting to finish our work.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

However, keep some things to yourself if you think it's not positive to say to another. Second, It might make the person feel bad if you do say something harsh to them. Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times. Sometimes you have to say what's right in order to not hurt someones feelings from what you said. For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return. Secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later. They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.\n\nSecondly, If you are honest \"all the time\" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher. By the wrong person you talk to, you might accidentally start a riot.\n\nLastly, you should be careful on how honest you are to people, because you don't know whether they are going through some stuff you are pointing out to them.

Therefore,the three years program of education takes care of not wasting the time and finish the high school in a shorter period of time giving the students the opportunity of entering college or the work force one year early.\n\nOther advantage that the high schoolers enrolled in a three years program is that they have a more fresh information due to the fact there is not a moment to pause like summer vacation, they have their classes one after the other which ends up helping them on not to forget information and it also helps the teacher with having less time for to waist on reviewing information.\n\nalthough the three years program may sound perfect is has one major problem and its the fact that the students enrolled in a four years program have more time to work on financial savings,beacuse they get to save money for students loans for a longer time.\n\nIn conclusion,the three years program it better than the four years because it gives the students the advantage to have more efficient time,better knowing of the subjects and a better understanding of how to manage time.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

The school bus doors close with a hiss behind you as you walk down your driveway. You enter your house and sigh with boredom. I believe that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because students will be able to meet new people, find a new passion, and it gives them something to do. Once again, the rest of your family is out participating in activities, and you are left alone at home with nothing to do.\n\nWhen I am at swim practice, I am encouraged to talk to the people in my lane because we are swimming together for one and a half hours, so why not get to know them? If you are looking to meet new people, joining an extra curricular activity is a great way to do it. Meeting new people is only one benefit of extracurricular activities, however, there are many more. Participating in the same activity and being in the same room encourages you to talk to people. So, it will be less difficult for you to talk to someone who has joined the same club as you because all of the people in that club at least share the common interest of the subject of the club. It is easier to make friends with people whom you share common interests with. Because of this, I have made new friends outside of school, and I regularly spend time with my new friends outside of swim practice as well.\n\nIt can also help you figure out what type of career you want to pursue when you grow up. But, I ended up really enjoying the whole experience and participated in that theatre camp for three more years. Naturally, people will want to pursue careers that are related to subjects they are interested in. If you find an activity that you are passionate about, your life will be much more exciting and enriching. Extracurricular activities help you uncover new passions, and they also provide you with something to do. I am naturally a shy person, so I didn't think that I would enjoy being on stage in front of a large crowd of people. My father signed me up for theatre one year, and when he first told me, I was apprehensive. Also, when I first started taking piano lessons, I thought that it would be a huge waste of time. But, I found that I was quite talented at playing the piano, and I enjoyed creating music that my family and friends would loved listening to. It is hard to discover hidden passions if you don't try new and different activities. So, it will be much easier for you to decide because you have discovered your passions and talents at an earlier age. Through these new activities, you could discover that you have a strong interest in robotics that you were not aware of before.\n\nlike meeting with my math team or piano lessons, which prevent me from experiencing painful boredom. When I have nothing to do at home, I play the piano because it is a great way for me to use excess time and I enjoy doing it. Many students come home and waste time on the internet or social media because they have nothing better to do. An activity would give them something to think about or allows them to spend their time somewhere productive. There is nothing worse than coming home and finding out that your child spent four hours watching a cartoon on TV. On the days that I am not at swim practice, I would feel like I have too much time on my hands. Participating in an extracurricular activity is a productive way to use your time. But, I have other extracurricular activities scheduled for those days. These are only a few reasons why students should participate in extracurricular activities, and it can be seen that there are significant benefits.\n\nWhen they arrive, you hurriedly jump into their car and anxiously wait during the drive back to school. Suddenly, you realize that today was the first day of track practice, and you frantically call you friend, asking them if they can come pick you up and bring you back to school. In conclusion, students should participate in extracurricular activities because they give you something productive to do, they help you find new passions, and allow you to meet new people. Luckily, the coach only just started with stretches, so you put down your bag and stretch with the rest of the team. Once you are finally there, you burst out of the car and hurry down to the track. Every student should choose one extracurricular activity to participate in because of the plentiful benefits these activities provide. Throughout the rest of practice, you laugh with a new friend whom you would have never met if you didn't join the track team.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher.

It is important to know people's experiences so, you won't do the same mistake as the other person did, learn from their experiences, and help you from preventing bad things. They are very important. Like day, my mom and her friend were walking by their self 's and they almost got kidnapped so, we didn't go. My mom helps me from preventing bad things. For example, one day my friend and I wanted to go to the store walking by ourselves and we asked my mom if we could go but, my mom didn't let us because she said we could get kidnapped. Experiences are always shared. Well I have many times with my mom.\n\nand she didn't want it so, she didn't get it and the next day she got sick so, then I decided to get the flu shot. You can also choose a better choice. Many people make mistakes and learn from them. Doing the same mistake as the other person is not as fun so, listening to people's experiences is a great way from preventing the same mistake. Then, my mom told me that one day, she had to get the flu shot but, I didn't want it because I don't like shots. For example, one day, I went to the doctors and I had to get the flu shot The first reason why you should share experiences with people is to prevent yourself from doing the same mistake as the other person. Mistakes are always made but not when you have already been warned.\n\nLearning is a very fun and exciting experience. Another example, is when I didn't know how to bake a cake and my aunt help me and the cake was baked very good. The second reason is to learn from experiences. Learning something new is a everyday thing. Doing things in a better way can be much more easier. Never give up when you can't do something, Just keep trying or ask for help. Learning from another person's experience can help you by knowing how to do something good. Like one day, I was doing something wrong and my teacher came to me and talked to me so, I wouldn't do it again and showed me how to do it in a better way.\n\nThird reason is so, they can help you from preventing bad things. One time, My sister and I were misbehaving and we thought we wouldn't get in trouble and we were hitting my 3 year old sister because she hit us with a bat, playing around and we got grounded afterwards and we couldn't go to the pool anymore. Bad things never take you somewhere good. Working hard is always the best thing to do. Help anyone from preventing something bad. Bad things never come out the best. When you need a opinion whether you should do something or not just ask anyone so, you would prevent doing something bad.\n\nAlso learn from your pass mistakes and do something better and easier. Easy things can become better in life. Try something new everyday and better. Sharing experiences can help people choose a better choice. People always have the best advice to give. Finally, Prevent doing everything that is bad and ask for opinions on whether if you should do it or not. People change into better people when they get the best advice.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

I think that having a problem is a chance for you to get back up and try again because when having a problem not only can you learn from your mistakes but you can see what you did wrong and ask someone that has succeeded to find a better way of helping you. You can also observe and look through what others around you have done before.\n\nYou will have a certain point in life where you face a challenge and have to try again over a thousand times because that's a time in life when you need to see where you are going with yourself and how you want those mistakes that you have done go in life therefore, that's how you learn from your mistakes. Learning from your mistakes isn't always as bad as you think it might be, it's a place for you to start over with a fresh start knowing that the skill you have tried before doesn't work, and that you know what to do before working on the previous work you had done. If, you had a relationship with someone and you made a mistake, that doesn't mean you have to end your relationship you can work things out and practice on being a better person and learning from your mistakes. You can learn from your mistakes by observing what the people around you have done that has made them succeed. For example one day you might come across a challenge on a project that you will certainly find hard, so you have to make mistakes over and over to build up a good relationship with that project.\n\nWe all come across problems everyday, but that doesn't mean we give up we fight back until the problem has been solved even if it takes days we still try our best to solve the problem. When we face a problem that is our time to get our chance and do our best by asking people for help and learning from our mistakes. Asking someone for help can make you feel better because someone has already dealt with the problem that you are going through and they have enough experience on that problem. When you come across a problem you shouldn't always be putting the worry on yourself, you can ask someone for help in fact you need to ask someone that has already went through a problem as similar as yours so you can ask for advice on how they dealt with that situation. For example there are scientist who come across mistakes and they get back up and try their very best for a long time so that they can get a good result, Math teachers face some hard questions they fail, get back up and do the best they can over and over again until they find the right problem solution to the question. Usually when people are working on a project that has been assigned to them by their professors or teachers they seem to ask themselves if they are doing the project right or they second guess themselves, how would you know if you're doing it right or not when you haven't asked the person that has assigned you that project, or someone that has already proceeded to succeed.\n\nYou can try and learn from your mistakes to find the solution of your problem by not doing the same thing over again. I agree that having a problem is a chance to do your best because that way you can proceed to succeed by asking peers around you for help or you can get back up by learning from your mistake and observing others do what you're doing. You should always tell a friend or someone that you feel comfortable with about what you are going through and how they can help you and comfort you.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

The way the students will get the education is by online or video conferencing with the students so they can see them doing the work. Some schools allowed their students to take their classes at home as an option for the students to get the education at home and able to do other things in the meanwhile. While some may see it as a problem for students to take their classes at home, but agreeing to it can have their students to take as much time as they need help, students will be able to focus more on the subject or task without distractions, and students will get the education they need to know in their lives. Can students benefit for taking classes at home?\n\nThat why for the teachers help, can improve the student to succeed in the class. One idea is that students will be able to take as much time as they need help on something. When the student is having problems with their homework or studies for a test that they need to pass, they can ask a teacher for help so they can see what is the problem and to see how they can help them succeed. The teacher can marked anything that is wrong on their homework or assignment and help them until they get what they got wrong. With the students having many other subject that they need to finish and task that they get assign can lead the student to stress and with the teachers help they can take as much time they need to finish.\n\nWhile the student is learning and finishing the task at hand there is no way that another student can intrude him and lose his focus and forget the subject or task he was doing. With the student being able to take their classes at home he has a quiet room to focus on the task that is given to him with no other person to distract him off the topic. The teacher want the students to succeed in their classes with no distraction in anyway possible, so the students can get what they are doing and to see if they can improve later for an up coming test or quiz on it. In someways a single thing can distract the person from they point of thought through the lesson. Another idea is that students will be able to focus more on the subject or task without distractions.\n\nAnother idea is that students will get the education they need to know in their lives. While some students might think that what they are learning in class is pointless, but the teachers in class want you to know the education they teach will help in the students daily lives. Some people may see it as a distraction, but others see it as something useful in their lives when helping others or family and friends. In a way that people can see it as a goal to be set, others will see it as a accomplishment in their lives and see that the education they live will help them through hard and good times throughout their life.\n\nWhile some people say that students having benefits while taking their classes at home because students could not get the recommend education they need to succeed in life, but agreeing to students being able to take their classes at home because students will be able to take as much time as they need help on, students will be able to focus more on the subject or task without any distractions, and students will get the education that they need to know in their lives. For schools to have this oppurtinity for students to be able to chose this option to take their classes at home and get the recommended education that they need to pass thought life, will help them get better at what they do and to see if their education can help them teach others that are heving the same problem learning what they learn before.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

According to Thomas Jefferson's quote inactivity is not a way to achieve our goals, and we might be always working and striving on our goals. \"Determine never to be idle . It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing.\" . . It is hard to think that the more effective way to be accomplish is being busy and always doing sometime.\n\nAccording to the New York times the people who take a moment of inactivity usually they are confident and sure about what they want to make in their life, and what goals they want to set and achieve. The main reason why those people say that inactivity serve an important purpose is because they get more time to think what they want to do in their life and have their goals already planned. Some people say that we accomplish more when we are inactive than when we are always doing something because we have more time to set our goals. In addition they are more motivated and they effort more at they goals..\n\nWhile we keep working on our goals, they will came to us soon. We accomplish more when we are always doing something because we have more time to keep working on our goals to achieve them soon. Being always active and working is the best way to achieve our goals. We always have to be working, our goals never will come easily. According to a study of the Generic_School, all the people that now is successful, they always were working on their goals and never had a moment where they thought that they had to stop and wait because the accomplishment was about to come.\n\nHe wanted to wait and be inactive at least one year before to enter in collage, but that was a big mistake because at that time he didn't get a job, so he used a part of the money that he would have used in collage. The right person to say that is my dad, when he was a teenager and already graduated, he wanted to become an Industrial Engineer, but he didn't want to go collage after he graduated. We accomplish more when we are always doing something because we don't waste time that can be used to work on our goals. Now he is not a Industrial Engineer, he never achieved his goal because he wasted the time that he could use to achieve his goal. Sometimes when we are working hard on our goals, there's a time where we think that we have to stop and rest, but we shouldn't do that because that would be a waste of time that would be used to keep working.\n\nThough some people say that inactivity is more effective than activity to be accomplish because is a better way to set our goals, activity is the best way to be accomplish because we can achieve our goals more soon and we don't waste useful time. In conclusion, as you can see inactivity will not be the best way because the reality is that if we can done our goals and get a lot of wonderful things just being always active. Stop and have a good moment of relaxing might be awesome, but nothing like have what you want in our life and done things that will show out our effort and dedication.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

Secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later. They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.\n\nSecondly, If you are honest \"all the time\" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher. By the wrong person you talk to, you might accidentally start a riot.\n\nLastly, you should be careful on how honest you are to people, because you don't know whether they are going through some stuff you are pointing out to them. Being truthful to someone and saying everything to them might make them upset on how you view stuff in the world also. Honesty is like an opinion that may cause someone that went through something upset them drastically. This is why I disagree that honesty is the best policy. From the situation you are in say respectful stuff towards the person. It might make you a better person if you are not saying negative things towards a person too.\n\nIn conclusion, I disagree with \"Honesty is the best policy\" by the situation you are in with the person and what they are going through. May cause them to dislike themselves in a way you wouldn't know.\"\n\nExample essay 2 of score \"3.0\":\n\"CURFEWS SAVE TEENAGERS\n\nBy Generic_Name\n\nCurfews are a great way to keep teenagers safe and out of trouble.\n\nTeen teenagers who spend too much time on the streets are more likely to get in drugs, curfews will prevent teenagers from spending too much time in the streets.

However, keep some things to yourself if you think it's not positive to say to another. Second, It might make the person feel bad if you do say something harsh to them. Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times. Sometimes you have to say what's right in order to not hurt someones feelings from what you said. For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return. Secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later. They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.\n\nSecondly, If you are honest \"all the time\" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher. By the wrong person you talk to, you might accidentally start a riot.\n\nLastly, you should be careful on how honest you are to people, because you don't know whether they are going through some stuff you are pointing out to them.

Honesty is like an opinion that may cause someone that went through something upset them drastically. This is why I disagree that honesty is the best policy. From the situation you are in say respectful stuff towards the person. It might make you a better person if you are not saying negative things towards a person too.\n\nIn conclusion, I disagree with \"Honesty is the best policy\" by the situation you are in with the person and what they are going through.

It is all about how we ourselves choose to act. People can judge to see how we act and do things. We choose our own decisions and actions.\n\nIt is said that students who chose to make good choices in school and at home made them a better person. This meant that the students decisions and actions shows how they build up character. On March, 7th, 1999 the Washington Post interview people from a local school. The students over the year who had good character, became successful later on, They were more successful because of their good characteristics and had a good personality.\n\nI have experienced this when I was at a job interview. In my opinion I think that every individual needs to be a better person by improving their character. For example a good character will most likely get you accepted to a job rather than having a bad character. When people make good choices they probably have a better future, this might help them to get a good job because of their good actions. I was determined to work by staying longer hours and studying. In my opinion I believe this as true because it is proven. It is proven because when you do something good it will make you a better person. This applies for many many things like schools and jobs. I feel that every individual should try to put a little more effort in their character. I made a good impression by dressing up and looking good, and my employer seemed impressed. What I've learned from building a good character, Is when you make a good impression and you are determine to do something, it will help you to improve your character.\n\nI think every individual including my self should try to improve their character. When people do this everyone will have a better character, and when there is better character people shall become more successful. In conclusion I think we do choose our own character traits.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

However, keep some things to yourself if you think it's not positive to say to another. Second, It might make the person feel bad if you do say something harsh to them. Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times. Sometimes you have to say what's right in order to not hurt someones feelings from what you said. For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return. Secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later. They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.\n\nSecondly, If you are honest \"all the time\" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher. By the wrong person you talk to, you might accidentally start a riot.\n\nLastly, you should be careful on how honest you are to people, because you don't know whether they are going through some stuff you are pointing out to them. Being truthful to someone and saying everything to them might make them upset on how you view stuff in the world also. Honesty is like an opinion that may cause someone that went through something upset them drastically. This is why I disagree that honesty is the best policy. From the situation you are in say respectful stuff towards the person. It might make you a better person if you are not saying negative things towards a person too.\n\nIn conclusion, I disagree with \"Honesty is the best policy\" by the situation you are in with the person and what they are going through.

This should not be allow because, it can end in car crash, teenagers don't have a lot of experience driving at night. For example, I had a friend who always likes to drive when hi was drunk at hing speeds in the highways at night, One night he had car accident because he was driving drunk and at a high speed he is dead now.\n\nThirdly, curfew can prevent teenagers from doing things that they are not supposed to do.

It will improve our skills, keep ourselves healthier just by being active, and it will open a we world full of new opportunities and success. I think that by being active opportunities will show with more frequency in our lives.\n\nThis will take us to always have advantage over inactive people. Just by being active we will make a progress on our skill, or even develop new ones. Being active will bring perseverance to our lives. It will also help us live out of something that we like. This is why I think that improving and developing skills is very important in human life. One example is the improvement of our skills.\n\nThis is so important that has one big impact of our health. Another example of the importance of being active is our health status. This is another reason that takes me to believe that doing something is a big deal in our lives. Activeness is super important for all of us. being inactive can lead people to some diseases, some of they can be terminal such as cancer. Being active when speaking on a fitness way is very important.\n\nThis skills will lead us to a life with several opportunities that will make our lives a lot easier to succeed. The last example is the opportunities that an active life can bring to us. Putting ourselves to work on something will give us a life of success. This is possibly the main reason of why we should always put ourselves to work on something. By having an active life, just like I mention before will improve and develop new skill.\n\nTo conclude with this information. It is our choice to be an active or an inactive person the the result of each are clear. I think that challenging, or putting ourselves to work on something may be hard, but the results of this are worth enough to motivate ourselves. Health, new opportunities, and self-improvement are so part of our lives. It is for all of this reason and many others I could not get to that I think that doing something is the key to achieve our goals and be successful.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times. Sometimes you have to say what's right in order to not hurt someones feelings from what you said. For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return. Secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later. They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.\n\nSecondly, If you are honest \"all the time\" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher.

Other people believe that curfew unfairly interfere in young people life because they need to know how the real world is at night, Going to movers and also having fun as a teen. Curfew will keep teenager out of trouble because the will be no midnight party, no playing out at night and no going to friends house at night.\n\nFirst,Curfew will keep teenagers out of trouble because the will be no mind party. Thats is why the curfew is there to keep teenagers out of trouble. Something like driving back home in the car why dunk and it will most likely lead to car case, or police may case them. Mostly at midnight party there can be a lot of troubles people can even do carry things. For example, When a teen go to a midnight party they will must likely smoker or drink,and when he/she gets high, or wasted they may do something carry.\n\nThe rock hit her in the head and she starting to bleed. For example, When are was in my county Liberia, we used to out at night and play,but one night something bad happen. When teens are out at night they make carry discretion and do carry things that will get them in a lot of trouble. Secondly curfew will help a lot keeping teenager out of trouble because the will be no playing out at night. They why playing out at night is not save. Curfew will help keep the teens save. Then that rock starting to come down,but no one was able to see it because it was night. The was this girl name Generic_Name who was right under where the rock was coming down at, but did not known it. The was this boy name Generic_Name he toke a rock trough it in the up in the air.\n\nOther wise curfew will help keep teenager out of trouble because going to friend house at night is not good a lot of bad things happens in there in the night and must teen dont have the best discretion when it comes to getting out of trouble so the curfew will help they with that. However, Not everyone again that curfew will help keep the teenager out of trouble.

Getting enough sleep is one of the best thing one could ever have! This is equivalent to having an extra day off at work or school. The benefits of changing to a four-day school week, conserves energy and resources, improves academic performances and provides enough time to complete school assignments.\n\nThat one extra day off reduces expenses in respect of food services,transportation and utilities. An example of such is electricity and water. The more we use, the more the school pays for it. The amount of energy and resources used at school for a whole week is more than what we use at home.\n\nNot only does the school conserves energy and resources, but also offers teachers and students an additional day for rest every week. As a result of that, there is less stress over school works. Students feel less pressured because they have enough rest at home before coming to school. This is an important factor that helps improve the academic performances of students.\n\nMost students complain they do not get time at home, to finish up with the homework given to them by their teachers. Notwithstanding the fact that, the school conserves energy and resources, and provides enough rest, students will also have enough time to complete their assignments. Having an additional day, making it three-day weekend instead of two, will give them more time to prepare for tests and study at their own pace.

Schools should partnerships with companies because it helps students to know what's best for them for example, what they are interested in, get opportunities to explore the world, and helps students to communicate with others.\n\nThere are many students who would just take any class with their friends even if they don't like because they are in difficult situation and don't know what they want to do. So in the future they won't get confused what they wanted to do but didn't get an opportunity to know. So, they just decides to go with friends and have an experience if they like it or not. If students get a chance of this internship, it allows them to work with other people. When they'll work with different people with different cultures, it will let them know how to work and handle other people. Joining this internship will help them to work and decide what is best for them. They'll be able to do what they want to and they'll have an experience too. On the other hand if they get a chance through internship it will help them for sure to know what they are interested in. It also is a trouble for school counselors because then they have to change students schedule which is very trouble making sometimes. Later on they quit that class because they feel it's not what they like. Many times they don't get an opportunity to know what they would like to do. One reason why it's beneficial for students is that they get to know what they are into. There are many students who don't know what they want to do or what they want to be.\n\nGetting an opportunity from this internship is very beneficial to explore the world because this makes students know how to work with other people. Exploring the world or learning new things is really good for students. Students don't hesitate to talk to others, especially when they know so many different languages which makes them feel they can achieve anything they want to. This is great to explore the world and learn new things which many students want, but bad luck not everyone get to explore. Next reason is that students get so many opportunities to explore the world. If they know different languages people will accept their application for internships or for jobs. When they explore the world they can get to learn new languages which makes so much easier for students to get job anywhere they want to. It helps them to learn about different cultures and make new friends. It allows them to know how the world is and what they can get in future working with other people. In United States, most of the times people look for students who speaks more than one language because it helps them to make their companies more effective in good way. It is very difficult or close to impossible that students get a chance to learn about the world.\n\nIf schools let them go or participate for internships it will allow them to become more confident. There is a reason they don't talk with others is that they feel shy or are not confident on themselves. When students will get an internship to work and talk with other people they won't feel shy anymore and will feel confident by practicing. Last reason is that students will be able to communicate and understand how is it to talk with others from this internship. It happens most of the times students might know so much about what's going on but they don't get to talk.\n\nIf students don't communicate they don't get ideas or don't really learn new things. Communication is the most important part of our lives if students don't talk they won't understand what's happening, which can destroy their school lives. In schools or outside the schools, communication skills must be best to improve yourself. When they will speak they'll feel confident and won't care what other thinks. Communication allows students to get the chance and gives them right to speak.\n\nThis will make students know that they can do what they want to. However, if schools have partnership with different companies this could be the best opportunity for students to experience what they are interested in, discover the world, and become confident and communicative. Many people argue thats it's not great for some students because it already have so many things to do like they have games or jobs after school.\n\nI think students should get this internship to help and improve themselves. In conclusion, by working with other companies will help students to make their decisions more confidently and not to feel shy about them. It also could help them to know what they wanna do in their lives. This partnership allows students to learn new things and languages which I think is very difficult without internship.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

However, keep some things to yourself if you think it's not positive to say to another. Second, It might make the person feel bad if you do say something harsh to them. Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times. Sometimes you have to say what's right in order to not hurt someones feelings from what you said. For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return. Secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later. They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.\n\nSecondly, If you are honest \"all the time\" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher. By the wrong person you talk to, you might accidentally start a riot.\n\nLastly, you should be careful on how honest you are to people, because you don't know whether they are going through some stuff you are pointing out to them. Being truthful to someone and saying everything to them might make them upset on how you view stuff in the world also. Honesty is like an opinion that may cause someone that went through something upset them drastically. This is why I disagree that honesty is the best policy. From the situation you are in say respectful stuff towards the person. It might make you a better person if you are not saying negative things towards a person too.\n\nIn conclusion, I disagree with \"Honesty is the best policy\" by the situation you are in with the person and what they are going through. May cause them to dislike themselves in a way you wouldn't know.\"\n\nExample essay 2 of score \"3.0\":\n\"CURFEWS SAVE TEENAGERS\n\nBy Generic_Name\n\nCurfews are a great way to keep teenagers safe and out of trouble.\n\nTeen teenagers who spend too much time on the streets are more likely to get in drugs, curfews will prevent teenagers from spending too much time in the streets. Teenagers offended tend to drive at high speeds at night because the might be drunk, it will prevent then to not get influence by bad people, if this law is approved it will really help keep teenagers safe.\n\nTo begin with, in streets at night there are lot bad people, teenagers are expose to a lot of dangers, when they are in the streets at night curfews can prevent this to happen. Teenagers could be kidnapped or raped when they are in the streets at night and some cases they can be forced to do drugs or join gangs, if they dont do this things they might be beaten to death until they do it.\n\nSecond reason, There are teenagers at night who tempt to drive at high speeds when they are drunk. This should not be allow because, it can end in car crash, teenagers don't have a lot of experience driving at night. For example, I had a friend who always likes to drive when hi was drunk at hing speeds in the highways at night, One night he had car accident because he was driving drunk and at a high speed he is dead now.\n\nThirdly, curfew can prevent teenagers from doing things that they are not supposed to do. They might be doing drugs or hanging out in the streets with people that are doing drugs or are in gangs, they can be influenced by bad people from the streets to do drugs. Insulation, my cousin who use to do spent a lot of time in the streets with her friends, she and her friends went to jail because they were doing drugs.\n\nIn conclusion, curfew prevents teenagers from getting in trouble, it may prevent teenagers from getting in drugs, also from getting kill in cars accidents.

The reason I'm telling them to not do this is because their lungs are going to get ruined,and they will not be able to breath good and they might need an oxygen tank. Another reason to not do it is because if they might give it to one of their friends or tell them to try it and they might get addicted to it. As a middle school student, I will tell elementary students to not do drugs,juul, or drink alcohol.\n\nyou ask well BIP is a room where you go if you did something bad. My second lesson to tell is to not get in trouble specially when you're about to get six broken pillars because the you're going to have to go to a meeting with your parents and all your teachers or sometimes just you and your teachers. Also if you do get the six broken pillars then you are going to have lunch detetention and not hang out with your friends at lunch and you will probably want to hang out with your friends and not just stay there and stay quiet for the whole lunch. Another rason you don't want to go is BIP why?\n\nOther reasons to get in trouble is being tardy and if you're tardy you will get a broken pillar unless you have a note from a teacher or an excuse. Third is don't do dumb stuff like get in trouble for running in the hallways,play fighting,or talking back to a teacher. All of the things I said are the dumbest reason to get in trouble for specially when you're on a rush to get to class or lunch.\n\nOne of the reason to not get in trouble is because if you do you'll probably get kicked out of the team. Also try to keep your grades up and not bring them down because then you're not going to be able to participate in events specially in important events. It is good because it helps yoiur muscles be strong help you stay strong. Fourth reason is to get involved in school activitys like basketball,track,soccer,volleyball,or whatever you play.\n\nAlso try or get better grades so you can succeed in life like other people or one of your family members. You can also get a better job or get a better house,car. You can even have a better lifestyle. In conclusion is better to not get in trouble because your parents might get mad and won't let you participate.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

I think that some parks do have activities that you can do like in a state parks they have fun and interesting activities that you can do with your family. community parks only have were everybody can go to the park and have time to spend with family. Do you think that community parks, state parks, and national parks provide a wide variety of fun and interesting activities?. A national parks do have interesting and fun activities that you and your family can do, and a national parks may have some holiday activities that you and you family can try.\n\na community parks may have some activities that you can try in the summer, like for example a community park may have an activities like the '' mud run'' is were they are lots of activities that you can try and they have a race were you have to run throw mud and everything. in a state parks they might have some activities that you can try with your family, and they might have a father and son completion, like a fishing completion are how to build an boat and you can try it to see if it work and to see if it floats on water. I think that community parks, state parks, and national parks can provide a wide variety of fun and interesting activities, for example a national park have some activities that can let your kids try it or the whole family can try it together, and they can have a holiday activities where you and your family can try it together.\n\ncommunity parks may have some interesting activities in the summer that you can do if you don't have nothing to do this summer. My first reason about community parks, state parks, and national parks is that some have activities that you can do and some don't, for example a community park maybe have some activities that you can do or maybe they don't have activities because it is a community park were everybody can go and have a cookout or were you can take you kids and play or walk with you friends or do whatever you want. a community park is were you can do somethings like go for a walk or you can swim or have a family time or maybe you can pay a sport there like soccer or football or anything that you want to do.\n\nMy next reason is that community parks, sate parks, and national parks have different things, like for example a community park is where people go and have fun or if they are having a family time. a state park may have some interesting activities that you can try with your family or kids, and it could be fun. A state park may have really cool and interesting activities that you can try with friends or family or with your kids in the summer cause they put really fun and interesting activities that you can try with your friends or family or kids . a state park could have a holiday activities or just a park that people could go and spend time with family and maybe they can spot some interesting activities they see.\n\nMy final reason is that community parks, state parks, and national parks have different things, like for example a community park is where people go and have fun of having a family time. A national park is where there is lot of activities that you can try, like in the summer they have lot of activities that you can try with your friend and family and you might like it. a state park is where they could have some activities for kids and family. And they might have a holiday activities that kids and family can try. A national park may have so interesting activities that you can try and the park might be big for everybody that are coming an trying the activities. a national park is where they have lots of activities that you and your family could go and try it.\n\nA national park is where they can have interesting and fun activities that can try with your kids and family. A state park is were they might have interesting activities that you can try and you family can try to. community parks, state parks, and national parks are different from each other cause some don't have interesting activities. Community parks, state parks, and national parks have different thing, like for example a community park is where everybody goes and have fun.\n\nA national park has interesting and fun activities that you can do with your friends and family. And a national park may have some holiday activities that you can try with your friendsand family.

In school some students cannot stay that much time constantly four days. Some students have jobs after school and some will take care of there little brother/sister while there parents were not at home.

A student who have big dreams and work to save money for their college fees lost his/her job will hurt him/her a lot and they will give up. There are some students who work whole week. Immigrants people who will come from another country they do not have much money so there children who are in high school will also work to help their parents.

Last reason is that if you are your self the world is on your side with that you have a big weapon to make a different. One reason why it can be the greatest thing to be your self in this world is because the world and people behaviors is a obstacle to be you ,they would try to change you. Thats why I agree with Emerson statement that \" To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishments\". and what is the purpose that we want to achieve in our life thats one step.\n\nThe world is constantly trying to make us become something else,but the world is us humans.\n\nThe majority of them are commitment by two or more persons .The police reports that I had read, they constantly give more years in jail to the main responsible. To me one of them was a bad influence, they become a obstacle for them selves and for those that they kill. Furthermore if you get to do anything that they want, you totally lose your self and always be the way that they want you to be .Thats why we need to find out who we are find our self ,and a purpose. One or a group or persons can be either good or bad influences to our life's .They literally can push us to do anything if we given them the control of our lives .For example in the United States we have a higher percentage of shooting in high school's and stores. thats why we need to know who do we call friends and family because they can push you to do things that maybe you don't want to do they become obstacle. fairly both of them get to pay for what they have done .However\n\nTo me in personal is hard to know everything about me, some times I do things that I never though about it. It is important because if you are focus on your goal. Ones you get to be yourself the world is on your side and with that you made a different and that becomes a big accomplishment. That phrases reflects to me how do we pretend to go against the world if we don't even know who we are? In addition this include how important is to give us a purpose. Is important that we find out who we are and what is the purpose that we want to achieve in our lives. For example you want to be a Doctor you spend a lot of time in studying and working that you would forget about what is going on in the world , you going to ignore problems and others people lives and be focus with yourself to achieve your purpose. There is one phrases that is inside of me it say \"If you don't know yourself how you pretend to know others\". We basically do what we see on the world .There is violence ,murders,economical problems ,rapists,robbers, and more.\n\nyou have everything under control you know who you are ,and your purposes ,the world would be on your side. The personality works better when is positive and you have a good heart, you get to support others and they support you .If That makes a different to you and others,\n\nFor example the majority of us have read documentaries about persons that had impact the world to become better. become successful and a great influences to others.\n\nMalala is great example to believe that be yourself is a greatest accomplishment. For example Malala , she was a young lady who decides to fights a against her government to get the right to study, in her country women wear not allowed to go to school. Malala was very confident in believing in her self and she knows what the purpose was, pass the time Malala achieve her accomplishments now thanks to her and all those that give their support ,women are allow to have education.\n\nIn conclusion, the world and people behaviors can be a big obstacle to us, it can be friends or families members, thats why we need to know our self and learn how to know others. It is important to give our self a purpose,so we would get focus and ignore the problems that are going on in the world and while that time we would be founding our self .\n\nmy opinion I agree with the idea that be your self in a that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishments . Ones we have confident about our self and know the purpose in our lives everything would be very different. The world would be on our side and thats a big weapon to supports others and help the world to become better .In\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

I am desegree that some teacher argue that there should be year-round schools, where there would be a 3-4 week break in the summer, a longer winter break, and a week off in the spring. But we study like 8-9 mouth why they want more time to study. some people travel in another country or state of United State because they do not like to live with cold they prefer hot place.\n\nI prefer a longer summer break because we can practice sports, we can go to the bitch and we can to cook out side to make (carne asada). If they want a longer winter how we can enjoy winter because in the winter: snow, to much cold, we just can stay in home and we will get stress.\n\nAlso the benefit that you can get in this practice sport, you can care your health because you will not see your mobile phone to damage your eyes or you will be a good person because you will have not stress, and you will have a good body because you will not stay in your bed to get fat. Also you can learn in practice sport maybe your do not know some sport but you have friend that they know how those sport play you will know after that you will feel good when your friend will talk about beacause you can share your opinion before you do not talk with bacuase you knew about that sport. Practice sport is a good thing in ours body that we can do in summer, sport like soccer, baesibol and we can run on the street with our friend. Soccer is one of sport that we can practice in summer because you can make a team and you can go to in the big liga to competion with another team, and you can make new friend in that liga, and if you like soccer maybe you can go to in big team like Barcelona, Galaxy, Real Madrid team like that.\n\nAnother good thing that you would be in summer is go to the bitch with your family to enjoy the sun, the sand, or when the shark go out to the sea. Now I like a lot shellfish, always when we go to the bitch my family in hotel called for some shellfish because now all family like shellfish. Watch the sun on the sea in the morning and say woawoawoa...... Shellfish is the first food that we eat. I was very enjoy the last summer because we had 3 mouth and I went to different country to enjoy the sea and I made the sand bull with my brother and I ate a lot shellfish, I like shellfish because when i was kid my father told me, when you will be young you will strong because the shellfish contain a lot vitamine but I did not like and when we traveled he always told me if you will not eat the shellfish, you will not food for this day But if you have money you can travel in another country where you can find coco or palm, country like Mexico where you can enjoy agua de coco (coco of water) or sleep under a palm without think, you will forget for a moment the bad thing that you had or work, study, enemiges etc...that is another reason that i want a longer summer because i want to forget for a moment all my bad thing while the time past i will have more power to star a new year of school. so I scared a lot and that day was my first time when I tried some.\n\nIt is beutiful when I do this thing because all my family to arrive in my house and we can talk about our story or when my grandfather is talking all my family have to keep quiet because he is talking about his past life and his idea is to propose good future for us. Also we can go to the park and to cook there too. This i can do during the winter because it si cold and i will freezing my body that is why i prefer a longer summer for to cook many time carne asada and share with my friends or my family. Also we can dance anything music that we can like. Carne Asada is another thing that I can do it for summer. For to make carne asada it is to have a clear sky because when you cook, you need to have your drill out side of the house and than you can to cook. This are moment that I can forget because in winter all this thing is end. Carne Asada mean barbeque, carne asada is name of food that Latin America call.\n\nand I believe in your house you can not do this Summer is the thing that we can enjoy and make many thing for to preperate for the winter because winter you can not work or travel so summer is very important. and you will died in your home without friends. Summer is a moment that must people like because you can do many thing, you can enjoy of your family and friend, because in winter only you can stay in your home watch television, phone, play fornite etc.... That is why I prefer longer summer because if they gime me just 3-4 week of summer I can not do enything and I will not want to came back at school, I will be bore. And i do not like all of those thing, I like to enjoy my youth because when your are a youngn you have to exploration your mind and you have make new friend\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times. Sometimes you have to say what's right in order to not hurt someones feelings from what you said. For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return. Secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later.

For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher.

Because, the online clasess are time limit so they can use their time wisely in other things and student who have to face transportation problem every morning, clasess from home will make their life more easier.\n\nIn USA most of the student have to take loan to finish thier education. In that case student can plan their study in a day and do a job in their free time. One course must have to be done by that seseaon time. Clearly, it is binificial to take online clasess and agree with the offer of distance learning. So doing a job while taking an online course will help a lot with those loan terms. To bging taking online clasess from home is much more valuable because those clasess are time limited, so that student can use their other time wisely. For example, usually online clasess have seseaons which is fixed time.\n\nEvery single morning they have to rush for public transportation to go to the campus so that they will not get late for class. And student will be able to focuse on study more than handeling little problems like those, which is alomost turning into a part of their daily life. For instance, in USA it is a big problem for people who do not have own transportation. Farthermore, student who do not have own transportation, online clasess are the best option for them. Some time it effects thier attendence, depends on institute and thier professors. Most of the time its the student who suffers most. This proves that taking an online class solve most of those problems easily.\n\nThis shows that student should attend clasess from home by way of online or vedio conferencing and accept the offer of distance learning.

Second reason, to be a positive person without loss of enthusiasm.\n\nFor example when my mother want to drove, she need to pass the permission drivers but always failure. The first time she's feeling bad and disappointed, but she try to pass all the time until she pass.\n\nHow much difficult is accept our errors when we are failure in something.

You don't want to accept that is your error but, when you learn to accept the error you start to endeavor for don't failure again. Finally reason, accept our mistake.\n\nThe failure help us to learn about life, get more experience, and accept our mistakes. We live in a country where we have lot opportunities to pursuit something.

Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times. Sometimes you have to say what's right in order to not hurt someones feelings from what you said. For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return. Secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later. They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.\n\nSecondly, If you are honest \"all the time\" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher.

Using time wisely with these devices will help teachers and students at the same time.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

However, keep some things to yourself if you think it's not positive to say to another. Second, It might make the person feel bad if you do say something harsh to them. Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times. Sometimes you have to say what's right in order to not hurt someones feelings from what you said. For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return. Secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later. They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.\n\nSecondly, If you are honest \"all the time\" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher. By the wrong person you talk to, you might accidentally start a riot.\n\nLastly, you should be careful on how honest you are to people, because you don't know whether they are going through some stuff you are pointing out to them. Being truthful to someone and saying everything to them might make them upset on how you view stuff in the world also. Honesty is like an opinion that may cause someone that went through something upset them drastically. This is why I disagree that honesty is the best policy. From the situation you are in say respectful stuff towards the person. It might make you a better person if you are not saying negative things towards a person too.\n\nIn conclusion, I disagree with \"Honesty is the best policy\" by the situation you are in with the person and what they are going through.

Most students don't put in as much effort other students do, and that's only because they don't care as much. It's only fair if the student got to make that decision, Why make them do something they wouldn't enjoy doing? Schools shouldn't be the ones to control student involvement in extracurricular activities, the decision should be left to the students and their families.\n\nIt wouldnt be fair to those that have a job, they are too young to be stressing out this much. Not only do they have to worry about college, a car, and helping their families out, they also have to worry about doing extracurricular activities. The students that have jobs aren't able to do extracurricular activities, they don't have the time for it. Most students need the job to save up for college, a car, and to help their families out. Making them do an activity for school would only have them under so much stress.\n\nOthers just lose motivation to do anything after a long day of being busy, and decide to procrastinate which isnt good. They lose track of time and end up having no time to do homework and to study. A reason why a good amount of students have bad grades is because they can't do so many things at once.\n\nWhat if they chose something we really dislike doing?

There are some persons who are always trying to do their best in order to improve our society, and everyday new persons are born to live in the world they are creating. Just like everybody else, they will start from zero and the same question will appear in their minds when they grow up,\"What do I have to do to get what I want?.\" We have scientists, doctors, firemen, pilots, policemen, chefs, etc.\n\nWe grow up seeing and listening different events that happen around the world but also, at the same time, these events start to giving form to our thoughts. All these factors makes us think about our own future and also motivates us to start making decisions that will affect our life.\n\nWhat is the problem with all this? you might be wondering. Here is when they start to ask themselves if they should ask for help or do it all by their own. As I said before, most of the people don't know what to do to get what they want. Once they've grown, sometimes people don't know what decisions should they make in order to have a pleasant life.\n\nI still remember when Generic_Name, my old brother, told me he had decided to be a doctor. He graduated from high school and was ready to take the next step in his life, work as a doctor and be successful. My family and I were wondering which college did Generic_Name choose, so he could learn everything a doctor needs to know. I've seen this situation long time ago.\n\nMy mother was furious but she let him do it, she knew he was going to realize soon or later, which was a big mistake. When the time came and my mother asked him which college did he choose, he said that he was not going to study in any college because he was going to learn all by himself.\n\nHis friends always told him that he had to go to college if he really wanted to be a doctor, but he didn't listen just because he thought he would spend years of his life by going, he thought that he could be a doctor faster in his own way. My old brother has been always like that, he would try to do everything by himself following his instincts and doing what he thought it was right, until that day. He saw how all his friends were learning how to be a doctor in college while he was wasting his time reading books and articles on the internet, which was good but not good enough. One year had passed and Generic_Name didn't do any progress.\n\nToday, there are some occasions where he tell me how much does he regret about his attitude back in those days. His friends were making progress until they finally made it, they graduated while my old brother, through the years, never changed his attitude and decided to take a different direction in his life. The time passed, and he never made it, he never could be a doctor.\n\nOf course there are ways to do it but, are you really sure you can do it? I'm not saying that you, a person, cannot be successful by doing and learning everything by yourself. because making sure of who you are and what type of capacities do you have is what will decide how good will you do it by yourself. With this story I just want to make something clear, the fact that we can lose all our dreams, what we have always wanted, just by being obstinate thinking that we are always right.\n\nNo one has to learn or take decisions by herself or himself because there will always be somebody. Anyhow, it is also important to know that ask or look for help will never be something bad. There are people with tons of experience in this world that can teach us how to be an excellent person, they can teach us how to be the person we want to be.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

However, keep some things to yourself if you think it's not positive to say to another. Second, It might make the person feel bad if you do say something harsh to them. Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times. Sometimes you have to say what's right in order to not hurt someones feelings from what you said. For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return. Secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later. They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.\n\nSecondly, If you are honest \"all the time\" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher. By the wrong person you talk to, you might accidentally start a riot.\n\nLastly, you should be careful on how honest you are to people, because you don't know whether they are going through some stuff you are pointing out to them. Being truthful to someone and saying everything to them might make them upset on how you view stuff in the world also. Honesty is like an opinion that may cause someone that went through something upset them drastically. This is why I disagree that honesty is the best policy. From the situation you are in say respectful stuff towards the person. It might make you a better person if you are not saying negative things towards a person too.\n\nIn conclusion, I disagree with \"Honesty is the best policy\" by the situation you are in with the person and what they are going through.

It is better to work alone,the other side say that it is better to work alone because we can be responsible and confident ,how ever it is not .Although some people might argue it is better to work alone, actually it is better to work in group because we can finish our work quickly and we can get learn more or get more knowledge.\n\nIt is better to work in group to finish our work quickly. For example in my history class some of the students choose to do there work there own and some of them them choose to do work by a group the student that finish early will get a price and the students that choose to work in group finished earlier and got the price. It is better to work in group because if we would have not done the work in group would not finish early and won the price because we have done our work in group we won the price. The first reason that explains that it is better to work in group because we can finish our work quickly. it is better to work in group to finish our work quickly. It is better to work in group, the second example that support this is; there was man who had to fix a lot of cars' in two days, and get money for his house rent he could not do it by his own so he called his friends to help him and they helped him they did the work in group and he finished his work quickly and also he payed for his house rent. It is is better to work in group because if the man had not finish fixing the cars' he would have been on the street but because he worked in group he finished his work quickly and payed his rent.\n\nit is better to work in group so we can learn more things . The second reason is It is better to work in group because we can know or learn new things. i got 100 on it. it is better to work in group to know new things, because if i didnt do my pay chart and present it i would have got 0 in my grades but because i worked in group and i learned i got 100. it is better to work in group to know or learn new things if she did not learn how to swim she could have got in the water and died and she would not know how to swim in different ways but they taught her in group and she learned how to swim. it is better to work in group to learn more the second example that support this is there was a girl she did not know how to swim and her sister and brother thought her how to swim and also they teach each other how to swim in different ways in group and she learned how to swim. For example i didnt know how to do pay chart for my chemistry presentation and i asked my friends to help me and they say lets teach each other i group and and they though how to do it It is better to work in group to learn new things. and i did it\n\nis better to work in group if the boy had worked in group and payed the rent with the group he would have afford the rent and leave there It is better to work in group, if the kid had learned how to rid a bike in the group he would not feel but he felled and hurt his leg, because he though he could do it by him self. but he choose to work alone so he could not afford it . The other side might say it is better to work alone because we can be responsible and confident however we can be more responsible and more confident if we work together in group. For example there was a lot of kids that was learning how to learn a bike but there was on kid that fell confident and he did not want to learn with them, he was 11 years old he was so confident that he can ride a bike by him self but he could not ride the bike cause he was not not in the group to learn how to ride a bike, so he feel when he ride the bike and hurt his leg. it is better to work alone to be responsible the second example that explains this is there was boy that i know he wanted to leave by him self and got in to a big house but he could not afford the rent .it it is better to work in group.\n\nAlthough some people might argue it is better to work alone, actually it is better to work in group because we can finish our work quickly and we can get more experience or get more knowledge.\n\nIt is better to work in group ,because working alone is not better than working in group, when we work in group we will be more safer we can accomplish things easily , finish quickly and learn a new things, it is better to work in group to susses.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

If you still doing the same thing that you already mastered you're losing an opportunity to learned a new object that can make you be better and have more experience in life. People should try something else that they never experience about, so they can learn new thing instead of doing what they already mastered. In my opinion when you mastered one object you should try another one, so you become better and grow to be successful in everything that life bring you. Many people should try to do something beyond that they already mastered, people will never grow if they just stay doing the same object they mastered .\n\nstudent in school sometimes get the same classes every year that they already mastered, while they can do another object to learn new object to be more capable in every aspect, they lost new experiences to learn something different, when you are in the same thing all the time, there is a moment when you get tired of doing the same thing over and over again. In one moment of your life you're going to think that you lost an opportunity to learn something different, its going to feel like it has a waste of time, time that you could't try something different instead of doing the same thing you already mastered.\n\nIn my option, i agree with Emerson's statement because his telling the people to look beyond not just to stay on the same thing all the time, to do another thing's after you already mastered, your object so you can grow and became successful in life, \"people that do the same thing they already mastered, they will never grow\".\n\nI think Emerson's statement was good to tell the peple to move on in life and look beyond the thing you already mastered. In conclusion people should practice another thing not the sameone they mastered, so they can grow and learn new thins so they can became successful in life.

This may be a good thing because students will have more time to learn instead of of doing nothing. Parents that work nine to five jobs wont have to worry about leaving there child unsupervised. They will be more increases in work ethic and discipline. Some children are worst of then others some are homeless and some are with out parents this would be a good time to learn so they could be better off.\n\nTax payers would boycott the the additional tax that comes with the one and a half hour change. That means that there income tax will be higher. If the teachers work more hours then they will have to be payed more money. if the local government has to pay them more money then there going to tax more people. The reason I disagree is because this would hurt not only the student but also the local government's economy and the tax payers.\n\nIn retrospect the board should layout a plan that works for students, parents and the economy. This is why adding one and a half hours would not only hurt student but also the local government's economy and the tax payers. These are my toughs on the topic at hand. I hope the head of the board and members consider not enacting this time extension. There are some pros to this plan, But there mostly cons.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

However, keep some things to yourself if you think it's not positive to say to another. Second, It might make the person feel bad if you do say something harsh to them. Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times. Sometimes you have to say what's right in order to not hurt someones feelings from what you said. For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return. Secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later. They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.\n\nSecondly, If you are honest \"all the time\" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher.

That'll just make a bad impression on yourself. Now on the other hand if you have a positive vibe and attitude your first impression is going to be good, people will think that you will be willing to work hard and set good standards.\n\nIf you chose to be negative you'll regret it. If you walk into a job interview with a bad impression they're most likely not even going to hire you; when you meet someone for the first time are you going to be negative about it or positive? because they don't want to make a fool of themselves. First impressions are impossible to change, the reason i say this is because no one likes a negative person. Most people if not everyone is going to say positive why you may ask? Because people will not just wanna talk to you, they'll talk bad about you saying, he's not a \"good person\" or \"he has a bad attitude\" etc.\n\nMany people just ask questions and you give them an answer that's not really a conversation. As bad on how your day went just smile because there will always be another day. So in conclusion have a good first impression it'll take you so far in life. Now lets say you have a positive attitude while meeting new people they'll like you instead of not wanting to talk to you. A conversation is when you actually get to know each other and share what you like to do and what are your hobbies etc. Another thing on first impressions is that many people are going to ask what do you do for a living, and that's a good thing because you can have a humane and chill conversation with them. That's what you call a good first impression because you did not have an attitude, you did not ignore them, you kept a positive vibe while you were talking to them. And if you keep that same attitude they will want to talk to you again because you didn't treat them bad.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times. Sometimes you have to say what's right in order to not hurt someones feelings from what you said. For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return. Secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later. They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.\n\nSecondly, If you are honest \"all the time\" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher. By the wrong person you talk to, you might accidentally start a riot.\n\nLastly, you should be careful on how honest you are to people, because you don't know whether they are going through some stuff you are pointing out to them.

In the other hand some people are disagree with this idea because some students are not familiar with technology and they are not be able to have internet access, but in this cases the school and the government could support them with technology. In the other side, the students will be more familiar with technology and also, almost all students have internet access at home, and this would make more easy for them. In my opinion as a student this's good idea because, some students live by their own or they help their parents economic.\n\nSome students already have a job to save money for college, so they will have more benefits because, they will have more time to manage their time to do homework and work, in this way they be less stressful. for example, the time that students use to prepare them and when they took a bus to the school, this time they can used to sleep more or even start the classes early during this time. By the way this can also change their social interaction. the online classes will have a positive change in their daily life.\n\nIn the other side the relationship between the student and their friends, they can use the time after school to hand out and enjoy their free time and at the same time this benefits their classes because they don't get distracting during class. Their video conferencing classes will have more interaction with the teacher and if the student need help then the teacher will have more time to them. Therefore. By the way the regular school have alert and their close the school.\n\nSo, they can continue their classes like a regular day.

Can we get more activities done by working on it all the time? working on a goal, it takes us time. I know that achieving a goal it is one of the proudest activities we can make for ourselves. Because we do not have time for ourselves, also we need to recharge our minds in order to continue doing an activity, and stress will come to our lives.\n\n5 years ago I remember when my parents were too busy to have a day off and to take care of me during the school year. Firstly, to become successful in this world, we need a routine based on productive things and also time for ourselves to do what we desire. Having a break between activities help us to give time to restart our minds. My parents and I were happy because we knew that we have time to make some fun things, and we stopped worrying about school, work and study. We need time for ourselves to relax an enjoy what this world offers us. My dad was working in a construction company from Monday through Saturday, and my mom was studying at the university. After the break we were ready and exhausted to start our routine again. We did not have time for ourselves to have a deep conversation and enjoy a day off at home. We needed a break time during that moment, but once the Spring Break came, we stopped our routine.\n\nSecondly, Humans are able to accomplish great goals, but time is required. According to my teacher, inactivity provides us energy and it is a way to going to be able to continue classwork or activities at school. When I was in middle school, my teacher always gave us time to relax and stop what we were doing at the classroom.\n\nAdditionally, when my classmates were tired, they ask the teacher for a break because they need that time to clear their minds from worries and stress. Practicing this activity was helpful to me, because I could concentrate even more on my activities at school.\n\nMy friends and I needed a time where we can interact with others. We need time not for only activities and responsibilities, we also need time to rest and stop worrying about work in order to recharge our minds and become successful. When I get to know with a new person it makes me feel important to that person.\n\nIt is hard to imagine how hard life can be. By concentrating even more on your required activities than fun activities, here it comes its negative side. Some people might quit their goals by not having time for themselves. He was required to work at a restaurant to earn some money. Once he started going to college and working at the restaurant. Breaks are important as activities in our lives. I noticed that he was super exhausted, stressed and quiet. Finally, stress can lead you to depression. For example; when my big brother went to college, he needed money to pay college and utensils. After a couple of days he quit college and his job, because of not having time for himself he stopped trying to reach his goal. He felt he was not able to finish college. He could reach his goal but too much activity and stress led him to depression.\n\nMany claim that the more early and rapidly you start doing your activities, the more chances you have to get things done. Because you have time to recharge your mind, also you have time for yourself, and stress does not affect your well-being. Additionally, some people believe that breaks are not important and beneficial on achieving a goal, and it should not be required to us; however, taking a break between your activities it is going to change your life. Life is short do not let activities lead you to depression take a break and start again.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times. Sometimes you have to say what's right in order to not hurt someones feelings from what you said. For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return.

For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher.

One way to have fun and learn is by doing science experiments. Science experiments are best because they teach how to work as a team, work independently, and life skills.\n\nWorking on an experiment doesn't mean one teammate does the work, there are roles for each team member. If they have fun while doing an experiment then they will most likely remember it. Science experiments teach teamwork because teammates help each other out. For a team to work out, they need someone in charge to assign roles so the experiment can go smoothly. Science experiments are enjoyable because students can work with their friends as a team to learn and have fun at the same time. If a team don't work together to reach the goal of the experiment, then the science experiment wouldn't teach anything.\n\nAlthough science experiments teach teamwork,they also teach how to work independently. One reason is opinion, when working with a team the team members might not all agree with an opinion one of their teammates has. Some also prefer to work independently than with a team for many reasons. If they were in a team then they might get stressed out because of peer pressure by teammates. Some students prefer to work alone because they can focus better. Some students might not feel comfortable working with teammates, so they work independently.\n\nThey might not work with their friends but when they are in a career they might work with people they don't know, and that's what science experiments teach. They might not have teammates but they learn to be more cautious. Students who are working independently learn how to understand better. Life skills is another skill science experiments teach. Students in teams learn how to lead, command, and work in a team. Whether a student is working with a team or independently, they learn life skills.\n\nStudent can have fun and learn at the same time, which is why science experiments are good. Most of the time they are memorable,which is the job of a science experiment. Science experiments are an enjoyable learning tool.

However, keep some things to yourself if you think it's not positive to say to another. Second, It might make the person feel bad if you do say something harsh to them. Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times. Sometimes you have to say what's right in order to not hurt someones feelings from what you said. For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return. Secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later. They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.\n\nSecondly, If you are honest \"all the time\" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher. By the wrong person you talk to, you might accidentally start a riot.\n\nLastly, you should be careful on how honest you are to people, because you don't know whether they are going through some stuff you are pointing out to them. Being truthful to someone and saying everything to them might make them upset on how you view stuff in the world also. Honesty is like an opinion that may cause someone that went through something upset them drastically. This is why I disagree that honesty is the best policy. From the situation you are in say respectful stuff towards the person. It might make you a better person if you are not saying negative things towards a person too.\n\nIn conclusion, I disagree with \"Honesty is the best policy\" by the situation you are in with the person and what they are going through.

One of the Ralph Waldo Emerson most famous quote is \"To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment\". Some people think that being something else in this world is an accomplishment. I agree with the quote, I believe to be myself in a world that is constantly trying to make me something else is the greatest accomplishment is a truth because being yourself help you to be honest, to be more secure of being who you are and people love you because you show yourself and you are not trying to be someone else.\n\nI think if people really like to be close of you they will accept your mistakes, it is like when you are starting to know someone and you tell him how you are. Firstly, I believe being honest all the time has to do with being yourself, and honesty makes you be yourself. Being honest is good because people believe in your words, and if you are doing something good people are going to do it too. Some people are always lying to be someone else to impress other people, and lie to impress other people is not good because every lie in the final will affect your life.\n\nThey think that just because they change their faces they will change the bad way they treat people, but a lot of them change because someone hurt them and they don't want to go back to the past full of bad memories. Other people love how they are and they don't want to change anything because they feel secure. People think that changing the way they are is going to change the past , what they did or how they look before. Secondly, to be secure of how you are is being yourself.\n\nIf you demonstrate yourself to people they will not doubt. When you don't show yourself to people they will think you are lying and maybe you are telling them the truth but you are not being yourself, but when you are being yourself and you are telling the truth they will have more confidence with you. Lastly, just because you are yourself people will love you and because you don't try to be something else. People love people who show their self, how they really treat other people or how they really act. People treat you as you show what kind of person you are.\n\nI feel that don't changing is a good way to feel satisfy of what you did right in the past, and that is why being yourself is an accomplishment. As you have read I agree with the quote because that's the way that I think. I feel that being yourself in a world that try to make you something else is a accomplishment, but most of the time a lot of people think they want a change, but to a better way. People hurt you in life and you change because of them, they make you more stronger.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

However, keep some things to yourself if you think it's not positive to say to another. Second, It might make the person feel bad if you do say something harsh to them. Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times. Sometimes you have to say what's right in order to not hurt someones feelings from what you said. For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return. Secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later. They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.\n\nSecondly, If you are honest \"all the time\" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher.

Some people may need it much more than others, but that's why their are guidance counselors at school it you don't feel comfortable telling a parent or people who need legal help have lawyers to get help from them we can't just do whatever, we need help all the time no matter how little of a thing it may seem. They are an important asset to us because without them honestly everyone could potentially be out of control; we need their help and it's not wrong to need or ask for help. I don't think it's to wise to just let people do what they want because they feel like they don't need help or advice on something. I think people should seek guidance and help from experts, and authorities because who doesn't seek for help from those people now anyway. We don't know what kind of ideas some people may have.\n\nNot everyone likes to seek for help when they need to make a tough decision and I get why it can be difficult asking others to get involved with the things we do. We get told what to do for a reason we need help and rules. If everyone was just going off instinct this world would definitely be messed up and all over the place it'd be way more messed up than it already is. Sometimes you really do need the help whether it's from your mom, to a police officer or a lawyer. Seeking help is never bad it can change your mind about the littlest ideas to really the important ones. Probably not, we humans can make some really bad choices, not everyone but we have a good handful of people that don't care about what they do, say or who they hurt. People should be able to make their own choices , but a little bit of guidance when making the decision wouldn't hurt anyone. We are human we can't go off whatever we feel is right in our minds because that could land you in trouble and it may not even be worth it. We have many people around us to talk to. Asking someone just for advice can make a difference in many ways. If we were to follow all our ideas and instincts do you really believe this world would be the way it is right now. We have to ask for help when we need it no matter who it's coming from.\n\nHere is an example in a TV show I watched not to long ago this teenage girl took her life but didn't ask for help from anyone she just wanted people to know she was upset but who was going go know when carrying around a big smile. The people that don't think they need anyone s opinion or help on making a wise decision are really the people that need the most help. The point is that not every person has the mentality we all think so differently and getting professional help from someone who sees or hears things like that we may feel or think is normal and they can give us the answers we would never find on our own.\n\nTheir are consequences for absolutely everyone roaming around with wild ideas and thinking you can just do what your mind is telling you. For instance would you feel comfortable knowing we just do whatever whenever because we don't have limits or rules or would you like to see a friend fall because they put their pride over getting help. I sure would not enjoy seeing a close friend or family member getting dragged down because they were ignorant and decided not to look for help with their problems when they it the most. It's really important for everyone to understand that you can't just do whatever we please.\n\nPeople need to just stop being ignorant and forget about their pride and put themselves first. In conclusion I agree with seeking help from experts instead of having weirdos go off what they think is right because I probably won't think the same things others do. I'd rather see people lining up to talk to someone about their problems whether they be big or not the ones who don't want help are the ones who just want to struggle on their own and fight it out. Those are the people who prefer living in their own little world. I ask for advice and opinions on a daily basis because it makes me feel better and more secure about my decisions and I hope that's what others feel too. Asking for advice has never been a bad thing everyone has your back if you need the help i'm sure their are many people who need to know its good to seek help and not just stay in a shell and swallow it.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

is like being honest with your self. if you are honest to your self then you can be honest with your love ones like youre family, friends, and all the people that are there for you when you need them or when you have a problem they will always help you.\n\nthats shows to be honest with the ones you love because once you lie to them you wont stop laying, and that can get you to have consequences only because you just can't be honest with your friends, and family, and all the people that are around you if they are there for you and if the trust you dont pay them back with laying to them just be honest because if you lie to them you will lose the family that was there for you when you need them those friends that were there to help you when you have a problem.\n\nlaying is the reason why people dont work out because, they dont have trust on each other that the only thing that they think about is to lie to each other because they just can't find a way to be honest and however some people might end up hurt because you were just laying to them the whole time and sometimes when someone is hurting another person is like hurting them self because they can't fix all that pain that they did to others thats why think about what are you going to do or say just take time and about before saying something that it would hurt other people thats why think about it twice not just acting like nothing happen think about what other people can feel, think or say. like for example laying is the reason why many people ruin there relationships.\n\nanother example if you go to an interview of work if you get there and the boss starts giving you a question to answer , and to the first question the boss gives you or who ever is doing the interview to that first question if you say a lie to that question is not going to end up good because if the person who is doing the interview keeps on asking you questions and you are just saying lies then thats not, going to work at all because now you cant stop laying can you can't control your self after saying a lie then you will not have the job because you were just laying and laying to others is like laying to your self. if you are honest to others you will have a normal life with honesty not just with lies and all that stuff that can hurt other people .\n\nall i got to say is to be honest with your friends, and family and all that people that has been there for you when you need them. just be honest if you re going to say something that is not honest and its a lie then don't say it think about it twice anyway try youre best on what you do don't life your life with lies because at the end you will realize what you said was wrong and it was en the truth then you will see at the end that what you did wasn't honest even that some people think that laying is the best and when you say a lie and another lie and that people that you love your family, and your friends once they Belize you and when they find out that you just lie to then they would never believe you again.\n\nand they left then the next day he started screaming gain and this time the men was saying the truth but it was too late because no body of the

no body help him because they thought the he was just laying again then at the end the wolf eat all the men's sheep's and no body of the town believe him ever again and the man stayed all alone because no body believe him. i think it would happen on the same story that my mom told me once she said that a long time there was a guy who used to have sheep's he lived in Small town and she told me that the guys one day that he was outside feeding his sheep's he started screaming for help saying that the wolf was trying to attack him, and then everyone in the town went outside to help him but when half of the people that lived in the town got where the man was they saw that there was nothing, then the man with the sheep's started luffing because the people of the town actually believed him then the next they the man with the sheep's started screaming again and saying the same thing he said before the people of the town believe him again then the people of the town got mad at hi\n\ni learn a give lessen only because of this story because this story is telling me to be honest with others, if you say a lie and you keep on saying it they won't believe you because you were laying all

Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times. Sometimes you have to say what's right in order to not hurt someones feelings from what you said. For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return. Secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later. They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.\n\nSecondly, If you are honest \"all the time\" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher.

Also they have been studying the topic or activity that you are trying to improve longer than you have. They are wiser because before they where a mentor they where a student who made lots of mistakes and improved them along the way.\n\nThis could come in handy because they can tell you something you might not have known with just the knowledge you already have.\n\nAnother reason why I think you should seek for guidance is because they are watching you. By this I mean they can see the mistakes that you make. Also mentors can make sure your still sticking to your plan so you can accomplish your goal. Manypeople have reported that when they start to try to accomplish a goal they often end up getting distracted or lose focus on what they need to accomplish, but with a mentor you have someone to remind you and uplift you to accomplish the goal you want. This good because once they acknowledge you doing something wrong they can help you improve it so you can do better than before.\n\nThese are all my reasons on why I believe you should seek for guidance. But when you have a mentor they will encourage you too keep trying and learn from the mistakes you made. My final reason on why you should seek guidance is because they motivate you. Also mentors will give you self confidence that will make you feel like you conquer anything, I say this because with all the motivating speeches your mentor gives and him/her helping you get through things you never thought you could get through , you are going to feel on top of the world. So often that when people are trying too improve something or try something new they sometimes get discouraged when they make a mistake.\n\n- Sincerely Generic_Name\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

However, people with a positive attitude it's a very different result. Now for a person with a positive attitude they won't give up on the couple of times they get it wrong they will keep on going until they get it right this being the result of always having a positive point of view. People with a positive attitude most likely have a lot of energy in them and with this energy built inside them, they can go further to higher heights. Lets compare a person with an positive attitude versus a person with a negative attitude, if a person with a negative attitude plays the guitar for the first time and doesn't get it right, they will get mad with theirselfs and give up. People with positive attitude don't give up very easily reason being the energy they have in them, but also because they seem to view something good in everything like a good result or a better outcome.\n\nbut it's most likely true.

In my opinion, I think that spending time indoors it is not really an issue for most people. In my neighborhood you take a look around, and there, you have nobody outside, at your sight. However spending time outdoors can be more excited and helpful for teen's lifestyle. Most of the teens of my generation, we like to stay home, play video games, watch a movie or t. v show, or to be on our phones.\n\nWorking out, can be another example of enjoying or taking care of yourself. For example, you can try new sports, or even if you already play a sport, you can practice outdoors. Being allow to have community parks, is a great offer to try new things out. Trying new things for the first time can be really fun, and you never know if you are actually are into it or good at it. One advantage of having community parks is that, they can be one mile or two miles away, they can be right in your neighborhood.\n\nThere is a lot of state parks where you can enjoy wisely your time like Kid's choice or anywhere outdoors. Carnivals are often in spring break, so rather then stayin home bored,for a full week, you can go and have a great time doing challenges at a carnival. State arks are almost always one of the most liked by teens of this generation. Waterparks are also fun to go, especailly in summer time. They do carnivals, where you can go, and hang out with your friends and family.\n\nYou can socialize more with your friends and family , you can spen time with them at a restaurant with your love ones. At Disney World park you can have a enjoyable time. National Parks can be way more excited to go to, but somethings for some people is not affordable to spend money on. One of my favorites national parks to go to is Disney World. There is so many options to chose like going to the rides, going to the zoo, to the stores. Sometimes you can realize that by having a great time with your adorable family can make yo happy and change your moods.\n\nIt can also effect on the way you decide to live yor life as. Going out is not only about being somewhere else besides your house. It could also effect your health, as if you decide to do some hobbies. it is about how many fun activities you can do and how much fun you want to have.

They didnt care about other peoples feelings except for their best friend. Kindness is a huge part in life that makes us grow and have a good,loving,and kind heart. The only thing that was important to them was themselves. Until.... I cried everyday for that matter. The people that I trusted were fake and their kindness was fake. They called me shy girl because i was quiet because when you are new to a school,you get nervous,you felt you didnt belong ,and you say to your self \"this isnt my school\" and those were the exact same words in my head when i entered the building four years ago. Last year at my old school(it was a private school),i was lost. I needed a true friend that was going to show me kindness,telling me that everything is going to be ok or i will always be by your side. Which i was not apart of. They judge a lot of people who were innocent by their looks or how they act .I felt alone. Everyday we need to show kindness because we are helping people who have a bad day or going through a rough time .I have been one of those people who are going through a rough time and its hard and sad.\n\nIt always made my day. The people were nice to me .I meet so many nice people. I was so much happier and i am still happy. The end of seventh grade i transferred to a public school ,I felt alive. Any people who do any kind or nice things to me,I appreciate it I never felt that feeling in years. I felt that i belonged here. i met real friends .They cared about me,they ask me is everything ok,you are beautiful,you are an amazing ,whats wrong,how was your day,this will make you feel better ,everything they said was kind.\n\n.Believe me if you do any kind thing to someone or say something nice to them ,it makes their day because they know they are not alone.\n\nyou help people to show kindness ,they will bring kindness back. Thats how kindness work .If Kindness may not be everywhere but as long as you felt you belong or have a purpose i life ,you have kindness in you and the people around you do too. whatever happens in life, you must have kindness in your heart because one day you will change someones life just like a switch because if you dont turn on the switch it stays dark but when you turn on the switch it is bright ,it shines.\n\nAlways Be kind. I hope people show kindness because they people helped me and i help them. Showing kindness is the right thing to do. Kindness any little thing you do is something that the people will always remember and cherish. \"Show kindness and respect always. Maybe one you will change someones life. The only thing i always remember and say \" is to always show kindness to the world.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

What would be better, to graduate from High School in three years instead of the traditional four years? All of us don't have to be smartest then others. Just to get where we'll want to be, all we need is effort and a need.\n\nFirst, having an extra year may help you to work a little hard, you can start working a lot, so in a future to have enough money to pay your college, otherwise your parents dont need to worry if you're going or not to college, another thing they don't need to worry about is if they're going to have the exacly money to help you save up for yours stuffs. College cost a lot of money, and effort as well.\n\nSecond, once we'll start school with good grades, everything comes out well at the end. Students may enter to the military force a year early, or enter college too. Doing something in a very good age its really better, because you only thinking in your own stuffs, because most of young people don't have obligations at home, it means there's not much to think about, only knowing that school is the most important.\n\nThird, back in Brazil i met a boy name Generic_Name. One great thing from him was that he was so smart, his dreams were really big. There's when he got more energies, and started making an effort to graduate a year early from High School. Family makes us sometimes to be a greatful person in this world. His mom had Cancer thats why she couldn't worked to help theirs kids go ahead. She felt so miserable because her older boy was the one who was working to feed all of them instead of her. One of His dreams was to earned a lot of money and buy his mother's a house. Once Generic_Name said, \" I am going to be someone increilble in life, I will have success in Life.\" He was very poor that; sometimes didn't have food to feed his siblings.\n\nNot considering anything good, won't make us successful in life. Move foward for better results. Some people say that Graduating from High school three years instead of the traditional four years is the same thing, but they are wrong because if you graduate early is because you made an effort to get good grades, Furthermore its not the same. In conclusion, In a future try to do all you can, so nobody will gets to you, and tell you what to do.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

I believe that it has benefit for students to be able attend classes from home, because students can have extra time to work on and if students can not be able to go to school they can attend that class at home. In some schools students are available to offer distance learning as an option.\n\nSome school have distance learning programs for students to attend classes from home, and that is helpful for students to get an extra time to work on. like in some classes students need to finish their work in limited time and this can make students a little stressful, but in distance learning program students can have enough time to work on.\n\nHowever, you have a dream if you are not educated it is so difficult to achieve your dream. For example some people wants to be a Doctor, Engineer, Athlete, and others want to be Astronaut. In this way if people need to educated to achieve their dream it is impossible to go to school for all person in this world in lots of reasons, like some people live in far from school, do not have enough money to go to school, having apart time job for living, and other reasons can affect their dreams. In this world every person has it`s own dream for the future to be in a perfect way of life.\n\nOn the other hand if students have distance learning program it is not easy to work on assignments and homeworks like students that are able to learn in school, because students that take classes at home do not have teachers and classmates that they can make things more easier to understand by giving examples and more explanations.\n\nIn my opinion it has benefit for students to be able attend classes from home, because students can have extra time to work on and if students can not be able to go to school they can attend that class at home. So schools should have offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing, and also students should not give up if they do not have way to go to school or if they are not able to take classes in the school, because they can attend for distance learning program and make their dream achievable, and schools should pay their own role to make achievable students dream.

Because during lunch is when they get to talk so why just not let them use their phone.

And so they could know about everything and no be in class looking through their phones trying to know what's going on.

For an example when you bring your phone to class I think that is a better decision then allowing students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times. For an example a students was texting another student of something that happened in a different school. Never ever bring your phone to school at all. and you forgot to turn it off then it rings all the sudden. She didn't pay attention at all and when she took a test the test had some questions that had to do with that lesson, but guess what she failed. The other student was in class when she was texting. I think that because that may affect the students learning and education. Also if the student bring phones to school that also might disturb other students. Today was a really important lesson, but the student didn't pay attention at all because she wanted to know what happened next and she was wandering and dreaming. Then she told her what happened, but she didn't tell her everything because the student has to go to class now. I think that would be the best policy for all schools. That might disturbed the whole class and also might affect the other students learning. I think the principle should not allow students to have phones at school at all. She didn't pay attention because she was busy texting and also that affected the other students learning and education and she also failed the test because they also had a really important lesson that they needed to know. I also think they should put that as a school rule in all schools that \"Phone's are not Allowed to be in School\".\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

In school every kid has been told to follow their dreams, to do what they like or to never stop follow there dreams; for example I love to draw and when I took art in school I was disappointed with my wok after seeing other student's art work, after few weeks I decided to drop my art class and when I told this to my art teacher, she told me to never compare yourself to others; learn to look from where are started and what you achieve, and what more you have to accomplish.\n\nAlthough people think doing something small for our accomplishment it do not help at all, but I believe every step we take towards our goals no matter huge or little it is, it always serve a purpose.\n\nLife is like a game every level will teach you something no matter what it is\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

However, keep some things to yourself if you think it's not positive to say to another. Second, It might make the person feel bad if you do say something harsh to them. Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times. Sometimes you have to say what's right in order to not hurt someones feelings from what you said. For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return. Secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later. They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.\n\nSecondly, If you are honest \"all the time\" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher. By the wrong person you talk to, you might accidentally start a riot.\n\nLastly, you should be careful on how honest you are to people, because you don't know whether they are going through some stuff you are pointing out to them. Being truthful to someone and saying everything to them might make them upset on how you view stuff in the world also. Honesty is like an opinion that may cause someone that went through something upset them drastically. This is why I disagree that honesty is the best policy. From the situation you are in say respectful stuff towards the person. It might make you a better person if you are not saying negative things towards a person too.\n\nIn conclusion, I disagree with \"Honesty is the best policy\" by the situation you are in with the person and what they are going through. May cause them to dislike themselves in a way you wouldn't know.\"\n\nExample essay 2 of score \"3.0\":\n\"CURFEWS SAVE TEENAGERS\n\nBy Generic_Name\n\nCurfews are a great way to keep teenagers safe and out of trouble.\n\nTeen teenagers who spend too much time on the streets are more likely to get in drugs, curfews will prevent teenagers from spending too much time in the streets.

However, keep some things to yourself if you think it's not positive to say to another. Second, It might make the person feel bad if you do say something harsh to them. Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times. Sometimes you have to say what's right in order to not hurt someones feelings from what you said. For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return. Secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later. They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.\n\nSecondly, If you are honest \"all the time\" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher. By the wrong person you talk to, you might accidentally start a riot.\n\nLastly, you should be careful on how honest you are to people, because you don't know whether they are going through some stuff you are pointing out to them. Being truthful to someone and saying everything to them might make them upset on how you view stuff in the world also. Honesty is like an opinion that may cause someone that went through something upset them drastically. This is why I disagree that honesty is the best policy. From the situation you are in say respectful stuff towards the person. It might make you a better person if you are not saying negative things towards a person too.\n\nIn conclusion, I disagree with \"Honesty is the best policy\" by the situation you are in with the person and what they are going through. May cause them to dislike themselves in a way you wouldn't know.\"\n\nExample essay 2 of score \"3.0\":\n\"CURFEWS SAVE TEENAGERS\n\nBy Generic_Name\n\nCurfews are a great way to keep teenagers safe and out of trouble.\n\nTeen teenagers who spend too much time on the streets are more likely to get in drugs, curfews will prevent teenagers from spending too much time in the streets.

To be one person or individual in the earth it means that people are can do everything they want.\n\nA person to be individual in the earth can't make their greatest achivevement;because every human in the world needs to the instruction of their family,best friend or someone elas that help and modifiy thier life. and they are interested the specch of them that how to be a powerful person and how to make ourself to be someting in the world and reach the greatest thing that we want. the cradle of every success person is that,they are listening to the thoungh of their familes or friends.\n\neveryone needs help that who can help and direct the right way. Be individual a person can not arrive the highest position because life is very difficult. so we can say our family is the most powerful person in our life that they are helping us that how we should progress and how we try alot to be a person that we can reach the jewel,treasure of the biggest achievement of our life. for example; so at the first beginning I want to say, the one who make our life amazing and give us the capability of anything we want,that is our family. like when a baby is born he or she dosen't know anything about life,and their family's are responseble to understanding their childern the good and the bad thing of the world.\n\nfor example for the first time when we are coming to school for understanding the knowledge, at the first time in school teacher is the best and the good helper for a student,because they are teaching the student and showing them the right way and makes the student to the biggest position,also teacher show the diffcultices of life for the student to never \"give up\" and be positive. they are helping the stundent that should have to attian and accomplish the greatest thing that the want. so in this way every one needs a best friend that can follow their decision and find the right way to be success and get the biggest treasure of thier life. A person by oneself is not complete or sometimes we can say no one is profect,it means that everybody needs a good helper to direct the right way and to modifiy and compelet their life to reach and get the biggest achievement.\n\nSo and the end I want to say that every person in the world can not do any thing with out of instruct and guide of family,friend. so every person has the worthiness of this to arrive the highest way to get the greatest achievement. the best way to advance and progerss our is to communcation with other person to expand our life in to the right position and make ourself to the capability of thing that we want and be a helpful person in the world to attian or reach the biggest thing that we have wish. so when we are individual we are not profect or we are not compelet.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times. Sometimes you have to say what's right in order to not hurt someones feelings from what you said. For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return. Secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later. They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.\n\nSecondly, If you are honest \"all the time\" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher. By the wrong person you talk to, you might accidentally start a riot.\n\nLastly, you should be careful on how honest you are to people, because you don't know whether they are going through some stuff you are pointing out to them. Being truthful to someone and saying everything to them might make them upset on how you view stuff in the world also.

Is setting a good example by your own behavior the best way to influence other people, or are there better ways to influence others? One other reason is if you show how hard you work and how much you bring to your community, it can influence others to do the same thing.\n\nAnother example is, when everyone see's what kind of a person you are and how you help others for anything they need help with it can effect their mood in many positive ways which could help them in the future to do good deeds. An example is, if you hang out with your friend with a very admirable behavior it can effect the way you act in a positive way. If your behavior is good and outgoing it can influence the people you hang out with.\n\nIf you show how hard you work and how much you do for your community it can influence others positively. Another example is, if you show how hard you work in something it can show what kind of a person you are and help influence the people that are always around you to succeed in whatever their goal is for the future. If you are helping the community by doing fundraisers or helping from preventing littering in the area it impacts the the community in a good way and it influences others to do the same thing.\n\nSome people may think that your behavior doesnt matter on how it influences others because they think there are a lot more methods to influence others without showing your personality. Your personality is a big factor to influence other in a positive way. I think the opposite because your behavior can effect others because of the set of mood and the way your acting.\n\nIn conclusion i think the reader should search up on how a humans behavior can set a good example for many people and show what come from it in the future.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

Afterschool homework club is the best idea possible!\n\nFirst of all,\n\nI think afterschool homework club is an amazing idea because some students are never able to do homework at home because they have siblings that constantly bother them and never give them time to do their homework, or they're just not motivated to do homework at home. Also, I think students aren't motivated to do work at home because they don't have anyone to push them to do their work.\n\nIn my opinion students usually understand more when teachers or students are guiding them on what to do. It's also a good idea because students can be surrounded by people who want to do well in school, and I think that can really push students to try their hardest! Another reason, why I think afterschool homework club can be a splendid idea is because students can be doing very bad in some classes and just not understand what's going on, so they can get extra help afterschool from teachers or even students.\n\nStudents can also discuss what they've learned and maybe teach each other something new! Finally, I think it can be a fun idea because students will have a chance to socialize with others once they're done with their work.\n\nIn conclusion, afterschool homework club would be an outstanding idea because it can help students finish their homework earlier at school, and help students with classes they aren't doing very well in. Afterschool homework club can also motivate kids to try their hardest in school!\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

Many racism people find the way to bother other people that are not from their race, religion, sexuality and many more cultures that other people can have. The majority of managers and boss fire people or they make their coworkers to respect other people but,\n\nmany other managers agree with the idea that her/his coworkers are doing with the person that is not like them. However, there are more nice people than bad in this world and now our generation there many people with different style and many more things that people can become rude for it.\n\npeople can be like that, because the different people that they call different are more intelligent, happy, and grateful and that makes racism and bad people anger. But, now there many institutions and rights that protect people from our same community. How can people be rude and problematic with our same people that the anger make them kill innocent children and teenagers,it doesn't make sense.\n\nOne more example , Donald Trump because he does not like immigrant people from any parts of world nor,Latinos community that's why he want to build the big wall between the two frontiers There are many more reasons why people does not like people that are different from them. have a bigger percent of discrimination and racism from people that they may prefer to kill innocent people instead of respect them or just don't talk to them but, don't go to far away with your anger that they are progressing or have better life. For example,immigrant people that came to this country to have a better life and better opportunities.\n\nSociety are not going to do or be something that other people want they to be because they are not going to move to their violence country, change their race, change their religion or be what other people want they to be; just to make racism people happy. Just respect others no matter where they are from and what their culture is,but now thanks to freedom of speech,Freedom of religion in this country people can yell aloud their sexuality, religion and many more cultures that they can have from their country no matter what other people think because no matter what there is always going to be at least one person that is not going to like it no matter if we are in the year 3000 something is always going to be like that. Furthermore, having a positive attitude is always going to benefit your life and is always going to be your greatest happiness no matter what other people think or said about.\n\npeople from different religion, sexually or that have different culture are free to do what makes then happy and that what's matter.\n\nThanks to the rights of the people and how Ralph waldo wrote you can be yourself in this world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment. In addition, you always have to wake up with a positive manner and a positive attitude that way you can be successful in life and that way people who does not like different people, they may learn to don't hate people just because people dress up differently and have other cultures.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

While first impressions are important, they are not impossible to reverse if one does not go in your favor. Eye contact is very important to ensure that you are being attentive and are completely immersed in the conversation. First impressions are vital when meeting new people. Eye contact,manners and conversational tone are all things that people tend to look when involved in a first encounter.\n\nSince we are each own individual character we cannot immerse ourselves in the minds of other to truly understand what they are feeling or thinking. Many people may become nervous during the first impressions putting avoid between eye contact and such. While it may be difficult to recover from a bad impressions, it can be done. One can easily make a good first impressions only to act disrespectful later, which in many cases, overpower the good first impressions. The idea of ''never judging a book by it's cover'', would appropriately fit this scenario. One can also make a not so great first impressions but turn around for better.\n\nfurthermore, it is not an entirely fair assessment to judge a person without a few encounters. Until a person is comfortable with their surrounding and the surrounding or other. Usually one counter with someone is not enough to judge them off of or to determine kind of person someone is. It is very possible that they may not act as friendly as they would in a situation when they are at ease.\n\nSomeone who attempts to belittle you or acts as if they are one higher level, is most likely always this way. A person who preoccupies themselves while in a conversation by things such a texting or listening to others things that are not a part of the conversation or interrupts is most likely displaying their normal behavior. It is wise never to judge someone off of their first impressions,however, there are exceptions, if someone in a cynical, sarcastic, rude or arrogant during a first encounter, this may be typically behavior. Doing such things are rude, disrespectful and will be hard to recover from.\n\nPeople should be given more than one change to display themselves as they truly are. Give everyone a few opportunities to prove themselves as good minded individuals. Judgments should made after a few, lengthy encounters to ensure that true characters is shown. Even if some portray themselves to be rude individuals, a judgment should not be made off of one single encounter.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

I disagree with his dissection because most of the students will not want to participate in a activity. The students will just sit there and do nothing or they'll fall asleep. The principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. And there are more reasons why students should not always participate in activities.\n\nStudents should have the right to choose what they want and what they dont want,because it would not be fair. The extracurricular activity's are great sometimes because you have more time to hang out with your friends and stuff,but when they dont let you then thats when students get mad. And for them getting in to much trouble it can affect there life and also it can affect there grads. Students get annoyed when teacher tell them to do something they dont want to. I would not join an activity because when i get home i dont have time to do all my stuff at home. For example,The students needed stay after school for an activity but they couldn't go. The principal made that rule but the students that dont want to do it they'll get in trouble.\n\nIf a student picks a sport like soccer they can get hurt in many ways and in some other sports. Students often dont have time to be doing activities or they dont have much important to them. Their are many reasons why students should not participate in activities. The teachers can also be to much they get mad if your chewing gum in class and then they be like \"IM GOING TO GIVE YOU A REFFERL FOR CHEWING GUM.\" People get bored when their just sitting their listening to the teacher. They also can get distracted easily They dont let you do what you want to do even sometimes you get in trouble for not going to your activities. and then they get in trouble for talking. Also they can be scared to go because their scared to get bulled by someone. All the schools from Generic_City have good and bad rules.\n\nThats why I wouldn't agree to this decision that the principal made. The teachers can make some other fun activity's so the students can enjoy there time with there friends. I mean a lot of people out there can have different ideas some dont think the same like others do. Students may look like their distracted but maybe their not,maybe its because they dont know how to do something in the activity. so they can understand that maybe activities can not be that bad. The county should make more activities that are excited so students can go and learn more stuff Some students can be lazy to even think about doing activities.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

In my opinion teenager have the right to be in the street during the 10 P.M weeday and during midnight. If in the city i live there is a debating between the adoption of a 10 P.M weekday curfew and a midnight weekend curfew for teenagers, my opinion would be that it will better if nobody adopts it. The City council should not accept the adoption of this new curfew law for all teenagers.\n\nMy life can be one example. Curfews can't keep teenagers out of trouble, teenagers are as same as adults, they can chose their own decision about what they want to do during any day of the week, they are only unfairly interfere in young people's lives!!!!. I woke up at 5 am to get ready to come to school, after school i have to go work during 4 P.M to 11 P.M. I work only 7 hours because, i need some times to do my homeworks, and some time to use my phone, facetime my friends and time to read my favorites books.\n\nIf the law of the curfew is adopted and i'm in the street at 11 P.M, it would mean that i'm breaking the law of the curfew!!!. Some teenagers have no parents, their parents are in their country, or they abandoned their childrens. For this reason have to work after school and sometimes they have to work extra shifts. The reason why i am desagree with this curfew law is because, not all teenagers that are on the street during weekdays and weekends are wasting their time, they are working hard to have a better future.\n\nThis is a hard debating between be desagree or agree with this curfew. Teenagers are owners of their onw lives, some people may think that adopting the curfew is one of the best ways to keep teenagers safe. If teenagers use drugs and alcohol they may not follow the intructions of their parents. Their parents need to teach how to have the same education at home, in school, or outside the school. The city council is not keeping teenagers out of truoble. The best way to keep your teenagers safe is teaching them to not use drugs and alcohol.\n\nIf the people go to the party and came back from the party at 12 A.M, the police will arrest them because, they are breaking the curfew law. During the weekends most of the teenagers includings adults, prefer to go to parties, and some people prefer to say at home with their families. we are teenagers, if we take our responsability at school, we can also take responsabilities outside the school. The city council should not adopt this curfew law, they will not be helping teenagers to how life work, working during nights.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

I agree with Churchill's statement because most of the time is hard to make our dreams come true, but if we really want to do something we can do it, because everything is possible in life. Another reason of why I think that failure could lead us to the best things in life, is because if we dont't try, we won't never know if it could be possible. I always dreamed being someone who could create art from anything. But there were many reasons that almost made me forgot about that dream. Also failure is not something that we should be afraid of, I think that failure can give us experiences in life that can lead us to success, things and experiences that only life can offer us.\n\nOne of the mean reasons was that I didn't have enough materials to make a simple peace of art, it was hard for me because in my country I didn't have the same opportunities that I have now. I know that I still have a lot to learn, i'll keep follow my dream, and I know that one day I'll say I FINALLY DID IT. And I went from failure to failure but I always tried to forgot about negative things and I was just focused about being someone different in life. Failure in life, for me is just another opportunity to try again something but with the same or more enthusiasm. For example, when I started learning how to draw or paint, there were many reasons that almost made me forgot about my dream. Now that I'm better at drawing and also I have the materials that I always wanted, I'll keep getting better and I can say that it wasn't easy but it worth it.\n\nAnd that is why I think that failure can lead us to success because if we don't know how hard is to obtain something important in life, we never will appreciate what we have or what a person is doing for us. And failure can lead us to the success, because it can give us experiences that only life can offer. And is very hard to imagine something that we haven't experienced, is hard to try and learn from what we hear than learn from what we have being true. For example if we do something wrong we know that we won't be able to fix the past, but the only thing that we can do is to learn from our mistakes and try to be better in the future. That is why we shouldn't be afraid to do something or to try new things in life, because nobody was born knowing things, only life can give us the knowledge to learn and teach. Another reason of why I agree with Churchill's statement, is because most of the time we don't see what we have until is gone.\n\nBut I'm proud of some of the decisions that I had made in the past, and at the same time I learned from my mistakes and I'll keep learning. We shouldn't be afraid of fall through, because life is to do new things everyday. That's another reason of why I agree with the statement, because like all the rest of the people i'm not perfect. Life is to live the way we want, having in mind that nobody is perfect and it's fine to make mistakes, but we have to learn from them. For example, many years ago I was afraid to leave my country, for many reasons I though that I wouldn't make it. I was scared to fail, but at the same time I saw that opportunity like the greatest thing that I ever had. But my mean motivation to come to this country, was to see my father for the firs time after 18 years.\n\nTo fall through is not a defeat, is a new opportunity to do something better. Everybody can try and teach you something, but your best teacher always is going to be life. I share Churchill's idea because you have to suffer before to triumph. And is fine to failure in order to find success, we just have to stand up and try again but with the same or more enthusiasm. The hardest things in life, are the things that will always worth it.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

How does this effect school around a the work with they were to adopt this methods? For many this is a great things and for others not so much.\n\nSome students have been done, and it showed that attendance has imporved twenty percent in a two year period. To start, having less day of school will and can improve the attendance of school, having lees days to miss students are most likely to have better attendance, and be more motivated since have time to rest and prepare.\n\nSome thing would go for teachers, since the work week is less they have more time to prepare, and time to organize things to be ready when the week stars. If you only have a four day school week that means, the amount of work that had been assigned is lees so more students will be able to turn their assignment in on time.\n\nAnother things is since the work week is less for teachers it gives them more time to do other work, and not have to work over the weekend, like some do sometimes and students can attend other school activites during that day off.\n\nWhen it comes to cost this can make a significant change. Energy will be saved more since the school will not be running the full five day week.\n\nI am for this to happen and feel that many other students would say the same, a four week school day would make life easier and a better place to learn. More students would be motivated to attend school, and the teachers life would be less stressful. Over all I believe having a four day school week would be more beneficial in the long run.\n\nBut the most important things is, they can enjoy the school.

Inactivity has multiple meanings and its up to individuals to take it as wasting time or a time to calm their mind and soul in order to get back up again and remain active. Being on track and remaining busy can take away a lot of time, but also help in many things. Busyness can take away the bad energy and keep people from doing many wrong things. Personally in life i have made many mistakes where id think i have nothing to do when really, theres always something to do in order to better yourself or to improve anything possible. Thomas Jefferson has the best way possible of saying \"it is wonderful how much may be done if we are doing\", because its mesmerizing how possible it is to get so much done in so little and even inactivity can serve a purpose for times where people want free time, or time to relax. Staying busy and being active can take away a lot of time, but the results an individual is looking forward to get out of is also very important, thats why its a lot better to stay busy and accomplish what your working hard for. Results people get from staying busy or being on task is much better than someone that likes to be inactive rather than active and feel way better accomplishing what their working hard for. Inactivity damages and takes away so many great things in life that people dont come across to notice where in such small amount of time you can realized that its very easy to ruin your life in such a small amount of time. because if people remain busy and take advantage of their time they will get a lot more done rather not doing anything with their time at all. In my opinion we accomplish more if we are always doing something, why?\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

However, keep some things to yourself if you think it's not positive to say to another. Second, It might make the person feel bad if you do say something harsh to them. Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times. Sometimes you have to say what's right in order to not hurt someones feelings from what you said. For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return. Secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later. They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.\n\nSecondly, If you are honest \"all the time\" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher. By the wrong person you talk to, you might accidentally start a riot.\n\nLastly, you should be careful on how honest you are to people, because you don't know whether they are going through some stuff you are pointing out to them. Being truthful to someone and saying everything to them might make them upset on how you view stuff in the world also. Honesty is like an opinion that may cause someone that went through something upset them drastically. This is why I disagree that honesty is the best policy. From the situation you are in say respectful stuff towards the person. It might make you a better person if you are not saying negative things towards a person too.\n\nIn conclusion, I disagree with \"Honesty is the best policy\" by the situation you are in with the person and what they are going through.

However, keep some things to yourself if you think it's not positive to say to another. Second, It might make the person feel bad if you do say something harsh to them. Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times. Sometimes you have to say what's right in order to not hurt someones feelings from what you said. For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return. Secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later. They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.\n\nSecondly, If you are honest \"all the time\" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher. By the wrong person you talk to, you might accidentally start a riot.\n\nLastly, you should be careful on how honest you are to people, because you don't know whether they are going through some stuff you are pointing out to them.

Honesty is like an opinion that may cause someone that went through something upset them drastically. This is why I disagree that honesty is the best policy.

There are many reason why this topic isn't fair. Not only that but also being commit to a specific career at a young age .\n\nFor example,\n\nit's not fair to have a young student make a specific dissension on career when there so much more they can pick instead of setting there mind to on specific topic,\n\nthey may not have interested in when there so many other opportunity they can pick from.\n\nBut because you enjoy it, when your young you really have no clue what career will best suit you. Being commit to one specific career isn't at all easy, when you know there so many other opportunity out there you will like and want.\n\nAfter you choose what career then comes the commitment to the class and other subject.\n\nAnother reason this is a bad idea is because not only do theses young student have to pick a career at young age.\n\nThey also have to keep in mind that their class will be about and how this will guide them toward their career. Another thing is that these young minds will be overwhelmed about all the work they will be having to do during their classes.\n\nAnother problem would be the about of stress they will be put in, also the amount of homework they will be giving and the amount of time they will have to get it done, it will be a big stress for the young students.\n\nFurther more, young student will have a difficult time with weather or not they make the right call on what career they picked. Having to make a big dissension on what career best suit you isn't at all easy it make over think your choose and how hard it will be so on.\n\nThen after you will start to question weather or not you really want to pick that on career or will there be more along the way that best are in your interest and you will know when you find that one career that really chases your eye later on when you know what path to take.\n\nIn conclusion being commit to a career at a young age isn't a great idea, after putting all this though in this dissension it's best to say that it a bad dissension in the matter.

In other word i feel that it would be a bad idea to commit to a career at a young age not knowing what will be the big out come of it all.

It is not just changing it self, but it also changing us and our lives. We dont even realize how much technology has helped us in our lives.\n\nIn our time you dont even need to feel uncomfortable in front of a girl while asking her on the date. It is much easier to just send her a text. Technology have made our lives much easier. We are using technology every day as a helpful equipment and source.

Technology made us feel comfortable and our work to be comfortable.\n\nIt can also do a lot of different things for us.

Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times. Sometimes you have to say what's right in order to not hurt someones feelings from what you said. For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return. Secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later. They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.\n\nSecondly, If you are honest \"all the time\" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher.

In high school the students don't have enough maturity such to take important decisions and consequently they don't know what to do. They have a lot of work to do, therefore they don't going to have many time to other things, like have a job or just have free time. They have to do the work of four year in three years, that means that they have to go to summer school, stay after school, night school and other options. Most people believe that have a early graduation is something amazing, but, do you know exactly what this means?. Only the 5% of the students have the chance to graduate in three years instead of four years. If the students are constantly under pressure they going to suffer stress. A survey show that after of their graduation the majority of the students don't know what to do with their life. Is a fact that the high school is not a easy stage, for that reason the students can not doing possible finish their education before. The stress is a real problem that always affect the students and their grades, with stress they don't can have a relax life and peace with themselves.\n\nThey have to take really important decision, like if the student want to go to college, get a job, or to be president of the United State, the students have to think in the future, they have to know what way they want to take. Of course, the aim of the education is give to the student the help to discover really who they are, and depend of the students to take everything learned in the time of their education and put in practice after high school, in their new life. The normal four years in a high school give to the student the chance to acquire enough maturity for the real life. After high school they have to start their life, a real life because they have to be independent, because now they aren't kids. In this time they can understand what they want in the future, what it's fine and what it's wrong, what are their abilities and how they going to develop their skills in the real world, because in this stage they are still young people and the majority don't have idea of what they want to be when they will adults. This time help to the students to growing up, physically and as well their way of think and their perspective about the life. Is a very difficult task to decide what do you going to be for the rest of your life when you are still an adolescent, and if you have to take this decision before of the normal is more difficult, because is easy dream but also the students have to be realistic about the options.\n\nIf a student have the chance of finish the school in four years, what is the hurry?. You have to still work in the important days like holidays, The majority of the student decided not finish the high school before, because is not a task easy, you have to do the same work than the four years, but with less time and that is more stressing because that can to be too much, the students claims that if you decide to have a early graduation, you have to work day and night without a break. Like once Frida Khalo said: \"The life isn't a race, there are time to everything\". If the students are always working in the school, how they going to have a job in the afternoons for have extra money for the things that they want or how they going to have fun with their family, their friends, if they don't have time to be free, to be adolescents. The student have to live their moment, just we have to enjoy each time of the life, the good, learn of the mistakes and live the life. The school is not a race, exist enough time to go step by step. Why hurry up the time in the school if this is the most important in the life of each student, here is where you find yourselves, and is not a good idea to be with a lot homework, test's, projects and many things more, that is too much, is not necessary suffer that. yeah, no vacations if you want finish early.\n\nJust care that they enjoy the school, because study and learn new things, had to have interesting and funny, not something that destroy your life. It is not normal that the students suffer of stress. The stress can to provoke several consecuenques in their lives such as, nutritious problems, sleep deficiency, they can be angry or tired all the time and in extreme cases the stress carry the students to the suicide. They don't had to have high amounts of work to do, they have to follow the normal process if they want. The students have to carry out their own speed for doing the things, they have to learn that it's fine to go slow. Researchers believe that one of the more important and worry problems that the adolescents confront is the stress.\n\nYou can do whatever you want because you have time, but you only have one life. Also they don't can live with stress that is a consequence of have many homework to do, the school is one of the most important things in the world, but have to exist a balance, and the work of the school cannot to be all that you have to doing in that stage. But also their duty is enjoy their youth, they don't are adults yet, that's why they can and should have time to have fun, to make memories with the people that they love, they do not have to start before on time, and take important decision that going to mark their whole life is they are not ready to do it. For these reasons, is that the programs that allow high school students to graduate early, can affect more than do better the life of the students, the duty of a student of high school, of course is have success in their apprenticeship and develop their skill on the better way of they can. You can take your time, make mistakes, start again, learn many things. Now you know, the life isn't a race, there are time to do everything.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

Tecnology is really making the none educated people life horrible, not only for the none educated but also for the educated people. I remeber when I was aroung thirteen years old my grandfather use to tell me that tecnology would take over the world and leave plenty of people out of jobs. In my opinon, the limitaion of human contact due to use technology has a positive effect on peoples life because, just few years ago a human made robot has took twenty four of the worlds scientist, And I can't imagine how much more we would lose if there is no limitaion to tecnology.\n\nFor example, everyone does't have a satisfied education so accepting a limited contact to technology won't have a disadvantage for a lot of people. That shows enough amount of peeople will have their jobs. And as it's limited each person gets almost equal amount of use to communicate or compute with others without getting in debts in life. Just to begin, limited contact due to use of technology makes life easy for each any type of person living at the moment.\n\nAnd the chances to survive or escape out the car is really low. their is also a higher chance to have a horrible accident with those technologically moniterd car because they are human made and humans make mistake. As researchers said because of the material the car is made of, the chance of the car catching fire has increased. For example, Tesla the self driving technologically monitered car is one thing to worry about. next, for the safty of the people technology that includes making self drivng cars should stay away from humans.\n\nFor example, like nowdays while trading, things get shipped but before all of that people used to walk from one country to another or had hourses to travel. Some say, technology made humans survive longer because for example, it helped humans make cropping faster and It created chance to communicate to any country to make it easy to survive by trading in and out. However, before technoogy made it to the headline like nowdays, humans beigns survived for plenty of years without knowing what technology was. Therefore, technology can not be something human beings got to depend on because before the technology came human beigns have made this earth easy to survive but the hard way.\n\nIn conclusion, to protect this earth and to make it more survivable technology should be limited before mistakenly made mad robots get cretaed and make human being go instinct.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher. By the wrong person you talk to, you might accidentally start a riot.\n\nLastly, you should be careful on how honest you are to people, because you don't know whether they are going through some stuff you are pointing out to them. Being truthful to someone and saying everything to them might make them upset on how you view stuff in the world also. Honesty is like an opinion that may cause someone that went through something upset them drastically. This is why I disagree that honesty is the best policy. From the situation you are in say respectful stuff towards the person. It might make you a better person if you are not saying negative things towards a person too.\n\nIn conclusion, I disagree with \"Honesty is the best policy\" by the situation you are in with the person and what they are going through.

Community parks, state parks , and national parks often provide a variety of interesting activities. Some of these \"interesting activities\" includes a Play area, Hiking, and Skydiving .\n\nIt's also healthy for the kid he can get some exercise. One of these Interesting activities I listed are Play areas or also called Playgrounds. Why is this activity so enjoyable? They're mainly used by Children under the age of 12 but they're useful in some ways especially if you don't wanna watch over your kids you can just go to the nearest park and leave them there playing while you sit in a chair doing nothing. well because it's where kids can go outside and spend some free time with other kids and they could possibly find a new friend to play with.\n\nThe other activity I mentioned was Hiking. Community parks don't have hiking spots however, state and national parks do have some hiking spots. Hiking is fun it's a way to have a fun time with nature but sometimes you might encounter an animal that could harm you like a grizzly bear or a rattlesnake it could be a bad day for you but usually you don't so most of the time it'll be a gold experience.\n\nThe last activity I mentioned was skydiving it looks scary but when you get used to it it's pretty cool. Skydiving is a great activity if you're not scared of heights otherwise it's not gonna be good for you. Many people enjoy skydiving because it feels like you're flying and plus it takes a lot of courage to go skydiving.\n\nIn conclusion parks these activities are enjoyable for most people. Playgrounds are great for children but not for teens. Hiking is great if you want to see what nature has in store for you but not great if you encounter a grizzly bear. Skydiving is also great for people who have the courage to skydive. Overall these activities I just mentioned are pretty great for parks mostly national parks but also good in community and state parks.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

Also, it will make our country become better, and it saves lots of time for students. A few weeks ago, my sister said, \"Afterschool homwork club is very helpful and it helped me a lot when I was seventh grade.\" I agree with the idea of establishing homework club in my school for many reasons.\n\nSecondly, students can directly talk to their friends while they are working on their homework. It is not only make them happy, it also makes their parents happy becasue we are like the treasures of our parents, so if we are happy, our parents will be happy, too. To summarize, homework clubs are very helpful for students because that helps students to get good grades, studnets can directly talk to their friends while they are working on their homework, and they can get help by teachers if needed. One of the reasons I agree with the idea of establishing homework club in my school is because it has many benefits for students. Lastly, students can get help by the teachers whenever they need. Firstly, it will help a lot of students to get good grades on their test, classwork, homework,.... and that will make them feel happy and love school even more. Students also can stay afterschool and discuss about their project if needed.\n\nWhile establishing afterschool homework club has many benifits for students, it is also better for the future of the United States. It is better for the future of the United States because the amount of people will get good job would be increased, so the U.S. will get more money. One of the character in the movie I watched before said, \" Your future is based on what you did in the past,\" so if we study well right now, we will get a good job in the future, and that alo helps our country to become better. Another reason is because the number of good grade students in our country will be increased. Overall, establishing afterschool homework club will be better for our country because more people will get good job in the future, number of good grade students in the country will be increased, make us proud of our country. Lastly, when we talk about America, everyone will think about the land of opportunities.\n\nBest reason for that is becasue they can join some outside activities, and that will keep students stay healthy, stronger, and don't get tired during school. One of the reasons for that is because students can finish their homework early, so when they get home, they don't have to do anything. Although establishing afterschool homework club is better for the future of the United States, it also saves students a lot of time. So, establishing afterschool homework club will save students a lot of time becasue they can finish their homework early at school, they will have more time to enjoy with their family, and that will keep students stay healthy. Next, after school, they can enjoy the rest of the day with their family or they can do whatever they want.\n\nNext, it is better for our country, and it also saves a lot of time for students. I agree with the idea of establishing homework club in my school because there are many benefits for students who have difficulty in certain subjects, or who want to finsh their homework ealry. Afterschool homework club will be best friend of many students, including me. Many students say that establishing afterschool club has many disadvantages, but they are wrong.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times.

For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return. Secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later. They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.\n\nSecondly, If you are honest \"all the time\" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher.

Schools should let students learn for 10 hours in 4 days.\n\nStudents would have longer class time to have more touch on activities in a science class. Students with less time in class struggle on test day where they only know the main points in the units and not all the points where an extended days with more class time would have time to teach all the points. Teachers would review more on the unit for students to understand it better. The school would not be behind on teaching they would be ahead on teaching. One, reason why schools should extend the school day it would let students learn more in their classes. The students would have less homework from having more class time to do it.\n\nStudents could sleep in Friday morning and not have to worry about waking up and going to school. Students would also have time to catch up in school work if they missed a day and do it over the weekend. During the long weekend students and teachers could spend more time with their family. With the three day weekend students and teachers could even have time to go on a vacation. Teenagers that are old enough would have time to work on weekends. students also have time on their weekend to play sports or be active. students struggle throughout the week about tests and homework but having a three day weekend would help them recover from all the stress. Second, reason why having an extended school day for four day is a good idea students would have a longer weekend.\n\nThird, reason although students would have more time in school students would not have time for themselves.\n\nTeenagers that are in high school that would prefer to work would want to drop out. Students could not take it any more with the stress their grades in their classes would drop. Students would not have time for sports throughout the week. They would have a tight schedule and would rather skip school then go to school. Children in the elementary school would be tired waking them up early and picking them up late from school kids should not be forced to learn for so many hours.\n\nTeaching and learning 10 hours just for 4 days and having a long weekend for students and staff is a idea we all should consider doing. I agreed having a longer school day and a longer weekend would help students learn more in their classes, have longer weekends, but students would also struggle to find time for themselves.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times. Sometimes you have to say what's right in order to not hurt someones feelings from what you said. For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return. Secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later. They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.\n\nSecondly, If you are honest \"all the time\" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher.

A music, a drama, and an art classes.\n\nTake one of this classes during your school year, it is beneficial because you will have the opportunity to have a better job and find one easy. For example: you choose an art class and you learned to draw beautiful designs, and one day an enterprise announce, that they are looking for some one who wants to get an extra job. You saw the announcement, there was the opportunity to get the extra money that really benefits you. This classes can also help you to get an extra money during your life even though, you are not interested in this specialty. Like this opportunities can make you more fundamental in life. The job is about to do some designs for their next collage. Elective classes gives the opportunity to those students that are willing to learn and have more skills in life.\n\nI say helpful because I got A's and it helped me to get my GPA up. Some students like me choose those classes for this reasons. And if these classes were required to take I could not be able to complete the classes that I need it. Some students chooses this classes because they are easy, funny, and helpful. It was a fun class, and when I played each cord made me felt relaxed because after all those hard classes I finally got into one that engage me. These makes them to get every day to the class with positively and with more effort. Last two years, I took a music class. This year, I decided to not chose an art class because I wanted to complete all my subjects and get the advance diploma, that was my goal. And it was guitar. It is better to have this classes as electives because that gives you the opportunity to select the classes that you really need.\n\nAn this is a great opportunity to start gain experience in a major field and see if you are good on it or you should start to think to be something else. Be able to chose, the classes that makes you feel confident is it one big step in your education. Some students wanted to get their major in one of the art classes.\n\nIt was great that he realize that at time. He realize that he is not good in that major field. For example: one student decided to get a major on music and he is really sure about that. In his freshmen year, he select the music class. The fist day he was happy but by the second class he was insecure about that class because it was hard for him to read the music papers, so he decided to change the class.\n\nHowever, Some people might say that let the students to select an art class it's not a good idea because every student should have an extra skill and learn something else.\n\nI think that each student choose to learn that extra skill, It is better to have the students to select if they want an art class or not because some of them are not interested in that field and they doesn't put the effort in those classes and by the end, they get a bad grade and that effects their GPA and the chance to graduate.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

When we make mistakes sometimes it could lead to a beginning to a new start or other times it can lead to something bad, but we always learn from our mistakes. No matter how dangerous it could be or how much trouble any person could be in, we are the ones to make the decision of doing something to change the future, we make that decision to try new things every day even if we end up learning from our mistakes.\n\nLawyers can make the mistake of accusing an innocent person during court, yes people can be innocent before proven guilty but what if they were scared to say the truth and turns out they really are innocent. Even if its something you might learn from people still makes mistakes and nobody is perfect, no one can be perfect to the point that never in there lives had they ever made mistakes because majority of the people around the world has made at least more then one mistake and sometimes people dont relies that they have made them. Experts, authorities, doctors, teachers, lawyers, judges, priest, probably even the president, but each and every one of these people that has had a degree of done good in school have made mistakes all the time. people make mistakes all the time some can be for poor decision making but you still learn from everything you do. People all around the world make decisions that are not the best but you get to learn from you mistakes. For example Doctors can make the mistake of diagnosing the wrong patient, yes its risky and dangerous but you learn from your mistakes even if there consequences at the end.\n\nothers can have the decision to help the homeless or be foster parents to help children or anyone out. People all around the world have a chance to have the decision to change the future for themselves or for their country, some people have the right to be able to save lives with some of the decisions people make. Everyday people make decisions even if there small decisions. Some decision can be for good use and others can be for greed, revenge, mistakes, or just a bad decision that could get you in some consequences. Mistakes can happen all the time but its on the person if they want tot learn from their mistakes or not. The reason why people make their own decisions and not authorities it because some people hate having some one to tell them what to do and that is not a hypotheses that is a fact, people genially like doing whatever they want even if its harmful or smart but we end up learning the hard way about everything.\n\nLife is not easy because you have lots of decisions to make everyday with not always knowing the outcome of that decision. For example a man might be going through stage three cancer and just wants people to understand that this is it, no more making decisions because he just wants to go, experts would have probably said take the treatment and be there with your family but it is not the families, friends, experts, doctors decision its the mans decision and his wishes. Experts do not have the right to make our decisions in life because our decisions that we make as an individual person are unique in our own way, people may judge, consequences may happen but it is you making the decision of thinking about what you feel is best for you even if you want make bad ones. Some people have it easy at life because of there decisions and others have it really ruff, experts may or may not understand what someone is going through because they have never experienced it. People make their decisions for so many reasons. No one has the right to make you decisions or you ideas, they cannot tell you what to do no matter how much they want to because i the end its you making the decision to listen or to ignore.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times. Sometimes you have to say what's right in order to not hurt someones feelings from what you said. For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return. Secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later. They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.\n\nSecondly, If you are honest \"all the time\" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher.

Honesty is like an opinion that may cause someone that went through something upset them drastically. This is why I disagree that honesty is the best policy.

Plus us kids don't have nothing to do during our free And if you take phones completely off students will be very upset and will not pay attention in class get caught with there phones out . So policy 1 its a better solution than the other one . I believe you should allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as their phones are off in class. so we just could text friend our parents telling them when they feel sick or something.

Do you agree or disagree that extending more hours of school days are a good thing or a bad thing to do?\n\nHowever, they would have less time to be with their family memebrs. There are some people that like being with their family memebrs a lot and they hate when they have to leave them to go to school, work, or have to travel somewhere far away from where their parents live. Also the students would have less time to do their homework and when they don't do their homework they could get in trouble and the teacher might ask or would say they have to come to lunch and finish their homework or stay afterschool if they didn't do it last night. Students shouldn't be in school for more than 7 hours unless they are staying afterschool because they won't have time to relax at home. And, if they extende one and a half hours than before they would at least have 6 hours or more hours to be able relax at home and then go back to school againthe next day. For example, if students be in school for a least 6 to 7 hours of school days then they would have a least 7 to 8 or more hours to relax at home and do whatever they want to.\n\nIt isn't good for students to learn a lot because it could be bad for students health. Another example is that students would be sleeping in class because the class is to boring and we all get thhat being in school is really boring and they just want to leave and go home to sleep but they got to wait 6 to 7 hours of school to end Also the students would forget everything and then ask the teacher how to help them do the problem and then the teacher could get mad a say \"why didn't you listen when I was giving you guys examples\". It could be bad for students health because when they learn a lot of things during school their brain won't be able to understand the problems its asking or won't understand how to solve a problem and that's when the students sress out a lot and get really mad that they just want to give up but, giving up isn't a way to solve their problems. but if they add one and a half of hours of school each day then the students would just sleep in and come late to school and teachers don't want their students to come to school late.\n\nSo, students shouldn't be getting to much education because then they will forget everything and could eventually, fail a grade or fail a test, class, or even a SOL. The school board shouldn't add a one and a half hour each school days because the students would have less time to be home and it would be bad for student like us to learn so much things during school.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

However, keep some things to yourself if you think it's not positive to say to another. Second, It might make the person feel bad if you do say something harsh to them. Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times. Sometimes you have to say what's right in order to not hurt someones feelings from what you said. For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return. Secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later. They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.\n\nSecondly, If you are honest \"all the time\" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher. By the wrong person you talk to, you might accidentally start a riot.\n\nLastly, you should be careful on how honest you are to people, because you don't know whether they are going through some stuff you are pointing out to them. Being truthful to someone and saying everything to them might make them upset on how you view stuff in the world also. Honesty is like an opinion that may cause someone that went through something upset them drastically. This is why I disagree that honesty is the best policy.

We all pass through a difficult time and we want to talk about it with somebody, but is so difficult to do it because you are scared on what people might think or say about you ,or sometimes people might not trust you. People who influence other people help people open their self to the wold and, they let go that stuff that they had pass through, sometimes there are better ways to do it but, just by talk about a situation that you had pass through a lot of people relate. People who can influence other might feel amazing to know that by helping people they help their self too.\n\nSometimes they just forget about the people, who was there to help them or the ones that they helped on opening their self to the world, and let their problems go away. people kind or personality, is a big argument because, now in days people does not really appreciate what other people had done for them.\n\nSometimes they just start acting different, and their famous self make them someone different just because they wanted the views,and want to become famous. your kind is one of the big word to represent yourself as a influence to people because , you really want to help them and they can relate to you. When you will do something is because you really would like it not because to had fun, for example a lot of youtubers now in days they, had tell the word a lot of stuff because , they just wanted views or they just pretend something that is not true. Sometimes people might relate to their stories and, they might support them and related to them, or sometimes people might not trust them, but in a certain time they had become someone important to the world , sometimes they go over the line, because they had became someone important. Never forget who was there for you and how people related to you a lot of times, because your kind of personality is what makes you big.\n\nOne day when they want to become an influence to others people, people might not want to relate to them because, of the behavior against others. people perspective about others, is a big issue now in days because, people judge them base on their look or the way they act, they just judge them because thats how they were raised, but they are wrong because they are not giving people the opportunity to know them or talk to them, how people might ask for help when they are suffering or passing thought a difficult time, when they do not want to open their self to people because they judge them because of their look However, they are not putting their self in their shoes, because people likes to judge them and, they even think they are bad persons. People never think of is that person will help them even more than they imagine, because that person might be the one who can relate to your problems, and have them solve for you, and of course there is always different ways to help.\n\nNow in days every party can become an influence, but not everyone will relate to your own influence on better ways that you can do it by yourself. In conclusion of this essay is that influence yourself first, and than with your behavior help others relate to yours, but do not expect something from people who does not want to help, expect from people the same way. In my opinion I agree with Albert Schweitzer, because on what I had pass though, and I relate myself that a good example by my own behavior will help me influence others, and in certain ways too.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

And another reasons is that it will also make you closer to your family, you can do fun things, and also camping can teach you a big lesson. If not, where have you been camping is the most adventurous thing in the world. Because it will be a new world to you, you will also see a lot of nature and animals that you think they were only on movies but no they are real!\n\nBut think for a moment, does a phone matters more than spending time with your love ones? First of all, have you ever went to camping with your family where there was no internet at all? If yes, I assume that you went crazy because you can't live without your phone.\n\nBecause a family trip is meant to communicate with each other, to do fun things,and to help each other. For example, you can help each other by trying to pull up a tent or to make fire. Even tho none of you can't, but still it will be a funny moment to look how each one of yall try to make it work. If you say \"yes\" let me tell you that you are really wrong because spending time with your family or friends is really valuable.\n\nSecond, camping can teach you a big lesson throughout the time you spend there. Because it can make you think that living on the woods is not easy. This things make you think that a lot of people around the worlds have to live in this conditions. Because you have to make your own place to stay, you have to make fire to keep you warm, and there is no electricity to communicate with someone.\n\nFinally, you will make a lot of fun things. For example, you can go exploring into the woods to look for some edible food. Or you can look for animals such as a bunny, raccoon, or a big brown bear if you are a risky person.\n\nTo tell scary stories that will make all your little hairs stand up. And if you want to add more happiness to the moment you can join two cookies,marshmallows, and a delicious chocolate. After that fun and risky mission, you can gather with your family in a big circle. Or if they dont like scary stories they can tell things about all the happy moment they went through. That sound good right?\n\nIf you have never been camping before, I think you should give it a chance. And also because I am sure you will like to eat a chocolaty marshmallow cookie. Because camping will give you one of the best memories with you and your family. And it will show you the reality of camping. Right? It will also show you further more into the woods.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times. Sometimes you have to say what's right in order to not hurt someones feelings from what you said. For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return. Secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later. They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.\n\nSecondly, If you are honest \"all the time\" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher.

Imagine not having to wake up earlier in order to shower, eat and put clothes on. Some schools have the convinient choice to let students study from home via online courses or through video. Students could also take courses that are nessesary for them and could help them with things that really are needed for the rest of their lives. For these students learning from home brings many benefits because, students would not worry about getting to school, they would still be able to learn whlile sick, and they would learn at a pace they needed to. Some Students are fortunate enough to learn from their own home so, they wouldnt go through these minor set backs.\n\nHaving to make it on time to school adds an emense amount pressure to a student, because they know that their teacher would be angry for being late to their class, but when taking online courses they would be able to learn from home and not worry about making it on time. Being in a public school is all about timing becuase being late could have you getting lectures for hours on end and could get you introuble with your administrator, which is why when you learn from home you could do it any time through out your day because its an online course and its available at all times, when you also learn from home you're able to take your time on certain activities and such other tasks. First, the students would'nt worry about how they were going to get to school. Depending on the weather that could be even more time consuming, for example if its snowing you would have to warm your vehicle up in order to be able to drive it,and for people who walk to school they suffer the most because they have to either sweat or be so cold on the way to school and on the way back. Students could relax a lot more knowing that they did not have to make those sacrifices to get to school.\n\nSecond, students would'nt have to make it to school even when sick. Some students miss an important day like test days, but when they do they have to wait to take the test and get a zero in the grade book untill they complete the test on what ever make up day is assigned to them. Many schools suggest that students should stay home when sick in order to prevent the sickness from getting every other person in that building sick. When a student takes an online course, they could still learn from home without getting anyone else sick. Missing school could probably be one of the worst things, all because of the amount of work you would have to catch up on. Students that take the online courses are alot luckier because they are still able to learn from bed with any sort of sickness. When students who take online cources miss the test day they could complete it when ever, just because it's online and it won't have to be taken on hard copy .\n\nFor example when a student sits down in math class, the teacher is either really quick or the teacher is really slow. For students who take the online classes they could have full attention of the teacher because every student has one specific teacher assigned to just for them, with this they are able to learn a lot more and are able to move from subject to subject alot quicker. But when online you could have the teacher to please repeat themselves and move at the pace you would really like to. The student who take the online class will also move at a much faster rate, because they wouldnt have any sort of distractions, but would give the teacher alot more attention than they would in a public class. Lastly, the student would be able to learn at he pace that they desire. When a teacher has a class of twenty-plus kids she/ he really cant give you undevided attention because there are so many students in that class. Students who attend public schools know that they dont always move at the desirable pace because their are many others in there learning with them.\n\nThis helps many students that have problems getting to school and home, it allows students to learn at the pace they will be more successful at, and would help when a student is not feeling well enough to go to school. Many of the students wish they were able to take an online course, which is much better than an online school. Some schools across the United States offer students the choice to take online courses from home.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

The world is life and life hits us with unexpected things but you know what we can fight it no matter how hard it hits us because us human beings are more stronger then we think we are. First of all, This world in a way is trying to change us but we can't let it because what ever we are trying to do in life is what we are going to chasing and we are going to keep chasing it because we can do what ever we set our minds to.\n\nThat word motivation is key because that's one of the things that keeps us going in life \"motivation\". Always repeat that in your head and if you don't know what it means look up and read what it says because then you would understand why you do the things that you do, why you behave the way that you behave because you have no motivation and don't think that you have nothing that motivates you everyone in this world has something that motivates them you just haven't opened your eyes wide enough to see it yourself but one day you will and when that day comes you will feel like you made the biggest accomplishment of your life. In addition, Some people would just give up when life finally hits them, they don't keep going because they don't have that motivation in them or they don't have anyone to motivate them and that's why us as humans should come together so more people can have that motivation and so we can start spreading that motivation. Im very grateful for what I have in life and very grateful for who i am today an eighteen year ago high school student trying to do what I'm going to do in the future and not letting the world also known as life take over me.\n\nAll you have to do is stop what you're doing and go find it now. Lastly, being myself who i am today is the biggest and greatest accomplishment of my life because I stood my ground and took on life because if it wasn't for my motivations and would've make it to where i am today and loving the things I love to do. I would says that I had a rough start in life but that the thing most people have rough starts but they come back from it and gratefully thats what happened to me and I'm very very grateful for that. For the people that are still hanging in there, find your motivation find what you love to do because once you find it and love to do it thats your motivation and thats what you can do to get back up again and to be yourself again. It's never to late to start and it's not as easy as you think but it is sure hell worth it. Ralph Waldo Emerson is a wise man and what he is saying in this qoute is very true and I agree with him on it.\n\nand I don't care how tough you are it will beat you to your knees and keep you permenent there if you let it, you, me or nobody is going to hit as hard as but it ain't about how hard you hit it's about how hard you can get it and keep moving forward, how much you can take and keep moving forward that's how winning is done, now if you know what your worth then go on and get what your worth but you have to be willing to take the hits and not pointing fingers saying you ain't who want to be because of him or her or anybody cowards do that and that ain't you.

Energy is very important in our life today. Without energy we cannot survive because most people use it daily, and our businesses rely on it.\n\ncoupled with that workers and students will spend more time at work than usual which seems exhausted than they currently do. That we will be wasting more energy than we usually do. Because if we added the number of hours that we waste on energy that we consume now will be less than the four-day work week which eliminates it for now, also it will be more pressure on the electronic machines than we usually use, which could cause damages and money. First reason I believe.\n\nSecondly\n\nStudents will spend more time in school. some students suffer laziness during school because of that long extended schedule, So adding four more hours to their regular day will decrease their ability to concentrate in class which leads to huge increase in the number of failing students every school year which parents don't which for, other than that we can find alternate resources that have can be renewable or nonrenewable we can use to maintain power. With the current schedule students find some troubles that make them struggle with the time they wake up and leave school.\n\npretty much clean coal technology is based on burning charcoal with using devolved vent with filters that can reduce air pollution. In general world has a lot of renewable and nonrenewable resources that can help us keep the energy as it is for examples: CCT which is clean coal technology. Moreover we can use solar cells to make resources even in case we needed an alternation. Lastly, looking for another sources that have the same quality.\n\nLast but not least, People should try their best to conserve energy and resources to make life better for them and the next generations. extending school and work hours to ten days is a below average solution to solve our issue, but human can find different ways to maintain energy.\n\nHumans beings can be creative if we used his nature to find resources that can make his life easier.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

Should the school follow the model by extending the school days in two hours?\n\nNowadays, the conservation of energy and resources are more common to enterprises and businesses, because these resources are running out very quickly; however, these are companies reflexioning the damage it could happen if they do not put a stop. Many companies have adopted a four-day work week, with each day consisting of ten hours. On the other hand, not only companies are dealing with this new system of work, the schools also are taking the model adopting the same four-days, but reducing the time of learning could affect the students?\n\nIn my opinion, it is a good implemented idea with the purpose to help the world' resources and energy, but I am disagree to cut off to two hours of learning; which I say, we should have more time to study to reach our goals in the future, and having two hours we just are spending time in the schools. Anyway, two hours do not cover up the time we need to study. For example, a student needs approximately eight hours with five days a week; reviewing four assignments a day, which it means for each assignment the student has to take one hour and half to at least stick something in the their heads. Most of the schools, follow a model of teaching of five five days with approximately eight hours each day, but now adopting the new model to conserve energy and saving resources, the schools are taking four-days delaying in two hours.\n\nAlso an implementation with removable energy in the schools can help; for example, solar panels on the school's roof can contribute with the develop of removable energy and save a lot of resources. Thus, the job companies would act dividing tasks like: cleaning rivers, picking up trash, sowing trees, turning off electric plants that expand smoke, etc. Retaking the view of point of saving the resources and energy; we know it is necessary to our lives and our task is to know how to protect them, but there are other ways to protect them without implementing the school day in two hours. For example, the businesses or ambient organization should put in practice a day only dedicated for the earth planet. Arctic countries implement this kind of model, they save the resources and the people work an available schedule of work, that's why Arctic countries have a good life of level and these countries are better known as the most beautiful countries to visit and live. In my opinion, this is the correct way we should implement without changing none schedule in the schools or businesses.\n\nWorking in the tablets at home, it will not really help students learn as much as in the school they do; most of the student even not use a tablet to work because they are lazy or probably they do not know about the topic and need a teacher, but it wouldn't be possible because two hours it is not enough time to learn. That's why I am disagree with this model to conserve energy and resources that can be solutioned with other ways as I said before. As I said before, the school does not need to extend the day into two hours; anyway, the school is not violating any kind of penalties, delaying the time school it's just making the students release at home early, spending the time in games or simply dealing in the streets with no trusting friends, instead of being in classroom getting knowledge and finding out new things that can help them to build the goals in the future.\n\nI believe that everything it's possible, and if we really want to make a difference with the removable resources we can deal with it, without affecting the schools; so leave the students they can spend more time in the school, not spending the time the rest of the day without doing nothing. In my humble conclusion, the schools should work every time because it is where the students create their own future and it is the only place where most of the time it's safe; therefore, extending the school's time to two hours, we just get waste of time and not enough time to educate to the students. On the other hand, the energy and resources as we know that they are a vital to make the world works; there are another ways to deal with it without affecting businesses, factories, enterprises, and the schools with the limited hours of study.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

Technology has a negative effect on people's lives because barely anyone wants to talk in person anymore, However, they want to use their cellphones to talk on phone. Technology has a negative effect on people's lives because people don't communicate in person anymore.\n\nTechnology helps us find everything but without communication with a teacher, tutor, or a manager to help us. Technology gives you all the information you need to finish any task without asking a question to a person. Technology allows people to complete many tasks without having contact with others. Technology helps you with each step you need to do to finish your work, project, or research. Technology helps you understand how to do things on your own.\n\nThe most important thing of all this is that people would forget how to communicate with one another. The effect that technology has on people is negative because people get addicted with their phones and computers. People would only use technology to get things they want so they don't have to walk or drive to the stores. People can check out books, shop, and play games without speaking to another person. People wouldn't leave their houses anymore because there would be apps that deliver your things to your house in hours or minutes.\n\nTechnology has a negative effect on people's lives because people don't communicate in person anymore.

Is online school and video conferencing beneficial for students then regular school. The last reason why the should not do online school and video conferencing is that the student could cheat on any thing like for references test,quiz,exams and the school wouldnt have a clue if it was true or false. The first reason is that the student could only learn and talk to the teacher.\n\nTeacher could be rude and disrespectful and might teach to fast or to slow. The student would only learn and hear form the teacher and wouldnt hear any one else thoughts. The student might not be able to know want the teacher is talking about. The student might be afraid to tell question or comments to the teacher. The teacher might be frustrating the student without even knowing. The student might just walk away from the computer. That why i think that one benefit you will lose in online school. The student would not get help from any one else but the teacher.\n\nThe student could leave at any time and not have to do the hours of requirement the students in school have to.\n\nThe only thing the online teacher could possible to is the the corporate about this issue. The student would be able to do any thing because the is no one there to tell the student want to do and want not to do. The student could take the computer were ever they want. so for example the could be doing the school work in fast food restaurants,library and other place and the teacher could tell them what to do. Here a example the student could be on their phone have their tabs open the teacher on the other side of the screen would have no clue. That is another issue that only online school will have and not with regular schools. because the student wouldn't care at all.\n\nthat is a another reason what you can do in online school that you cant do in regular schools. In school he couldnt cheat because the teacher would see them doing. There is a lot of thing the student could cheat on like here are examples home work,quiz's,exams and test. There are many situation for the student to cheat it could help the or there family or it can be bad of them but ether way it is still bad to cheat any way. But online there could be a friend or family member help the cheat on the test so they can pass and help their family out in the future. The student could cheat without the teacher knowing at all. I will give you a example a student is doing a test and dose not want to fall because their family needs him to pass to help them out in the future.\n\nyou could go were ever you want to go. But that is my over all thoughts on for why not to have online school. that only person you could talk to is the teacher. That why i think that they should not have online school or video conferencing then regular school. You could cheat on test, homework, quiz,ects. I think they should not need to if need they should but that they only reason i know of.

They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.\n\nSecondly, If you are honest \"all the time\" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher. By the wrong person you talk to, you might accidentally start a riot.\n\nLastly, you should be careful on how honest you are to people, because you don't know whether they are going through some stuff you are pointing out to them. Being truthful to someone and saying everything to them might make them upset on how you view stuff in the world also. Honesty is like an opinion that may cause someone that went through something upset them drastically. This is why I disagree that honesty is the best policy. From the situation you are in say respectful stuff towards the person. It might make you a better person if you are not saying negative things towards a person too.\n\nIn conclusion, I disagree with \"Honesty is the best policy\" by the situation you are in with the person and what they are going through. May cause them to dislike themselves in a way you wouldn't know.\"\n\nExample essay 2 of score \"3.0\":\n\"CURFEWS SAVE TEENAGERS\n\nBy Generic_Name\n\nCurfews are a great way to keep teenagers safe and out of trouble.\n\nTeen teenagers who spend too much time on the streets are more likely to get in drugs, curfews will prevent teenagers from spending too much time in the streets.

They are reasons in why they take elective classes. Should students be required to take a class in the arts, or should such classes be electives? Some people believe that students should be required to take a music, a drama, or an art class. Yes students can take those classes because they have the right and no if they do not want to but they have the right to take any others electives classes too They can choose those electives because they like to draw things, sing and act in front of people, or they can choose any other electives classes they want to take.\n\nStudents are required to take them to help them know things that they did not about those classes. They can get to know things in music like how to play an instrument or how to sing correctly. First reason in why they they should take elective classes, is because they need them to fill up their schedule. Students can get to know how to draw and color in many different ways in art class. They need to take them after they are done with their principal classes like math, science, and history.\n\nStudents have the right to choose their electives classes but not that the counselor gives to to them, because they might not like the class they give to him/her Second reason is because they need to have points for their GPA, for their high school diploma. and they might not go to that class or they might not do anything. Some electives classes will help in the future, like if you take computer information , it will help you if you take a career in computers. Out of those elective classes can come out musicians, artist and great actors in the future but we do not known.\n\nThird and final reason in why students need to take elective classes is to have them entertain so they can get things off their minds and worry about other classes. In my opinion, students often take electives classes because they still need some classes to graduate, but sometimes no because they already have all the credits that they need to graduate. Students can take them to have fun and make memories, like me that is my last year in high school i like the electives classes that i have chosen for my last here and i'm having fun in those classes because i like them.\n\nElectives classes at the end will help us with some things to remember in the future. In conclusion students can take those electives classes but if they do not want to they can take other electives classes because they have the right to. But in the end, students have to take them to gradute and so maybe they csn have fun being in those classes. Students are required to them to fill up their schelude and to graduate. Some students take them because they like them and they would like to know more about them. Those electives classes are good for you because you get to learn many things out of elective classes.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

Students also have a life outside of school that they have to keep up with and manage like their friendships. Students should not be expected to commit to a career by the time they get to high school. Going into high school is a very hard transition for all students especially mentally because they have to adapt to lots of new things.\n\nChoosing a career at a young age is not the best decision for students its a very important choice that stick with you for the rest of your life. They should have time to try different course that they are interested in during high school and not choose right away. It would be too early for students to know what they want to study. Waiting out the four high school years would be the best decision because they would still have time to take different courses and see which course they are really interested in. They would feel forced to choose a career that they really don't want to take. Their still young and have to develop their mentality.\n\nMost of the time students dont know how to overcome those family challenges. Transitioning into high school is really were all the dating and friendships start going on. They get overwhelmed by things going on outside of school that it gets hard for them to be focused in school. It's a very hard thing to manage between school and friendships. Besides school students have a outside life that they have to deal with good or bad. Every family has something they have to overcome and it takes a toll on students. Friendships and dating also take a toll on students because everything is so new to them that they dont know how to deal with it.\n\nAdapting to a whole new environment that you've never been in is a very hard thing to do. Not only do they mature and develop, but they also have to adapt to a whole new environment. It's too much stress for a young developing brain students tend to mature the most during their high school years. During the transition of middle and high school students start to develop and mature their brain. Choosing their career when transitioning into high school would not be the best idea. It would be too much for a young student to have to choose a career. They start to re think their actions but still dont make the best decisions.\n\nIdentifying a career by the time you get to high school is not the best idea for students. It already takes time for students that are about to graduate high school to choose what they want to take as a career. Choosing a career while transitioning into high school is a very risky thing to do that should be wated out till your last year of high school. Their is things that go on in the outside besides school that students need to overcome.

I'm disagree because they still too young to get a career and they just enter high school, and to be in career is a lot of responsibility, and they still need to learn more to be in career, because learning a career is like they are learning a job, and to learn about a job that you want to do for the rest of your life you need to know more like they did just enter to high school you need to learn more and be preparation and i think the grades has to be A, B, C, I think that how their grade has to be and when they grade are good and they are passing they can be in a career when they are in 10 grade but not in 9 grade\n\nFirst they are some students that just enter to high school and they still don't know about responsibility, and career is a lot of responsibility, and it's only for junior and seniors and when they are in\n\n10 grade if they had English 10 they can sign in for a career, and get ready for a career, and they can choice what ever career they want like be a nursing, mechanic ,and etc and they can choice like to career and what ever they say that they can choice they will study for it.\n\nSecond if they are 16 years old they can choice a career, but if they are not 16 years old they can not choice a career they are still young but still like 50% of the students in 10 grade they don't give them a change to be in a career like me they did not have me a change I want to be a nursing but they did not have a change, and now i think i will to college and study to be a teacher or I don't really know because at the same time I think \"I want to be a famous\" like try to be in a movie or I don't really know what career i want to be in I'm junior and I still don't know what career I want to take because they did not have us other choices to study about, I wish we could had other choices to study in school not like nursing because other students that they want to be other things, but if we application to be a nursing it doesn't always have everyone at school a opportunity, they are some students that they want to be nursing and they applicate and they don't have them a chance but if that students doesn't study more, they will not have him/her the opportunity to study for nursing so my opinion is that they should not allow students that they just enter to school get a career.\n\nthird I think that they should talk with them about career before they are in 10 grade and ask them if they are really to sign in for a career and they should think about what career they want to be in, but they are still young they should not be in young age if the are 16 years old or older them 17 they should allow to choice a career, bu if they are not older them 16 years old they should not allow what career they want to do they should talk to them about career but leave them choice a career.\n\nMy opinion is that they should not let them choice a career because they are still to young and she know what career she want to be she want to be a soccer player she is good in soccer so that's why they should not allow thme selected a career first they had to show respect to they teacher, family, and their self. and they need to know more about responsibility like they should start learning about responsibility my best friend Generic_Name she is in 9 grade, and she know about responsibility she take care of her little brother and she is so nice and good friends they should be more 9 grades like my best friends that they already know about responsibility and they are 9 grades that they don't even respect the teacher and their family so that means that they still don't know about responsibility, and they should respect the teacher and their family because that show that they know about responsibility, some students that they enter to high school they don't respect even students from 10, 11 ,12 grade\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

That is why I feel it'd be better to have 4 years of school and take things nice and easy. If you take 3 years of school you might have to take classes during summer, may not be able to take elective classes, or might even have more school hours. I don't think it's a good idea to have high school for 3 years and graduate early. I believe that 4 years of high school would be a lot better because by then you'd have an idea of what you'd want your career to be.\n\nI'd like to start by saying, if you have 3 years of high school you'll be able to graduate early but probably won't know what you want to become, you might not even have an Idea of what you want to be. That is why it is better to have more time to be able to find out what we/you want to be or at least get an idea of what that is. I'm a junior this year and I still don't know what I'd want to be if it's either becoming a mechanic or becoming a doctor and those are only 2 careers out of the many there are.\n\nIf you did have electives your going to most likely have more school hours so that would mean less time at home, less time with family, and if you work you'd have to work late. You can graduate early but will have more hours of school. Also, if you have 3 years of school you'll have to think about the classes. Your going to have to take all your required classes first meaning you won't have many electives. So, you have to think about how a 3 year school would operate.\n\nI hope I made you think about your decision and making you agree with me, that it's better to have 4 years of high school instead of 3. You might also say \"I get to work now\" well..... your right, but you can be working while attending school either way. So Finally, you might be thinking \"If I have 3 years of high school that means I'll be able to graduate early and be able to attend college early,\" but then again like I had said before what if you don't know what you want to be, it's better to take your time and think things through and know the classes you'll need in college.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

My cousin has showed wisdom and experience to me by telling me things like \"don't do this because things could happen.\" and like \"listen to what people say.\" The thing anyone tells you is important because if you make a mistake then you could remember what he said, you wont have to experience what other people go through if someone knows what it's like, you could end up in more worse stuff then you could already be in.\n\nOne reason I think it's important to learn from experience of others is that if you make a mistake then you could go back and remember what that person told you and be like \"oh I should've listened to them.\" I've noticed that my family really cares and don't want none of their children, niece, nephew, cousins, anyone to be in a bad situation. He wanted me to be safe, and not be in danger. When my cousin told me this then I knew I shouldn't be doing bad stuff like he did before.\n\nWhen you want to do things you know that is bad then ask older family members if they have gone through it for then they could tell you, and you could probably reconsider before doing it. Another reason I think it's important to learn from experience of others is that you wont have to experience what other people go through if someone explains to you for that you won't end up making bad choices. so I knew that I should listen to him and not risk it. My cousin told me multiple stuff he has done and he warned me about it.\n\nAlways remember what your family is telling you because then you can end up telling your kids or little family members that you'll end up having. The stuff that could end up happening to you could most likely end up being bad and you don't want that. A third reason I think it's important to learn from experience of others is that you could end up in more worse stuff then you could already be in. My cousin always told me \"think first\" it always stayed in my head, that certain saying. When you choose to do something bad,first think of the consequences.\n\nJust think what your doing and choose what's best for you. Maybe life is different for others but you need to trust what people say because it could influence you in life somehow. These are reasons why it's important to learn from experience of others. Your family knows what's best because they have maybe gone through it. Do stuff that is good for you.

How can we show love when we did not love our self first ? Now that was about our appearance but how we can say about how we really feel about it, well famous people do you really think that they are honest with us? However, that is what we like to see and we wanna be like them buy whatever they have, live how they live, and just try to be \"perfect\" how we think that they are, but what about our feelings or their feelings.

And it's hard because something you have to pretend be someone completely different just for your job, school, family, and everyone around you because you're afraid to lose their company or what they bring to you. So, when we thought about what how can show the world who we are we have to think \" do I really be who I want to be\".\n\nIn my opinion that is why \"to be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment\". And that is how our world works, is complicated but that is how we live and not because we prefer it, is because everyone have a different concept about freedom, and most of them thought that they can make you and dont let you make yourself.\n\nSincerely, Ralph W.

It also helps them to build a stronger relationship since they both come from different backgrounds. The program will help both group of students because ,they can have things like competitions, and also they can both learn from each other and also achieve the goals they have planned for that class in particularly, if they work as a team. A Program That Benefits Both Older And Younger Students. Older students have more experiences than the younger students, which makes it easy for them to handle problems.\n\nFirstly, such a program will benefit both older and younger students because, they can have things such as competitions. They make sure that, they value their time and make their books their \"best friend\". Both students will try their best and put in much effort because, either they want to be ahead of each other or they want to succeed in that program.\n\nThere is a quote that states that \"Education is the key to success\".\n\nWhen students try to compete with others, they learn harder to attain their dreams and also to make people believe in them. Such competitions make students learn harder and also makes them successful.\n\nSecondly,such a program will benefit both students because ,\"they can both learn from each other\".\n\nLearning from each other benefits both of us, especially when we know about our likes and dislikes. That alone will help us learn from each other because, we will not like to work with each other without getting to know ourselves. When we realize we are from different places, we will be interested in knowing a little bit about each other's background and how we do our things. For instance, if i have been paired with someone who is three years older than me to do an assignment, it makes it easier for us to complete the assignment. It is because, we are both from different backgrounds and also raised up and trained by different people.\n\nLastly, both students benefit from such a program because, they can achieve the goals they have planned for that class particularly,if they work as a team. For example,if one person will be able to carry twenty out of fifty books then two people will be able to carry all the fifty books or even more. However, since they both have the same purpose they will decide to work together to help each other reach their goals. The students have goals and dreams they want to acquire in life. There is a quote i remember that says that \"two heads are better than one\".\n\nConclusively,both students will benefit from such a program because,\n\nStudents can be assisted by people who are old,young,or even of a different race or gender. The effects of a program that helps both old and younger students to pair up and help each other has been listed in the essay above. they can compete against each other and put in much effort to reach their dreams, to also learn about each other and to help each other strive for their goals.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

Study's show that students who identify a career choice by the time the enter high school, are more likely to succeed in the future.\n\nThese courses can be hard at times, but never give up. For example, they should choose a career that pays well, and that makes them happy. First, students should choose a career that benefits them. Giving up will not help you reach your goals in the future. The courses they need to accomplish there goals will be provided by the school.\n\nSchools should give opportunity for students to win scholarship money for college. For example, a doctor is a high paying career choice for students, so schools should have the resources, and courses to becoming a doctor. These choices can range from high paying careers to low paying careers. It can help pay for their college, and pursue his, or her career after high school. Next, schools should provide courses for the students career choice.\n\nsometimes the even don't have enough teachers to teach the course. These are some of the disadvantages to having students pick their courses, by the time they enter high school. For instants, some schools do not have enough resources, and courses to becoming a professor. However, students might want to change there career choice,after starting their courses. Schools may not have the courses, or resources for some career choices.\n\nyou can take online classes, if there isn't a teacher to teach your career choice. some schools may not have the courses, but you can transfer to the ones that do have the courses, and the resources you need. After starting your career choice, you can change it after 1 year of experience.\n\nChoosing a career early helps you to focus on school work, and on your future. These are some of amazing reasons to think about your future, and to choose a career by the time you enter high school. In conclusion, I believe that students should identify a career choice by the time they are in their freshmen year. Because giving up will not help you accomplish your goals. Giving up should not be an option.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

The hard part was when the summer was over and we start school again that I didn't remember anything of English at all. Some people said that summer projects should not be designed by teachers because students will not have time to learn things that they want to learn by their self, actually summer projects should be designed by teachers because teachers will designed specific projects to help students prepare for the next school years and students will not forget what they learn before because they will continue learning. but I learned some words on my English class. 3 years ago when I was new in this country I din't know anything of English I remember that the school year was almost done and my English teacher din't assigned any books to read. For the next summer my counselor talk to my new English teacher and told her that I need read a lot in English. That help me a lot to improve my second language skills I din't forgot anything at all.\n\nHowever students can do all what they want to do when teachers designed projects for them. For example, students got very stress during school year and they want to make something fun like watching TV, playing video games, and go out with their family. Students will not have the opportunity to design projects for things that students want to learn. Many people said that summer projects should not be designed by teachers because if teachers design projects for students. Students have the all day, so they can do the projects that teachers assign them to do and have fun.\n\nWhen the student is back to school and he get a higher math class he have a struggle year on that class because the teacher didn't assign any project for the student during the summer. It' hard for students to create their own projects to learn. Also teachers should design projects for students because students don't know about the new classes that they will take. Teachers know what things students will need to know and how hard that class is going to be if the student is not prepare for the next year. First reason, teachers will design summer projects that will help students prepare for the next school year. For example, some students are very bad at math and they don't get any project designed by teachers during the summer.\n\nThe projects that teachers design maybe will be on computers and students can take 10 to 15 minutes to work on projects, so they were learning and having fun during the summer. Some students are very far away from home because they are on vacations, but they can do everything from where they are. Teachers designed projects will help students to continue learning during summer that can make ease for students for the next year. Teachers designed projects it will help students to review things that they learn and not forget a lot because students will continue learning. Second reason, teachers should design projects for students because that will help students to not forget what things the students learn in the year before.\n\nI think if teachers don't assign summer projects for students they will not study. Students can't designed summer projects because students don't know how hard that class is going to be. Teacher know what the student need and the summer projects will help students on summer. That's why I think teachers should dessing students projects. Also students will continue learning as they're doing the projects that the teachers dessing for them to do. In conclusion, teachers should design summer projects for students because that will help students prepare for the next school year.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

I think this true because there are alot of distractions in school and students do not realize that those distractions could be the cause of the reason as to why they are not learning and possibly why they might be failing their classes.\n\nAlso, walking into class late not only ruins your learning time but it also distracts others who are trying to learn. Another reason why students could benefit from being homeschooled is that, There would be no attendance policy and you get to learn things faster. I think this is true because, There are always those types of students who always arrive to school/class late and have already missed out on half of the lesson only beacuse they couldn't get thereselves up in the morning just to get to school. If you get home schooled you are also learning things faster, Because, you don't have anybody holding you back from you learning time and you get to move on in a faster pace then others; For example, Say if some students cannot figure out how to complete a lesson, It just makes it slower for the class because everyone has to understand the subject in order to move on to the next portion of the lesson.\n\nThe reason why I think this is true is because the amount of time of learning that would be set up at home would be diffrent at home then at school; for example, students might get to comfortable at home and might think they can get up from bed at whatever time they please. Since the student is are very familiar with their enviroment at home, it would be very hard to pay attention and listen to what you are learning only because you are distracted of your familiar surroundings. Another example of why a student would not benefit from going to school at home is because, the home school student would be distracted by their surroundings. However, Reasons as to why I do not think students would benefit from going to school at home.\n\nIn Conclusion, These are all the reasons and examples as to why I think should students benefit and be allowed to be homeschoold.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times. Sometimes you have to say what's right in order to not hurt someones feelings from what you said. For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return. Secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later. They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.\n\nSecondly, If you are honest \"all the time\" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher.

Life is not easy so a lot us by wasting time in school we need to stop because it not going to be easy in the real world when it is our time to go out there and shine. School is very important and some of us children need to understand that and stop wasting the Teachers time. But some times the teachers need to show us children some more respect because we deserves it.\n\nI love track & flied i run track for my school and i am telling you it is no where near easy. Track will let you have sleep less nights because your legs is so cramp you cant even sleep you just have to stay up all night and cry and ask god why is he doing this to me. yes this is what i work so hard for. And in the future i would like to become a track star because track is what i love and it pay a lot of money also. But if you really want something in life all you have to do is work hard because one day all the hard work going to pay off and best to believe it is going to pay off because god got our back and he will always do. But track is so hard because it take everything from out of your body, when you are running track will make you want to give up on life and quit track will, make you feel like you are less than people, track will make you want to kill someone if someone say you are not good, But the best part about track is when you win races at your track meet it will put a big smile on your face and let you say in the head so just work hard to your goals if you want to achieve some thing go in life.\"\n\nAssign it a score from 1 to 5, in increments of 0.5, based on this rubric:\n- A 5-point essay demonstrates native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n- A 4-point essay demonstrates facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n- A 3-point essay demonstrates facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.\n\nFirstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times. Sometimes you have to say what's right in order to not hurt someones feelings from what you said. For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return. Secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later.

For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that \"honesty\" and \"truth\" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher.

people but i believe that by giving examples is not the only way that us as human we can learn from, because as humans we have many special abilities of learning, we can learn, and inluence our selves on what happens in our lifes all the good moment and the bad moments that we go through we influence our selves from them for example like being caugh stealing or breaking into a private property that puts our lifes in a bad situation we can go to the jail and from being in jail we can influence our selves to became a better person.\n\nSchools and teachers should make more tours to students, and take them to the most sadnes, and poorly part of the cityes where people sell drugs, where there is a lot of crimes, the streets are full of trash, and people living on the streets to show them and at the same time encourage them that if they don't push their selves in school, they will end up like these poor people, students will learn and change their minds and take more seriously school, because us as humans we have the power to control our minds, and change the way we think, and when students see this poor people living in extremely bad conditions and surrounded by all types of cimes but not just that they understand that their lifes could end in any moment because there is no police that could protect them when they are being attacking this tours may be a good way to influece students to study and prepare for their future with a wealthy life.\n\nI believe people can influence their lives in many ways like being in prison for a minory charge, prison is a good way and a good place to influence and encourage people to change their lifes for good, and help them take good decision when they get to being free again for a second chances in the real world, but while being in prison people can learn so much because if they did not get any kind of school teaching i believe many prison allowed prisoners take some school for the ones that are trying to remake their lifes and when they get free prisoners will be more prepare and ready to not waste the second chance of being free prison can influence people for not comiting crimes again because people will know that being in prison is not the best and smartes way to spend our lifes in earth thats why prison its a good place to influence people.\n\nA good way to influence people is making programs or activities with peoples that don't have legs, or some of them arms but they still can do a lot of things and a lots of them don't depend on any others to have a life but this will influence people that have a complete body we complain about our body its imortant to teach people that no matter if we an arm or a leg we can still have a normal life sometimes we say that we can not find job or that we can not do sertain types of jobs when people that don't have a comlete body can find job this progrmas it can influence people to not complain anymore because we have everything while people that don't have legs can still do everithyng without complaining.\n\nExamples of life behavior its not the only way that can influence people, theres many ways that can make change a person's life, like being charged with crimes of stealing, punching someone, or entereing in a private property, and being sentenced for a couple years in prison, or can encourage their lifes form others that don't have a total body because when they born without a leg or arm thats why i believe that examples of life behavior can be a good way to influence people but it can be more ways to make people change their lifes and take

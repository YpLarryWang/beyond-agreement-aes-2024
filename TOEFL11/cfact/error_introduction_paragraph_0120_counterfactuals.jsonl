As the title suggests young and old , we can say that young will have more capability and ability than old to enjoy the life .\n\n\nNormally older people can not make their way to the above mentioned places bacause it may be because of their age , health and some may not knew also who stay in remote areas about these kind of places and what mostly older people want is to spend their life peacefully-free from all the tensions and most of them will spend at their home itself with their grand children and by some other means . As there is improvement in the technology day-by-day , there are new things for enjoyment like going for drives , spending their liesure time with friends in pubs and resturants , many amusement parks which gives recreation from their daily workload , etc .\n\n\nMoreover as they were young , they are energetic and they have the ability to roam around the places with complete enthusiasum . Most of the young people will enjoy more compared to older people because of stress also .\n It is also one of the factor bacause they have to work all the time from morning to evening with full stress and to overcome that stress , there should be some means of enjoyment which were not available at the time of their older ones .\n\n\nThe boy have many ways and opportunities to enjoy his life as he is energetic firstly and there are many ways for his enjoyment as there is improvement in the technology where as his grand father can not enjoy as the boy does because he is older and his age may not be cooperatative with that .\n Consider an example of a 20 year old boy and his grand father .\n It may be also that he may not be familiar with new kind of enjoyments which were brought by technology .\n\nAs there is more improvement in the technology , there are many ways to enjoy as mentioned in the above paragraphs and surely our next generations will enjoy more than what we are enjoying now as there will be improvement in the technology in the coming years and they will have better opportunities morethan what we have .\n\nOfcourse there are some ways for the older people also to enjoy but their health conditions may not support for that .\n So i strongly support the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do by considering certain factors and examples which were mentioned in the above paragraphs ."}

In today 's world , cars are the main kind of transportation used for transportation on land .\n\n\nMost people prefer having there own cars and it 's easy to see why : methods of public transportation are slow and unreliable .\n First of all , there is the fact that to get from one place to another , you need to have a way of transportation .\n For most people , in the large cities they live in today , it is impossible to get to work or to go shopping or anywhere within walking distance .\n Not very conveniant , nor is it going to work .\n Taxis are usually very expensive .\n So , they need to have a car or a way of public transportation .\n You never know when the bus is going to come and it 's almost certain that you will be late to wherever you 're going .\n Plus , if you go grocery shopping , there is no way you can carry all your bags unless you have a trunk to put them into .\n Picture yourself in a crowded bus or metro with ten bags full of heavy fruits and vegetables , gallons of milk and juice , meat that is about to get spoiled and ice cream that is melting all over the floor .\n This is an example of why at least one car is needen for every family . Metros are usually very crowded and it is very uncomfortable to travel squeezed against people that you do n't even know .\n Also , buses go slow and stop many times for passengers to get on and off .\n\n\nThere are so many cars that it takes you an hour to get home during rush hour when it usually takes fifteen minutes .\n That is why shopping malls and working places have started to schedule service buses which will take you directly from home to work or wherever you are going .\n So , instead of twenty people going to a place in separate cars , imagine how much it would reduce pollution and traffic if all twenty people used a bus to go there . Plus , when you get to work , or the mall , there is always the problem of parking .\n Would n't it just be great to go and catch a movie or get a bite to eat in the time you use looking for parking spaces ?\n However , there is the growing problem of pollution and traffic .\n Also , there is the problem of the oil resources running out , and put that aside , cars heavily pollute the air .\n\n\nFor example , in the United States , carpool lanes have been arranged in big cities like Los Angeles which you can use only if you have more than one passanger in your car .\n Governments that are aware of the pollution and traffic problem are developing methods of public transportation to encourage their people to use those methods instead of cars .\n My opinion is that the number of cars will reduce in the next twenty years .\n So , in my opinion , the rising public awareness of pollution , the raise in the cost for fuel for cars and the development in public transportation will reduce the number of cars in the future ."}

Second , in our daily life , we can clearly observe the necessity for specialists .\n The first doctor you went to would probably be a representative of a person that has a broader knowledge on human body .\n Then you would need a doctor specialized on your problem .\n For example , think of a situation that you are sick and went to the doctor .\n You would expect that doctor to direct you to a specialist for the specific health problem you have .\n\n\nSo , this experience of me from summer internship indicates the possible disadvantages of working on the same topic all the time . Finally , people that are specialized on a topic may sometimes become blinded by the long times of same kind of work they are dealing with .\n In such cases , a broader knowledge person could see the big picture and would be more beneficial to solve the problems .\n When we deal with the problems stated by a department in the company , we observe that the department does not consider the possible causes of the problem which can actually be caused by any other department .\n To illustrate , industrial engineering , which is my major field , requires seeing the big picture in a company as we try to solve the problems in it .\n\n\nIn conclusion , we need both specialists and people having broad knowledges since they are both needed for solving the problems of human beings in the real life .\n So , a clear conclusion that one of the positions is better than the other would be very misleading ."}

Personally , I believe , that it is better to specialize in one specific subject rather than to have broad , abstract knowledge about many .\n When you specialize in one subject , you gain a lot of knowledge and authority on that subject .\n\n\nIf you are knowledgable about a subject , not only can you do your own work better , but you can also help your colleagues or peers with problems they may be facing . Firstly , mastery in one subject can help you with your career .\n For example , in a competitive industry like the Information Technology industry , if you have a good grip on your domain , it will benefit you much more than having incomplete knowledge about a lot of other domains .\n If you have complete command over your subject , you can effectively utilize it to further your career goals .\n\n\nSo not only do you become more popular , you also gain a lot of respect by helping others out . This can lead to other people looking at you for direction or help if they are stuck .\n Specialization in a subject makes you an authority on it .\n\n\nOr Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart , who with his skill in music , gave us so many beautiful compositions .\n Had he not developed his skill in painting to such a high degree , we would not today have been able to exclaim at the beauty of the Mona Lisa .\n Take Leonardo Da Vinci for example .\n Lastly , i would say that if everyone just wanted to have broad knowledge on a variety of different subjects , then no scientific or other development would ever have been possible .\n Or Albest Einstein , whose immense study of scientific phenomena lead to so many inventions .\n\nIn conclusion , I firmly believe that it is much better to specialize in a subject you feel passionately about than to have a lot of unimportant data on subjects you might be just mildly interested in ."}

In our era , the value of everything is evaluated by its image created in the minds of humankind .\n The most popular technique of creating the desired image is using marketing methodologies .\nOne of the most valid and prevailing marketing tactics is advertising .\n Some factions think that advertisements have the power to make products seem better than they are really , while the other factions assert that it is impossible to make a product seem better by making customers deceive thanks to lots of legal legislations and institutional controls .\n\n\nFirst , not all the countries have laws and legislations for broadcasting fair advertisement that reflects the product just like as it is .\n To illustrate , the cream used for decoration located on top of cakes .\n In the advertisements , the manufacturer can use shaving cream instead of cake cream in order to benefit from shaving cream 's durability and viscosity , are there not any regulations about the ethics that should be conducted in the advertisements .\n In that case , producer can make his product seem more qualified in the advertisements .\n As a result , if there is no legal stimulus for advertisements , with the help of spurious counterparts , the product may be demonstrated as more qualified . Because they have the same color , nobody can distinguish the shaving cream that is displayed in the advertisement as the cake cream from normal cake cream , and all advertisement viewers would probably think that it is a marvellous brand to buy comparing to others as no normal cake cream can seem of such good shape and durability .\n\n\nHowever , if there is enough legislation for advertising procedures in a country , it is impossible to guile the customers by giving false information about product or using a counterfeit product , as the manufacturer is aware of the fact that he will be punished by the laws , if he even tempts to do it .\n For instance , in the USA , if a producer wants an actor to give a testimony for his product , it is a must that the actor should use the product for 6 months before the advertisement .\n\nIn summary , in the advertisements it is quite possible to make the product seem more qualified than it is if there are no laws about that .\n So more laws should be accepted in that issue ."}

In spite of the benefits of learning facts , I believe that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts .\n\n\nIn the first hand , I support the idea that understand ideas and concepts in a field ( for instance economy ) gives a overall comprehension of this field and the process that can occur in that field .\n Thus , it allows graduate students that come into the labor market to meet the requirements of numerous jobs even if they did not study certain characteristics of some tasks .\n\nThen , I have the belief that when a student has well understood ideas and concepts in a field , he is then able not only to understand the new events that can take place in this area , but also to learn itself from this fact .\n\nFuthermore , facts may be linked to a fashion in the way of thinking or the way of product goods .\n An illustration of this idea could be the the fact that an American citizen sold a lot of French foie gras because he likes that at a certain period , but still not do that because of a change in both the relationship between the American government and the French one , and the way to consider the treatment of the ducks . Finally , from my perspective , the facts are widely dependant from the time and the conditions in which they occur .\n Consequently , an event that took place in a certain situation or a certain country , for example a major workers strike in France before a change in political majority , can not be interpreted than one in Bangladesh during a very harsch time .\n\n\nNevertheless , learning facts can sometimes be necessary . As a conclusion , I think that it is both more important and useful for the future life for students to understand ideas and concepts .\n However , I admit that learning facts may help a understand concepts either not concrete at all or a little difficult .\n"}

That 's the question that amazes and sometimes confuses the customer and that he goes on wondering for some time .\n\n\nFor example , some years ago a famous industry had for some time its car advertised by a short movie , in which the car was running on the waters around Mount S. Michel , France .\n It was really impressive , but as the car came out in the market , it revealed to be inferior to the standard of the house .\n\nA field especially affected by misleading advertisement is that of food stuff : deli presented as prodigious or incredibly tasty have often not safe origin , or not good taste .\n Marketing is going to look more and more like an art , whose task is not to inform the customer about real qualities of the product , but to make the best of it , to describe it in the most imaginative and intriguing way . The reason that hides behind all of that , you can easily track out : marketing is one of the finest and most expensive business of our time .\n\n\nIt 's also important to remember that a great amount of money is invested in trade by single or group sellers and the effort to have effective advertisements is normally equal to the productive effort .\n\nJust look or listen to the stories and enjoy the glittering tale ! As it happens normally in human life , is possible to find a glance of good just adopting the right perspective : about advertisement , maybe ther will be a time when we should not ask if they are relieble or not , if they tell us the truth or an amount of lies .\n"}

Because of this laws the advertisement world have to be very carefull in the presentation of facts and images and they have developed .\n Over the years , they have developed many tactics for saying the maximun great things about their products without telling a lie but making the consumers think that their products are the best when sometimes its not the case .\n For example , talking about beauty spots in the tv , everyday we can see that in the screen supermodels using cremes and beauty products that they say put the skin or hair in an excellent condition but we are fooling ourselves if we think that using that products it will make that we became as beautiful as those supermodels .\n\n\nFinally , consumers need to be realistic and critic with the actual advertisement world , puting in the balance all the concepts and knowledge they have to determine if a product is as good as it is presented ."}

Cars ' prices have been decreasing slightly in the past few decades : originally born as a super-luxury status symbol back in the end of the nineteenth century , we can therefore clearly state that today cars are a commodity affordable by almost anyone in any industrialized country .\n\n\nFirts things first , since cars are produced and sold even in big , heavily populated countries like China and India ( together comprehending more than one third of the world population altogether ) , markets where once they were unavalible to almost the totality of people , their demanded quantity has risen to the sky , and so the fuel prices : petroleum extracting sites are used in a more and more savage way , but the lack of offer of this fundamental mineral caused , according to a very well known economic law , an increase in its price .\n As of today , even extracting sites placed very far from any valuable market , or very expensive to use , have been approaching by excracting companies ( e.g. in Alaska , in the North Sea , through Oceanic platforms . .. )\n after the traditional sites ' shortage .\n\nIt is my opinion that the oil prices , unfortunately , rise more and more , to the point where cars will be once again an item affordable by , and only by , very rich people , therefore decreasing significantly their number .\n The only solution to this inevitable economic disaster would be to find some alternative energy font ; however , researches in that field have been growing slowly in the last years , thus our energetic future is not looking bright at all .\n\nSome scientist , in fact , even came to think that , if their number is still going to increase over the years , world governmentscould even ban them from using , so to prevent the enivronment , that however , by that day will probably be seriously compromised . Besides , how not to mention the fact that since cars ' use spread around every continent ( and it 's gonna be worse and worse in the short period ) pollution 's effects on global environments have icreased so much ?\n Cars are not what you might call an ecological way of transportation : having more and more of them drinving around all over the world might even lead to the worst solution .\n\n\nTo summarize , I think that cars ' number will grow in the short period , until it will be too much to afford them ( in economical and ecological means ) : since that moment on I believe there will be fewer and fewer of them , even less than today ."}

To conclude , I believe that groups led by a tour guide can be both a good or less good alternative depending on the major aim of the journey .\n In my opinion , if the thourough understanding of a certain monument or place is the objective , then a different alternative should be taken .\n"}

In this regard , it is worth noting that prior to start of the new academic year , AUCians usually gather in organized groups that tend to make orientation to the new freshmans .\n Usually , there are groups that cover wide spectrum of services that include orientation to the AUC campus including classes , labs , library , and departments .\n Moreover , the same groups make the new students familiar with the various extra corricular activities that are available on campus .\n Also , these groups introduce the new students to the university catalogue and related matters such as advising , course registeration , and requirements for joining any specific major .\n Another aspect of devotion of young AUCians are devoted to their small community is that they join certain groups that target alumni and other sponsors in order to provide adequate funding for many of the activities that are arranged at AUC .\n\n\nFurthermore , the cancer club concentrates its efforts on collecting donations to support patients of cancer in their tough struggle with this severe disease .\n Accordingly , it goes beyound doubt that the young students at AUC play a vital role in serving their large community . This is attained via gathering donations from AUC young students and using the same to buy food , clothes , homes , and shelter for the poor people .\n There are many clubs that include , inter alia , help club , cancer club , and hand in hand club .\n During these visits members of the hand in hand club tend to provide the said elders with their needs and try to draw a smile on their faces as a simple reciprocation for the sincere efforts in their youth .\n AUC hosts many clubs that are fully operated through young students and aim at making life better in Egypt .\n The help club is a club that aims at providing the poor people in Egypt with better living conditions .\n On the other hand , and as far as AUCians services for their large community are concerned , it will be essential to highlight the role of the different clubs at AUC .\n Along the same line , the hand in hand club aims at visiting elder people who are hosted in various elder houses .\n\n\nIn light of the above , and based on life examples of the young students at AUC , it can be concluded that young students have feel their belonging beleonging to their societies .\n Thus , they have enthusiasm and dedication to help and serve their communities ."}

In relationship marketing , one makes the difference between the ` waiting time ' , which is the time the client waits before its problem is taken into account by a firm , and the ` solving time ' which is the time needed to solve this particular problem .\n Another way to justify my point of view is to consider it under the professional aspect .\n By choosing specialists , the firm considerably reduces its ` solving time ' .\n\n\nLastly , specialization may require from a firm to have a good internal organization .\n However , if a firm does settle down such an organization , and does prefer hiring specialized workers , its efficiency will surely improve . Indeed , without such an efficient organization , special skills of each employee may not be used as well as it should be .\n\n\nTo conclude , my strong belief is that specialization is a key answer to some persistent economical and political problems .\n A major stakes will thus be to accept the fact that one could not do everything perferctly .\n Afterall , Billy Wilder was probably right when he wrote that ` Nobody is perfect ' !"}

Furthermore , another thesis supporting his view might be that public transport will become not only more accessible but also less expensive .\n The invention of a new form of transportation might as well contribute to a reducing number of cars .\n\n\nDevelopment happens rapidly and the chance that countries like India or South Africa join the club of the developed countries within the next twenty years is more than realistic . However , in countries like China or in other third-world countries , space is not a restricting factor .\n The last point seems to be pretty evident , especially in a country like Germany .\n In opposite , the development of those countries will even increase the demand for high-priced technologies as is the car .\n\n\nAlso the invention of a new form of transportation might not be absolutely out of space but it is nowhere in sight and it would take much longer to gain general acceptance than the given 20 years to have any impact on the number of cars in use .\n\nWhat I definitely hope and as well believe is the fall of prices for public transport and its spread over the world - even in countries where it is not established yet .\n I myself used the car for my way to this TOEFL center instead of taking bus or train .\n However , I am afraid that the car as much more comfortable choice will always attract humans enough to convince people to take it .\n This demonstrates that even the existence of a public transport system does not have great effects on the number of cars used .\n The establishment of a public transport system is by far more expensive than the building of roads . While the public transport system surely is one of the best in the world , streets are filled with cars .\n Furthermore , outside Europe , countries are much more rural than here .\n Germany again serves as a good example .\n\n\nThe statement that the increase in the number of cars decreases is definitly true but this does not necessarily mean the end of an increasing number of cars is close .\n As stated before , though Europe reached a peak which can hardly be increased , in other countries the demand will rise during the following years and outnumber potential decreases in Europe .\n\nThis effect is even promoted by a rising population on the world .\n Though in Germany and in other highly developed countries , the number of inhabitants decreases slightly , the total number of people still increases fastly .\n This will not change during the following 20 summers .\n\nThough I do not appreciate the trend of more cars , I am absolutely sure that it will hold on .

The answer to this question is trivial , somehow the possible customer is convinced that ( this can also be on the subconscious level ) one of the products is better than the other , and therefore remembered only the better one .\n\n\nI think that the setting is the key to making people believe that what you are offering is something better than they have , because it is being displayed in an environment that is better than yours .\n The first proof of this can be found in advertisements that present a setting that is not or can not be real .\n This could be a beach so amazing that it can only be a painting , or a photograph modified using software .\n Another example of this might be the people in the advertisements , most of the women in it are very beautiful and most of the men in it are very handsome .\n What an advertiser is trying to achieve by using nearly flawless characters is to convince us that we can be like them , all we need to do is to buy that new cellular phone .\n\nMost of the advertisements only give information about the best cases , an extreme example could be that how a tooth paste made somone 's teeth as white as pearls from the ocean , in a clinical experiment .\n During the time interval , this information is being transmitted to our brains , a fast subtitle written in a tiny font size indicates that in this experiment some kind of chemical was also used to amplify the effects of the mentioned tooth paste . The worst case is of course when an advertiser claims that a product can do something that it can not in the average .\n\n\nThis situation will continue to become a bigger problem as long as new products are introduced to the global and local markets everyday , because this will increase the motivation for advertisers to do so ."}

On the one hand , it is very important to understand an underlying idea .\n It is an essential ability to suceed in exams and it even enables the further development of new hypotheses or even whole theories .\n It is the base to apply it to new contexts and to connect it with other concepts .\n\n\nFor example , the principle of many basic learning theories , investigated by Skinner , where cited by numerous other researchers .\n The researchers conducted many interesting experiments , resulting in highly useful applications .\n\nI totally agree , that this does not make any sense .\n In the other hand , you can not deny the importance of knowledge of facts .\n Surely , the solely learning of facts was exaggerated for a long time .\n Whole generations of students only had to repeat information without having to prove their understanding .\n I also permit that it is hard work to learn them and it seems senseless from time to time .\n\nIt is not sufficient if researchers have understood a main principle .\n This is all fruitful background information .

Firstly , the tour guide is a trained professional in tourism .\n For example , to go up the Eiffel Tower in Paris , France , it would , on average , take a person 2 hours to get a ticket in the high season .\n\n\nThere is also a social benefit to traveling with a group , as it would be likely that your group consists of people mainly from your home country , and therefore you would be to socialise with them and discuss the attractions you visit , along with the fact that you make new friends .\n\nHowever , some people may argue that having a tour guide deprives them from making their own decisions , and their personal choises .\n Also , it would not allow them to do things that they have always wanted to do , if they visted a certain country , but this can always be easily solved by extending the vacation a day or two , or if that is not possible , missing the certain guided tours they are not particularly interested in .\n\nAll in all , I strongly agree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .\n It 's advantages significantly overwiegh its disadvantages , and I beleive that most people would have more fun if they travelled in group led by a guide ."}

Facts are like evidence in a trial , things that support the main ideas and concepts .\n\n\nThe first example that I can cite is history .\n When we study history we study a large number of facts , dates , events , meaning that we learn a large amount of notions , that we are most likely going to forget in the future .\n The facts are the instruments at our disposal to build a broader vision of the period at hand and to have a general idea of the economical or sociological or religious forces that interacted in that historical moment .\n But all these facts are necessary to understand what happened in a specific period and to analyze the causes and effects that took place in those years .\n Even if we eventually forget the specific dates or facts , we still keep a concept , an idea of what was happening in the past .\n\nOur mind , on the contrary , has the wonderful ability of elaborating information , putting them together and drawing conclusions , in form of main ideas and concepts .\n Moreover I think that it is sometimes even impossible for our mind to store and remember all the notions and information we read .\n Again , we see what is really important : ideas and concepts .

''\n\n\nFirst reason that think that advertisements do n't at all make products better than what they are , is that , what we see can not be true or a right thing most of the times .\n For example an adverisement on tv showing about a new car launched by some xyz company .\n But just by looking at an ad we ca n't predict the way in which a car would be handling at severe turns and bends .\n Well to buy a car we really need to go out to a showroom and have a look at it as well as test drive it .\n Well\n\nWell i certainly know from the response from which iam hearing about the bike from my fellow friends is that the bike was n't even worth a penny . This bike was endorsed by rising sportstar .\n Secondly nowadays a lot of advertisemnt endorsing is done by popular faces like the actors sportsmen and so on .\n In my hometown a lot of people by seeing this advertisement went to the showroom and bought that bike .\n Well i saw an advertisement of a bike recently on tv .\n\n\nIt was so poorly designed .\n Now my friends are complaining to the dealer about their sorry state .\n So i do feel that by just following an advertisement one should not loose his normal senses and end up buying false products . The electronics the engine was the major problem concerning that bike .\n\n\nFor example an actor in my hometown is endorsing a product of personal computer and laptops .\n Additionally people who are making these advertisements about the products as well as those endorsing these products do they really use these products ?\n They would be using products from more famous brands and reputed ones .\n This means that he is sure that the product which he is endorsing is unreliable .\n Well it seems to be an interesting question .\n But recently at a film production unit my friends did see him using a laptop of another brand .\n Mostly we would not find all of the above people who make these advertisements , using these products .\n Hence we should not always look at an advertisement an buy the product .\n\nIn conlusion to the above mentioned points i firmly believe that todays advertisements are no more than a fake piece of information that is shown on television to make money out of the innocent people .\n Thus i believe that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are ."}

It is commonly assumed that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .\n\n\nHence , advertisement makers have to rely on commercial technics that give the impression that their product is not only good , but that it is better than other products of the same category . First , we have to keep in mind the primary goal of an advertisement , which is to attract customers to a specific product .\n\n\nThis unbalanced and biased view on the product inherent value will surely produce a distorted perception of it 's real desirability , making it seem much better than it really is . It is precisely in this process that a gap may occure between what the product really is , and how it is presented to the customers .\n Even if we assume that the advertisement makers are aware of the basic qualities of a product , what is to be understood is that their goal is to make you think that you need this particular product , hence emphasizing it 's qualities and of course passing under silence it 's negative aspects .\n\n\nBut they naturally never mention the fact that these vehicules are much more energy-consuming than non-american cars .\n This very competitive market forces advertisement makers to present every car as they are perfectly fitted for you , which is not always the case .\n But , if he buys it , he will soon realize that his vehicule has a high gas consumption rate .\n For example , american car makers have the tendency to promote their vehicule by stating their durability and their power .\n He then might have the feeling that he made the wrong choice , that the vehicule was not as good for him as the advertisement pretented .\n Hence , if one relies only on the advertisement , he will be conviced that this particular american automobile is a really good product .\n This illustration shows clearly that advertisements are by definition enhancing the apparent value of a product in order to sell it .

Like going to town with friends or to a disco .\n Of course they are supposed to learn it at school but if the parents do not care than the children will keep it the same way .\n\n\nAt last helping your community normaly means working for it as a volunter so you will not gain any money for it .\n Many young people that want to finance their live or have a bit plus will invest their time doing something they will be paid for .\n\nSo they need volunters working for them so everybody can keep the standard of living people now have .\n All these reasons show why young people do not invest enough time into their communities .\n Communities also have a lot of financial problems .\n First of all your community is not just a couple of people living at the same pace on this planet but it can be a wonderfull social network that might help you in hard times .\n If the people giving time to their communities become less things will start to disapear .\n Probably young people than will wonder where the bus went driving kids to school or where the mall comes from where there used to be a park .\n That is only possible if you show that you are interested in your community and realy try to be part of it .\n But it would be so important that they would do so .\n But if you want to be part of it you will have to get to know the people and be part of the team .\n Young peolple tend to believe things would just be given to them without thinking about the work behind it .\n All these reasons make it so important that young people start to learn how to be an active part of community and why it is so important that they start giving time to helping their communities ."}

However , it is very ulikely that this will happen during the next twenty years , and even if it did , that twenty years will be enough to witness a drop in car usage .\n\n\nFirstly , this theory has been enounced many times and new petrol reserves are being found day after day .\n Finally , one has to point out that the arguement that petrol will not be available in a couple of decades is not valid .\n Secondly , new energy supplies are being developped , such as the biometric fuel or the eletric car .\n\nThe car may be cleaner and even potentially out of date in twenty years , but , as far as the proposed statement is concerned , there will not be fewer of them on a global scale , as long as there will be more humans and more economic groath on this planet ."}

It starts from helping your family in its daily chores , taking care of the neighbours ' house while they are away or spending some time in charities organisation .\n\n\nI think this is a very complex phenomenon and linked to a great number of reasons . Overall I agree with the idea that young people do not seem focused enough on the needs of their communities , and I actually think that they are fairly detached from the concept of community altogehter .\n\n\nFirst of all , it seems that our society and culture put a high value on time , especially spare time .\n Partly because modern life is very demanding , partly because the offer of entertainment and outdoor stimulations is so varied , we praise our time as a supreme luxury and feel very frustrated when we can not use it in complete frredom .\n\nSecondly , I think Western societies have developed more and more in a hedonistic direction .\n I think this is particularly apparent in young people , as they claim they right to play and have fun , and resent any request of help or support as a form of injustice . In other words , we feel it is our own right to enjoy ourselves , feel free in our choices and simply follow instant gratification .\n\n\nIt seems to me that there is a general detachment between young people and older generations or people in need .\n These are generally the people that need more time and support within the community , and it would be the duty of the younger generation to look after them . In a dominant culture of self-absorption and pleasure , taking the time to communicate with people that are different , for background and frame of mind , seems unjustified and this leads to another worrying trend .\n\n\nIn conclusion , I think that values that have become more and more present in our societies are now central in young people 's vision of life .\n As a consequence , there seems to be a more selfish conception of one 's use of time and gifts , that unfortunately leads to the neglect of parts of teh community that might be in need ."}

What an important topic !\n As far as I am concerned , I agree that there will be fewer cars in use in the near future than there are today .\n Indeed , the reduction or increase of cars , and their effects on the environment , are mainly discussed in our every-day conversation and political programs .\n Will there be fewer cars in use in twenty years than there are today ?\n\n\n..\n Therefore , cars have to be reduced . The pollution contributes to the global warming and what is the primary source of pollution ?\n These are obviously cars and their CO2 .\n Indeed , we all know that lots of things go wrong around us such like the global warming for example .\n It is terrible , is n't it ?\n So the point is that if we do nothing , we are certainly going to lose our planet and we will have to find somewhere else to live !\n This gaz contributes too to many diseases . Did you know that with this frightening global warming glaciers disappear and that can lead to the disappearance of the Maldives in less than twenty years for instance ?\n On the first hand , the actual trend is that everybody ( the government , households and corporations ) has to take care of his or her environment , and it is going to be a real obligation in the next few years .\n\n\nMoreover , the other transportation modes are developing in an impressiove manner .\n Let 's take the example of Paris .\n We can notice that having a car is totally wrong with all this traffic in the streets !\n At least we definitely know what time exactly we are going to arrive .\n Why do n't we take the bus instead ?\n Driving in Paris can take four or five times more time than taking the bus , for exemple .\n\nFinally , questions of security became so important in our society .\n It is unacceptable . We should reduce the number of cars because of the too many accidents it occurs .\n\n\nI really think that this is the best solution since you can not order people to stop using their cars . They can work with sun or non-polluting oils for example .\n To conclude , I will just say that there is another solution : changing our actual polluting cars to ecological cars , which deeply consider and respect our environment .\n"}

Although the majority of the world 's population lives in abject poverty , those who are capable of giving to their communities are often segregated from those who are in need .\n In today 's world , many youths do not see a valid social reason to immerse themselves in community service .\n\n\nThe only sense of giving that can be felt in my school 's atmosphere is purely caused from the need to `` look good '' on transcripts for college .\n Speaking from personal experience , I find that there is a gradual decline in my own community of youths that refuse to give or help out their communities in any manner .\n Of course , I 'm sure not all of them feel this way , but I truly think it 's safe to say that the majority feels this way . As the president of Key Club , an international community service organization in my high school , I find it more and more difficult every year to recruit new members to replace the ones that have departed .\n I remember when there were about 40 members in the group - now I find that it is even difficult to gather 20 members for the meetings .\n\n\nNonetheless , society 's greed can even prevent the giving of money . Due to this fact , those who can help and give find it extremely annoying to invest their time in helping others .\n Inevitably , most of us in the world have been brought up be capitalists - when we give , we expect something back in return .\n However , when youths help out with their communities , they do not receive something tangible as rewards .\n This is an economic reason why I belive that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .\n Hence , today 's youth neglects to help their communities .\n Every year , monetary donations rise in Key Club as the number of members decline .\n Thus , their only token of help is through monetary means , which they believe is compensation for not giving time to their communities .\n\n\nIt is time that society creates more awareness in young people to be willing to invest their times for others .\n It 's truly a shame to look around and see that today 's youth , or tomorrow 's leaders , refuse to invest their time when they are perfectly capable of doing so .\n Once youths overcome their laziness , fear of helping out , and learn that the greatest reward ( as cliched as it may sound ) is the fuzzy feeling they get from giving time and helping others , it will be the massive stepping stone in getting the world 's youth more involved ."}

There is a common belief that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .\n I also agree that advertisements make the products seem better that they really are .\n\n\nFirst to think about advertisements is their purpose of preparation .\n Advertisements are designed to convince the consumer to buy or consume that particular product .\n For both of the purposes , the product has to be shown to be the best .\n In order to convince a consumer for a product , one should make him believe that he really needs that particular product or make him believe that the product is best at all .\n This brings us the possibility that advertisements may reflect non-real facts about a prodct .\n\nWhen the sales increase , the profit also increases .\n In short if the product seems better , its sales increase and this leads to a higher profit for the company . The producers , who would like to profit more and more , would also agree to display a non-realistic advertisement in order to make the product seem better so that increase the sales .\n Secondly advertisements are prepared to increase the profit for the specific product .\n\n\nCompanies have to compete with each other with respect to their products in order to survive in the market .\n Finally , the third purpose of an advertisement is to help the company to dominate in the market .\n So an advertisement that shows a specific product better that that of another company would make that specific company to win the race among the companies .\n This again shows that advertisements are not designed to describe a product but rahter make it seem better .\n\nIn short , people believe that advertisements make the products seem better thatn they really are , are right to think so .\n A company would not agree to say the truth in the cost of earning less .

Second thing is that cars are thought to be more safer when compared to other two wheelers .\n This feeling is gradually spreading in countries like india where the two wheelers dominate the roads .\n\n\nThird idea is that cars can transport many people at a time when campared to bikes and scooters .\n so these bike or scooter owners also will be trying to purchase cars .\n Also as the prices of petroleum products are going to increase people will think of spending money on cars and have combined transportation rather than investing on individual tranportation means such as two-wheelers .\n\nHence in the near future more number of cars are going to land on the roads throughout the world In this modern world where people are constantly trying to show off it wont be a surprise if more number of cars are purchased .\n Last but not the least many people thik that owning a car is a kind of prestige issue .\n"}

Secondly , the change is unavoidable in virtually all the areas of human activity and people not taking any risks for exploring new things are deemed to be surpassed by the '' risk = takers '' .\n For example , the technics for shoe = making is already very wel established and people in this sector know very well how to produce high quality shoes for low costs .\n\n\nSo the definitoin of success is always pushed furhter in terms of required perfection . The reason is that in any given area , there are many very talented people trying to be the number one ; through improving their related skills and also via obtaining relevant knowledge both of which require long periods of hard work .\n On the other hand , history is also full of famous people who caught the success via persevering in a well = defined field , from army commanders to artists to shoemakers and athletes .\n\n\nBut the process of exploration requierd l There are always new areas potentially very useful for the humanity to explore .\n Although the first man on the earth had naturally to try new thinghs he also had to improve on his skills for not failing = if he had not ; we would not be here .\n"}

The main reason of teenagers enjoying life is freedom .\n Even this often goes along with little fights with their parents , teenagers have the will to create their freedom by prooving that they can be independant .\n The way of enjoying life changes as the children become teenagers .\n\n\nBut even if that is difficult , parents enjoy every little moment of happyness they can share with their children .

To illustrate , suppose a person is well skilled to type on his type machine and is complacent with his skill with no interest in learning computer skills will not meet new expectations of the employer and might loose his job .\n Techonological advances are demanding people to acquire new skills and approaches .\n\n\nIf a person sticks to the methods well known to him and refuges to acquire newer skills donot get increments and promotions in his job . A successful person has the habbit of exploring newways and new things and he tries to put himself in a superior position through his hardwork which is also innovative .\n\n\nIf the person is reasonable in his approach , risks due to new approaches get minimised and he enjoys the fruits of his innovation .\n But we can never discover anything new without experimenting .\n Some people do not dare to risk new changes in their work .\n Rather we can not acjieve any thing in our life without facing that minimum amount of risk .

These are dangers , which are definitely not mentioned in the advertisement , an unacceptable way to distract from dangers in my opinion .\n In fact , this offers does n't represent the real price , because it does n't contain the additonal fees of airports or the extra costs of the fuel .\n For instance , the big air lines try to attract people with cheap offers , e.g. one flight form Munich to Berlin for only 30 Euro .\n\n\nAdditionally , the hazards of the products are n't mentioned .\n Moreover , toy selling companies want to make their toxic products attractive to the consumer .\n All in all , advertisements screw up the reality .\n Mc Donald 's tries to offer its burgers with fotos which do n't view the real burger .\n Finally , false prices annoy the consumer .

Firstly if a person is more widely knowledgable in the field of his own interest , he not only performs well but also is able to put in his own efforts in the form of information to be used more accurately .\n\n\nIf we have not mastered even one subject we can not put in any effort to get something out of our knowledge .\n Secondly like i said dangers of half knowledge are not unknown to us .\n This can also be decisive for the growth of a society on the whole . We do not have a sense of direction in which to proceed also we have to stop in the middle of an invention or discovery because we do not know what lies ahead .\n\n\nLike i stated if it is a cardiologist in question then he would have some knowledge of the whole body functioning as that is evidently related . Finally for any specialization to happen on any subject we start with a knowledge of various feilds related or unrelated which might help in the better understanding our field of interest so the knowledge of all academic subjects is in a way the foundation stone of any specializaion and is therefore a part of the learning process .\n\n\nEventually helping us to mature as an individual , as an adroit in our field and in the growth of society on the whole .

On the other hand , once an idea or concept has been `` obserevd '' and `` established '' through the study of `` facts '' , it provides a medium for understanding of all future factual observations .\n\n\nHence , observation of `` facts '' is both the `` initiator '' and `` distiller '' of concepts .\n\nConcurrently a concept or idea provides the medium for assimilation of large number of facts .\n In this light , it will be fool hardy to see ideas and concepts as opposed to facts .\n Both are inseparable for complete learning .

Therefore , it becomes difficult to keep the interest of the internet-based youth appropriate with that of the communities .\n The process of globalisation suscitates a global village where individuals gain universal attributes and goals rather than interesting with their communities .\n On the other hand , we may acknowledge that there are some current problems to keep the youth intact with their community as well as with their families .\n\n\nYet , we should not ignore that they are also active in especially helping their communities and they find time to helping even if they feel themselves busy and overloaded by the educational or professionnal life .\n Briefly , young people nowadays give time to helping their communities in spite of the difficulties in their globalised and internet-based lives . Consequently , we may consider that young people prefer interesting in private and global objectives rather than communal or social ones .\n"}

However , mainly because facts can be learn outside the school I would agree to state it is more important to understand concepts .\n It is true it is very important to understand the concepts of class , place and territory ( their role , symbols etc ) .\n As a student myself , I feel very concerned by this topic , especially because I am a young researcher and the relationship between concepts and facts is critical .\n For instance , in my own research about the gentrification of Harlem , I am less interested by the facts and the details than by understand the whole process and the trends which drive it .\n\n\nIn effect , how can you understand a concept or an idea if you do n't know some facts to contextualize it for example .\n I think concepts and facts are linked and the reciprocity of their relation is the secret of a good understanding of concepts and ideas . Even if facts can be learned differently than in an academic way , they are required .\n For example , if I do n't know how many people are displaced by the gentrification or in what extent the rents rised due to the gentrification , how can I expect to understand the nature of the transformations occuring in the neighborhood ?\n However , saying the concept is more important than the fact ( as it implied in the question )\nI face a big ethic problem .\n\n\nThe reality is more complex and to understand efficiently an idea , you need to know the context and the facts .

Thus , if I have to choose between understanding ideas and concepts on certain subject or learning facts , I would choose to understand ideas and concepts .\n\n\nThe first reason is because if you focus on understanding ideas and concepts , you can obtain knowledge much easier and faster .\n This shows why it understanding is more important than learning facts . This is because when you try to obtain ideas and concepts to yours , it is easier to concentrate as the process of learning them is fun and interesting .\n The other group is consist of low grades which I considered boring and waited the class to end .\n As you see from my experience , the quality of outcome differs whether you understand ideas or just try to learn facts .\n For example , when I get the report cards from school , I could divide them into two groups .\n The subjects with high grade were the subjects I understood the concepts and ideas very well .\n\n\nThe next reason is that the ideas and concepts you understand remains for longer time .\n In my case , I still remember the math formulas I understand in my high school days .\n This reason is conceivable among people .\n This is because if you understand the ideas or concepts as yours , it can be applied to other areas thereby the formulas or other facts can be used and remembered on and on even you become old .\n\nTo sum up , the two reasons presented above shows why understanding facts is more curcial than just learning facts .\n Understanding facts helps your knowledge be installed in your brain in shorter amount of time with positive attitude towards it , and can be applied to other spheres as well .\n As I have experienced variety of cases related to this statement during my high school life , I strongly agree with the statement ."}

The group could just simply seperate , each person goes to where they want , and at the end of the day meet again .\n When it come to traveling in a group some people may say that the best way to do so is led by a tour guide ; I personally disagree with that oppinion .\n It could also be said that when traveling in big groups , people always want to see different things , and arguments may occur .\n Although having a tour guide could prevent this disagreements by simply following the itinerary set for that day , theres a better way to solve the problem .\n The advantage of this solution is that when a big number of people are together for a period of time , usually arguments happen ; by sending each person on their different way it gives them time to refresh from the enviroment of the group .\n When traveling in a group you want to spend time with your friends , and spending it as you wish ; not having to be tied to a schedule as it is when using a tour guide .\n Most important of all , of why is better to travel without a tour guide , it that having a tour guide babysitting you around the city take away a great part of the social and cultural interaction .\n It 's true that having a tour guide has its advantages such as being taken to all the typical local turist attractions , you will be almost sertain that you wo n't be missing out on any must see places .\n"}

I agree with this statement .\n Advertising is an art , an art of making products seem attrative and perfect .\n It is also the art of convincing the consumers to buy the product .\n\n\nOn TV ads you can see people use , eat the product the company is selling .\n They reach more easily the consumer . They have a lot of means to attract to consumer .\n TV advertsiments are the easiest way to convince a consumer to buy your product whereas written advertisments in newspapers for example are less convincing because they are not interactive .\n First of all I would say adverstiment companies tend to have a lot of money so they can make beautiful , attrative advertisements .\n\n\nIt is an art .\n For example when you see an advertisment for a frozen pizza , the pizza always looks hot , savourous .\n Usually you can see the cheese melt whereas when you buy it and you heat it up it is nothing compared to that advertisment , it is a normal frozen pizza not a home made one . Second of all , advertisments are made to make products seem better than they are in real life .\n\n\nSometimes ads tend to lie about the the qualities of the product for example toothpaste that make your teeth white as the snow , or a soap which eliminates all the imperfections of a teenage skin . Third of all advertisement is a lure for consumers .\n People do not buy a product for its consistency but for the way it looks in the ad .\n\n\nTo conclude I would say advertisement make products seem much better than they really are because it is one of the goal of advertsiment the first one being to sell a product .\n But to sell a product in huge quantities you have to make it special , better than the others , attractive or even emphazise the results of this product ."}

One can tell that today an average high school student , with an average level of education , knows better physics than Newton .\n With so much information accumulated , the urge for the scientists to specialize in one area to contribute to that area gets more and more significant .\n We are living in an age of information , where the human knowledge of its surroundings has boosted and continues to accelerate even more rapidly .\n\n\nFor instance , while most people still have difficulties understanding Einstein and his Relativity Theory , scientists are introducing theories that even extend it , having given a lifetime of study in that subject only .\n Specialization in a specific topic seems to be the only way of studying science professionally . First of all , as mentioned above , the accumulation of knowledge in a single area has increased so much that it is impossible to have some discovery on top of it without having the grasp of all prior information .\n\n\nIn fact , the current education system in most of the countries in the world is so : an introductory undergraduate program covering all the required subjects as a baseline , and then graduate studies specializing in a specific subject with the purpose of academic research . This is of course true to some extent .\n There are many general topics to cover until one has the capacity of advancing to a specialized topic but that does not stand against the fact that academic subjects are now so complex that one can not afford distributing his effort among various subjects .\n Secondly , one can say that it is required to have a broad knowledge of many fields to be able to work on specific topic since scientific fields are highly interconnected and interdependent .\n\n\nWhile each one has advantages over the other , it seems that specialization is nearly an obligation of modern science regarding its depth and complexity .\n Specialization is inevitable and must be pursued by every academician , but also not ignoring the background knowledge of the prerequisite subjects . In conclusion , whether to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects or to specialize in one specific subject is an important question .\n"}

Secondly , the fact the world is becoming more competitive and also a lot more interesting , youngsters are becoming more involved in other activities and their studies rather than contributing towards their communities .\n These young people may have objectives such as going to the best universities or simply enjoying life by relaxing , and in my personal experience , I have never come across a young individual who actually wants to give their time to help their communities .\n\n\nIn conclusion , as young people are not tempted to help the community as it is not enjoyable and the fact they have better , perhaps more important things that must be done , young people nowadays do not give enough time nor effort to helping their communities ."}

The tombstone was awsome at least for me for I was interested in Turkic history .\n\n\nPersonally , therefore , I prefer to travel alone if I have enough time but at the same time , I agree that organized travel can be useful and enjoyable experience if you does not have enough time or if you are not really into the destination of your travel ."}

The known old patterns will only provide the known old amount of success .\n A successful person knows there has to be more than the already achieved .\n\n\nIf a person were successful at least once in his or her life by taking a risk he or she has made an important step .\n Despite of that the person knows how to deal with developments that can not be foreseen , so he or she has no or at least less fear of them .

{"file_id":"1114626.txt","text":"The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide is a statement I can totally agree with and my opinion is based on several factors .\n\nFirst off , the main reason of traveling usually is to explore the place visited , and see the beautiful attractions in it .\n That 's why it is necessary to find a professional and experienced local to guide you to the places because he knows his job and he knows what he 's doing so he would with no doubt take you to the places often tourists admire like : beautiful scenes and natural beauties .\n\nI ca n't find words to describe how excellent were her choices and how greatly were we satisfied with the places we have seen and the activities we 've taken part of , since we saw most of the breath-taking attractions in Giza like : the Pyramids , Sphinx and the national museums in that area where we had this short lesson about hyroglyphs .\n Also getting a tour guide who 's also local can make a splendid combination because you ca n't find someone who 'd try hard to show you places in his town to make you love the place like a local . I remember we met this young woman who was appointed to meet us as our tour guide .\n For an example , I remember when I went with my family to Egypt .\n\n\nTouring guides often accompanied with security guards who 're common and familiar with situations that can cause some tourists a kind of unhappiness , or make them uncomfortable or in worst cases be in danger such as : getting caught in the overwhelming traffic , being lost , get a good deal of disturbance by beggars , or even in worst cases being endagered by tourist-targeting criminals . Second off all , by getting a touring guide you can avoid some great deal of trouble you may face if you were all alone .\n\n\nSo that 's why I do think that tour guides are a must , instead of going solo , getting unsatisfied with what you see and give the place you visit a bad name as a result of that choice you 've taken ."}

In todays world , nearly every product which is offered to consumers , is being marketed with advertisements .\n These advertisements introduce the product to its buyers and demands them to buy it .\n\n\nBecause of these factors happiness of the consumer is usually being ignored .\n For example , when I saw a person who drinks or eats something I immediately feel a bit thirsty or hungry because my mind thinks of an oppurtunity to eat something .\n Secondly , people often expect differrent things from a product , one may want durability but the other may want more reasonable price , but an advertisement should be prepared for every potential buyers .\n This , again , would result in the disappointment of the buyer .\n For instance ; advertisements are being prepared by marketing departments to sell them more and more to make profits , not just to declare that the product is made .\n The increasing number of adverisement-officies and the money in this job also indicates that everything about advertisement is about making more money .\n This fact will affect me to buy the stuff which is being advertised , but probably I would be disappointed becasue I would have bought the think without thinking .

In many cases , young people are not able to get a good education because of their immigration-background or their social environment .\n Unemployment of young people is a hughe problem in many european countries .\n\n\nOn the other hand , also older people are affected by these job cuts .\n At the same time , european welfare-states have to raise the retirement age in order to keep their social systems functioning and financeable .\n\nthey might get the impression , that young people enjoy life more than they do or than they did when they were their age .\n They experienced the cruelty of the World War II and the hard work that was necessary to rebuild the countries afterwards . And that impression , in my opinion , is probably correct .\n When todays old generations were young , in the fourties and fifties , there was not a lot of fun stuff to do in Europe .\n When older people who either have the will to work but do n't find a job or who have worked for decades and are now retired see young people in the streets , hanging out , doing nothing ( except skateboarding , listening to music , playing computer games and shopping ) Of course , this development sometimes causes frustration on both sides .\n\n\nThey have the chance to do things , older people were not able to : they can travel , they can communicate with strangers and friends around the world , they can get to know the world in a totally different way their parents , grand parents and grand grand parents were able to .\n Young people in Europe are lucky , to grow up in a safe and often wealthy environment .\n They have the time and possibility to do sports and ofther fun activities and to enjoy their life - maybe more , or at least in a different way , than many older people do .\n\nMaybe this way of lifestyle many young people have , containing travelling , extreme sports and other ways to test their personal limits , are a way to cope with their `` Zukunftsangst '' , with the scary feeling many youngsters have , that they have to be flexible all the time , they often do n't know , what tomorrow brings them and they are not sure , if and how long they will have a job ( and if they are lucky to have a job , they have to pay for the older people 's retirement , probalby without beeing ever able to profit from this system themselves ) .\n\nGo and have some fun !

The incompleteness of the view , is given by the fact that old people are people with experience .\n This means that they can assess values to certain actions on the basis of their past experience .\n\n\nThis shows that people , during the early stages of life , have plenty of time to dedicate to themselves , to the discovery of new things .\n It is up to their parents to control and administer the so called ` dirty work` , whilst they are free to grow up .\n However , there is the opposite pont of view , which is the one of the statement .\n For example , people usually remember their first kiss , rather than their last . Young people , or at least most of them , do not have many things to worry about .\n If it is true that old people know what things they like and what they do n't , with the advantage of not having to experiment anymore , it is also true that youngsters have the possibility of going through the process of discovering , which is probably the most interesting and fulfilling of all , as it gives you the opportunity of knowing new things and experiencing new feelings , which were previously unknown .\n\n\nIn conclusion , I would say that life can be enjoyed at every stage , when you are young and when you are old , although in different ways .\n The first period of life should be dedicated to discover what you like and enjoy , whilst the last should be dedicated to the exploitation of such discoveries ."}

Generally people which are remebered are those who leave a trace of their life in history .\n Nobody remembers or notice a person whose life has been carried out in an anonimous pattern .\n\n\nFirst of all , nowadays we consider successful people who occupy certain social positions due to their efforts in seeking their place .\n This means that success depends on extraordinary situations carried out in particular conditions : it is finding a new solution , a new idea to obtain something . Nobody would consider successful someone who works in a normal or standard position .\n Nevertheless , this position is regarded as successful when the position itself is exceptional .\n This successful social position varies depending on cultures .\n\n\nHence this will not be differentiable .\n We will not be thus capable of recognising the new into the normal .\n Success is also difference , uniqueness .\n Secondly , people will recognise success only when it is visible .\n In other words new things . If nothing could lead us to distinguish something from normality , we would not be able to determine the difference between the two .\n\n\nTo be noticed as different one idea has to be new , thus risky . This uncertainty has to deal with risk .\n Third , stated that success is based on difference and new ideas , it is also to be said that news find their root in risk .\n Elaborating something new , it is not possible to understand whether it will be regarded as something really new and meet the taste of the others or will just fail to communicate its difference .\n\n\nTo conclude , we demostrated that success comes from difference from normality ; exceptionality and risk .\n As Oscar Wilde said . The last factor is perhaps the essential key for success .\n"}

Do young people enjoy life more than older people do ?\n\n\nFirst , old people have a long experience in life so they know exactly how they enjoy .\n In contrast , young people do't have enough experiences .\n\nFor an example , mybe an young person tried to enjoy by something which is harmful but he did n't know , and after some time he enjured him self .\n But an old one may have an experience with that thing so he will not try it again .\n\nFor example , their jobs , their business , their family , their healthy and other things that the life now required to worry about . Second , even though that young persons have a lot of choises to enjoy but in the sane time they have several things to worry about .\n\n\nOn the other hand , old persons do n't have any thing to worry about except thei healthy .\n\nBut the old one will not care about any other thing than his enjoy and his health . For example , young person go to the gym to enjoy and whil he excersices he remember something that make him go out from the gym and lose that enjoy time .\n\n\nfinally , every one has his own enjoyable ."}

However most advertisements blow this definition completely out of propotion by marketing a product which ends up being radically different when finally used .\n\n\nAlthough one of the selling points of a good advertisement is in some cases to provide a tinge of humor to go with the product , certain advertisements and brands use this to the extent that make their products seem too good to be true .\n Advertisements in various other sectors also mislead users to believe that the product will offer qualities that it was never designed to provide in the first place .\n Various mail order catalogs for exercising systems are also another a clear example of how the end product differs vastly from the advertised one\n\nEspecially in today 's wolrd where common opinion has it that media over powers print , people look to advertisements especially on television , to help them make informed choices about which product suits their needs better .\n Some of the advertisements have caused people to make incorrect decisions due to their assured but unrealistic claims . An example to illustrate this are the advertisements for real estate projects or finance and tax saving instruments and more recently even in job searching portals .\n This dependency may not be large when it comes to everyday products , but in cases of products which are highly expensive and involve large investments , some advertisements can often mislead people 's desicions .\n\n\nA certain degree of humor and make believe is alright I therefore ardently agree with the fact that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .

{"file_id":"1135299.txt","text":"Enjoyment in itself is symbolic for freshness .\n I completely agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do .\n Age certainly is a big factor in determining the freshness at heart to enjoy life at the fullest .\n\nThey are either dependent on their parents or have some support for themselves .\n The needs shrink to bare minimum and emotional support dominates over feelings of enjoyment .\n The most important factor that supports this idea is that young people are away from responsibilities and day-to-day life woes .\n Especially those who enjoyed a lot at a younger age tend to get away from enjoyment in older age .\n Take for instance , in countries like India and Sri Lanka , older people find pleasure in spiritual activities and become more inclined towards leading an ascetic life refraining themselves from enjoyment altogether . Older people are experienced and have families to look upon .\n So their enjoyment is limited to families , colleagues and near-ones .\n Moreover with the passage of time , the feeling of being satisfied with life increases .\n Their domain starts and finishes with their families .\n This kind of independence enthuses them to feel free thereby adding on to the fun in their life .\n\n\nFor example young people can have no limits on eating , say , chocolates , but older people ca n't do so . Other factor that helps young people to enjoy life more is the state of their health , which certainly is better than older people .\n As age advances , the body does not allow all activities to be done they could be done during young age .\n\n\nYoung people , being adventurous at heart , tend to take challenges , make new friends and thus expand their social circle and broaden their horizon .\n On the other hand , older ones do not mix up so easily and rely on already built up relations .\n Thus it is quite convincing to believe that young people enjoy more than older ones . Another argument that favours the statement is that since older people have already enjoyed at some point of time in their lives , so they feel filled and complete in themselves and are left practically with no desire to enjoy .\n"}

It is hard to predict the twists in the market .\n Market in one field can drop down suddenly one day , and all businesses in that field will close .\n\n\nIf a person knows few more things to do life other than his regular routine work , it will be like a change for him , which he can enjoy and have fun .\n You get to know more people around you when to interact , and will help to build relationships between them . Second point is recreation .\n\n\nEveryone should be aware of things taking place in and around his place , his society and nation as a whole . Its a part of our duty to maintain a balance of everything in life .\n Let us consider one example , currently its the trend of computers and technology , and many people will only take up subjects in Computer science and neglect other aspects like Ecology , Sociology and Economics .\n Who should care for the betterment and preservation of nature and nation , if no person is knowlegeable about the least the basics of ecology .\n\n\nGeneral knowledge is required to be successfull in life .\n Only because of this , he is able to start up millions of McDonald 's centers in every busy commercial corner of the World .\n He integrated his knowledge of marketing and real-estates into the knowledge of food-industry .

Another reason that makes more people willing to get a car is given by the improvement of the transportation system pretty much allover the world .\n\n\nThere are many countries , such as Italy for example , where the public transports system is not fully developed , for this reason a growing number of people prefers to have its own car rather than to rely on a way to travel that is not as efficient .\n\nFor this reason more people prefer to be independente when they get around and the car becomes their own shell .

Moreover , this kind of advertisement makes woman want to be her and men want to get her .\n Who has not seen an advertisement that appealed to his\/her own needs and wants ?\n For example an advertisement for a cigarettes company sells a cancerous stick to people by presenting a tan , attractive , and good-looking woman with a glowing cigarette in her hand on a huge billboard .\n Furthermore , I will go a step further and say that I am sure that almost everyone has bought a product because he\/she remembered an advertisement about it .\n\n\nThese advertisements will store subconsciously .\n They are surprised by the fact that the advertisements sold them this product and , more important , made it look better than it actually was .

A very obvious example are the successful doctors .\n Not only these doctors have to specialize in fields such as dentistry , pathology etc. The most prominent successful people today are the ones who are specialists in their respective fields .\n On the other hand , there is no denial to the fact that this is a highly competitive world .\n\n\nIf the marketing manager in the above example is a person with broad knowledge about many academic subjects then he might find it difficult to devise a marketing strategy , which needs core and in depth study about marketing related policies .\n I would support a balanced approach as I feel this can make a person a balanced individual who has enough broad perspective to make effective decisions and is specialist in his own field .\n Similarly if he is just a typical marketing specialist , he may ignore other vital information related to different subjects and end up giving a poor solution .\n If he takes a balanced approach where he is a specialist in his area but also knows about other subjects , he will make better decisions and will succeed in life ."}

I definately agree with the statement that it would be more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it would be for them to learn the facts .\n\n\nFirstly I surely agree with the opinion that students have to learn some facts .\n To be capable to memorise you need to connect the facts and to transform them in bigger pieces , in concepts . As I experienced , the things you remember in the end are not the ones hardly learned and memorised , but the ideas and concepts transmitted by a book or a professor .\n It is obviously important to know certain things but it can not be the main objective .\n\n\nYou are may not able to see the overall meaning of all the factors learned . By memorising numbers and numbers of facts you do n't automatically also understand them and you are not necessarily able to see them in relation to other factors .\n Secondly it is not just important to know things , but to understand them .\n\n\nThirdly , when actually using the the knowledge learned , you need concepts and ideas rather than pure facts .\n Experiencing pain in the knee is not necessarily caused by the knee itself .\n For example if you are a doctor , it does not help you to just know where the knee is but also to be aware of all the different parts of the body that can influence and affect the knee .\n It can also be originated in another part of the body .\n\nWhat counts in the end is the ability of using the knowledge and this is just possible when having a profound understanding of the facts learned .

I agree with the statment that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .\n First , advertisement tend to over exeggerate the effect of the product .\n When you see the advertisement you will be attracted by the slogans or marvel at its magical effect , and you will buy it .\n Here are the reasons why .\n For example , many cosmetics claim in their advertisements that they have speical elements that make your skin white within just two weeks or make your face looks better .\n\n\nHowever , the hair is very artificial .\n Second , the advertisement is a work being thoroughly and specially designed .\n Through the lightening and computer adjustments , the product can be seen perfect in the advertisements .\n There is no way people 's hair can be that perfect , but the company that produces the shampoo spends a huge amount of money on the filming to make you believe that their shampoo is really that good . Take the shampoo advertisement as an example , the model 's hair always look so shining and smooth in the ads after they use the shampoo .\n\n\nFor instance , in a house ads that emphasize on the idea that single woman can live alone happily , the house itself is not that important .\n It is not the product that is apealing , but the ideal lifestyle beneath it that attracks you .\n Finally , the advertisement is often selling a concept of lifestyle , not the product itself .\n It is the wish to live as a happy single noble that makes you want to buy the house . The product can be bad , but as long as you want to have the lifestyle that the advertisement promote , you will buy the product .\n\n\nTo conclude , the advertisement is a carefully designed work that promotes concept and often exegerates the product .\n Thus , it makes the products seem much better that they really are ."}
{"file_id":"1147775.txt","text":"There are various reasons why I hold this opinion .\n A world with fewer cars !\nSounds preposterous now .\n These include population growth , fuel crisis , and popular consciouness about environment . But I think this is going to be a reality in twenty years from today .\n\n\nNow , we see that the number of cars have indeed come down on the roads because people find it more convenient to take a train to office , at a negligibel price , rather than maintain an own car . Then the recourse is mass rapid transport system , which discourage car-use .\n With limited land , there will come a time when we will not be able to find more space for our cars .\n But , we do not realise that land is not growing in proportion to people .\n This has already been seen in Delhi , India 's capital city where Delhi Metro Rail system has been created to deal with the stress that increasing vehicular population was creating .\n Naturally , we would expect more cars to roll on the roads .\n The population of the world is only growing by the day .\n\n\nIn such a case , running a car can be very expensive .\n Thus , it will be very difficult for the common man buy fuel for his car .\n Early signs can already be seen .\n It is becoming increasingly difficult to satisfy the energy need of the world .\n Research on alternative fuels , like biofuels or solar power , is still in nascent stage .\n In India , the price of petrol has been increasing steadily and my family now goes out in car , only when it is really necessary or when all the four of us have to go out together .\n Otherwise , we use bikes or , simply , the public transport system . Another reason why the number of cars might go down is the shortage of fuel .\n Very soon , the prices of oil are going to increase very highly .\n Oil crisis is here for real .\n\n\nThus , concious citizens support such ideas .\n They are also a healthier option in comparison to cars as they keep the rider fit .\n Therefore , some countries , like those in the Nordic region , encourage their citizens to use bicycles which are more eco-friendly .\n The last reason why I think that cars are going to be fewer is popular sentiment against environmental pollution .\n Cars use fuel which increases environmental pollution .\n In that case , the prospects for cars look bleak . This trend seems to be catching up , which makes me believe that it will in future become very popular .\n\n\nFinally , when people become more eco-friendly , they would look for options other than cars , which will affect the prospects of these automobiles . These are going to be scarce because of growing population , in which case cars will not be viable .\n To conclude , I believe that cars are going to become rarer in the years to come because of a variety of factors .\n These include shortage of two resources : land and oil .\n"}

Another reason is that , most advertisements includes creative ideas , which entice various fantasies in consumers .\n Sheer curousity of consumer for that product , forces him to buy and consume it .\n The consumers start to believe that they might come true if they started consuming that product .\n\n\nFor example , a new range of nike sport shoes is being endorsed by a leading soccer player or a complete range of clothes being supported by a famous celebrity .\n As these famous personalities have a very large fan base over the world , it leads to incorporation of blind trust in these brands by their followers .\n Who want to be like their on screen idols in their lives .\n Third , nowdays there is an increasing participation of renouned personalities in advertisements for various products .\n People does not even search for reviews on these products or at least consider the use of these products in their lives .\n\nAdvertisements should display appropriate contents in them , so that consumer is not mis-guided by their curousity .\n Products should consider this so that it may not result in loosing their brand name ."}
{"file_id":"1150906.txt","text":"Although some people , perhaps marketing majors , may argue that a product consists both of its physical form and of the good advertisements that present it , even if they are not so correct , I do not agree at all with this view .\n In my opinion , a product must be judged as good and , of course bought , according to its quality and advertisements should be based on the quality of the product and should not make the product seem better than it really is .\n\nFurthermore , in spite of its low quality , a product of the latter kind is often much more expensive . The main concern of this marketing habit is that low quality products are actually invading the market and the consumers can not distinguish between a good item and an item which is only well presented .\n\n\nHowever , I do not mean that Timberland shoes are a low quality product , but of course , the sole difference between these and the ones that are not presented in the same way , is the price . As an example we can take Timberland shoes .\n In my country I see a lot of people buying them only because they have been influenced by the advertisements .\n Moreover , the shoes with that brand cost nearly three times the price of a high quality pair of shoes you can usually find in a shop , the difference between the two is the misleading advertisements .\n\n\nI could also have brought more meaningful examples but the problem would remain the same , we should care more about quality and the quality-price ratio ."}

Research shows that since the dawn of civilisation , man has been a tourist in a crude sense .\n This is evident in the study of nomads , shifting agriculture and the like .\n The pesipicuous phrase , `` On the move '' has probably been termed after much thought .\n\n\nSo , to believe that this rise will ever decline , is highly unlikely and improbable .\n That goes out to suggest that people will have more time to spend with their families and go out on vacations and using cars people can drive to farther destinations . The automative industry has witnessed a manifold increase since man has invented the wheel .\n Firstly , economic reviews show that living conditions will improve in the future which means people have greater leisure time .\n\n\nEven if the thought is inclinated to the rich , there is another reason to believe why car production will increase .\n Infact , lot of investment is going into making solar cars and better fuel efficient cars .\n Certainly , the expenditure being done on the research is not to never make use of it in the future .\n There has always been a focus on science and technology improving the nature of things and cars are not an exception .\n This suggests that people want to have more cars in the future .\n\nOne would definitely want to own something when one has the money to do so and with the economic development throughout the world , people would like to switch to owning their own cars than using the public transport system . When people have a proportionate rise in income , they use less of public utility services .\n Taking the middle income group as an example , I would like to illustrate that an increase in income always shifts people 's preferences to personalise commodities .\n Lastly , necessity is being combined with luxury in the economic arena as of today .\n\n\nTherefore , I believe that indeed there will be more cars in the years to come ."}

First of all , success can be a relative term , because for some it may mean owning a private jet and having millions of dollars , but for others success could simply be having a good , small business that maintains their family and gives them a decent life .\n\n\nIt takes hard work , dedication , being fully prepared and intelligence .\n There are many key ingredients involved in the process of MAYBE achieving success .\n Just because a person has all those ingredients does n't guarantee them a bright future full of riches .\n Usually people do n't acheive success by accident .\n Most people have worked hard all their life but have n't gotten anywhere they want to go . It takes years and years , and sometimes that is not enough .\n Also , it 's difficult to achieve succes in life , since it requires many abilities from a person .\n\n\nBy just applying his knowledge to the stock market and making smart choices , he can become rich , but he can also lose it all .\n To work hard at you 're craft and make smart moves can equally take you towards success .\n Another important point is the fact that succes can be achieved by doing what a person already knows how to do well .\n Sometimes it 's as simple as that .\n It 's not so much about risk but about making smart choices . For example , if a person studies economics and ends up working at the NYCSE , he can achieve a fortune by just putting to work all those years of studying he did in college or university .\n\n\nSo in the end I do n't agree with the statement given .\n Once you get to the top , the only other way to go is down , sicne it 's not only difficult to reach the top but to be able to stay there .\n Success is never a sure thing , and even if a person achieves it , the possibility still exists that it wo n't last for long .\n Nothing in life is certain , only death and taxes .

{"file_id":"1172599.txt","text":"Within the following essay I discuss if people trying new things and taking more risks are more succesful than people using well established practices .\n\nSecondly I highlight several arguments on the topic before concluding with my own opinion on it . For the beginning I give an principal definition of succes , because it is a question of perspective wether someone is succesful or not .\n\n\nNow my perspective focusses on the economic perspective by earning a lot of money and therefore I definite succes by it . Succes is within a society normally a well conscructed and established value .\n Within Western countries who share the same principles of economy and society succes can be defined as earning a lot of money , having a family or simply being happy , whatever this would say .\n Every value consists normally of an imagination of distinctive goals .\n Instead succes itself is not adequate to a constructed goal but needs to be constructed by each community of people .\n\n\nWhile starting his proper buisness is relatively costly for oneself and is followed by the incertainity of acceptance of the product , it lets some room for creativity and personality .\n The example of franchising worked on earlier this TOEFL fits quite well .\n It is relatively easy to buy the right of a huge company like Burger King and to produce its products but it also highlights the limitations of own freedom to establish something own .\n Additionally new innovative products could be sold for higher price . New products are normally accompagnied by a bigger amount of risks and also by a larger scale of innovativity than established products are .\n By stretching the economic face of succes I need to differentiate between new products and well established products .\n\n\nNevertheless it could n't be denied that you can earn money with both possibilities .\n Perhaps it 's not really a question of succes in this case , but of making it a special way .\n\nFor my conclusion I emphasize on the hope of everyone to have succes that leads people to start something new and innovative against all odds .\n This hope might be imaginative but leads researchers to new inventions and at all humanity to progress .\n By using well established practices you can suceed too and by stretching on the example of new products you need an etablished name to sell products better .

The students ' teaching method is very controversive between the approach focused on the facts and the other more based on the concepts and the ideas .\n\n\nFirstly it seems to me than when a student understands ideas and concepts than will help it to understand the facts .\n Indeed it would be not very interesting for a student to learn a succesion of facts without knowing why these facts are happening .\n For example the history facts are numerous and it is impossible to keep all of them but if you understand the ideas of an special historical event you can learn better all the facts that are associated with this event .\n\nAs a matter of fact , the professor can give to their students keys that will help them to understand the idea .\n The professor can illustrate the facts with personal experiences and therefore making them more interesting but he will not change the facts . Secondly I think that it is easier to learn the facts individually than understand ideas and concepts .\n At the contrary the facts are not difficult to understand and also the support of the professor is not indispensable .\n\n\nFor instance a student that understand well a special philosophy concept can do its own theory about the concept . By identifying the structure of a conceptor a idea , the student can develop its own ideas and build also a thinking system .\n Finally , I believe that the understanding of ideas and concepts for a student is the basis of the development of its own reflexions and also to have criticism .\n\n\nTo conclude I can say that the understanding of ideas and concepts is the most important part of a student learning process , even if it is not unnecessary to learn facts but not as the first priority ."}

In this case , the advertisements warn us the possibility of danger that is caused by using the products .\n\n\nFor example , Yukiguni-maitake , Japanese food products company , uses the conspicuous strategy : Its advertisement says that do not buy its products .\n In view of this , the advertisements sometimes apply unique strategy which does not appeal merits of the products . Furthermore , some advertisements utilize an unique strategy to attract consumers .\n This advertisement is unusual , therefore , many consumers are attracted and finally buy the products .\n\n\nNevertheless , some critics claims that the advertisements ' role is to appeal the products .\n However , the fact , as detailed above , reveals that some advertisements try to prevent customers from buying their products .\n\nIn conclusion , I believe that the advertisements usually use different strategies to attract customers .\n It is clear from my examples ."}

For example in any family , the father always think about how to get money for his children , the mother looks after the children and tries to help her husband financially .\n\n\nSecond reason , old people always start to take care of their health which absoultly goes down as they get older .\n In the other hand , young people think about no resposibilty and no problems with their health , so why do n't they enjoy their lives before anything happens in the future .\n Another man who is 20 years old , who just finished his high school and he wants to play sports and going out with his friends without any health problems thats if we ignore the exceptinals like the handicaps . For example , if someone who is 60 years old and he is retired from his job , he could have health problems refuses him to enjoy his life .\n\n\nAlso , no body knows about his health and how good its going to be .\n I hope everyone enjoys his life whether he is olde or young .

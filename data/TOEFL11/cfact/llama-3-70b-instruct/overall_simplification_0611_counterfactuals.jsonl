I think most ads trick people into buying things without thinking clearly by making the products sound better than they are. There are two main reasons why ads work this way.\n\nFirst, ads can make people believe products are perfect. Many products are advertised by famous people who have a good reputation. If people see these ads over and over, they will likely trust the products.\n\nSecond, most companies don't talk about the bad things about their products. They only focus on the good things to get people to buy. It's more profitable to hide the flaws."}

They also value time with friends more than helping the community.\n\nHelping the community helps both the community and the people who help. Humans are social, so we need to work together.\n\nIn conclusion, we need to get young people involved in helping the community. Schools and parents should encourage this by showing the benefits and not holding people back."}
{"file_id": "100336.txt", "output_essay": "Successful people try new things and take risks instead of just doing what they're good at. There are many reasons why this is true. First, people who take risks are often better at handling new situations and feel more confident when they're out of their comfort zone. For example, when a student from another country moves to a new city with a different culture, they get to try new things like the music, food, and architecture. This not only makes their life more interesting but also helps them think in new ways. When people try new things, they also learn from their mistakes and build a stronger personality. For example, when people know they can try again if they fail, they're more likely to succeed. People have different ideas about what success means. Some think it's about making a lot of money, while others think it's about being happy. No matter how you define success, I believe that taking risks will help you become a successful person."}

But if students learn facts, they can develop these skills more easily.\n\nAlso, to be successful, students need more than just ideas and concepts. They need to learn facts to become successful. For example, most jobs require basic computer skills. If a student learns computer skills, they will be more attractive to employers.\n\nLastly, learning facts helps students become well-rounded adults. If students only understand ideas and concepts, they may lack empathy.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe learning facts is more important than understanding ideas and concepts."}
{"file_id": "102535.txt", "output_essay": "In my opinion, it's better to focus on one subject than to know a little about many subjects. This is because of how knowledge works.\n\nSince the 17th century, many new things have been invented. The information used to make these inventions and the information they provide is growing. No one person can know it all. For example, universities have different departments like natural science, literature, and social science. Each department has smaller sections too. In my university, business administration, economics, and international trade are part of the social science department. You can only study one of these sections at a time, so it's impossible to learn everything at once.\n\nAnother reason is that each subject is very complex. If you want to cure a disease like AIDS, you need to specialize in viruses, which cause AIDS. Knowing about other subjects like optics, psychology, or literature won't help. You can only learn by doing, so specializing is better.\n\nSo, specializing is better than knowing a little about many things."}

Just like a building needs a strong foundation, a person needs to understand things to build a good life.\n\nIt's clear that understanding is more important than just learning facts. When you understand something, you can think about it and figure out what's happening around you. Let's look at some examples to make this clearer.\n\nTake an electrical engineer who has learned about power supply from a book. But if he doesn't understand how it works, he can't fix a problem if something goes wrong. He might even get hurt if he tries to fix it without understanding the basics.\n\nIt's the same with swimming. Just knowing a rule about floating isn't enough. You need to understand how to swim with the help of a teacher.\n\nAll the experts and scientists who make new discoveries don't just memorize facts. They create new ideas and rules because they really understand their subject.\n\nFrom these examples, we can see that it's more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than just to learn facts. This is the only way they can become better individuals and thinkers who can help their country."}

Many don't spend enough time helping their communities.\n\nLet's look at an example in my community. Our local Red Cross facility has fewer members every year. We often struggle to fill our schedules. One reason is that many students and people are too busy. They need to work hard to get a good job or education, so they have little time for other things.\n\nBut if we think about it, we should have more free time than before. New inventions like computers and phones help us finish daily tasks faster.\n\nI think the real problem is how we choose to spend our free time. Every day, we get new ways to have fun, like watching movies or going to new bars. Young people don't help in their communities because they want to try all these new things.\n\nBut these things don't make us feel confident. If people got involved in their communities, they would see how much fun it is to help. In conclusion, I agree that helping in communities is important, and it can be improved if people try it.\n\nWhen you give to others, you are often happier than when you only think of yourself."}

They believe this because society is becoming more focused on individual needs. However, I do not agree with this idea. I think young people do care about their communities because of what schools and societies expect from them.\n\nFirst, schools encourage students to get involved in community service. Many schools offer volunteer programs that give students extra credit or count as elective courses. In fact, studies by the Ministry of Education in Korea show that the number of community service programs in schools has increased by 67% in the past 10 years. Also, student participation in these programs has gone up by 87%. This shows that schools have a positive impact on young people's community involvement.\n\nAdditionally, societies emphasize the importance of helping communities. Communities put up posters asking for young people's help, and society praises those who participate. Young people who help others are rewarded by the government, and their names are published in local newspapers. For example, I saw a poster asking for help to rebuild my community after a hurricane. I decided to lead the team and was awarded by the village representative. This volunteer experience helped me get my current job. My employers said that helping others is a key quality they look for.\n\nIn short, I do not agree that young people do not care about their communities.

This is important because it shows what students are really interested in. I think it's better to focus on one subject rather than trying to know everything.\n\nThe first reason I think this is that when you try to learn many subjects, you can't focus well on all of them. You can't do well in all of them either. But if you pick one subject and focus on it, you can do it well. That's why I think my choice is better.\n\nAnother reason is that focusing on one subject helps you learn new things easily. You can focus on one thing and do it better. By studying the subject, you can discover new things. For example, great people like Einstein spent their whole life studying one subject and made many discoveries. That's why I think my choice is the best.\n\nFinally, not everyone is interested or good at learning all subjects. If someone is forced to learn something they don't like, they won't learn it well. So, it's better to focus on one subject they like rather than trying to learn everything.\n\nSo, based on these reasons, I think it's better for a student to focus on one subject they like rather than trying to learn everything."}

For example, they had a cherry blossom festival in spring, fireworks in summer, a moon festival in fall, and New Year's Day celebrations at the local shrine. Young people would help prepare and clean up after these events. This helped them get to know their neighbors and build strong relationships.\n\nMany young people wanted to help with these events and keep the community spirit alive. This is what my mother experienced when she was young.\n\nBut what about today? When I was a kid, I didn't have many chances to join local events.

We don't use public transportation like buses or trains much. Many people work in cities where there are many buses and trains, but they prefer to park near their office or factory. It's a good idea to start using buses or trains, but there are some issues. To get more people to take trains, they need to be on time and clean. On the other hand, I don't think people will give up their cars. A car shows others that you have a lot of money and a good job. Also, technology is getting better, and this will help us stop using oil and find new materials. So, pollution will decrease. In conclusion, I hope that in twenty years, there will be fewer cars on the road than there are today.

Travel should be fun and enjoyable, and group tours let many people interact with each other and with locals. When you travel alone, you don't get to talk to as many people. On a group tour, you can start by befriending the tour guide. There are many advantages to group travel. First, you don't need to plan your trip or schedule. You can just follow the tour guide and enjoy the sights. You can focus on what you want to see, learn, or hear. Second, group travel is safer. The tour guide makes sure you're safe and avoids unsafe places. If you're traveling alone, you might not know if a place is safe or not. Third, group travel is convenient. You won't get lost or waste money. The tour guide schedules your day, so you can stick to the plan and see what you want. You can shop and eat in safe places, and no one can cheat you. These benefits apply to both domestic and international travel. I especially recommend group travel for international trips.

We need to think about why we travel. Traveling is not about getting stressed. In a group, you can't help but feel stressed. If that's the case, it's better not to go on a trip. On the other hand, traveling alone is better. I can make my trip meaningful, stress-free, and fun. There are some reasons for this. First, I can go where I want.

Some use their time to study and attend tuition classes. Others find playing games more interesting than helping their community. They do not have the same feeling in their heart that people in the past had for serving their community. They do not know that their community will help them when they need it. They should work for their community to make it better and create a good reputation.\n\nFor example, Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi was not called the Father of India for no reason. He suffered a lot to free his country from British rule, which lasted for many years. He did not do it alone. He slowly gathered Indians to support him and led several movements to gain freedom. Finally, his country gained freedom on August 15, 1947, after struggling for decades. Young people should wake up and help strengthen their freedom. They should not take it for granted. So, young people's focus should always be on helping their community, just like Guru Nanak did for the Sikhs.\n\nTherefore, every person in a community should be able to do what their community needs from them.

For example, if you only know a little about many subjects, it doesn't make you an expert. It just makes you smarter. But to get a good job, you need to be an expert.

However, learning facts also has its downsides, like not understanding it deeply. So, we can't say for sure that learning facts is always better. On the other hand, understanding ideas is often underrated. If you look closely, you'll see its hidden benefits.\n\nOne big advantage of understanding ideas is that it helps you think. For example, my parents, who are professors, taught me to understand ideas from a young age. As a result, I developed the ability to think, which makes me more creative.\n\nAnother reason I think understanding ideas is better is that it's more interesting. Many experts agree that interest is a crucial part of learning, and understanding ideas is more attractive and fascinating.\n\nLastly, understanding ideas is easier for students to grasp. Facts can change depending on the situation, but understanding ideas is more straightforward. This is especially helpful for students who struggle with learning.\n\nConsidering all these points, I believe that understanding ideas is more important for students.

Spending all night working on the same goal over and over can make someone's life empty, causing them to lose focus on what they wanted in the first place. Many great thinkers got stuck in their own minds, thinking only one thing was important, like religion or complex ideas. They shut themselves off from the world and missed opportunities to grow and learn. Our minds need to explore and take new chances; they can't be limited. There are many ideas and projects out there, and endless ways to make the world better. Knowing many subjects and having different skills enriches people's lives and opens their minds. The problem is that it's hard to balance growth in each area; it's easy to get distracted, and it's hard to know what to focus on when.\n\nStill, the idea that focusing on one thing is best might be wrong. Looking at Wiles's experience, he couldn't have proved the theorem without knowing a lot about math; if he hadn't looked at old records, other experts might have thought it was useless or not relevant; if he hadn't tried new methods when needed.

I believe that in twenty years, there will be fewer cars on the road than there are today, and I have three reasons to support this.\n\nFirst, if fewer people use cars, it will be easier to solve environmental problems. Cars use a lot of fuel and release bad air, which is a serious issue. Bad air hurts people's health. If people breathe in too much car air, they can get sick. Children are especially weak, and if they breathe in a lot of bad air, they can get very sick. Today, fuel is expensive, and many people worry about money. However, people must think about the environment. The earth belongs to us.\n\nSecond, if people don't use cars as much, there won't be as many traffic jams. Many cities in the world have traffic jams, especially in developed countries. For example, Tokyo, Japan's capital city, has heavy traffic jams every morning. It's a big problem. The Japanese government has built many new roads, but the number of cars hasn't decreased much. I think the main reason is that cars are cheaper, and many people can buy them easily. I think the best way to reduce the number of cars is for the Japanese government to charge a tax on using cars. If they do this, there will be fewer cars.\n\nThird, if fewer people drive, there will be less danger. Getting a driver's license is easy. Not everyone is a good driver, and sometimes accidents happen. If the test for a driver's license becomes harder, fewer people will be able to drive, and accidents will decrease.\n\nIn conclusion, if fewer people drive cars, we can solve many problems. So, I hope that many people will use trains or buses, and there will be fewer cars on the road than there are today."}
{"file_id": "104396.txt", "output_essay": "The future of cars is uncertain. In the past, people lived without cars, but since they were invented, there are more and more cars everywhere. However, I believe there will be fewer cars in use twenty years from now.\n\nFirst, with new technology and the world changing so fast, I think cars will eventually disappear. People get bored quickly and will want something new. For example, I hope we'll soon be able to travel just by thinking about where we want to go. It will be easier, save energy, and save time. Even if we can't teleport, it's clear that cars will disappear as quickly as they appeared. Then, a new and better way to travel will be invented.\n\nAlso, countries are working together to reduce pollution on earth. The Kyoto agreement is a good example of what we want to achieve. Even if some countries aren't following the rules now, I'm sure they will realize the urgency and make an effort. People are becoming more aware that we're acting for the future and the next generation. So, if we want people to be able to live on earth in the future, we need to stop using cars and stop polluting.\n\nIn short, even if I'm not sure there will be more pedestrians, I'm convinced that cars belong to the past, not the future. We'll find ways to travel without polluting too much."}
{"file_id": "103851.txt", "output_essay": "I believe the argument is correct, and the number of cars will decrease over the next twenty years. There are many alternatives to driving a car, and there won't be enough space on the roads for all of them. I'm sure there will be laws in the future to control the number of cars.\n\nToday, we can use the train, a ship, a plane, or public transport to get to different places. These alternatives will become more appealing because of technological progress, which will make them cheaper to use. Many people in Germany, for example, prefer taking the train because it's convenient and always arrives on time.\n\nThe price of oil has gone up over the years, and there's no change in sight. The industry responded to this problem by building engines that use less gas, but the electronic equipment meant they couldn't reduce the amount of gas needed.\n\nAnother reason is that cities will become overcrowded, and there won't be enough space for new cars. For example, in Japan, there's no space for new buildings, and the streets are already too big. One solution is for people to share cars to get to work.\n\nFinally, there will be laws to control the number of cars. The world has many pollution problems, and governments have started introducing laws in fast-growing economies. By doing this, governments want companies and individuals to pay more attention to their energy use. If people change their behavior, one result could be that fewer new cars are bought.\n\nIn conclusion, these are my three main reasons why there will be fewer cars in twenty years."}

There are pros and cons on both sides.\n\nFirst, being an expert is like a goal you can achieve, fulfilling your dream of being the best. It motivates you to work harder. And, of course, experts are needed for innovation. You need time and energy to think of new ways and conduct experiments.\n\nSpecialization has always played a crucial role in evolution, in general, and in human evolution. People became experts and shared the work. They got faster and gained knowledge, understanding, and skills. In fact, specialization is key to our culture; without it, there would be no art.\n\nOn the other hand, experts might be very good in one area but not so good in everyday life. They rely on others, so you can't have a world full of experts. You need people who work together and share their skills. Another important point is having a broad view. If you know various things, you can see how they connect and influence each other. You can draw your own conclusions.\n\nYou can also find surprising answers to problems because you don't think in the usual way. Not everyone is interested in all academic subjects and skills, so they're not motivated.\n\nIn education, I think the best way is a combination of both. You need to know some basic information and gain fundamental skills in every field. But when you find a topic that really interests you and you're good at it, you should be able to specialize.\n\nIn my opinion, you should never stop learning. And nowadays, you can always ask someone if you don't understand or know something. It's important to be a good expert - focus on what you do best, but don't forget to look around sometimes."}

Young people are healthy and have their whole lives ahead of them. Older people, on the other hand, may be sick and know they will die soon. Parents often tell their kids how lucky they are. I agree that getting old is not fun for the body and health, but it also means you have lived a lot and experienced many things. You have found your way, had children, and maybe even have grandchildren. At this age, people have done the hard work and can now relax and do what they want.\n\nHowever, being young is not easy either. The teenage years can be especially tough. It's a time to figure out who you are, fall in love, and make big decisions. Teenagers don't have much experience or confidence, so it's hard. Young people can also be mean to each other, and many suffer during this time. The teenage years are a time of change, and it's not always easy. You lose your innocence and enter the real world, which can be disappointing.\n\nOn the other hand, older people have already lived their lives and have more experience. They know how to solve problems better.\n\nIn the end, I think every age has its good and bad points. But I believe that being young is the hardest because it comes with many problems and questions that we're not always ready for."}

Many products are sold through advertising.\n\nMost products are not as good as they seem in ads. Advertisers don't show the truth. They try to convince people that their product is high quality, but it's not.\n\nFor example, beauty creams and face packs are advertised in an attractive way, but they don't really work. The ads don't mention the bad side effects. Similarly, food and snack ads make false claims about giving people energy and strength. And, clothes don't stay clean and shiny forever like they do in detergent ads. It's all about tricking people into buying their product. It would be better if ads showed the real quality of products. Only a few products live up to their ads.\n\nIn conclusion, I think most ads make products seem better than they really are."}

I agreed and added that it's best to have a group with a plan and a tour guide. I think this is the best way to travel, especially to a new place.\n\nTraveling has many benefits. The most important one is gaining knowledge. When I travel to a new place, I want to learn about it. The best way to do this is to go with a group led by a tour guide. They explain everything about the place, including its history, values, and landmarks.\n\nLast summer, we went to the Greek Island of Rhodes with a tour guide. It was like a museum where we learned about Greek history. We gained a lot of information about the area, thanks to our guide.\n\nThe guide also helped us with other aspects of traveling, like dealing with locals, finding the best places to visit, and handling daily life matters. Without them, these things could be a big problem.\n\nIn the end, I think a guide is essential for a successful trip. They provide important services before, during, and after the trip."}

No matter how much you study the rules or techniques, you can't play well without experience. Many professional soccer players from Brazil didn't read books about soccer when they were kids. They just played for fun and learned as they went. They didn't study physics or how the ball moves.\n\nAnother example is driving a car. I studied car engineering for a month and thought I knew enough. But when I drove a car for the first time, I couldn't do it well. I think understanding an idea is not enough.\n\nThe most important thing is to learn by doing, not just thinking. Yes, there are times when you need to understand ideas and concepts, but you can get that kind of knowledge when you learn by doing."}

Today, we are in the space age because of those brave ideas and actions. When we think about the first time humans traveled to space, the chance of returning alive was low. It was a risky move, but it paid off, and now we can build new space stations.\n\nThere are no scientists who can make new discoveries without trying risky experiments. Edison invented electricity after many failed attempts. He took many risks to achieve his goal.\n\nIn business, companies can be started by taking risks. No one can predict if a business will succeed or not. But there are many examples of entrepreneurs who started their business with loans and had to earn a lot to pay them back. This is also taking risks. Starting and running a new business requires taking risks.\n\nWithout taking risks, nothing new can be created.\n\nIn short, to achieve new things like inventions and start businesses, the first thing you need is the ability to take risks. We are in the space age because of the risks people took. Many companies exist because of the idea of taking risks."}

I will explain why.\n\nFirst, when I travel with others, I'm not free to do what I want. I remember a trip to Guam Island with five friends after we graduated from university. When we arrived at the hotel, I wanted to swim right away. But my friends didn't want to swim and wanted to go shopping instead. I couldn't say no to them. I felt like my choices were limited. I didn't feel free.\n\nSecond, when others are around, I don't get to deal with problems on my own. I think it's interesting to face challenges while traveling, like getting lost. Three years ago, I traveled to New York City in the United States. I wanted to visit Central Park after I arrived. I tried to get there using the subway, but I got lost near Times Square. Even though I didn't speak English well, I asked someone for directions. A kind man told me the way, and I finally made it to Central Park. I faced a problem and found a solution on my own. If I had been with others or a tour guide, I wouldn't have gotten lost. And I wouldn't have talked to a stranger.\n\nIn conclusion, considering these points, I completely disagree with the idea that the best way to travel is with a group and a tour guide. I prefer to travel alone. When I'm alone, I feel free and can go anywhere, anytime."}
{"file_id": "106793.txt", "output_essay": "Since cars were invented, their number has been increasing with improvements in technology. I don't think there will be fewer cars in twenty years. Some people might say that high-tech transportation will replace cars, but I think twenty years is not enough time for that to happen.\n\nIn my opinion, in twenty years, there will be as many or more cars as there are today, but they will not harm the environment as much. A lot has already been done to reduce pollution, and I'm sure more can be done. For example, many European cities are promoting the use of cleaner cars like Euro4 and Euro5, which pollute less than regular cars. This is possible because of improvements in car technology. Every month, new car models are introduced, which are less polluting and more advanced in design, engine, and features. Some of these cars are expensive, depending on the brand, while others are more affordable. Car industries are working hard to make these cars available to everyone, from rich to poor. Governments are also taking action to reduce pollution. They organize awareness campaigns, restrict car use on certain days, and fund electric public transportation.\n\nI believe these are good reasons to think that the number of cars will not decrease in the next twenty years. Instead, we can expect to see many cars on the road, but they will be cleaner than they are today."}

I believe experience, time, and a higher chance of success support my opinion.\n\nFirst, experience helps people succeed in a job. When someone has a lot of experience in a job, they can make the best decision when a problem comes up. They're better than someone who's new to the job and doesn't know what to do. This person can easily make a bad decision. So, successful people stick to what they're good at because they have experience.\n\nSecond, we need time to make our jobs successful. Making a job successful takes a long time. When someone does a job they're good at, they save time learning the basics. Then, they can focus on making the job perfect and becoming successful.\n\nFinally, someone who does a job they're good at has a better chance of success than someone who tries new things and takes risks. When we try a new job, we have no experience and need to spend a lot of time learning. It's risky because we might find out we can't make it successful after spending a lot of time. On the other hand, if we're good at a job, we know how to make it successful quickly and easily.\n\nI don't agree that successful people try new things and take risks instead of doing what they're good at, because they don't have experience, time, or a better chance of success in a new job."}

Some people like to travel, have parties, or go for drives.\n\nI agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do. Young people have more energy and ability to have fun than older people.\n\nThere are many reasons for this. One reason is that technology is getting better every day. This means there are new ways for young people to have fun, like going to amusement parks or spending time with friends at restaurants. Older people may not be able to do these things because of their age, health, or because they don't know about them. Most older people just want to live peacefully and free from stress. They often spend their time at home with their grandkids.\n\nYoung people also have more stress, so they need ways to relax and have fun. They work hard all day and need to find ways to overcome their stress. When they were young, they had more energy and could go out and have fun.\n\nFor example, a 20-year-old boy has many ways to have fun because he's energetic and there are many new things to do. His grandfather, on the other hand, can't have fun in the same way because of his age and health.\n\nAs technology gets better, there will be even more ways for people to have fun. Our next generation will have more opportunities to enjoy life than we do now.\n\nOf course, older people can still find ways to have fun, but their health may not allow it.

{"file_id": "105218.txt", "output_essay": "I don't think it's accurate to say that having a broad knowledge of academic subjects is better than specializing in one specific subject. There are pros and cons to both approaches.\n\nFirst, being an expert in a specific field is very important. Science advances by building on what we've learned from our ancestors. To use previous research and take it further, we need specialists. A person with broad knowledge wouldn't be effective in this situation.\n\nIn our daily lives, we can see that specialists are necessary. For example, when you're sick, you go to a doctor who has broad knowledge of the human body. They direct you to a specialist for your specific health problem. This shows we need both.\n\nSometimes, people who specialize in a topic can become narrow-minded from doing the same work for a long time. A person with broad knowledge can see the bigger picture and be more helpful in solving problems. In my major, industrial engineering, we need to see the big picture to solve company problems. During my summer internship, I saw that departments often don't consider the root causes of problems, which can be caused by other departments. This shows the limitations of specializing in one topic.\n\nIn conclusion, we need both specialists and people with broad knowledge because they're both necessary for solving real-life problems. Saying one is better than the other would be misleading."}

If they try, they won't know much about anything and won't be able to help their patients well. That's why doctors choose to specialize in areas like pediatrics, oncology, or heart surgery. When you specialize, you learn more about that area.\n\nAs I said earlier, you can only do one job well. But your hobbies can also help you with your job. So, you need hobbies that support your job.

The tour guide helps us get to our apartment or hotel and explains things about the city or country because they know it well.\n\nTraveling with a tour guide has taught us a lot. For example, when we visited England, we saw many statues, parks, trees, trains, and rivers. The tour guide explained each one clearly, telling us when they were built, where they were, and how long they would last. We learned a lot and had a better experience of the country.\n\nWithout a tour guide, we might get lost. A tour guide is like a guide who shows the way. A few years ago, when we visited Australia, we thought we didn't need a tour guide. But we had many problems and troubles because of that.

They trusted a dictator, and it led to a war we could have avoided.\n\nNow we know how dangerous that ideology can be, and we need to choose more carefully. But learning some facts isn't always important. Some facts are useless, like in philosophy classes. Some actions affect our lives and behavior, but others aren't interesting for developing awareness. However, studying this raises another issue: we need to learn facts to learn in general. Why? Because everything that seems unimportant means more than you think. We can understand many things without knowing everything about a subject. We can learn about World War Two without living through it. We learn that millions of people died for our freedom, and even if we didn't experience fear of bombs, we can understand what it's like.\n\nIn conclusion, I want to emphasize that it doesn't matter how we improve things.

They want to get good jobs and a better life in the future, which makes them happy. But I think they will forget important things if they only focus on studying.\n\nFor example, they should make time for friends, help others, and take care of their families. Volunteering is a great idea. They help people and learn something at the same time. So, they should make time to help their communities.\n\nSecond, I think it's just an excuse.

For example, take ads for soda. They use famous athletes like David Beckham or Michael Jordan to promote their products, showing how their drink can improve performance. Everyone knows that a drink won't make them a star, but seeing their idols in the ad might convince them to buy it. This can work for small purchases, and people might buy the product anyway, but the ad helps them decide which brand to choose.\n\nAnother way ads make their products seem better is by convincing people that they will look more attractive and improve their personal lives if they buy the product. Take beauty products that promise to make you look better and more attractive for a small price. These ads can grab people's attention because everyone wants to look better for a low cost. Teenagers, in particular, are often drawn to products that can make them look better in front of their friends.\n\nSome products use famous people to promote their products, while others tap into people's small desires and market their product in the best way possible.

You can do this by preparing well, using what you've learned from past experiences, and stepping out of your comfort zone. This helps you build stamina and tolerance, making you stronger.\n\nFor example, I've seen my martial arts instructor do this. He's very successful because he keeps pushing himself. When I first met him, he was just a senior student. Later, he became the chief instructor and owner of the school. He changed the curriculum to do new things, which was a big risk. He added social activities to help the community, which meant hiring more staff. This was a big challenge, but it paid off. Our school became more popular, and we earned more respect and money.\n\nAnother example is Microsoft Windows. Before Windows, most operating systems were based on typing commands. People were used to it. But Mr. Gates took a big risk and created a new interface that was more expensive and complex. It turned out to be more effective and fun for users. Today, Windows is the most popular operating system. Taking risks means trying new things and having the courage to make them happen. Mr. Gates believed in his idea, worked hard, and succeeded.\n\nIn conclusion, trying new things can improve yourself and the outcome. It's not easy, but if you keep trying, you'll eventually succeed."}

For instance, in a conversation or debate, having broad knowledge might let you talk for a bit, but you won't be able to have a deep and interesting conversation. \n\nIn contrast, being an expert in one area allows you to have a meaningful conversation. Additionally, specializing in one subject provides better job opportunities.

But this person might have been negative their whole life, even when they were young.\n\nI believe people enjoy life in different ways and get happiness from different things at different ages. This is because each stage of life has its own tasks. For instance, teenagers might take risks and try new things to become independent and find their own identity. This is normal for their age and role in our society. Some people think this means they are happy, but it's not always true. Some teenagers might not be happy with their life. On the other hand, an older adult with a family and a good job might not look happy at first, but they might be very satisfied with their life.\n\nAnother point is that people confuse older people's lifestyle with being boring and unhappy.

In the United States, most people own their first car by the age of sixteen.\n\nI also think that the growing problem of obesity is linked to the number of cars. In many developed countries, people are getting heavier and lazier, so they prefer to drive rather than walk or bike. It's simply more convenient.\n\nOn the other hand, people are becoming aware of how cars affect the environment. Some people refuse to own a car because they don't want to harm the planet for their own benefit.\n\nI recently watched a TV show that discussed the earth running out of natural resources like oil. If we run out of oil, we'll have a big problem fueling our cars. Although this won't happen soon, scientists are working on alternative, environmentally friendly ways to power engines.\n\nHowever, I believe this will take a long time and won't be available to the public in the next few years.

However, when I used it, I realized I had wasted my money because it was not as good as my usual oil.\n\nI think that just because a company is famous, it doesn't mean its products are always good. For instance, a famous toy company recently had problems with its toys because they had a dangerous chemical in them. This company is famous worldwide, but that doesn't guarantee the quality of its products.\n\nI agree that many ads make products seem better than they really are because companies are competing for customers. So, it's up to people to decide which products are good or not. I think that when companies specialize in making a particular product, it helps people know which one is better because the products become more advanced and cheaper.\n\nSome products may look better than others, but people should share their opinions about which products are good or not. This helps them make better choices in the market and in their daily lives, and it also helps others."}
{"file_id": "112494.txt", "output_essay": "I think the best way to travel is with a group and a tour guide. There are many reasons for this.\n\nFirst, when we visit a new place, being in a group helps us avoid getting lost. We can share our thoughts and ideas with each other and enjoy the site together. If someone gets sick, the group can take care of them.\n\nSecond, a tour guide is very helpful. They know the place well and can teach us about its history. They take us to important places we might not find on our own. They also help us find good places to rest and eat.\n\nThird, we can make many friends on the tour. In a group, no one gets bored because we can have fun together during free time, like dancing and singing around a campfire."}
{"file_id": "105219.txt", "output_essay": "Many of us have heard the saying \"Jack of all trades, master of none.\" The question is, do you want to be good at many things or an expert in one?\n\nPersonally, I think it's better to focus on one subject rather than knowing a little about many. When you specialize in one area, you gain a lot of knowledge and become an expert. This can bring many benefits.\n\nFirst, being an expert in one area can help your career. If you're really good at what you do, you can use that skill to achieve your career goals. For example, in a competitive field like IT, having a strong understanding of your area is more valuable than knowing a little about many areas. When you're knowledgeable, you can do your job better and also help your colleagues with their problems.\n\nBeing an expert in one area makes you an authority. People will look up to you for guidance and help when they're stuck. This not only makes you popular but also earns you respect for helping others.\n\nLastly, if everyone just wanted to know a little about many things, there would be no progress or innovation. Take Leonardo da Vinci, for example. If he hadn't developed his painting skills, we wouldn't have the Mona Lisa today. Or Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, who gave us beautiful music. Or Albert Einstein, who invented many things through his intense study of science.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe it's better to focus on a subject you're passionate about rather than having a little knowledge about many subjects that don't interest you much."}
{"file_id": "111518.txt", "output_essay": "We can't change the real world, but we can change how we think about it. Advertisements are a great way to make us think about things in a certain way. Studies have shown that ads can influence what we think about products.\n\nIn today's world of TV and entertainment, many famous people are created by the media, and we tend to look up to them and value their opinions. Companies take advantage of this.\n\nYou often see famous actors, actresses, and singers in ads. I think that if you're a fan of Michael Jackson and you see him in a Pepsi ad, Pepsi becomes more important to you.\n\nAnother thing about ads is that they don't show the bad things about products. For example, when you buy a microwave, you're not supposed to use it near babies or people who are sensitive to radiation. But you never see warnings about this in ads.\n\nIn short, ads are very powerful in shaping our thoughts about products. Research shows that products with ads are more popular than those without. Companies use famous people to influence us and avoid telling us the negative truths about products."}
{"file_id": "105202.txt", "output_essay": "I mostly agree with the statement, but we need to think about the situation it's in. For example, when it comes to languages, it's better to know a little bit of many languages rather than one language perfectly. However, when it comes to a job, I disagree. In today's economy, it's better to be an expert in one area. There are many educated people who are unemployed because they're not specialized enough.\n\nOn the other hand, knowing many subjects can be helpful if you're running your own business and can't rely on others. A broad knowledge is the foundation for learning more. If you don't know many things, it's harder to learn new things. Especially now, it's important to be flexible and keep learning throughout your life. If you're an expert in one area, you might not want to listen to new information.\n\nIt depends on the person, but I think knowing many subjects is more important than being an expert in one. The foundation is the most important thing. Then, you can still specialize in areas you're interested in. If you don't know all the options, you can't be sure you've chosen the right path.\n\nI prefer knowing many things because then I have all the options. If I specialize and choose wrong, I'll be disappointed. We don't know what the future will be like, so specializing is risky. It's better to know a little bit about many things than to be an expert in something nobody needs.\n\nIn general, I agree with the statement. Specializing comes after having a broad knowledge of many subjects."}

{"file_id": "104966.txt", "output_essay": "I think it's better to know a little about many academic subjects than to be an expert in just one. This can help us in many ways. We can learn more about the world, find what we really love to do, talk to people from different backgrounds, and understand what's happening around us.\n\nFirst, knowing many subjects can open our minds. Each subject is unique, so it's good to know a bit about each one.\n\nSecond, learning many subjects can help us find our true passion. If we only focus on one thing, we might miss out on other interesting things. I took many different courses in Grade 11, like Chemistry, Accounting, and History. I wasn't sure what I wanted to study in university, so I wanted to learn as much as I could. My friend, who wanted to be a doctor, took only science courses because she knew what she wanted. I think it's better to learn many subjects before choosing one, unless you're really sure about what you want.\n\nAlso, knowing many subjects can help us talk to people from different backgrounds. Everyone has different interests, so if we know a little about many things, we can talk to anyone. One way to learn more is to read different sections of the newspaper, like Business, World, and Entertainment. This can help us learn more and talk more easily with new people.\n\nThe world is always changing, and new things happen every day. If we don't know the basics of a subject, we won't understand what's happening. Many subjects are connected, so we need to know a little about each one to understand the others. For example, business is connected to politics, and changes in politics can affect business. So, it's important to know a little about politics to understand business.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe it's better to know a little about many academic subjects than to be an expert in just one."}

What one person thinks is fun, another person might not. For some, enjoying life means partying all the time. For others, it means raising a family.\n\nThe differences between young and old people are big. They have different lifestyles, and even within those groups, there are many sub-groups. These differences come from what people believe or think. Sometimes, the differences between a young person and an old person are small.\n\nA young person's life is about college, friends, partying, and doing things they can't do when they're older. In my opinion, an old person's life is about having peace and being with family. We know some young and old people don't enjoy their lives; they find it boring.\n\nYoung people often get into trouble, have problems, and complain. But if we stop and think, we see that old people's lives are often affected by young people's lives. Like cops, who mostly deal with teenagers.\n\nAnd who helps us out of trouble? Old people do.\n\nIn conclusion, both young and old people can enjoy their lives. As a young person, I think enjoying life means studying, partying, and hanging out with friends. I know old people who think the same way. I believe I should enjoy my life now, and later, I'll find a different way to enjoy it."}

Learning facts helps us wake up. We are students, and we are not rich. But if we study facts, we can become people who can think for ourselves. Second, understanding is about how we think. We act based on simple ideas. These ideas can be influenced by what others think. Belief is a good example. A person who can only think one way is very dangerous.\n\nJapanese students don't know the real facts. They don't want to know the real facts either.

{"file_id": "101568.txt", "output_essay": "Age plays a big role in our lives, and that's why it's essential to enjoy life. However, it's not as simple as it sounds because we go through different stages in life that come with different challenges. I believe that young people enjoy life more than older people do.\n\nWhen people are young, three main things make them enjoy life more. First, they have fewer responsibilities. At the beginning of life, people don't have to worry about many things; their parents or someone else takes care of important things. Even if they have responsibilities, they have the energy to handle them. For example, paying bills, taking care of the house, and other tasks that require responsibility and can cause stress.\n\nAnother important aspect is health. Young people usually don't have big health problems; they can move around on their own and do things without help. This is very important for us as humans.\n\nThe last point is mentality or mental health. Young people usually think positively, have dreams, and want to achieve things in their future. They have expectations and can work towards getting what they want out of life.\n\nFor older people, things are not that easy. They've already been young and have done many things. They've had a lot of responsibilities and are now tired and need to rest. This makes them have a negative attitude towards life, and they can't see other things to enjoy. They don't have much energy left to continue with responsibilities.\n\nAnother important aspect is physical health. When people get old, they often have limitations that stop them from enjoying life like they did when they were young. Things take longer to do, and they might not be able to do them at all. Finally, mental health is also a challenge. Having a positive attitude is difficult when you're old. Things have changed, and being old is not easy. That's why I think young people enjoy life more than older people. Everything is easier when you're young, and you have more things to enjoy life. Energy runs out, and attitude is also important."}
{"file_id": "103545.txt", "output_essay": "We live in a world filled with ads. All ads try to make their products seem amazing. But I don't believe most of what they say. I think they make products seem better than they really are.\n\nThe goal of ads is to get as many customers as possible. To do this, they give false or exaggerated information about their products. For example, some healthy food ads claim they can help you build muscle. But they rarely provide proof or trustworthy surveys to back up their claims. We might see a comparison between a fat girl and a thin girl, but how can we be sure it's just because of the food? Since ads are meant to sell, most of them won't provide scientific proof.\n\nIt's also interesting to see famous actresses and actors in ads. They're attractive and beautiful, and we associate the products with these good images. But how many celebrities actually use the products they're promoting? They're just paid to say a few words or pose for the camera. This can mislead customers. We connect the products to the good images in our minds, but the products aren't as perfect as the ads say.\n\nThere's a big gap between the products in ads and the real products because there's no effective rule to regulate ads. There's no policy to restrict them. In fact, exaggeration is a key part of ads. I've been disappointed to find that real products rarely live up to their ads. Only when our government and media realize the importance of giving us unbiased and true facts, rather than beautiful lies, can we choose products without doubt.\n\nSo, when you're buying something, don't trust what the ads say. Turn off the TV when you see an unbelievable product in an ad. A smart customer should evaluate and judge a product for themselves."}

I'm one of the latter and I disagree with the idea. I don't like to travel in a group with a tour guide because it takes away the freedom to change plans.\n\nIt's true that having a tour guide is comfortable. Some people might find planning where to visit annoying. A group trip with a tour guide is perfect for them. Tour guides are professionals who plan and travel safely. The trip should be easy and safe. However, traveling with a tour guide lacks flexibility.\n\nIn some cities, there are too many famous places, and travelers have to choose which ones to visit. In London or New York, for example, we would need to spend three or four days in a museum to see everything. In such cases, travelers have to follow the tour plan. People who love art and want to spend more time in a museum should travel on their own.\n\nSometimes I change my plan during a trip. When I visited Germany as a student, I planned to visit five cities in one week. But when I saw the beautiful river and castle at the first place, I was so impressed that I changed my plan and stayed there for a week. As a result, I only visited one city.\n\nWhen we travel, we often come across amazing scenery or events. Traveling with a tour guide doesn't allow us to change our plan and stay longer than we planned."}

Happiness and success go together. You might think you can have both, but I think you need to focus on that goal. If you don't try new things and take risks, time will pass you by. You won't have time to enjoy your success. Success is doing what you love, doing it well, earning a good living, and spending time with the people you love. What's the point of having a lot of things if you can't watch your kids grow up?

{"file_id": "106895.txt", "output_essay": "I completely agree that young people today do not have enough time to help their communities. There are several reasons for this: lack of time, busy schedules, and not knowing their communities.\n\nFirst, I'm a young person who doesn't help my community, and I think it's because we're too busy with school. Even if I want to help, I don't have the time because of school. Many students, including me, go to private schools that are far from home. It takes me an hour and a half to get to school, so it's hard to find time to help my community.\n\nSecond, many students, even elementary school students, go to extra tutoring classes after school. This is because parents and students are not satisfied with the school education or think they need extra support. As a result, they don't have time for family or friends. Students who are preparing for exams to get into high school or university go to tutoring classes almost every day. They would rather spend time with family or friends if they could.\n\nThird, I think young people don't know their communities well. In the past, people knew each other and talked a lot. But it's not like that now. I recently moved to a new city, so I don't know my community or neighbors. When there's a festival, I don't participate because I don't know anyone. I think this happens to many people nowadays.\n\nIn conclusion, I agree that most young people don't have enough time to help their communities. Even if they want to help, it's not easy because they're so busy. I think we need to find a way to make our communities more active."}

I think communities don't need as much help or time nowadays.\n\nIn the past, people in small towns or villages worked together for the good of everyone. They had weekly meetings to discuss problems. Young people, who are usually the most energetic, volunteered to solve problems and organize festivals and local events.\n\nPeople were more involved in their community. They worked together, and everyone's problem was everyone else's problem. It was natural for young people to be very active in the community.\n\nBut in many modern places, things are very different. New communication technology and the internet have made people focus more on their computers than on each other.\n\nSystems and services are now more efficient and computerized. There's less need for people, including young people, to get involved in helping because there's not much help needed. People can discuss problems online and via email.\n\nThe town administration has a website where people can post problems. Responsible people can then take action. So today, there's not much help needed, but there's a big need for ideas. And in this case, young people are still the most active group.\n\nSo, considering the current times, I disagree."}
{"file_id": "108264.txt", "output_essay": "Today, people judge the value of things based on how they are perceived. One way to create a good image is through marketing. Advertising is a popular marketing tool. Some people think ads can make products seem better than they are, while others believe it's impossible to deceive customers because of laws and regulations. I think both sides are right, but it depends on the situation.\n\nIn some countries, there are no laws to ensure fair advertising. In these cases, a company can make their product seem better than it is. For example, a cake cream manufacturer might use shaving cream in an ad because it looks the same but lasts longer. Without laws, a company can show a fake product and make people think it's a great brand.\n\nHowever, if a country has laws to regulate advertising, it's hard to trick customers. Manufacturers know they will get in trouble if they lie about their product or use a fake one. For instance, in the USA, an actor must use a product for six months before they can endorse it in an ad.\n\nIn summary, ads can make a product seem better than it is if there are no laws to stop it. Therefore, we need more laws to regulate advertising."}
{"file_id": "107514.txt", "output_essay": "After World War II, many peaceful communities emerged with the help of international organizations. People wanted to live in peace without conflicts. This idea was supported by economics, especially in the 1980s. Young people who grew up during this time were educated by their parents, who had seen the damage of wars. As a result, young people felt disconnected from society and focused on getting jobs and making money. Today, young people do not spend enough time helping their communities. I agree with this statement for several reasons. Young people prefer to spend time playing video games and focusing on their careers instead of helping society. Many young people love video games, and this keeps them away from their families, friends, and community. However, the community faces many problems that need to be solved quickly. For example, unemployment is a major issue. Instead of finding solutions, young people prefer to play video games. Young people are energetic and active, so they can work on projects to solve unemployment. Moreover, they focus too much on making money and ignore the community's social problems. While career goals are important, community problems will eventually affect many people. In the past, foundations played a significant role in society because of their supportive function and organized structure. However, it was the effort of young people that led to their success. In short, I believe that young people today do not spend enough time helping their communities. This might be due to misguided values in schools or families, but whatever the reason, governments must address this issue and find solutions. Otherwise, society will face many problems. Young people are the ones who will build our society."}

This means they might not pay enough attention to their own communities. However, young people now have more chances to help others because we live better and more informed lives than before.\n\nYoung people born after 1985 are the technology generation. They've been using computers since they were very young, even at 3 or 4 years old. Growing up with this, they tend to focus more on machines like computers, MP3 players, and game players than on people. They spend more time using these devices than interacting with others, including their communities.\n\nHowever, young people who grew up like this have more chances to help their communities. They can use their excellent computer skills to help their communities in many ways. For example, they can teach older people how to use computers and surf the Internet. This is easy for young people, but it's very meaningful for older people who can't use technology. By connecting with the world through computers, older people's lives can change a lot.\n\nIn my neighborhood, there's a young person who likes to teach older people in my community. He says, 'It makes his life more meaningful, and he's happy to use his computer skills to help people.' It's easy for him to do so."}

There are many differences between today and the past that affect people's behavior.\n\nIn the past, people knew each other well in their local area and relied on each other more. This created a stronger sense of community, and young people did their part to help. Today, people know others from a much wider area, so they do not feel as close to their local community.\n\nThere are other reasons why young people focus on themselves rather than others. Our society puts pressure on people to be successful in everything they do. To achieve this, people need time, which leaves little time for helping the community. Also, people are more interested in their own lives than in helping others. Most people only care about their own business and do not think about others, even if they live in the same community.\n\nAnother reason is that life is more anonymous today. People may not even know their neighbors, even if they live in the same building. If people do not know their community, they are unlikely to care about it.\n\nFinally, I think about the responsibility people feel towards their families and the money involved. In the past, families lived together more closely. People felt more responsible for each other. Today, people do not feel as responsible for their relatives; instead, they show they care by spending money to support them.\n\nThere are many differences between today and the past that have changed how willing young people are to help their communities."}

When we look at different age groups, we see that younger people want to have more fun than older people. They want to do what they want without worrying about what others think.\n\nWhen you're young, you're full of energy and dreams. You feel like you can do anything. Even though many young people today are focused on their careers, they still want to have fun and share their feelings with others. They go to parties, concerts, and movies. This is where older people often disagree with them.\n\nOlder people are usually more calm and wise. They've learned to accept what life brings them. They've had many experiences, and this has taught them a lot.\n\nOne reason why people have different ideas about fun is because of changes in their bodies as they age. When you're young, your body is full of energy and excitement. As you get older, this energy slows down. This affects how much you enjoy things.\n\nMostly, younger people have more fun than older people. In my house, I want to celebrate holidays in a big way. But my parents always tell me to calm down. Even though I might feel bad at the time, I might do the same thing when I'm older.\n\nSo, in my opinion, younger people generally have more fun than older people.

For example, in math, I learned different ways to solve problems, which helped me understand it better. It was hard, but it gave me a deeper understanding.

We've lost our sense of belonging and take many things for granted. Many think community service is someone else's job.\n\nFirst, students have a lot of schoolwork, so they have little free time. They're often too tired after classes to want to do community work. Also, there's a lot of competition, so students use their free time to study more or prepare for tests. If a student isn't doing well, they'll focus on studying harder. Community service becomes less important.\n\nSecond, when students do have free time, they might choose to get a paid job. For example, if they can earn good money working at a local cafeteria, community service doesn't seem as appealing. Many people prioritize their own benefits over helping others. In other cases, free time is spent with friends, watching movies, or chatting online. For instance, after a long day at college, two friends might prefer to meet at the mall instead of doing more work.\n\nUsually, people do community service to make their resume look better or to get into college. However, there are some who genuinely enjoy helping others and find happiness in it. Some people like visiting old age homes and making the elderly happy.

Everything is new and exciting, so they have plenty of time to experience and enjoy life.\n\nFirst, young people have time and energy to learn new things and stay up-to-date. This helps them enjoy life more. For example, most people over 50 don't use computers to work and communicate, which is a convenient and fun way to do things. So, it's clear that young people enjoy life more.\n\nSecond, young people have more time and energy to have fun. They're strong and healthy, so they can do many things that older people can't. This means they have more opportunities for entertainment. As a young person myself, I feel like I can do anything I want. I even plan to travel the world someday.

The government should look into building underground and bus systems.\n\nFor example, Istanbul is a huge city with 15 million people. There are also 5 million cars in the city. However, Istanbul does not have a good underground metro network. The buses are also old and not good for transportation. Taxis are not cheap either. Because of all these reasons, people prefer to buy a car and use it for daily work. I think this is a problem everywhere in the world.\n\nAnother issue is old cars on the road. There are many old cars, over 20 years old, that are still being used. It's necessary to make new traffic laws in countries. I think old cars, over 20 years old, should not be allowed on the road.\n\nScientists are also researching ways to power cars with electricity or water.

They provide information about sights, cities, and history.\n\nFrom my experience, I meet many people from around the world during my trip. This is sometimes more important than the sights themselves. I can also get tips from other travelers.\n\nGuides usually visit famous places, which are often very crowded.\n\nIn short, I want to be flexible and save money. I don't want to spend money on a place I don't like just because the group decides to stay. That doesn't feel like a holiday.\n\nPlanning my trip is also a great experience."}
{"file_id": "111230.txt", "output_essay": "In my experience, I think traveling with a group led by a tour guide is the best way to go. There are many good things about traveling in a group. In this essay, I will explain why I think this is the best way to travel.\n\nFirst, you can make friends on the trip. When you're on a plane, train, boat, or bus, you can talk to each other and have fun. I met one of my best friends, Kim, on a bus during a group trip to Hangzhou. We sat together, started talking, and became good friends. So, traveling in a group helps you make friends.\n\nSecond, a tour guide can organize the trip well. They can take you to popular and interesting places that tourists like. For example, if I went to a new place alone, I would get lost and not know where to stay, go, or eat. But with a group and a tour guide, things are much easier.\n\nLast, traveling in a group is more fun. If I went somewhere alone, I would get bored on the plane or train. But with a group, it's more interesting and fun. We can share funny stories or personal experiences, so we don't get bored.\n\nIn conclusion, I explained why I think traveling in a group with a tour guide is the best way. In my opinion, I prefer to travel in a group because I can make new friends during the trip."}
{"file_id": "110394.txt", "output_essay": "When we talk about young people and older people, it's hard to know exactly who we mean. So, let's say young people are teenagers, and older people are 50 and above.\n\nTo figure out if young people enjoy life more than older people, let's look at the good and bad things about being young or old. One good thing about being young is that you have your whole life ahead of you, so you have many options. Older people, on the other hand, don't have as much time left, so they have fewer choices. Young people have more time to develop their skills and abilities.\n\nAnother good thing about being young is that you're usually physically fit. Most young people are healthier and stronger than older people. They can also build up their strength and endurance more easily.\n\nOlder people have some advantages too. They have learned a lot from their experiences and can make good decisions. Young people, on the other hand, don't have as much experience, which can cause problems.\n\nOne big disadvantage for young people is that there are many rules they have to follow. For example, they can't drink alcohol or drive until they're a certain age. Older people don't have these restrictions.\n\nUltimately, whether old people or young people enjoy life more depends on the individual. Both have good and bad things about them. If I had to choose, I'd say young people enjoy life more. I'm young, so I know what it's like. Also, people have always wanted to stay young and healthy for as long as possible, which supports my idea."}

I think kids are much happier than older people.\n\nWhen we look at older people's lives, we see many things that worry them. For example, they have to pay bills every month, or their boss at work asks them to do more every day. This doesn't mean they don't enjoy life. However, they have a lot on their minds.\n\nKids keep their lives simple, and that's the secret to their happiness. They can watch cartoons for hours without worrying about what they'll eat tonight because their mom takes care of that. Or, they can play with their neighbors all afternoon until they're tired and need a nap.\n\nIn the adult world, things are different. Older people still have fun. They can have nice conversations with friends, go to the movies, or have dinner with their family. But they don't have the same energy and enthusiasm as young people. Young people are more optimistic and positive because they have their whole life ahead of them, which motivates them to try new things.\n\nSo, in conclusion, young people enjoy life more than older people. That's why it's common to hear people say they wish they could be a kid again."}
{"file_id": "108871.txt", "output_essay": "I agree that successful people should try new things and take risks instead of just doing what they're good at. First, a person needs to be secure financially and mentally by doing what they're skilled at. Then, they should try new ways to do their work or take risks to grow in life.\n\nDoing the same thing over and over gets boring. To make life more interesting, people need to try something new. But they should do it carefully so they don't hurt their reputation or job. Take Mr. Dhirubhai Ambani, the founder of Reliance Industrial group in India, for example. He started a textile firm in the 20th century and worked hard to make it big. He was very successful and financially secure, but he didn't stop there. He took risks and entered the petroleum industry, and now Reliance petroleum is a big name in India.\n\nHe also started Reliance telecommunications, which was the first CDMA mobile service in India, and made a lot of money. The Reliance Group even entered the Energy and Retail sectors. Today, it's one of the top 50 companies globally. If Mr. Ambani had stuck to his textile business, none of this would have happened.\n\nSo, I think it's best to be secure first, and then try new things and take risks to grow your business. A successful person never stops trying to be more successful. They try new things and take risks instead of just doing what they're good at."}

In my opinion, it's better to specialize in one subject.\n\nFirst, when you study many subjects, you can't focus well. You have to divide your time among many subjects. We know that the more time you spend on something, the better you'll be at it. If you spend one hour studying, you'll get different results than if you spend eight hours. If you focus on one subject, you'll know it better. But if you study many subjects, you won't learn much about any of them.\n\nSecond, having a special skill makes it easier to find a job. You have expert knowledge in one area. Many companies need people with special skills. For example, in Canada, there's a shortage of people who know how to build cables. If you have that skill, you can easily find a job and get paid well.\n\nIt's true that people with broad knowledge can find jobs, like in foreign companies that need people to speak multiple languages. But they might not be able to write in those languages.\n\nOverall, it's better to specialize in one subject. You can learn a lot about one subject, but not much about many subjects."}

From hunting for food to using the latest technology, curiosity has played a big role.\n\nIn this essay, I will look at what makes a successful person and if being optimistic is key to success.\n\nWhen we look at history, we see that great leaders are optimistic. They take bold decisions and try new things. For example, George Washington, America's first president, was enthusiastic about trying new things. Abraham Lincoln is another example of someone who took risks and tried new things to achieve great things.\n\nI also think that doing what we know well can be done accurately and with less effort. However, it doesn't make us more efficient. Think about our ancestors who were good at hunting. If they hadn't tried new ways of living, we wouldn't be where we are today.\n\nObstacles help us find the path to success. When we overcome obstacles and take risks, we become stronger and discover new levels of success.\n\nIn conclusion, if you want to be very successful, get used to taking risks and facing obstacles, and you will be successful."}

I think it's better to have knowledge of many subjects because it helps me connect with people and understand how different subjects are related.\n\nFirst, having broad knowledge helps in everyday life. I've lived in New York City for three years and met people from many countries. I've tried new foods, seen different customs, and learned about different religions. In my first English class, I had ten classmates from ten different countries. They introduced themselves, and I realized I didn't know much about some of their countries. I felt ashamed and sorry for them. Similarly, some of my classmates didn't know where Korea was, and that surprised me. I realized I needed to learn more about other cultures.\n\nAlso, all subjects are connected. My major is interior design, and I thought I would only learn drawing and measuring. But I had to take classes in math, history, and art too. At first, I wondered why I needed to take these classes. But then I understood why. I needed to learn history to understand how interior design developed and who started designing rooms. Math helped me calculate measurements when I drew. \n\nIn conclusion, I believe it's better to have knowledge of many subjects because it helps me connect with people and understand how different subjects are related."}

To get hired, we need to be better than others in our field. If we try to learn a little about many subjects instead of focusing on what our career needs, we'll be at a disadvantage in the job market.\n\nThe saying 'Jack of all, King of none' is true. If we try to learn about many subjects, we'll know more, but it won't be useful unless we're an expert in all of them.\n\nFor example, I wanted to be a software engineer, and there's a lot of competition for software jobs. If I hadn't majored in software engineering in college, I wouldn't have gotten a job. No software company wants someone who knows a little about many subjects but isn't an expert in software.\n\nHowever, I think it's also important to know a little about other subjects for our general knowledge and to live in the world. In school, we learn about many subjects like math, science, geography, and history, and that's enough. Once we're in college, we should focus on one area that interests us, which will give us satisfaction and better career prospects.\n\nIn conclusion, specializing in one subject is always better than knowing a little about many subjects."}
{"file_id": "112298.txt", "output_essay": "We all face tough times in our lives that help us learn and grow. I believe in the saying, 'Successful people try new things and take risks instead of just doing what they're good at.' This is true for many reasons. When someone tries new things, they gain experience and knowledge. Taking risks and learning new things helps people develop emotionally and physically. It's good for people to be adventurous and try different things, because it helps them learn new lessons. By learning these lessons, people become more optimistic and happy. They find more meaning in life and want to try new things that will entertain and teach them. I think risk takers are confident people who know what they want in life. They're lucky to have this trait. Taking risks is a positive choice that helps people succeed in life. Unlike those who only do what they know, risk takers will not regret missing out on new experiences. The difference between these two types of people is that one is willing to learn and grow, while the other is scared and lazy. In conclusion, taking risks will not harm anyone. It helps people feel good about themselves, builds their confidence, and makes them successful in life."}

These ads create high expectations for the products they see on screen or in newspapers. However, most ads promise more than they can deliver to customers. The strong marketing of big companies makes people dream big, but customers are not aware of the tricks used to make products look better.\n\nThe message an ad sends to customers is carefully created by the marketing team of big brands. They sell dreams through their ads. For example, people don't feel guilty about buying and drinking too much Diet Coke because it's said to have less sugar than the original. Similarly, people who buy exercise machines to get fit at home dream of being fit because of the ad.\n\nMoreover, people often forget that images can be edited on computers. This happens especially in the beauty industry, where brands show off their products. They create beautiful ads with top models who have perfect skin, which is actually the result of computer editing."}

We may not understand the local language, customs, or traditions. For example, if you plan to visit France, you may not speak French, and a guide can help.\n\nSecond, when we visit a historic place without a guide, we might just see old buildings. But a guide can explain the history behind these places. For instance, when you visit the Egyptian pyramids, a guide can tell you who built them and how. This makes the trip more exciting and enjoyable.\n\nOn the other hand, traveling alone or with family who don't know the place or its history can be boring. You might get lost or miss important details. If you see mysterious writings on stones, you can't understand them on your own.\n\nConsidering all these reasons, I strongly agree with the statement."}
{"file_id": "111601.txt", "output_essay": "Over the past few years, people's way of life has changed a lot. Many events in the 19th century, such as world wars, the growth of capitalism, and religious conflicts, have changed our society in France and other countries. I will use France as an example. The events of May 1968 changed people's minds. Before then, young people were more obedient and structured, in my opinion. They were also less focused on their individual goals. Capitalism has made people more focused on their own success because times are tough, and people know it will get even harder in the future. So, young people feel pressured and know they must succeed. They work hard at school or have two jobs, and they have less time to do other things. To sum it up, I think there are two main reasons: one, young people are more focused on their own success and don't think about helping others; two, they have less time due to the new social model. However, we can see that young people can help others in difficult situations. For example, during the Tsunami, many young people gave gifts to charity organizations or wanted to go help those affected. We can see that young people can help their communities when there's an emergency. So, we can say that they can be very helpful at certain times. But I also think that they don't make enough effort to help others who need it."}

They have little time left for themselves, so they prefer to use that time for their hobbies or personal activities rather than helping their community.\n\nTV and other media have changed our lives. We're so focused on what's happening around the world that we forget about the problems in our own neighborhoods. I know someone who's addicted to a TV show and always watches it, even if they have work to do. That's how much TV affects young people today.\n\nSome young people, especially college students, think helping the community is not cool. They avoid it, even if it goes against their conscience, just to seem cool. I've seen this myself in junior college.\n\nThis way of thinking, which is common among young people in cities, needs to change. It's sad that young people today think helping the community is cheap and uncool.\n\nBut there are still people in each community who dedicate time to helping others, despite all this."}

If students only learn facts, they won't know how to apply them in real-life situations. For instance, a math teacher might teach a problem and solve it without explaining the concept behind it, like the formula or steps to follow. This can be a problem if students are given a similar problem in a different way or on a test. They won't be able to solve it because they don't understand the concept.\n\nA good teacher should teach the concept first, then solve a problem using that concept. This way, students will remember the concept and be able to solve similar problems easily. Every problem has a concept behind it. Take a physics textbook, for example. Each chapter has many concepts. In the chapter on gravity, the idea is that the Earth's gravity pulls things towards it. If we just tell students that things fall back to the ground, they're only learning a fact. They don't know why it happens. This kind of learning won't produce good engineers or professionals.\n\nEven a civil engineering student who doesn't know how to build a safe building will cause it to collapse. That's why it's crucial for students to learn concepts and understand ideas rather than just memorizing facts."}

There are several reasons why I believe this.\n\nFirst, young people are more capable than older people. They can do what they want because they are physically strong. They don't get tired easily. If they don't do what they want when they're young, they won't be able to do it when they're old. For example, sports like surfing, running, and soccer are hard to do when you're old. I love traveling, but it's tiring. Last winter, I went to Orlando, Florida alone. It took thirty hours to get there because I had to change planes twice. I think older people can't handle that.\n\nSecond, young people can bounce back quickly. When they make a mistake, they can try again. Older people can't do that. If they make a small mistake, they might not get another chance. For example, if a young person quits their job, they can get hired by another company soon.

These challenges can make life harder to enjoy.\n\nOlder people also often have more family and work responsibilities. This can cause stress and anxiety, making it harder to enjoy life. However, having a family can also bring happiness.\n\nOn the other hand, young people are often more carefree and want to have fun. They usually don't have the same family and work worries as older people. This means they can focus on enjoying themselves.\n\nYoung people also tend to have fewer money worries. Their parents often provide for their needs. This takes away a big concern and lets young people enjoy life more.\n\nIn conclusion, young people may enjoy life more because they don't have the same worries as older people.

{"file_id": "109364.txt", "output_essay": "When I read about successful people, I notice that their success is based on new ideas or inventions. Today, it's a challenge to come up with brand new ideas. Everyone wants new ideas and products to be successful. The world has developed so much that regular ideas or inventions are not enough. Successful people always face hard times, but they overcome them. In my opinion, that's what makes them successful.\n\nFirst, successful people are not satisfied with the present situation and always challenge themselves. Walt Disney was not happy with the way TV was back then. He created characters like Mickey Mouse and Minnie Mouse, which got kids' attention and helped him succeed. He kept creating new characters, which made his success even greater.\n\nSecond, successful people take more risks than others. You can't get rich in one try, unless you win the lottery. They take risks to get better results. Bill Gates went to Harvard University, but he took a risk and left to create Microsoft. He gave up his good reputation at Harvard, which is not something most people do.\n\nThird, successful people keep developing themselves. They try new things, take risks, and never give up. They keep trying until they get the results they want. Then, they start again with what they've learned. Picasso was a famous artist, and his paintings are worth millions. At first, his work was not well-known because it was too creative. But he didn't give up. He kept painting, and now we think his work is amazing.\n\nIn short, successful people try new things, take risks, and never give up until they reach their goal.

It was a risk because many people already had MP3 players and didn't want to change. But he didn't care and went to every shop, and people started buying the new MP3 player. It became popular.\n\nPeople who take risks are not afraid to make decisions. If someone hesitates, they can't be successful. A successful person can make decisions in any situation.\n\nFor example, my friend has a 25-year-old shop. There was an economic problem in my country, and many shop owners closed their shops. My friend had problems too, but he made some important decisions and didn't hesitate. Now, he's still working in the same place.\n\nSuccessful people are not afraid to try new things. Some owners are afraid to try new things because they think they might lose their business.

Many people already prefer to use these options and only drive to the nearest station.\n\nSecond, the Internet and video conferencing are making it possible for people to work from home. Many companies, such as software firms and trading corporations, are already allowing their employees to do this. As this trend continues, fewer people will need to drive to work.\n\nFinally, the limited supply of fuel will also reduce the use of cars. The world is using more and more fuel, but there is no way to replace it quickly. To solve this problem, people will have to find ways to use less fuel, which means using cars less often.\n\nIt may be hard to accept, but it seems likely that we will stop using cars, one of humanity's most important inventions, in the near future.

{"file_id": "104080.txt", "output_essay": "In today's world, cars are the main way to travel on land. As cities grow and distances get longer, people need transportation more and more in their daily lives. Almost every person who can afford it, is over 18, and has a license owns a car. If you think about the number of people on this planet, that's a lot of cars. However, public transportation is getting better, which means people don't need cars as much. So what will happen in twenty years?\n\nFirst, you need a way to get from one place to another. In big cities, it's hard to get to work or go shopping without a car or public transportation. Most people prefer their own cars because public transportation is slow and not reliable. You never know when the bus will come, and you'll probably be late. Buses are also slow and stop a lot. Metros are crowded and uncomfortable. Taxis are expensive. If you go shopping, you can't carry all your bags without a trunk. Imagine being on a crowded bus or metro with ten bags of groceries. It's not convenient. This is why most families need at least one car.\n\nHowever, there's a growing problem of pollution and traffic. There are so many cars that it takes an hour to get home during rush hour. Plus, when you get to work or the mall, it's hard to find parking. Wouldn't it be great to use that time to catch a movie or eat instead of looking for parking? That's why some places have started using service buses to take you directly from home to work. Also, oil resources are running out, and cars pollute the air. If twenty people went to a place in one bus instead of separate cars, it would reduce pollution and traffic.\n\nIn my opinion, there will be fewer cars in the next twenty years. Governments are aware of the pollution and traffic problem and are making public transportation better to encourage people to use it. For example, in the United States, some cities have special carpool lanes that you can only use if you have more than one passenger in your car. So, I think public awareness of pollution, rising fuel costs, and better public transportation will reduce the number of cars in the future."}

Are we comparing young people today to those from 50 years ago or 100 years ago? Let's say we're comparing them to those who were young right after World War II. Even then, it's tough to answer because society was very different back then. Cities were not as crowded, and many people lived in small towns. In those towns, people knew each other better than they do in big cities. When you live in a small town, you're more likely to help your neighbor, like helping with their garden when they're not around. You do this because you know them well. In cities, hardly anyone knows their neighbors.\n\nWe also need to clarify what 'helping their communities' means. Does it have to benefit everyone or just one person? It's easy for young people to do things that benefit the whole community because they don't think about it too much at their age.\n\nTo sum up, I'd like to share my opinion. I think young people today spend less time helping their communities than their parents did in the past. But I don't think it's because they're selfish. I think it's because today's society is selfish."}

Their goal is not to inform consumers, but to make a product more appealing. Ads are supposed to increase sales and make a profit. So, their purpose is to influence people.\n\nAds are paid for by the producer, who decides what they say. Everyone knows this, so it's fair to exaggerate a bit. There are laws in Western countries to protect consumers from false claims. So, it's unlikely that ads tell outright lies.\n\nHowever, within these limits, it's easy to make claims that can't be proven or disproven. Anti-aging products are a good example. No one says you can stop aging, but ads suggest it without directly saying it. They show young, fresh-looking people with no aging issues.\n\nAdvertisers often try to sell a dream or feeling, not a fact. For instance, ads for luxury goods like expensive cars and watches focus on quality, but people buy them for intangible reasons like prestige and exclusivity.

At 21, I consider myself young and think I can do anything. It's more fun when you think you can do everything. However, as you get older, life gets tougher, and older people tend to forget how to dream and enjoy life. This is probably because of money, family, and health.\n\nWhen you're older, you worry about money a lot. You need a job to support yourself, and it's hard to save money. When you're young, you can live with your parents and have a part-time job, so you have more freedom to spend your money. I had a lot of money when I was in high school, and I could do whatever I wanted. Having money makes life more enjoyable because you can do more things.\n\nAnother thing is family. When you're young and don't have kids, you have more freedom. But when you have kids, your free time is limited, and you always have to think about your family and bills. You may not have your dream job, but you have to work to support your family. This can be very stressful and make you unhappy.\n\nLastly, as you get older, your body isn't as strong as it used to be. I'm healthy now, but my mom always complains about her health. She says she has bad legs and back, and she doesn't like to go out often. Just staying at home isn't the best thing to do, but sometimes you have no choice. So I think I should make the most of my youth and do what I can while I'm still young.\n\nLater in life, I'll be able to enjoy life like older people do, but being young is something that older people can't experience."}
{"file_id": "116293.txt", "output_essay": "I believe that successful people try new things and take risks instead of just doing what they're good at. This idea applies to many areas, but business is one of the most important. Success is often linked to money, so a big company might take more risks than a small family business. However, it's not that simple. A big company has more opportunities because it has more money. But if we compare a successful company to an unsuccessful one, we'll see that the successful one takes more risks.\n\nFor example, Coca Cola is one of the most successful companies today. But it didn't start out that way. It began with just one product, Cola. When Coca Cola became popular worldwide, its profits grew every year. Then, the company took a big risk and invested in new products, Fanta and Sprite. This was a big gamble because people might not have liked the new drinks and wouldn't have bought them. Even if Coca Cola had lost all the money it invested, it would still have remained a successful company.\n\nIn general, successful businesses take more risks to make even more money, unlike unsuccessful ones. It doesn't matter to them if they lose."}
{"file_id": "1004000.txt", "output_essay": "It's better to focus on one subject. I have some reasons for this opinion. First, specializing in one subject helps you get a job. For example, if you want to be a carpenter, learning about carpentry specifically makes it easier to become one. You learn a lot about carpentry, and a carpenter doesn't need to know many other things. Second, learning many things takes more time than focusing on one subject. This is a big problem because it means you'll graduate later, and it will take even longer to get a job. Third, focusing on one subject saves money. If you want to learn many things, you need to buy many textbooks. But if you focus on one subject, you only need a few textbooks. So, you don't have to spend a lot of money. In conclusion, it's good to focus on one subject because it helps you get a job, saves time, and saves money. These are very important reasons."}

Young people have lots of energy and a strong body. They can do many things.\n\nBut older people have other ways to enjoy life. They can spend time in parks, feed animals at the zoo, play cards, or play music. These things make them happy and relaxed.\n\nOlder people also have the power of their past experiences. This is important for their well-being. Memories of the past make them feel strong emotions, maybe even romantic feelings.\n\nIt's hard for me to conclude.

Sometimes, when you're with a guide and a group, you don't have enough time to look at what you like or enjoy the things you like best. For me, it's important to try the local food and talk to the people who live there, not just see monuments and learn about history. In conclusion, everyone has different interests when they travel, and a good book can be just as good as a guide. You can read about the place you're visiting and then take your time to do what you really like.

While specializing in a field is important, in today's fast-paced society, we need to excel in many areas.\n\nTake scientific experiments, for example. They often lead to new discoveries and require people from different fields to work together. A biologist needs chemists to provide chemicals and physicists to develop machinery. Without them, we wouldn't have made progress in sequencing genetic material.\n\nExams, like the one I'm taking, show us that having a broad knowledge of many subjects is beneficial. It also increases our ability to learn and apply what we know. We can think bigger and come up with innovative ideas. Even if we study science, it's good to have general knowledge of culture and history. In interviews and exams, questions often test our general knowledge, which shows how well we understand the world around us.\n\nHaving broad knowledge not only leads to a successful life but also makes us better people.

You're just like others who don't try their best. To be successful, you need to challenge yourself, try new things, and take risks.\n\nTo me, success means doing more than you can do. You need to try new things and take risks to do more. If you do, you'll see the results in many areas. Success isn't just about having a lot of money. Money doesn't define success.\n\nI believe success is about being different from others, knowing more, and having more experiences. You might not be successful even if you try new things and take risks. But if you have more experiences and knowledge than others, that makes you successful.\n\nSuccess is about how much you've improved. When you succeed at something you thought was hard, that makes you successful and better than others. It's not about having more money and power. Everyone has their own situation and level of success. If you succeed in your own way, the power and money will follow.\n\nPeople who try new things and take risks will succeed, no matter how much they've improved or how rich they are.

{"file_id": "115179.txt", "output_essay": "I agree that ads make products seem better than they are, and that's their goal. Ads want to make you think a product is the best thing ever, that you need it, and that it's the most important thing. They want to sell the product and make money. A good example is diet pill ads on TV. They make hard goals seem easy, fast, and effortless. They target what people care about: looking good and being healthy. People want to be healthy to avoid health problems and to feel good about themselves. Healthy bodies come from eating well, exercising, and planning. But diet pill ads make it seem like you can skip these steps and still get a healthy body, which is not true and not recommended by doctors. People still buy these products because they want to look and feel good. To understand why ads work, we need to look at why products seem better than they are. First, ads make hard things seem easy to sell the product and make money. Second, when you watch a TV ad, look for the small print that tells the truth about the product. This is not new; all products are made to seem great to make a profit. But it's up to us to be informed and make smart choices when buying products."}
{"file_id": "111649.txt", "output_essay": "In today's fast-changing world, job opportunities are increasing. Every field has subfields or new areas to explore. Successful people try new things and take risks instead of just doing what they're good at. This is because trying new things can bring them money, recognition, and attention, and help them think creatively.\n\nFirst, making money and gaining recognition is the foundation of success. People want at least one of these two things. Trying something new can always bring you money or recognition. For example, a skilled car mechanic who starts working on luxury boat engines will soon get customers asking for his help with boat-related issues or other mechanical problems. This shows that trying new things can bring you both money and recognition, which encourages you to try more new things.\n\nSecondly, getting people's attention makes you happy. When you do something new, people ask you about it, want to learn from you, or congratulate you. You feel like you're the center of attention, and everyone loves and needs you. This is what drives people to succeed, so getting attention is a key reason to try new things.\n\nLastly, only imaginative people try new things because they're not afraid to think differently. They can imagine a whole new world and live in it. When they imagine something, they can also imagine the outcome. If they don't see success, they won't try new things. Their brains work differently, and they're smart.\n\nIn conclusion, trying new things and being successful is about making money, getting attention, and being imaginative. People who try new things can be successful, but sometimes only successful people have the courage and brains to try new things. This is a two-way road: someone on this road will always be successful or always try new things, and it will end with the other one."}
{"file_id": "1000528.txt", "output_essay": "I don't agree with the idea that advertisements are good. There are several reasons why.\n\nFirst, too many ads confuse people. Usually, people buy things based on what the company says in the ad. When the product is not what they expected, they get confused. For example, I wanted to lose weight, so I bought an exercise machine. The ad said I could lose weight easily, and that sounded great. I bought the machine right away. But when I used it, I found it was hard to use and required a lot of effort. I stopped using it.\n\nSecond, companies that use too many ads lose people's trust. After my bad experience, I don't trust the company. They still sell the same machine and claim it's a good way to lose weight, but I don't believe them.\n\nThird, too many ads are bad for my country's society. Although ads help companies make more money, they can be misleading. If we allow these ads, they will spread all over the country. That's not good for our society. For example, food companies are supposed to show the expiration date on their products because it's safe to eat until then. But recently, some companies have been changing the expiration dates on purpose. This is very discouraging for our country.\n\nSo, for these reasons, I disagree with the statement."}

If students understand them, they're less likely to forget them.\n\nSecond, memorizing facts is hard. For example, trying to remember facts takes more time than understanding ideas and concepts. We should save our time.\n\nIf students only memorize facts, they might forget them. This is a waste of time.\n\nThird, memorizing facts is not cheaper than understanding ideas and concepts. If we try to memorize facts, we might need to pay for classes. But if we choose to understand ideas and concepts, we can do it on our own. For example, we can read books. Reading books helps us understand ideas and concepts.\n\nMemorizing facts is not a good way to learn. We should focus on learning so we can get a job. Getting a job is tough, especially with the current economy.\n\nSo, I recommend understanding ideas and concepts. If I could go back in time, I would focus on understanding ideas and concepts.

Without understanding, they'll struggle and won't be able to learn facts clearly. Breaking down the study into steps helps a lot because it prevents mistakes.\n\nUnderstanding ideas and concepts is essential for all students, but it needs to be done step by step. Once students understand, they can easily learn the facts. Schools provide a brief explanation of how to understand ideas before analyzing them and learning the facts.\n\nColleges in different fields give students the chance to understand the ideas of their study. Schools are meant to help students understand. After graduating, students go to college and are ready to learn facts because they're prepared. However, it's not as important for students to learn facts as it is to understand ideas and concepts.\n\nThe main idea is that students everywhere should understand ideas and concepts before learning facts.

For example, a major workers' strike in France before a change in government cannot be seen in the same way as one in Bangladesh during a difficult time. Facts can also be linked to a particular way of thinking or producing goods. For instance, an American might have sold a lot of French foie gras because they liked it at a certain time, but not anymore due to changes in the relationship between the American and French governments and the way ducks are treated.\n\nI admit that learning facts can help understand difficult concepts. In conclusion, I think it's more important and useful for students to understand ideas and concepts for their future life. However, learning facts can sometimes be necessary."}

I don't try anything else. So, I'm a good dancer, but I'm not a successful person. I only succeed at one thing.\n\nA successful person tries new things, even if they're not good at them. And because they're successful, they'll get better at those things.\n\nTo be really successful, you need to try many things. Being good at just a few things doesn't mean you're successful.\n\nFor example, after learning to play the guitar, I can try another instrument.

Today, they don't spend enough time helping their communities because they don't feel connected to them. There are reasons for this.\n\nOne reason is that young people have new interests and habits. They spend a lot of time on TVs and computers. They watch what's happening in the world on TV and connect with people from other countries online. This makes them less likely to talk to people in their own communities.\n\nAnother reason is that parents don't teach their children about their customs, like how to behave and speak to people in their communities. This makes young people less familiar with their customs, so they find other things to focus on.\n\nAdditionally, young people have to study harder than before. They have to focus on their schoolwork because of university and high school entrance exams. This leaves them no time to get involved in their communities.\n\nYoung people should be helping their communities, but they don't because they don't have time to connect with them.

This agrees with the statement.\n\nA good example to support this statement is from before the Renaissance period in Europe. The Roman Catholic Church was in charge at that time. They taught false information, saying the Earth was the center of the solar system and that the other planets moved around it. People were taught this, and facts were more important, even if they were wrong. This meant people lived with a lie.\n\nIf understanding and conceptualizing were more important back then, we would have learned more about the universe even before the Renaissance period.\n\nThis idea also supports the saying 'necessity is the mother of invention.' If students only learn facts, which are discoveries made by others who understood ideas, there's no room for free thinking. This means the future, which is made up of students, will not progress.\n\nI also think that some facts can be changed or proven wrong by understanding ideas and concepts. The example above shows this. During the Renaissance period, free thinkers like Galileo proved the false facts wrong by understanding ideas and concepts.

But that's true for all people in her village, not just young people. On the other hand, my grandmother and her friends had to work a lot at home and in the fields. They didn't have much time to spend together or help their community.\n\nI think young people today are also socially active. It depends on where they live. In small villages, people are closer and help each other more. In big cities like Zurich, people are too busy and don't know their neighbors. The bigger the city, the more people focus on themselves and don't connect with others. This means young people aren't part of the whole society. They only hang out with friends and don't connect with people of different ages or backgrounds. They don't think about helping their community.

When I was in my country, I played soccer every weekend. After a while, I got bored with playing soccer. I wanted to change something in my lifestyle. Before I came to the US, I didn't know about American football. Now I'm learning about it. I also like it, and I've learned new rules about the sport.\n\nAnother example is about taking risks. I studied for a PhD in my country for two years. I wanted to change my education place, even though it was risky. It meant spending a lot of money, passing the TOEFL exam, and completing a new PhD education in the US. I didn't know how much money I would spend or if I would pass the TOEFL and complete a new education. I took the risk.\n\nSuccessful people develop themselves by trying new things. They find new ways to do things, which helps them try new things. For example, a student who prepares for the TOEFL develops new studying methods and finds better solutions for studying.

I agree that in twenty years, there will be fewer cars on the road because people are becoming more aware of the problems and governments are making new rules to protect the environment and reduce city problems.\n\nThe main problem with cars is air pollution. When we use cars more, we pollute the air more. Now, people know this is a danger, so they may use their cars less to reduce pollution.\n\nCars also cause traffic jams in cities.

Using a famous person, like a footballer or model, can increase a product's popularity. Companies also use camera tricks and lighting to make products look more attractive. They can even make a small product look big and a slow one look fast. Additionally, ads are repeated many times to persuade consumers. This puts pressure on them to try the product. The price of a product is also important. If it's cheap, we often think it's the best choice. But this isn't always true. Companies know this and use it to their advantage.\n\nDespite this, some ads show the real features and uses of a product. In these cases, we can trust the companies.

Companies like Mobil, BP, and Texaco have invested a lot of money to stop alternative energy sources from being developed. They make most of their money from car fuel, and they won't give it up easily. If they don't want cars to change, they will definitely fight against having fewer cars.\n\nAnother reason the number of cars won't decrease is that governments in Western countries spend most of their money on building roads. If there are fewer cars, it will cause big problems for the government and the economy.\n\nIn conclusion, the tire industry, fuel producers, and governments won't let the number of cars decrease.

I admit that sometimes ads can be misleading, and people trust the celebrities who promote them, so they buy the product. That's why I don't completely disagree with the idea that ads can be misleading.\n\nHowever, I think viewers should be careful when watching ads and should check the product before buying it. They should make sure the claims made in the ads are true. It's the customer's job to remember that some companies might exaggerate the benefits of their products to sell more.\n\nIn a country like India, there's a group called 'ISO' that checks the quality of products and makes sure they're safe to sell. With groups like 'ISO', it's not easy for companies to make false claims about their products.\n\nAds can help people compare different products and choose the best one.

First, experts say that the Earth's oil will eventually run out. With current technology, we can expect fuel to become very expensive or even unavailable by 2050. Second, to combat global warming, people will have to use less fuel and drive fewer cars. Stricter laws will lead to less pollution in the future.\n\nAs people move to bigger cities, they will use public transportation like subways and buses more often. This could also lead to fewer cars on the road.\n\nHowever, one thing is certain: cars will change. Why might people want more cars in the future? The main reason is that the population will grow over the next twenty years. As the population grows, so will the demand for cars. Cars might also become more fuel-efficient, and new oil fields could be discovered.\n\nNew sources of power will also become more affordable and be used in the car industry. For example, vegetable oil can be used to power cars, as seen in Brazil, and hydrogen energy is another option.\n\nIn the end, the future of the global car population is uncertain.

{"file_id": "117434.txt", "output_essay": "At first, we might think that focusing on one subject is good because we can give it all our time and energy. But this approach might stop us from improving in other areas.\n\nFirst, all sciences are connected and no subject is completely separate from others. Not knowing about other subjects will always limit us in our studies. For example, as a computer science student, I might not need to know about physics or chemistry in university. But if I need to create software for a company that makes chemical products, I'll need help from others who know chemistry. From my projects, I've learned that knowing a little about many topics is helpful. In fact, a computer engineer who doesn't know basic engineering principles is not a complete engineer and will always need help.\n\nAdditionally, from what I've learned in the software industry, having knowledge of many subjects sets you apart from others and makes you more desirable. If we want to be good at our jobs, focusing on one subject is not enough.\n\nThere are also many interesting subjects in science. We might be happy to spend time on other subjects and improve ourselves. It's not good to limit ourselves to one subject all the time, as there might be other topics that interest us.\n\nIn conclusion, I agree that it's better to have knowledge of many subjects. During our university studies, we should try to learn about as many subjects as possible and not limit ourselves to just one."}

The reason is that 'fun' means different things to different people.\n\nFor young people, fun can be many things, like spending time with friends, having birthday parties, or studying. My point is that fun is different for everyone.\n\nFor older people, fun can be simple things like watching TV or taking a long walk. For example, my 75-year-old grandfather loves eating his favorite food. When people get older, they often enjoy simple pleasures like this. This doesn't mean they're not enjoying life. They just enjoy it in their own way.\n\nYoung people might enjoy life now, but that doesn't mean older people didn't do the same things when they were young. In fact, older people have done everything young people have. What this means is that enjoying life and having fun change as people get older. It all depends on what makes each person happy at their age. For my grandfather, it's his favorite food. For me, it's playing my guitar on the rooftop.\n\nSo, I think the statement is wrong. Fun means different things to different people. Older people have just as much fun as young people, but they have fun in different ways."}

Even though we'll likely run out of petroleum in twenty years, I think we'll find other fuels to power cars. Today, we already see cars that use propane or other gases on the market.\n\nIn twenty years, I believe this technology will be advanced enough to let cars run without petroleum. However, this doesn't mean they won't harm the environment. Unfortunately, I don't think people will take action to solve the environmental problem until it's too late.\n\nMaybe people will stop using their own cars when the earth becomes too hot to live comfortably. But I don't think that will happen in the next twenty years. The car industry is too powerful, and nobody will try to stop people from using cars until it's unbearable.\n\nSince I don't think people will stop using cars, and cars are well-suited to city life, it's likely that car sales will continue as they have been. This means the number of cars on the road will increase. Additionally, countries like China and India are developing rapidly and will likely become big car consumers in the near future, including the next twenty years."}

Let's take medicine as an example. People who know a little might think taking more painkillers will make the pain go away faster. But people who know more will realize that taking too many pills can have bad side effects. That's why it's good to know a little about many subjects. This doesn't mean you need to be an expert in everything. It's hard to know every detail about everything because it can distract you from what's important.\n\nMy advice is to try to learn about many things, but not to focus on every detail. Each person should have one subject they know a lot about. Try to learn from people you meet who have different educations. Remember, opportunities don't come often."}

Facts are just conclusions people draw from their own experiences and research. Once students understand the ideas behind an issue, they can easily figure out the facts.\n\nFor example, we know the sun rises in the east and sets in the west. But if people just accepted this fact without questioning, the world would be a different place today. We also know that when you throw an apple up, it always falls down. If people just accepted this fact without thinking, we might not know who Isaac Newton is.\n\nThere are already many facts that we know. To discover more facts, students need to study a topic, do research, and understand the basic ideas behind it.

{"file_id": "1004657.txt", "output_essay": "I believe it's more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than to just memorize facts. To really understand a fact, you need to know where it comes from. The how and why behind it are important too.\n\nThere are two main reasons why understanding concepts and ideas is more important. First, when you understand the idea behind a fact, you can really grasp what's going on. For example, knowing that earthquakes are dangerous and that the earth moves is not enough. If you understand the concept, you can take steps to stay safe, like moving to a place where earthquakes don't happen.\n\nSecond, understanding concepts helps you learn more about a topic. You can answer questions like how and why, and that gives you a deeper understanding of the subject. For instance, knowing that touching fire will burn you is not enough. If you understand the concept, you'll know what to do next, like going to the hospital or using antibacterial ointment.\n\nIn short, knowing concepts and ideas gives you a big advantage over students who only memorize facts. You'll know how, why, and what to do."}

It's like this: we can't focus on two things at the same time. If we're interrupted, we might forget important things.\n\nAlso, when we focus on one thing, we can pay more attention to it. We won't be confused by two things. So, we can remember more of what we learn.\n\nAdditionally, everyone is good at some things and not good at others. For example, I might be good at tennis, but not good at ping-pong. It's natural. I was born this way. People can't force me to do something I'm not good at.\n\nBeing an expert at one thing makes life less confusing. But, I'm not saying that people who know everything aren't smart.

It's true that environmental problems related to oil are getting worse, and many car companies, like Toyota in Japan, are working hard to develop a new way of transportation that can replace cars. Some people, especially those living in big cities, might use this new way of transportation. As a result, there might be fewer cars in those areas.\n\nBut this new system will only work in areas that are already well-developed and have a strong economy. Areas that are still developing can't afford to buy or build this system. On the other hand, as their economy grows, the demand for cars will increase. Cars are also cheaper than this new system.\n\nIf we look at the bigger picture, there are more people living in developing countries than in developed countries. So, the number of cars in developing countries will increase faster than the number of cars will decrease in developed countries. This is the first reason I disagree.\n\nThe second reason is that people will always want cars. There are car enthusiasts who love cars."}

To do this, they focus on the best qualities of the product that people know about.

When I was a kid, I saw a toy advertisement and wanted it because it looked amazing. But when I got the toy, it didn't move or talk much, and the colors were bad.\n\nAdvertisers use tricks like this to sell products to kids who want things that look nice. There are rules that say ads should be honest about the product, but these rules aren't always followed. To be honest, some ads do show products as they really are. But these are rare because people prefer to buy products that look better in ads, even if they cost more."}

In a difficult environment, someone has more opportunities to stand out than in a simple one. In a simple environment, many people can do their jobs well, and that's what we expect. So, it's not unusual and doesn't lead to success.\n\nOn the other hand, a challenging career means facing many problems and difficulties. The risk is higher. When people take risks, they don't always succeed, but when they do, they stand out and become successful.\n\nAnother important point is that a challenging environment and taking risks help people break out of their daily routine. When people face new and difficult situations, they don't get bored. Their motivation can be very high because of the stakes. This means they may do their jobs with more enthusiasm than in less risky positions. We can get bored doing something we know well, so we might not take our job seriously and focus on other things instead.\n\nSome people may not be suited for a complex environment due to their priorities or qualities.\n\nFor these reasons, I agree with the statement.

I promised myself not to buy bags online again. My parents bought a massage machine they saw on TV. They thought it would be comfortable and relaxing. But when they used it, they didn't feel the same way. The person in the ad seemed happy, but they didn't. My brother also bought a T-shirt online.

We owe our lives to our elders, so we can't ignore them. We've learned to respect our elders and people in our society. That's why I don't agree with the idea that young people don't spend enough time with their communities.\n\nYoung people go to college, studying different subjects like science, commerce, and humanities. But they also do many other things outside of class. There are many clubs and groups started by young people that help with community activities, like protecting the environment and fighting against social problems like corruption. In my university, there are groups like the Nature club, which teaches people about issues like noise pollution and the harm of plastic. They express themselves in different ways, like making banners and holding quizzes. There's another group that speaks out against social problems in my country, like dowry and female foeticide. I'm a member of this group, and we organize activities like trips to local neighborhoods and street plays to spread our message.\n\nYoung people also care about what's happening in their communities and want to make a difference. In my country, college students run for office and help bring important national issues to discussion forums where students can talk about possible solutions. \n\nYoung people also help their communities by coming up with new ideas.

Women would do laundry together by the river and bake bread together. Farmers would get help from others to clean their farms. But when technology came along, people started doing these tasks at home. This has made people a bit lonely. I think this is a bad thing.\n\nOn the other hand, technology has made it easier to help others. For example, if you want to donate to a charity, you don't need to go to the charity or bank. You can just use the internet, type in the address, and enter your credit card number. It's very easy.\n\nOverall, I believe that young people are doing enough to help their communities because of these reasons."}
{"file_id": "1000545.txt", "output_essay": "I don't agree that the best way to travel is with a tour guide. Although group tours are often cheaper and easier, I think traveling alone is a better experience for several reasons.\n\nFirst, group tours take you to very popular places that are crowded with tourists. These areas also attract many local vendors who sell things at high prices. For example, when I went to China, my tour guide took me to a part of the Great Wall called 'Badaling.' It was very crowded, and I didn't enjoy it. On another trip, I went to a different part of the Great Wall that was farther from the city. There were fewer people, and the scenery was more beautiful.\n\nSecond, with group tours, you don't get to choose your schedule. Every visit is planned out, and you can't stay longer than planned. If you do, the bus or tour guide will leave you behind. Visiting the Louvre museum in Paris isn't worth it if you only have time to see the 'Mona Lisa' and not the other paintings.\n\nLastly, I believe that the most interesting part of traveling is meeting local people. When I travel to other countries, I learn a lot about the place, but I also learn about the culture by talking to locals. It may seem strange to see people in China spitting on the street. But once you understand that they do it to get rid of bad things they breathe in, you might think it's smart or at least understandable. Talking to people is how you start to respect their culture.\n\nIn conclusion, based on my experience, I always recommend traveling alone instead of with a guide. This is the best way to discover, understand, and respect a culture."}

I have to go with the group to places I don't want to visit, eat what they tell me to eat, and even use the restroom when they say so. It's like having a boss instead of a guide.\n\nSecond, tour guides often only take you to popular places that make them money. This means you might not be able to find a guide for the places you really want to visit. For example, my friends and I wanted to go to a mountain in our province, but none of the tour companies offered that trip. We had to go on our own.\n\nThird, some people think that traveling with a tour guide saves money. This might be true sometimes. But you have to pay extra for the guide, not just the trip. Also, some guides take you to shops and malls that you don't want to visit, just because they get paid to do so. I've even heard of guides cheating tourists about food and transportation costs.

They all want to make society better, but they focus on different groups of people, so they divide into different kinds of clubs. These clubs recruit new members at the start of the semester and then divide them into groups to plan helping projects. Sometimes, it takes a whole semester to prepare for a big project, which may involve several universities working together during summer or winter break.\n\nThese students do amazing things for their communities and society by donating their ideas and efforts. They do activities like cleaning up a community, giving baths to elderly people who live alone, or offering free tutoring to children in remote areas. How can someone say that young people are not willing to help just because some students spend their time playing computer games or singing at karaoke bars?\n\nHowever, there is still a shortage of volunteers to help communities or society.

Here, signs with information about tourist spots are limited. A guide can provide dates, history, and other details. If you don't hire a guide, your friends might go in different directions, lose the fun of being together, and learn less.\n\nIt's more enjoyable to visit places together. Otherwise, you might get bored. If a group hires a guide, they will likely stay together. So, there's no risk of losing someone on the trip.\n\nThe guide will show you new things in a clear and meaningful way, step by step. Group members might have questions about the monuments. By discussing these questions, you can understand the history better. If you're on a school trip for history class, you can even discuss more topics. The guide won't skip important information to save time and make more money, because they're accountable to the group.\n\nA group can also share the cost of a guide, which means they can hire a better guide than an individual.

This essay will discuss the deceptive nature of advertising and try to find a solution.\n\nMany people have had problems with products they bought because ads only show the good things. They never mention the bad things. Also, because of competition, companies don't want to give all the details about their products in ads. If consumers know too much, they might change their minds and buy something else. Furthermore, with advances in computer technology, ads use special effects to grab our attention. This makes us think the product is perfect or just like the ad.\n\nIn conclusion, most ads are unfair to consumers. Although the ad industry needs improvement, this doesn't mean they can ignore consumer rights or those of other companies trying to compete. Because of this, government agencies and consumer protection boards need to regulate ads, and consumers need to know their rights against companies."}

Also, it can be cheaper than traveling alone.\n\nHowever, traveling with a group can also have its downsides. You have to follow the group's schedule and visit the places they choose.

Unless we find a new source of energy, we should enjoy driving while we still can.\n\nAnother reason is that gas pollutes the air. If we don't stop polluting, we'll be in big trouble. We need to take responsibility for this problem. It's about the survival of humanity! We need to be smart and think about our children.

Helping the community is everyone's responsibility. When people help their community, they improve their surroundings and quality of life.\n\nFor example, many communities need social workers, but young people are not interested. They are too busy with work and school to care about helping others. They would rather have fun than do community work. Young people today prefer not to help their communities because they are interested in other things. They are also less focused on helping because of their ego and what their friends think. They are busy with school and do not have time to help.\n\nIt's not the schools' fault for having a tight schedule. The problem is that young people are not interested in helping their community. It's up to each person to want to help. Few young people want to help their community. Older people are more likely to help because they have less work stress. They have an advantage over young people when it comes to helping their community.\n\nIn conclusion, young people have less time to help their community compared to older people.

So, I think the best way to travel is with a group and a guide.\n\nFirst, guides know a lot. When we travel alone, we have to use guidebooks to learn about what we're seeing. But guides have studied a lot and know more than what's in books. For example, to be a guide in Japan, you need to study Japanese culture. So, they know things we can't learn from books. Like at Guell Park, built by Antoni Gaudi, there's a famous bench that's very comfortable. Our group thought it was another example of Gaudi's genius. But our guide told us it wasn't made by Gaudi, but by someone who worked with him. You won't find that in any book.\n\nSecond, guides know the area well, so we can have special experiences. They know where to eat well, where to buy good gifts, and about local customs. For example, my guide suggested a restaurant, and we ate together. My guide told me that if I showed the chef I was enjoying my meal, they would appreciate it. I did, and I got extra chicken soup for free.\n\nTour guides are experts. They can tell us things not in books. Since they know the area well, we can do things other tourists can't. The best way to travel is with a smart and knowledgeable guide."}

I agree with this statement.\n\nOne reason to support this statement is that trying new things and taking risks can lead to new ideas and better ways to solve problems. For example, Einstein, a famous scientist, always tried new things and found new ways to reach a conclusion. As a result, he gave the world new theories and explanations that nobody knew about. Einstein is one of the greatest scientists ever known.\n\nAnother reason is that doing what we're good at can be like ignoring the changes happening around us. For example, my father was great at making spears. I learned how to make spears from him. But with all the new technology and innovative methods available, I can't say that my way is the best way. Today, machines can make spears faster and more accurately. So, to do things well, we need to understand the changing world around us.\n\nA third reason is that if people don't try new things and take risks, the economy won't grow and will eventually stop. For example, Bill Gates, the founder of Microsoft, took a risk by starting a computer company when many people thought he would fail. He worked hard and succeeded in the end. Microsoft created many jobs and made products that made tasks easier. Microsoft helped the economy grow faster by introducing new technology and creating jobs. Bill Gates is now one of the richest people in the world. If he hadn't taken the risk of starting a new company, he wouldn't be successful.\n\nIn conclusion, people who try new things and take calculated risks succeed. People who only do what they're good at may become successful, but not as successful as those who take risks."}

However, every young person has a role to play in their community. They should serve the community and future generations.\n\nYoung people often benefit from their community.

For example, in developing countries, some students get special privileges because they come from a disadvantaged community. After they succeed, they don't show gratitude to the community and don't try to help it.\n\nBut this is not always the case. Consider an Indian student who goes to the United States for higher education. The student contacts the Indian community at the college beforehand. The community members then help the student settle in, picking them up from the airport and taking care of them for a few days. This community helps other students, and young people are making a difference.\n\nThere are also many young people who try to help their communities. When someone leaves their country and achieves success, they don't forget their roots; they try to help their native community. Take the case of many Non-Resident Indians. These young people help and fund charity organizations in India.\n\nSo, while I agree that young people today don't spend enough time helping their communities, I believe this is not always true.

This means more people have money to spend, and more people need to commute to work. Not everyone will buy a new car, but many will.\n\nSecond, living standards are improving in developed countries. In the past, one car per family was common, but now many families have two or more cars. As living standards rise, the number of cars will too, as parents start buying cars for their children.\n\nThird, some developing countries, like China, are experiencing rapid economic growth. Car sales are also increasing rapidly in China. International companies are moving to China to sell and make cars because they can't keep up with demand. Top economists think this growth will continue for many years. This trend isn't limited to China; it's also happening in other developing countries, like those in South America.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe these factors clearly show that the number of cars will increase, and it will be higher in twenty years than it is now."}

For example, in university, we have two years of specialization. In a big company, each person has a specific job, and this leads to great results. Someone who is very good at one thing will get a good outcome because it's what they're best at. We can see that the best professors, scientists, Nobel winners, and athletes are all experts in their field and don't try to be good at many things. We can also see that when experts work together, each doing what they're best at, it's very important in many areas of our life."}
{"file_id": "1003689.txt", "output_essay": "I don't think there will be fewer cars on the road in twenty years than there are today. Many reasons support my belief. These reasons include the current state of driving, the kind of drivers we have, and the progress being made in driving technology. This essay will explain why I disagree with the idea that there will be fewer cars.\n\nThe way people drive has changed a lot over time. Before cars existed, people used other ways to get around, like boats and horses. The main goal was to move people or things from one place to another. The first car was a big improvement in transportation. It made it faster for people to get where they wanted to go. New technologies are being developed every day, and as cars got faster, people started to focus more on the thrill of speed and less on getting to their destination. This has an impact on the kind of drivers we have.\n\nToday, more young people are interested in cars than ever before. As young adults, they enjoy taking risks and trying new things, and getting a driver's license at a young age doesn't help. In my country, Bahrain, most accidents are caused by young people speeding, and the number of deaths is increasing every year. For drivers who want excitement and adventure, the right technology needs to be developed.\n\nCars are getting faster and better all the time. We should recognize that progress won't stop, and if we consider other factors, we see that cars are needed more than ever. As job requirements related to cars change, so do our expectations of cars. New roads are being built, and faster, more reliable cars need to be designed for these roads.\n\nNo matter what is done to reduce the number of cars on the road, such as raising the driving age or investing in other ways to travel, I believe people won't give up cars because of the privacy and efficiency they provide. Logically, if the world is moving forward, we're not going backward, and so in conclusion, I think there will be more cars, not fewer."}

It helps us learn about different things we need in our daily life.\n\nWe shouldn't focus on just one subject because it can limit us in this competitive world. We need to know about many things that are essential to our lives. By learning about various subjects, we can survive anywhere in the world and in any field.\n\nWhen we have good knowledge in many areas, we can understand the importance of each field in our daily life. This knowledge can be useful at least once in our life.\n\nWe should learn about different subjects like literature, arts, science, technology, and pharmacy. These subjects play a vital role in our lives. By learning about many subjects, we can improve our creativity and individuality.\n\nWe should learn various subjects to get a good grip on all the necessary subjects. This helps us survive and cope with the competitive world. By learning and experiencing new things, we can understand any situation that comes our way. We can also develop kindness and humanity towards others.\n\nIt's important to use our knowledge wisely and not misuse it. We should use our knowledge to develop our country, not destroy it. Therefore, I agree that having broad knowledge about various subjects is important. It helps us know what we need in our lives. By learning about many subjects, we can later specialize in one area that interests us, which can help our careers.\n\nMany engineers and IT professionals are now working in software fields because they have experience in many areas."}
{"file_id": "1009929.txt", "output_essay": "First, I want to make it clear that marketing and publicity aim to show the good side of products. So, it's natural to find that most ads make products seem better than they really are. However, this is about how consumers feel, not the ad creators' problem.\n\nIf an ad tells lies or gives wrong information, it can be a problem. For example, if a detergent ad compares two types of detergents, it must show the true result. There are laws that protect consumers from abuse and misinformation.\n\nBecause of these laws, the ad world must be careful with facts and images. Over time, they've developed ways to say great things about their products without lying. They make us think their products are the best, even when they're not.\n\nFor example, beauty ads on TV show supermodels using creams and products that make their skin and hair look great. But we're fooling ourselves if we think using those products will make us as beautiful as the models. That's not the ad people's fault; it's their job to make their products appealing.\n\nFinally, consumers need to be realistic and critical of ads. They should weigh all the facts and knowledge they have to decide if a product is as good as it's presented."}
{"file_id": "1011317.txt", "output_essay": "I believe that most ads make the product they're promoting sound better than it really is. There are three main reasons for this. First, ads are meant to sell the product. Second, ads often leave out important details, like the downsides of a contract. Third, every product has both good and bad qualities, but ads usually only show the good.\n\nTo sell a product, the company has to make it look good, or people will buy a similar product from another company instead. This means the ad will make the product seem better than it is. For example, some creams claim to improve skin, but studies show they don't work and can even harm skin. If the ad told the truth, nobody would buy the cream.\n\nPhone company contracts are a good example of the second reason. They advertise some costs, but not all of them. They have to include the fine print, but it's usually in small letters. If you're not careful, you might think the contract is cheaper than it is.\n\nAds never mention a product's flaws, except when they're required to by law, like with phone contracts. But every product has its good and bad sides, especially when compared to similar products. Ads don't talk about these things, even when other products might be better. That's why independent testers, like computer magazines, review products to show their hidden qualities.\n\nSo, you can't always trust ads."}

I think that if you do what you know and do it well, you can be just as successful as someone who takes risks.\n\nMany people today like to take risks and face challenges, but this can also lead to failure. For example, I had a friend who had a good job as a banker. He had a good position and earned enough money, but he wanted more. He started studying again in a new field and had to give up many comforts he was used to.\n\nUnfortunately, his risk didn't work out well. He took five years to study, but he realized that this field wasn't right for him. He got bad grades and had to retake classes. Now, it's hard for him to get a good job in his field because there aren't many opportunities.\n\nIf he had stayed in his old job, he could be a director by now. I also think that we should treat all people equally and not judge their success based on how they got there.\n\nFor instance, when it comes to a job offer, I think the person who has worked for years in that area and has a lot of experience might be more successful. But people often overlook them and prefer to hire someone who has a more interesting past and took risks to get there.\n\nOn the other hand, taking risks can open up new opportunities that you never thought possible. Given these reasons, I think you can be very successful either way, whether you take risks or stick to what you know."}
{"file_id": "1012047.txt", "output_essay": "I think the statement is interesting, and I will share my thoughts about it below.\n\nIn my opinion, having fewer cars on the road would be good for the health of plants and humans. Cars pollute the air with bad gases and noise. We should also avoid building roads through forests and fields where wild animals live, because it destroys their homes.\n\nInstead of driving alone, people can take the train, bus, bike, or walk. They can also carpool with others.\n\nI think changes in oil availability will force us to make these changes. Oil is running out quickly, and its price will go up a lot. Many car owners won't be able to afford the higher gas prices because their income won't increase.\n\nThis is a big problem for the car industry and related jobs, because many people will lose their jobs.\n\nWhen I think about all this, I believe we should make plans now to solve the problem. First, we can build new ways to transport people and find new resources to replace oil.\n\nMaybe in twenty years, we can drive cars powered by water or sunlight. Cars could have solar panels on the roof, which would not pollute the air.\n\nThat would be great."}
{"file_id": "1006488.txt", "output_essay": "To compare the lives of young people and older people, let's start with a brief description of each.\n\nYoung people like to have fun with friends, go out, play sports, or listen to music. These activities are enjoyable and help them relax after a long day at school or work. However, they need money to do these things. As a result, young people often work hard, even taking on jobs while in high school or university, and spend their money in the evenings and on weekends. They quickly switch from making money to spending it and forget to take time to relax and do simple things like reading a book.\n\nSometimes, young people work nonstop so they can have fun later in life, which is the most extreme case.\n\nOlder people are usually the opposite. Retirees enjoy a slow pace of life without feeling rushed or stressed. They stick to daily routines, which helps them live a settled and enjoyable life. They don't feel like they're missing out when they go to bed early sometimes, which is a problem many young people face.\n\nWhen we compare these two ways of enjoying life, a basic problem arises. If we put an older person in a young person's situation, they would find it extremely stressful. On the other hand, the young person would probably think the older person's life is boring. The main difference is that young people enjoy life at a higher risk of getting stressed and rushed.\n\nIn the end, a young person doesn't enjoy life more than an older person; they just enjoy life in different ways. We should remember that we're talking about stereotypes, and there may be people of all ages who don't enjoy their lives."}
{"file_id": "1002985.txt", "output_essay": "I believe that young people enjoy life more than older people. They are healthy and can do things that older people can only dream of doing when they were young.\n\nFor example, older people can't participate in adventure sports. They can only watch younger people do it. With their health problems and medicines, it's hard to imagine them doing it. Even if they want to and have the brains to do it, their bodies can't keep up.\n\nIt's easier for young people to try new things, but it's harder for older people. As people get older, their way of thinking changes. They prefer to guide rather than do things themselves. Most people don't like being guided; they want to learn by trying. This creates a gap between older and younger people. When you don't have many people around, life isn't enjoyable.\n\nHave you ever wondered why athletes and workers retire at a certain age? It's because they can't do their jobs as well as they used to. An older person has to make way for a younger one, whether they like it or not. Imagine a coach who used to be a great player but can't play anymore. He's there to give orders, not because he's not good, but because he can't do it anymore.\n\nThis can be explained by biology too. As people get older, their senses start to decline, and these are the only way to connect with the world. How can you expect someone to enjoy life in this condition? With age, the body wears down, and it takes longer to heal. Older people can't enjoy things fully.\n\nEveryone has heard their parents or grandparents say, 'Those were the best days of my life.' They smile when they talk about their youth. You can't ask for better proof than that.\n\nSo, it's clear that young people enjoy life more than older people do."}
{"file_id": "1005231.txt", "output_essay": "I strongly believe that students should focus on understanding ideas and concepts rather than just memorizing facts. Memorizing facts without understanding the idea behind them may seem easy at first, but it doesn't help in the long run. For example, if you just memorize math problem solutions in primary school, you'll have to memorize new ones every year. But if you understand the concept, you can apply it and get good grades easily. I learned this from my own experience. I only studied word problems in primary 6 and never had to study them again. Just memorizing facts not only limits your understanding but also stops you from thinking deeply and growing mentally. If we don't ask ourselves questions and try to find answers, we're blocking our own progress. For example, if Newton didn't ask himself why the apple fell, he wouldn't have discovered his theory. Understanding a subject deeply not only helps you understand it clearly but also makes you interested in it. What's better than enjoying what you're doing? Every skill requires practice, time, and interest. Learning is an art, just like painting or doing science. For example, if you understand what titration is in chemistry, you'll enjoy doing it in the lab and seeing the results. Another example is understanding cancer. If you know how it works at a cellular level, it's fascinating to study it and see the results. Learning a technique makes you a worker, but learning a subject makes you a scientist. So, in-depth knowledge is not just important, it's necessary. Memorizing facts makes you a worker, but understanding concepts makes you a master of the subject, and that's what takes you far."}

I agree with this statement based on my personal experience. I once bought a set of roller pens. The ads said they wrote in 0.7, but when I used them, they were not even 0.3. I believe the problem is the production company. They try to make their products seem as good as possible to attract more customers.\n\nWhen a product does not live up to its claims, customers return it to the store, and the store returns it to the company. This happens many times, and the company's reputation suffers. They may not be able to sell products under the same name in the future. It seems they are only after short-term profits. If so, they succeed. But exaggerating what a product can do leads customers to try it before buying. This is a problem."}

But what's behind their attractive surfaces? That's the question that often confuses customers and makes them wonder. Unfortunately, what we get is often not what we expected, and we realize the product isn't as good as advertised.\n\nFor example, a famous car company once showed a commercial where their car drove on water around Mount St. Michel in France. It was impressive, but when the car came out, it didn't meet the company's standards.\n\nFood ads are especially misleading. Delicious-looking foods are often presented as incredibly tasty, but they may not be safe or taste good. The reason is that marketing is a big and expensive business. Marketers try to make products sound as good as possible, rather than telling the truth about them.\n\nA lot of money is spent on advertising, and sellers work hard to make their ads effective. As in life, we can find some good in ads if we look at them the right way. Maybe one day, we won't worry about whether ads are true or not. We can just enjoy the stories they tell."}

If we use a car beyond fifteen years, it may pollute the air.\n\nOur government is taking steps to ensure that cars are used for only fifteen years. After that, they must be returned to the showroom or thoroughly checked to prevent pollution.\n\nThe demand for petrol has increased a lot. We need petrol to run our vehicles.

The number of vehicles is increasing every day, making traffic worse. In fact, it's often faster to walk than to drive.

If your job is very competitive, it's hard to succeed. You should consider a new job with a unique idea that nobody else has thought of.\n\nSecond, successful businesspeople often have unusual ideas, like inventing the light bulb or creating the internet. If you're good at something, many others can do it too.

You can also achieve great success if you spend a lot of time on it. It's better to focus on one subject than to try to learn many things and end up forgetting them.\n\nSecond, specializing in one subject can be very challenging.

Then, I will summarize my points.\n\nFirst, let's ask why people use tour guides. One reason might be that people don't have a lot of time to visit a place, so they want to make the most of their time. In that case, tour guides show them the most popular sights, and they can see a lot in a short time. I think this is a good idea for a short trip.\n\nHowever, there's a big problem with this. When you're trying to see a lot in a short time, every visit is planned and timed. If you want to learn more about a sight, it's hard because the group might be leaving, or you might not have enough time. So, if you want to really understand a place or sight, a tour might not be the best choice.\n\nTo conclude, I think traveling with a tour guide can be good or bad, depending on what you want from your trip. If you want to really understand a place, you might want to choose a different way to travel. But if you want to see the main sights in a short time, a tour guide might be the way to go."}

This is clear when you look at the history of McDonald's and the book 'Le Papillon'. \n\nThe owner of McDonald's, Mr. Kroc, started with just a restaurant like many others. But he wanted to make more money, so he came up with the idea of fast food. He made food quickly to fit the busy lifestyle of his customers.

People liked it, and today McDonald's is one of the most famous restaurants in the world. It was a risky idea, but Kroc had the vision to see into the future and try new things. \n\nIn the book 'Le Papillon', the author Bernard Werber shows that trying new things can open up new possibilities. The characters in the book are unhappy with their world because of the corrupt media and selfish people. One of the characters, a scientist, comes up with an idea to escape the earth. Not many people were willing to fund his project because it was too risky. But a rich businessman stepped up and funded the project. The project was a huge success, and those who took the risk got to leave the earth. \n\nThe game I play also shows that taking risks can lead to greater rewards.

{"file_id": "1011805.txt", "output_essay": "I strongly believe that learning facts is more important than understanding ideas and concepts for students. There are three reasons to support my view.\n\nFirstly, people are generally better at learning facts than understanding ideas and concepts. Facts are specific, while concepts are abstract. For instance, we can tell a valuable painting from a worthless one by how realistic it looks. Experts, on the other hand, judge a painting's value by its colors and techniques. We may not understand the key elements in Van Gogh's painting because we don't even know what he drew.\n\nSecondly, it's easier for students to learn from a teacher than on their own. A teacher can provide specific examples and facts to explain a new concept, making it easier for students to understand.\n\nThirdly, learning facts is not affected by part-time jobs. Many students take part-time jobs while in school because they provide social skills that can't be learned from books or classes. Plus, they get to learn while earning money.\n\nHowever, understanding ideas and concepts is also essential for students. Subjects like math, science, history, and social science require students to learn new things. If someone can't read, write, or do basic math, they won't learn anything, even if they know many facts.\n\nIn conclusion, I think understanding ideas and concepts is just as important as learning facts. We can develop both skills at the same time."}

All subjects are important to me, and I think they will help me in the future, like when I take the university entrance exam and look for a job. I have two reasons for this.\n\nFirst, I think it's great to study many subjects. For example, I'm in high school now, and I enjoy studying all my subjects. It's fun to learn new things and get smarter. My English class helps me speak better, my History class helps me listen better, and I like talking to my friends in other classes. Each subject has its own benefits. So, I want to study all of them, and I think it's boring to focus on just one.\n\nSecond, knowing many subjects is not a waste of time. We can use what we learn everywhere. When we take the university exam and when we look for a job, all subjects are useful. Some people think it's not important for kids to study extra subjects like physical education, music, and art. But I think they're all important because they're fun and help us enjoy learning. I think it's important to enjoy what we study, not just focus on required subjects like English, Math, and Science. The extra subjects also show what we know, and they'll be helpful when we communicate with others.\n\nFor these reasons, I support the idea that it's better to know a little about many subjects than to be an expert in one.

For instance, I work in the forest industry, and I studied forestry, so I know a lot about timber, plants, and wood.\n\nSecond, in today's fast-paced world, if you want a high-paying job and a good lifestyle, you need to be an expert in one area.\n\nConsidering everything, it's best to specialize in one area and use that knowledge to have a successful career. That's why I'm choosing to do so."}
{"file_id": "1011110.txt", "output_essay": "In today's society, people typically spend 6 to 12 years in school to learn. The main goal is to gain knowledge. Some students think understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning facts, so they focus on understanding. I disagree with that. I think facts are just as important as ideas and concepts. You can't have one without the other when it comes to learning.\n\nFirst, we need to know why we're learning. Everyone knows the purpose is to gain knowledge. But what do we do with that knowledge? We should use it to develop our skills and abilities, which we can use in our jobs and daily lives. For example, if a student thinks understanding ideas is more important than learning facts, they might ignore the importance of facts. Then, they won't want to learn them. After they graduate, they might know many concepts, but they'll struggle to find a good job. This is because they can't apply their knowledge in the real world. So, learning facts is crucial for students' futures.\n\nOn the other hand, learning facts helps students understand ideas and concepts. We all know that ideas and concepts are made up of words and formulas, which can be boring. But when students learn facts about these concepts, they become more interested and understand them faster. So, facts are helpful for students to learn.\n\nLastly, students can learn from the experiences and lessons in facts. Facts are events, past happenings, or examples of failed attempts. These are very important. If students don't learn from facts, they'll learn from their own mistakes in the future.\n\nIn conclusion, learning facts is very important for students. No one can ignore them."}
{"file_id": "1012427.txt", "output_essay": "I completely agree with the statement. Everyone, whether successful or not, needs to try new things and take risks. If they only do what they know, they won't learn anything. Successful people try new things and take risks, which is the right thing to do. For example, a scientist who discovers a new medicine for humans. If they only make medicines we already have, it's not a discovery, and they're not needed. They need to find new medicines, which takes risks because they test on animals. Another example is successful students. Why are they successful? They try new things, like reading many books and talking to teachers. It's risky to take extra exams that aren't required. If students don't read a lot and evaluate themselves, how can they be successful? They'll stay the same without studying new things. They can't just study what they know well. Otherwise, they won't be open-minded. I have a personal story about this topic. I'm trying new things and taking risks. I came to America to study. I'm trying to learn new cultures and languages. I'm not successful yet, but I'm trying to be. It's also a risk for me because my parents can't afford for me to study at a university in America. The tuition is too high. My parents have to take care of me and my brother. International students can't work off-campus, and I couldn't find a job on-campus. This is a big challenge for me to study abroad. So, I agree with the statement."}

They go on trips for different reasons, like a businessman taking his wife on vacation or a kid wanting to explore the planet. When you travel to a new place, you need to prepare, and a tour guide can show you the local sights. But is this the best way to travel?\n\nI don't think so. I believe it takes away the fun and adventure of traveling.\n\nWhen I travel with my friends and family, I want to have a good time and see new things. I also like the feeling of being free to go anywhere, anytime. But with a tour guide, you have to follow a plan and visit places you might not want to see. Sometimes, the guide is not just for you, and you have to follow a group.\n\nI remember a time when I went on a guided tour of Paris. I got stuck in an art museum I didn't want to visit. I had no car and no money for a taxi, so I had to stay with the group and got bored.\n\nI also like backpacking, which means traveling from place to place without a plan, staying in hostels, and not having to follow a map. If I had a tour guide, it would take away the adventure and excitement of backpacking.\n\nIn conclusion, following a tour guide is a good way to see a city's sights, but it's not for everyone, like me, who likes to take risks and have new experiences."}

I believe it's better to have a good understanding of many subjects rather than being an expert in just one.\n\nKnowing a little about many things helps us see the big picture and make connections between different ideas. This gives us more options to find solutions to problems.\n\nThe more skills we have, the more things we can do. We don't have to be perfect at everything, but knowing enough to handle different situations is important.\n\nOn the other hand, focusing too much on one thing can limit our abilities. For example, a brain surgeon who doesn't know basic plumbing might not be able to handle an emergency at home. I'm not saying they need to take a plumbing course, but knowing some basics can help them take care of things until they get help.\n\nOverall, learning a little about many things makes us more flexible and better prepared to handle life's challenges."}

The goal of testing is to see how well we understand and can apply these ideas. My professors didn't want students to pass the class without understanding the main ideas.\n\nA Korean newspaper reported that successful students understand the ideas and concepts of a subject, not just the facts. In an experiment, researchers divided 100 high school students into two groups. One group studied only concepts and ideas, while the other group studied only facts. The result was that 40 out of 50 students in the ideas group got A's, while only 10 out of 50 students in the facts group got A's.\n\nAfter reading about this experiment, I focused on understanding the main ideas of the material. As a result, my grades improved. I think understanding ideas and concepts is more important than just learning facts. Getting good grades is not the only goal for students.

I agree that young people don't spend enough time helping their communities.\n\nThere are several reasons for this.\n\nFirst, most young people don't know their neighbors because they don't have a chance to meet them. In the past, people in Japan did everything with their community members. They were like family, so they made important decisions together, like rebuilding a house or changing a job. They helped each other in their communities. However, people today are not interested in others and don't want to connect with their neighbors because of recent bad incidents.\n\nSecond, older and younger families have different views. If they have a chance to do something together in their communities, they often disagree. This is natural because people tend to avoid complicated problems. As a result, they don't spend enough time helping their communities and don't connect with each other.\n\nWhen I was a child, I had to clean up the park where I played with my friends for a community event. This was a task for kids. Many adults watched us, and another day, many adults taught sports for the community club. I agree that many young people don't spend time on their communities, but we should change this habit to improve relationships between neighbors and me. If accidents happen in daily life, people nearby help first. People help each other and build good relationships in their communities."}
{"file_id": "1016100.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with the statement. Successful people always look for new things that others have not done. They are not afraid to fail. Taking big risks leads to huge success. To be successful, I think two more things are necessary besides trying new things and taking risks.\n\nAmbition is essential for success. Let's take Ichiro Suzuki, a Japanese baseball player in the US, as an example. He is one of the most successful Japanese players. Everyone knows he is an incredible baseball player. However, he had a strong ambition to be the best player in the world since he was a kid. He wanted to be a baseball player and worked very hard. Without ambition, Ichiro might have been only a good player in Japan.\n\nEffort is also crucial. Even with big dreams, people cannot succeed without hard work. For instance, I have a dream to study abroad to improve my skills and learn a language. It's not just about having the dream; I need to put in the effort. I need to study hard for TOEFL, which is not easy. My ambition will motivate me to study, but ultimately, it's the effort that brings success.\n\nAs you can see, I agree with the statement. However, I think two more things are important to be successful. People who only do what they know well are not challenging themselves. If you want to succeed, you need to try new things, take risks, have ambition, and put in the effort."}

This might seem surprising, given that car ownership is growing rapidly worldwide. However, I will explain why I think this is the case.\n\nCar prices have been dropping slightly over the past few decades. Originally, cars were a luxury item only the rich could afford. Today, they are affordable for almost anyone in industrialized countries.\n\nHowever, this change has led to two major problems: rising oil prices and harm to the environment.\n\nFirst, since cars are now sold in big countries like China and India, the demand for them has skyrocketed. This has driven up fuel prices. Oil companies are extracting oil in more and more extreme ways, but there's not enough oil to meet the demand. As a result, prices have risen.\n\nToday, even oil sites that are hard to reach or expensive to use are being tapped. I believe oil prices will continue to rise, making cars too expensive for most people. This will lead to a significant decrease in the number of cars on the road.\n\nThe only solution to this problem is to find alternative energy sources. However, research in this area has been slow, and our energy future looks bleak.\n\nFurthermore, the widespread use of cars has led to a huge increase in pollution. Cars are not an environmentally friendly way to travel. If their numbers continue to grow, it could lead to disaster. Some scientists even think that governments might ban cars to protect the environment.\n\nIn summary, I think the number of cars will increase in the short term, but eventually, they will become too expensive and too harmful to the environment. At that point, there will be fewer cars on the road than there are today."}

I believe young people do not spend enough time helping their community, and here's why.\n\nFirst, young people have a hard time finding a job and making a living on their own. For example, I worked at Goldman Sachs in Tokyo from 1996. At that time, the Japanese economy was struggling, and it was tough for young people to find a job. I was lucky to find a good job, but I had to work long hours every day without much rest. In this situation, young people don't have enough time to help their community.\n\nSecond, many communities are not strong. For example, I live in Roppongi, Tokyo, where many young people work long hours. Here, people don't think about their community much. They don't think about helping their community, so they don't spend time doing it.\n\nSome people might think differently about rural areas, but many young people agree with me.

Society needs to step up and help the poor. For example, if we help someone in need, we should encourage them to do more, or help them as much as we can.\n\nThe problem is that if young people focus on helping their community, they might forget about their education and not be able to focus on their studies. They might not be helpful to the country.\n\nMany young people today don't help their communities because no one motivates them. Everyone wants to do their own thing and be happy. Young people especially love to have fun.\n\nTo get young people to help, someone needs to motivate them to take the lead. Then, they will make time to help their community.\n\nI want to say that young people need to do all the tasks required of them, including helping their community. This way, they can learn about their responsibilities. If we suddenly ask them to help, they might not be interested.\n\nIf young people work for their community, they can build a better country and make a good name for themselves. They need to improve their helping nature by motivating others.\n\nEverything has its good and bad sides.\n\nGood things: Young people can learn about their responsibilities and inspire others. They can easily connect with others and get help when they need it.\n\nBad things: Young people might fall behind in their education if they focus on helping their community.

I think it's better to travel alone or with a few friends or family members.\n\nFirst, when we travel on our own, we can make our own schedule. We can choose where we want to go and plan the best route. Last month, my son and I went to Spain and picked the places we wanted to visit. We used the subway to get around and saw historical sites and museums. If we wanted to change our plan, we could stop and make a new one. For example, after we saw Gaud\u00ed's famous Cathedral in Barcelona, my son wanted to see more of his work, so we decided to visit other buildings instead of going to the Picasso museum.\n\nSecond, we can go to places that interest us. In Granada, we visited an old town called Albaic\u00edn. This town is on a hill and has narrow roads, making it hard for big tour groups to visit. If I were a tour guide, I might get lost in the maze-like roads. But looking back, this town was the most exciting and attractive place for us. If we had gone on a group tour, we wouldn't have been able to visit this amazing historical town.\n\nFor these reasons, I prefer traveling on my own or with a few people. We can go where we really want to go and enjoy what we really want to see. My trip to Spain with my son was one of the most memorable trips I've ever had."}

Cars make people think of wealth and happiness. They are also part of some dreams and fantasies, like in movies.\n\nNext, cars are very helpful. They are a convenient and flexible way to travel. I don't think there's another invention that lets people move around so easily. You can also carry more personal things in a car than on a plane or train.\n\nFinally, laws against car pollution haven't worked well. I think this will continue in the future.

In this essay, I will share my thoughts on this issue. I believe in the power of specialization and disagree with the idea that knowing a little about everything is better.\n\nThe academic environment is changing, and I think it's moving towards specialization. Specialization means knowing every detail about one subject. In my country, Turkey, there's a saying that it's better to know everything about one subject than to know a little about many subjects. I believe in this message.\n\nSpecializing in one subject has many advantages. For example, in university, I had to choose between studying business administration or international trade. I chose international trade because I wanted to specialize in it. Now, I see the benefits of this choice. Many companies are looking for international trade specialists.\n\nAnother advantage of specialization is that it's clear what you do and what you're interested in. If someone asks you about your job, you can give a clear answer. For example, if doctors aren't specialized, they can't say what they're experts in.\n\nIn conclusion, specialization is the way to go."}

Every company's marketing team tries to create a successful ad to sell more products.

For example, they might use kids and a happy family in an ad for a family car. This makes the husband think, 'That's the perfect car for my family. I'll buy it next week.'\n\nYou can see ads like this everywhere - during movie breaks or between TV shows. They all want you to buy their product.\n\nTake an ad for a washing machine, for instance. It might say, 'This is the cheapest washing machine in the world! You'll save a lot of money!' But the truth is, it might not be a good deal. You might end up paying more for water and electricity because of its poor technology.\n\nThe people in charge of marketing try to make their product look like the best. They want to sell more than other companies.\n\nThat's why consumers need to make their own decisions about which product is best for them. The best way to do this is to not listen to or watch too many ads.

A tour guide knows the area well and can show us hidden gems we might not find on our own. For example, when I went on a school trip to China, our guide took us to beautiful forests and rivers that we wouldn't have seen otherwise.\n\nSecond, a tour guide can help us communicate with locals when we travel abroad. Many tour guides speak the local language fluently, so they can translate for us. This is especially helpful when we don't speak the language ourselves. Without a guide, it's hard to communicate with locals and learn about their culture.\n\nLastly, traveling in a group gives us a chance to meet new people who share similar interests. It's a great opportunity to make new friends, especially for someone like me who doesn't often meet new people. As a university student, I usually see the same people every day, so it's nice to meet someone new who shares my interests.\n\nIn conclusion, I prefer to travel in a group with a tour guide because it allows me to visit new places, communicate with locals, and make new friends."}

A recent health study showed that people who get stuck in traffic are more stressed, which affects their personal and work lives.

This helps us learn and succeed in new areas. If we don't try new things, our knowledge will stay limited to what we already know.\n\nFor example, if people didn't try to understand the human body, we wouldn't have made so much progress in medicine.\n\nThis shows that even though there are risks involved in learning and mastering new areas, it's necessary for progress.\n\nHowever, sometimes people who take risks end up regretting it.

For example, cars are not used very efficiently. On average, only 1.5 people use a car at a time worldwide. This is much less than the number of people who can use a train, ship, or plane. Cars also cause traffic problems that are not seen with other modes of transportation.\n\nWhile cars offer more flexibility than other modes of transportation, this may change in the future. In twenty years, planes and trains may become cheaper and more frequent, making them a more appealing option. Additionally, cars require a lot of maintenance, which can be expensive.\n\nCars also harm the environment, which is a major concern. They need oil to run, and this contributes to global warming.

Other industries may take advantage of the growing demand for alternative transportation and develop new technologies that make them more appealing than cars."}

You need to decide what subject you prefer and understand it well before you can specialize in it.\n\nSpecializing is the next step. This is crucial because the world is moving fast, and we need people who are organized in their field. We need people to do their best work, and to do that, they need to specialize. For example, an economist needs to know math and economic history well, so they need to study that subject a lot.\n\nAt the same time, they also need to know other things. This isn't just because the system requires it, but because I think having an open mind is important to become a complete person. Having a wide range of knowledge helps open our minds.\n\nIn my opinion, this is a tool to change the future."}

Some people prefer to travel alone because they don't have to adjust their schedule for others and can make their own decisions. However, I believe it's better to travel with a tour guide.\n\nWhen we visit a new place, everything is unfamiliar. That's why we need a tour guide who knows the area well. They can create a great schedule and manage our time. All we have to do is follow the plan. I think this is convenient and saves us time.\n\nTraveling with a group also offers more exciting experiences. We can share our thoughts, take great photos together, and enjoy our free time more. Since we live in a social world, group travel can help us build relationships.\n\nIn conclusion, due to these two reasons, I think the best way to travel is with a tour guide and a group of people."}
{"file_id": "1014908.txt", "output_essay": "I agree that ads make products seem better than they really are. They use famous people, perfect results, and amazing situations to make their product look good.\n\nAds often claim amazing results. For example, a fairness cream ad might say it will make you fair in six weeks, but the real results are not that great. So, the ad makes the product seem better than it is.\n\nAds also use famous people to promote their products. They hire a movie star or sports celebrity to endorse their product. This gets people's attention, and they don't really think about the product itself. They just think the product is good because their favorite star uses it. It doesn't matter if the product is not that good. What matters is that a famous person is using it.\n\nIn ads, models often do amazing things after using the product. For example, an ad might show someone doing cool stunts after drinking a certain drink. This makes the product and its users look cool, and it appeals to young men. They want to use the product because it's associated with cool people, and they want to be cool too.\n\nAds also barely mention the bad things about their products. For example, in an ad for investments, the bad things are mentioned quickly, so viewers don't really notice. This focuses attention on the good things.\n\nSo, ads make products seem better by using famous people, making exaggerated claims, and using psychological tricks."}

I have many reasons why I don't think they're right, and I'll explain a few main ones.\n\nFirst, we can learn ideas and concepts while learning facts. Teachers can teach students ideas and concepts by teaching a specific fact. For example, in a physics class, the teacher gives the students a problem to solve. If they can't solve it, the teacher can give them some ideas to help them solve it. Then, the students can learn the concept and solve the problem.\n\nNext, why do we learn ideas and concepts? We learn them to use them in real life. So, why not learn something more practical? Learning facts helps us do things directly, and it saves time. We don't have to waste time studying theories or concepts.\n\nFinally, learning facts is sometimes more useful than learning concepts. For example, imagine we're learning to fix a bike. From books, we might only know how to fix general problems. But when we face a special problem, like a bike making noise everywhere, what can we do? We might feel confused trying to fix it.\n\nIn conclusion, learning facts can save us a lot of time. Since we learn to work, studying facts might be more useful than studying ideas and concepts. Considering all these points, it's better to learn facts than to understand ideas and concepts."}

One reason is that Japanese society offers many distractions, such as video games and studying. Some young people just aren't interested in helping others.\n\nOlder people often say that in the past, young people had more time to help their communities. However, times have changed, and many young people don't want to help or care about their communities. Even if their parents don't care, they might not encourage their children to get involved.\n\nOn the other hand, Japanese students study very hard and have little time for community work. In fact, students in Asia, including Japan, study much harder than those in North America. I've seen young Americans helping their communities, and my American friends tell me that Japanese students study harder than they do.\n\nIn Japan, we have a serious problem called the 'Hikikimori Phenomenon.' Many young people, including young adults, stay at home all day, often in their rooms. They have no interest in the outside world and don't work, go to school, or leave their homes.\n\nIn conclusion, young people today don't have time to help their communities because of the changing times, their busy study schedules, and this serious problem."}
{"file_id": "1019727.txt", "output_essay": "One of the main problems with the education system in Italy is the huge amount of material we have to learn in all subjects. From my experience, most of what we learn in school is forgotten right after we study it. I agree that it's more important for students to understand the main ideas. A famous Italian writer said that what we call culture is not just what we remember from school, but the mix of all our experiences and ideas. It doesn't matter if we forget some small details from years ago.\n\nIn my opinion, a good teacher should help students understand history, for example, by making it interesting and relatable, not just by teaching dates and names. They should try to make the student imagine what life was like back then. We can say the same for most subjects, except maybe math and physics.\n\nWe can forget facts we learned because they might not be useful in our daily lives, so we never get to use them. But if we understand the main idea, we'll never forget it. It's more important for students to get a feel for things and develop their passions and interests.\n\nIn conclusion, Italian schools (and I think this is a problem in other countries too) should teach students to value what they don't know and open doors to new worlds for them to explore on their own, based on their interests."}

This is because ideas are useful and stay with us for a long time.\n\nFirst, when we understand ideas and concepts, we can use them in our daily lives. For example, when we learn about Plato, it's not just about his age or book titles. If we understand his philosophy, we gain a new perspective, and old ideas relate to our present life, making it better.\n\nSecond, understanding ideas and concepts helps us remember them easily. For instance, think about Chinese characters we learned in elementary school. When we learned to write them, we also learned their origins. That's why we can remember them easily when we understand the ideas behind them.\n\nIn conclusion, understanding ideas is more important than learning facts. It gives us new ideas and makes our life better."}

This is because we're running out of oil, and that makes oil prices go up and up.\n\nIn Europe, people are very concerned about the environment, and cars are seen as a major threat to it. So, I think that in twenty years, there will be fewer cars in Europe, Japan, and the United States. However, I believe that in developing countries like those in Africa and South America, the number of cars will not decrease as much. This is because cars are still very important for their economy.\n\nIn these countries, people need cars to get to work, whereas in richer countries, people are used to taking public transportation like subways, buses, and trams. But if everyone in poorer countries starts buying cars, the total number of cars worldwide will increase dramatically.\n\nAnother issue is lobbying. The car industry has a lot of influence in the United States, so they won't let the government make laws to limit the number of cars per family. This means that if someone wants to reduce the number of cars, they'll have to fight against politicians and the car industry.\n\nI think that in twenty years, there will be a big conflict between environmental groups and car manufacturers like General Motors, Ford, and VW. I'm sure that organizations like Greenpeace will become more important because everyone wants to protect the environment.\n\nI also think that the number of cars can decrease in twenty years because traffic is a huge problem in big cities like Paris and New York City. That's why cars are banned in central London, and I'm sure that many Londoners will sell their cars and not buy new ones. Cars have become useless in London. I heard that Paris is planning to do the same, which shows that the number of cars in Europe will decrease.\n\nIn conclusion, while the number of cars will decrease in some parts of the world in twenty years, it will remain important in others."}

Others believe young people are more energetic and enjoy life more. I agree with the second view. There are many reasons to support this idea, and I will explain a few of them.\n\nFirst, young people have more energy than older people. We can see this in the entertainment industry. Young people care about movies, music, and celebrities. They spend a lot of their free time talking and watching them. They are also physically able to do so for a long time. You rarely see older people in a disco bar. In short, young people have more energy, so they can enjoy life more.\n\nSecond, young people are more creative than older people. This is clear in teenagers. Research shows that young people's brains are still developing, so they can easily accept new things. For example, young people are the main users of the Internet. No wonder people call young people the rising sun. Their creativity helps them enjoy life the most.\n\nIn conclusion, it's easy to see that young people can enjoy life more than any other age group because of their energy and creativity. However, we should also encourage older people to learn from the young and never give up on life."}

It has been important for almost a century, and it's becoming even more important today. The reason is that developing countries are growing their industries, and the car industry is a major part of that.\n\nMore and more cars are being built every day, and they'll be on our streets soon. For example, Asian countries are becoming very powerful in this area. We all know brands like Toyota and Honda. If we look around, we'll see how common it is to see people driving these cars.\n\nOther developed countries are not stopping either. They're trying to catch up and are making new cars too. For example, we have Volkswagen and BMW in Germany, and Chevrolet and General Motors in the United States.\n\nThey're all trying to be more competitive, so they're making new cars and selling more cars too.\n\nThe car industry is important to every country's economy today, so I think we'll see a lot more cars in the future. In twenty years, I don't think this problem will be solved.\n\nBut we're also seeing more concern about the environment. More organizations are opening to protect our planet. Greenpeace was the first, but not the last.\n\nIn my opinion, it's also becoming a political strategy. We might have a solution to the environmental damage: new kinds of cars that don't pollute as much. For example, electric cars.\n\nTo conclude, I think economic strategies won't let the car industry disappear, but they might find new ways to combine a strong economy with protecting the environment."}
{"file_id": "1013913.txt", "output_essay": "Today, people are discussing whether young people spend enough time helping their communities. \n\nFrom my experience as a student at The American University in Cairo (AUC), I believe that young people do spend enough time making their communities better.\n\nFirst, I want to give examples of how AUC students help their small community, which is the AUC campus. Before the new school year starts, students form groups to help new freshmen. These groups show new students around the campus, introduce them to the university's rules and services, and tell them about extracurricular activities. They also help new students get familiar with the campus. Another way AUC students help their small community is by joining groups that raise money for campus activities.\n\nOn the other hand, AUC students also help their larger community. The university has many clubs run by students that aim to make life better in Egypt. For example, there's the Help Club, which helps poor people in Egypt by collecting donations and buying them food, clothes, and homes. The Cancer Club collects donations to support cancer patients. The Hand in Hand Club visits elderly people and tries to make them happy. It's clear that AUC students play a vital role in helping their larger community.\n\nFrom these examples, we can see that young students at AUC feel connected to their communities and are enthusiastic about helping and serving them."}

My friend Kate bought a shower gel that promised to make her skin smooth like silk, but it didn't work. Another example is the LCD TVs that salespeople push, promising a great view and lots of light, but then you find out you need to pay extra to see it.\n\nIn the past, I argued with people who sold these kinds of things. I'm not saying all ads are bad, sometimes products really are great. But I hate it when people lie and promise something that's not true.\n\nI don't like people who lie, and I think those who cheat others should face legal action, especially when they handle other people's money.\n\nI think it's important for economies to be transparent, because that's the first step for people to trust their governments and make the world a better place.\n\nIn my opinion, we need laws that make ads trustworthy and clear, so people can buy things without bad surprises."}

But understanding how physics explains the Earth's movement is harder.\n\nFinally, there's always new research in each area. When we think we understand an idea, a new theory comes along to explain it. For example, Pluto is no longer considered a planet.

When you travel with a tour guide, you might miss the most important things about the places you visit.\n\nA tour guide will take you to popular areas, and you can take pictures in front of famous landmarks. But you can also do that with a photo edit and put yourself anywhere you want.\n\nWhat makes travel special is the people you meet and the new cultural experiences they share with you. The people make a place unique, and they give it its own personality, whether it's through buildings or food.\n\nIf you talk to locals, you can discover many new wonders. Let's take Germany as an example. In the region of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, there's a famous castle that inspired Disney's Cinderella Castle. It's beautiful, but there's not much to see, and you'll likely wait in line with many other people. Meanwhile, you could be visiting other, nicer castles in a more relaxed way.\n\nFood is another reason to travel on your own. You'll find McDonald's everywhere, but if you're with a tour guide, you might only get to eat at expensive restaurants or have fast food. If you take the time, locals will appreciate it, and you might even get to eat at someone's home. That's the best food of all.\n\nThere are many reasons to travel on your own, rather than with a tour guide. But in the end, it's up to you to decide what's best.

However, without knowing the facts, it's hard to form a personal opinion.\n\nIn science, this statement doesn't work. You can't discuss a scientific idea without knowing the specific facts, like rules and laws, that relate to it.\n\nIn my opinion, facts and concepts are closely connected. You can't have one without the other. I think students should make sure they really understand a fact before giving their opinion, and they should investigate a fact before accepting what others say.\n\nThis issue is related to the problem of historical sources. Scholars have to trust what historians say without being able to check the facts themselves. On the other hand, a critic is someone who can study a fact and then give their opinion about it.\n\nTo give a correct and believable opinion, it's very important to study the facts themselves."}

I have three reasons to support my idea.\n\nFirst, governments are investing more in public transportation. In my city, people buy cars because there are not enough buses and subways, and it makes them late. If the government builds a better public transportation system, fewer people will buy cars. Since the Traffic Mass Action started, the number of cars has already gone down.\n\nSecond, there is not enough crude oil, and it is expensive. We are looking for new oil resources, but it costs a lot to drill for oil in the sea. The war in the Middle East has also made oil prices rise. If we want to drive a car, we have to spend more money on fuel than before.

However, I think this is true, and here's why.\n\nFirst, a famous person in an ad can make us think the product is better than it is. For example, I bought a new car three years ago. I searched online and talked to salespeople for five months. But what really made me buy the car was a TV commercial with Ichiro, a famous Japanese baseball player. I liked him, and I thought buying the car would make me feel close to him. But the car had many problems, and I regret buying it. If Ichiro hadn't been in the ad, I wouldn't have bought it. This shows that a famous person in an ad can make us misunderstand the product.\n\nAlso, ads often only talk about the good things about a product. For example, I bought a new computer last year. The ad said it was the cheapest and latest, so I bought it quickly. But I found out that it didn't come with common software like 'Word' and 'Excel'. Usually, computers in Japan come with this software. The ad didn't mention this problem. If I had known, I wouldn't have bought it.

Although young people in the past also did community service, the desire and need to do it have increased today. There are many reasons why young people do volunteer work.\n\nFirst, they have more opportunities to do community service today. In school, teachers encourage students to sign up for activities like Flag Day or teaching English at local schools.\n\nToday, it's almost a requirement to do community service.

They want to get into good universities, and doing volunteer work gives them an advantage. Universities are impressed when students have done volunteer work, and it can be included in their application. So, many young people in Hong Kong spend their free time doing volunteer work, especially during holidays, to get a government-issued certificate.\n\nOverall, I disagree with the statement that young people today don't help their communities enough.

After considering all aspects, I strongly believe that specialization has more advantages than broad knowledge.\n\nFirstly, specialization makes problem-solving more efficient. It's like asking a mathematician to read Moli\u00e8re or an actor to solve a math problem. I believe each of us has special skills that make us different: one person plays the piano, another cooks well, and I don't see why the pianist should learn to cook. Instead, they should keep improving their piano skills.\n\nAnother reason to support my view is to look at it from a professional perspective. In customer service, there's a difference between 'waiting time' and 'solving time'. By hiring specialists, a company can reduce its 'solving time'. The more specialists they have, the shorter the 'waiting time' will be, because they can handle different problems quickly.\n\nLastly, specialization requires a company to have a good organization. Without it, the special skills of each employee may not be used well. But if a company sets up a good organization and hires specialized workers, its efficiency will improve.\n\nIn conclusion, I strongly believe that specialization is the key to solving some persistent economic and political problems. We need to accept that we can't do everything perfectly. As Billy Wilder said, 'Nobody is perfect!'"}
{"file_id": "1024274.txt", "output_essay": "In my opinion, to understand ideas, we need to support them with facts.\n\nFirst, we can't understand an idea without looking at the facts that make it up. If we learn an idea without knowing the facts, we're just learning something without thinking about it. For example, some people learn about religion without looking at the facts. They just want a simple answer, not a deep understanding.\n\nNext, to understand something, we need to learn the facts and then think critically about them. The only way to start understanding is to start with the facts.\n\nTo understand an idea, we need to know the situation in which it was created. For example, we can't understand communism or Nazism without knowing the history that led to them.\n\nFinally, I think we don't really understand something unless we can prove it with facts. We need to look at the facts to show what we've learned and why we believe it. Scientists need to do experiments to prove their points. If they don't, their ideas won't be believable.\n\nThese are the three reasons why I think there's a strong connection between understanding an idea and learning the facts about it."}
{"file_id": "1017400.txt", "output_essay": "I believe it's better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects rather than specializing in just one.\n\nThere are several reasons why I think this way.\n\nFirst, it's important to make smart choices about our future. Since we're still young, we need to try out different things to figure out what we really want to do. Most university students are unsure about their future.\n\nIn my case, I chose French as my major. After working with French for two years, I was unsure if I made the right choice. So, I took some English classes and talked to a professor about my situation. This helped me think more clearly about my problem. In the end, I decided to double major in English and French. If I hadn't taken those English classes, I wouldn't have known what I really wanted to study.\n\nSecond, people who only know about their major can seem boring. Today, society wants people with many interests and talents. We can learn new things from other subjects. These subjects can help us explore other majors.\n\nFor example, my university has a leisure sports department. Many of my friends, who weren't majoring in leisure sports, took classes in jazz dance and bodybuilding. They had a lot of fun and made great memories.\n\nBy taking classes outside of our major, we can enjoy our time in college and gain new experiences.\n\nUntil we graduate from high school, we don't get to choose what we want to study. So, we should take advantage of the opportunity to try out many subjects and learn new things."}

In my opinion, it's crucial to have people in society who try new things, especially when it comes to innovation. If people didn't take risks, we wouldn't have cars or planes today. Society needs new inventions, but we also need to consider the risks. Take Albert Einstein, for example. He created a lot of value for our society with his inventions. However, if he hadn't been so innovative, would we have nuclear weapons today? As most people are part of a community or company, I'll focus on how companies can be successful in a competitive market. From my perspective, the only way to be successful and sustainable is to be innovative and have innovative employees. Some companies stay in business by doing what they're good at, but to be truly successful, you need to try new things. A company that only does what it knows might not take risks, but it risks being replaced by a more innovative company. There's a famous saying about company management that applies to everyone: 'It's often more important to do the right things than to do things right.' In conclusion, people who try new things are successful, but they need to be aware of the risks."}
{"file_id": "1025558.txt", "output_essay": "While many students think that understanding ideas and concepts is the key to learning, I believe that learning facts is more important.\n\nFirst, facts show students how to apply ideas and concepts from their textbooks. For example, a student who leads a software development team will understand software design and human resource management better than someone who only reads books.\n\nA designer will have a deeper understanding of their job after researching and reviewing many books and articles. They will learn the most important parts of their job by doing hands-on work.\n\nIn addition, students learn more by doing their own experiments. When I worked on our university website, I learned a lot from installing and configuring the web server and writing code. This experience made it easier for me to become an expert in computer science.\n\nLastly, learning facts is more important than just understanding ideas and concepts. Students who can apply what they learn will be better at learning new things and will become quick learners. This is a valuable skill that companies like Microsoft, Google, and IBM look for.\n\nIn conclusion, learning facts is more important than just understanding ideas and concepts in the learning process."}

People have different opinions, and one topic that sparks debate is whether it's better to travel alone or with a tour guide. I think traveling with a guide is better, and I'll explain why.\n\nFirst, a tour guide can teach me more about the places I visit. A guidebook or a phone can't give me the same level of information as a knowledgeable guide. They can show me hidden gems and share stories that I wouldn't find on my own.\n\nSecond, traveling with a guide helps me meet new people. I went on a guided tour and made friends with some of the other travelers. We still keep in touch, and it's nice to have friends who share similar interests and experiences.\n\nLastly, traveling with a guide is safer and more enjoyable. If I'm alone and get hurt, who will help me? If I get lost, who will show me the way? If I feel sick on the bus, who will talk to me? When I'm with a guide, I can ask for help and talk to other travelers.\n\nIn conclusion, traveling with a tour guide has many benefits. I highly recommend it, and I hope others who love traveling will consider it too."}

Without understanding these concepts, it's hard to grasp the main point of a passage or theory. The fact itself is useless if the main idea isn't conveyed to the students. We've all heard funny stories that are meaningless at first, but we laugh and understand the words because they convey an idea or concept. This is more important than just understanding the fact. \n\nFacts can improve our knowledge, but their usefulness is limited. We should try to find the underlying idea and concept to learn the fact more clearly. Without understanding the core of the information, we might misinterpret the fact and remain confused. \n\nMany students read news to stay updated, but they rarely try to understand the main idea of the situation. This lack of understanding leads them to make mistakes when commenting on the issue. They think they know everything, but they're actually making many mistakes.

Some people think it's more important for students to understand ideas and concepts, while others believe learning facts is crucial. In my opinion, it's more reasonable for schools to focus on teaching students how to understand ideas and concepts.\n\nMy main reason is that schools offer the best place for students to learn ideas and concepts with the help of teachers and classmates. Students can discuss and learn from each other in class, which is very important. If teachers only teach facts, the school's advantage is wasted. Moreover, students can learn facts on their own through the internet and documentaries, which often have more up-to-date information than textbooks.\n\nUnderstanding ideas and concepts also helps students solve complex problems. Nowadays, exams require students to apply what they've learned, not just memorize facts. If a student can understand ideas and concepts in high school, they're likely to do better on the College Entrance Examination, which is crucial for their future career.\n\nAdditionally, when students focus on understanding ideas and concepts, they're more likely to discuss and share their opinions with classmates and teachers. This helps improve their communication skills and can even lead to friendships. When students discuss problems together, they may find common interests and become friends.\n\nWhile learning facts is important, I believe understanding ideas and concepts is more important. As mentioned above, it has a greater impact on students' learning and future success."}

However, I believe it's more important for students to understand ideas than to learn facts. This is because students with ideas can explain things more clearly, and they have more time to study than adults.\n\nThere are two main reasons for this. \n\nFirstly, ideas help people explain things in a logical way. For example, my brother studied many ideas in university and can explain why things happen. I, on the other hand, only know facts from experience, and I find it hard to explain things to others. Many people don't understand my explanations, so I think learning ideas is key.\n\nSecondly, students have more time to study ideas than adults do. Even if adults want to learn ideas, it takes a long time. For instance, my brother studied ideas in university, and I wish I had done the same. Now, I'm too busy working to learn ideas properly, and I regret not studying them in university.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe it's more important for students to understand ideas than to learn facts.

You can't compare them.\n\nIn my opinion, older people enjoy their life in a different way now than they did in the past. In the past, parents were stricter with their children than they are today. Older people enjoy their free time by doing things like traveling, walking, reading, or other activities. They don't need to go to a club or disco to have fun.\n\nWhen you're older, you also have more opportunities to enjoy life because you may have more money than younger people.\n\nI think it's sad that young people often enjoy life in a strange way. They often need to drink or take drugs to have fun. I don't think that's a good way to enjoy life.\n\nFor example, my parents didn't enjoy life when they were young like they do now. They became parents early and couldn't have fun like young people do today. But now, their children are adults and don't live at home, so they can take holidays or go to the cinema whenever they want.

Learning ideas and concepts is important because you can remember facts by thinking about the ideas and concepts, and you can learn new facts about a different topic easily.\n\nFirst, memorizing facts can be a quick way to learn. It can work in a short time. You can pass a test, for example. But when you forget a fact, it's hard to remember if you don't know the ideas behind it. If you learn the ideas, you can figure out how the fact works. So, learning ideas helps you remember facts for a long time.\n\nAlso, when you get used to learning how to get a fact from an idea, you can easily learn a new topic. Every class has facts and ideas, and the relationship between them is the same. First, you try to understand the ideas. Then, you can learn the facts easily. You can use the same method to learn new classes.\n\nIn the end, learning ideas is better than memorizing facts, even though it takes more time.

To ride a horse, you need strong muscles, which are often associated with youth. When you're 80, you may not have the strength to ride a horse anymore. I think being able to do something makes you happy, and not being able to do it makes you unhappy. So, when I'm 80 and can't ride a horse, it might make me unhappy.

Young people enjoy life in their own way, and older people enjoy it in their own way too. Older people can think about their experiences because they've lived a long time and have the time to reflect.

In biology, it's hard to learn facts without knowing their purpose in a biological system or process. In history class, knowing the dates of events is important, but understanding the ideas and development of an event helps put it in chronological order.\n\nLearning facts is essential for language students who need to learn vocabulary to improve their language skills. Law and medicine students also need to learn many facts. However, learning facts takes a lot of time and isn't very helpful in a future job. Understanding ideas and concepts is more useful. It's easier to learn and understand than facts. Facts are just pieces of information, and you often don't know how to apply them in important situations.\n\nFor example, if a machine breaks down, it's hard to check every single fact about it. It's easier to think about how the machine works and what it produces. This way, it's much easier to find the problem.\n\nI think students who want to work in a business or process-based industry need to know more about ideas and concepts. It's more important to understand the whole process than to know facts you can easily look up. Understanding ideas and concepts helps you think about problems and find solutions. This skill makes you attractive to many employers.\n\nIn my opinion, understanding ideas and concepts is the most important skill for business, and that's what students should focus on in university."}

Life has become very fast-paced, and stress levels have increased. This makes it hard for older people to keep up. They struggle to compete with younger people and enjoy their work or success. So, it's fair to say that young people enjoy life more. I read that Alexander could pursue his plans because of his youth. History shows that Emperor Trajan regretted not being able to make more conquests due to his old age. This proves that we need youth to do many things in life, including enjoying its pleasures. Many stories feature men searching for the elixir of youth to stay young forever. Today, researchers are working to slow down aging, spending billions of dollars. We need youth to have many adventures in life. Youth is a precious gift that we can't get back, so we must make the most of it. We should do important things in life when we're young, or we'll regret it when we're old. This is my personal opinion. I'm not saying old age is bad, but youth is a blessing, and we should use it to the fullest."}

More people in Asia can now afford to buy a car, and they are doing so. In twenty years, people in Africa will likely be able to buy cars too, which means there will be a greater demand.\n\nSecond, car manufacturers keep making new and better cars every year. People get excited about these new models, as we can see at big car shows like IAA or Geneva Salon. Even if people can't afford a certain car, they often find a way to buy it, like paying in monthly installments. Car dealers' sales numbers show that this is happening more and more.\n\nSome people might say that there will be laws to reduce car use to protect the environment. But as someone who works in the car industry, I don't think that will happen. Engineers are working hard to make cars more efficient and less polluting. They're even thinking about how to build cars that don't need oil, which will be important when oil becomes scarce.\n\nIn summary, I don't think there will be fewer cars in twenty years. The reasons are that people are getting wealthier, there won't be strict laws because of better technology, and people will still be excited about new cars."}

To really enjoy a trip, I think it's better to go without a guide. Here's why:\n\nFirst, a guide is a professional who wants to show you all the sights quickly. They don't give you time to fully enjoy each place. If my friends and I can plan our own trip, we can do it better.\n\nSecond, without a guide, you can travel at your own pace. For example, last month I went on a trip to Bombay, Lonavala, and Khandala with my college friends. These places are very beautiful and have a lot of natural scenery. We hired a guide, but he rushed us through all the sights in just an hour and a half. He only showed us some places from a distance. My friends and I asked him to spend more time at each place, but he refused. We were unlucky.\n\nOn the other hand, last year I went on a trip with my relatives without a guide. We didn't know the place, but we found our way there on our own. So, I prefer not to have a guide on a trip."}

I don't fully agree that it's better for students to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts. I believe both are equally important for young people's development.\n\nUnderstanding ideas and concepts is crucial because it helps students form their own opinions and ideas. However, learning facts is also important because it teaches us from past experiences and helps us avoid mistakes.\n\nFor instance, knowing history helps us understand the concept of peace. We learn that war only brings poverty, difficulties, and no good things. Having a real-life example in facts makes it easier to understand concepts.\n\nBoth ideas and concepts, along with learning facts, provide a strong foundation for our education and are essential for a good future.

However, I believe that understanding concepts is more important than just learning facts. I have two reasons to support my opinion: people remember longer when they understand ideas, and they can solve all kinds of questions, even the hard ones.\n\nFirst, people tend to remember longer when they understand concepts. When they just learn and memorize facts, they forget quickly. For example, I learned about the 'Feedback system' in biology with my mother's help. I understood how it works. My friend, on the other hand, just memorized the process without understanding. When we had a surprise quiz, I could answer all the questions about the 'Feedback system', but my friend couldn't. This is because I understood the concept, and my friend forgot what he memorized.\n\nSecond, students can solve any difficult question if they fully understand the concepts. This often happens in math classes. Math teachers don't ask easy questions; they make them complicated. Students who understand concepts can solve these questions. However, students who just memorize facts get confused or hesitate to solve the questions because they lack basic knowledge of the concepts.\n\nIn conclusion, since students don't forget or misuse knowledge when they understand concepts, and students who understand concepts can solve all kinds of difficult questions, I believe that understanding concepts is more important than just learning facts."}

I prefer traveling in a group to traveling alone. I believe the best way to travel is with a tour guide because I can learn more and spend my money wisely.\n\nFirst, I can learn more. A tour guide's job is to help people understand other cultures. They show us the culture and let us experience it. For example, I went to Hong Kong and it was great. The tour guide showed us Hong Kong's culture, food, and daily life. He also told us about Hong Kong's history, which made it easy to understand. So, with a tour guide, I can learn more about a country.\n\nAlso, I can spend my money better. Some people travel to get away from work and stress. They think they need to relax, but it costs money. For instance, when I went to Cambodia without a tour guide, I didn't know what to do. I just stayed in my hotel room, which was a waste of time and money. I could have rested at home, but I spent money to rest in another country. So, I can save money.\n\nIn conclusion, I think the best way to travel is with a tour guide. I can learn more about other countries and spend my money wisely."}
{"file_id": "1030800.txt", "output_essay": "I think most ads make products seem better than they really are. There are two reasons for this. First, ads show products in the best way possible to sell them. For example, clothing companies use good-looking models to make their clothes look more attractive. Food ads also make food look perfect with nice dishes and lighting. I've had to return products I bought because they didn't look like they did in the ads.\n\nSecond, ads are a powerful way for companies to convince people to buy their products. So, companies focus on the good things about their products, not the bad things. For example, when we hear ads for beauty products on TV or radio, they make us think they can solve all our skin problems. But they don't tell us how much time or money they might take. That's why some products, like cigarettes or sleeping pills, have to say what bad things might happen if we use them. If the law didn't make them, companies wouldn't want to talk about their products' weaknesses.\n\nAs I said, ads are meant to sell products and make people like them. So, I really believe that products are often better in ads than they are in real life."}

Some people dedicate most of their time to thinking about how they can help their community. Others do not care about helping their society and only focus on their own problems. However, I believe that people do not give enough time to help their society.\n\nOne reason I think this is that the current business world leaves people with little time to help their communities. The business world demands a lot of time, and people are often very tired at the end of the day.\n\nFor example, I used to work for an advertising company five years ago. The work was very difficult, and I usually spent over 12 hours in the office. When I got home at 9 pm, I was extremely tired. I did not have the energy to help my community. All I wanted to do was rest. I was always too tired to help others when I was not working.\n\nAnother reason I believe this is that people have become more selfish. They only think about what is important to them and do not care about others. Research shows that less than 15% of people from my hometown helped their community in the last two years.\n\nIn conclusion, I agree that people today do not give enough time to helping their communities. I support this view with two main points: the business world takes up a lot of people's time, and people have become more selfish."}

There are some key differences between traveling alone and traveling with a group led by a tour guide.\n\nFirst, I believe that travel should be about freedom. When I plan my trip, I want to go to places I choose, not where my friends or the group wants to go. With a tour guide, you have to follow a set plan and can't go where you want.\n\nSecond, I think travel should be flexible. You might see a place from a train window or find a hidden gem not in your guidebook. Changing your plans is part of the fun of traveling.\n\nFinally, I think traveling alone gives you a chance to meet new people. I don't need a group to make friends - I can meet others who are traveling alone like me. If I have a question, I can ask locals who know the area well.\n\nSo, I think the best way to travel is on your own."}
{"file_id": "1029138.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with the statement because advertisements aim to highlight a product's advantages, often by exaggerating them.\n\nA common TV ad scenario shows happy situations unrelated to the product. For example, a sad person becomes happy when they drink a Coke as the sun rises. This creates the idea that a refreshing drink can make you happy, even though the weather has no connection to Coke.\n\nMagazine and photo ads use simple tricks like making products appear bigger or showing them with extra accessories not included. This makes the product look more attractive.\n\nSome ads show results that can't be achieved by the product alone. This is common in diet products, where a thin model exercises and drinks diet yogurt, making it seem like the yogurt can help you lose weight. However, it only prevents weight gain.\n\nAnother issue is that ads often hide a product's disadvantages or show them quickly and in small print. This is the case with alcohol ads, which flash a warning about excessive drinking being bad for your health.\n\nIn conclusion, ads often don't tell the whole truth about a product.

So, I bought it last year. At first, it was interesting, but I got bored after just three days. Now, my Nintendo DS is just sitting in a box. This shows that ads try to make products seem better than they really are to get our attention.\n\nSecond, many people agree that ads make products seem better than they really are. In my brand strategy class at Kyoto University, we discussed how companies create a brand image. We looked at a car ad, and my classmate, Okaie, pointed out that the car was driving on a beautiful road that doesn't exist in Japan. We all agreed that this was just a marketing trick.

{"file_id": "1024659.txt", "output_essay": "I disagree with the idea that ads make products seem better than they are. As a product owner knows how their product is made and works, they focus on its quality and how to get it to people correctly. To do this, they need to advertise it well. They want to show people how good their product is. Without ads, it takes a long time for a product to become popular and make a name for itself.\n\nAds may not make people believe everything, but they clearly state what a product does and how it works. Consumers buy a product based on their needs, not just because of the ad. Before releasing a product, it must pass many tests to ensure it meets requirements. Ads are then created based on what the product can do. Not all producers follow the same method, but they advertise based on the product's cost and their personal style. Some use media, marketers, or pamphlets to advertise.\n\nAds can be very appealing and make people want to buy a product. Some producers use famous people in their ads to grab attention. Ads are the best way to let people know about a product, which is why even governments use them. For example, in my state, a celebrity advertises the government's polio program to spread awareness quickly. This shows how important ads are.\n\nIn conclusion, ads are a powerful tool. As long as they are honest, they show a product for what it is, rather than making it seem better than it really is."}

On one hand, the growing population and progress in medicine mean people will live longer. This leads me to think that there will be more people, and therefore more cars, in the future. Since no government has found a new way to transport people, cars will likely continue to develop.\n\nOn the other hand, I think the opposite might be true. The progress in science and medicine could lead to new ways of transportation, like planes or even teletransportation. This could replace cars. Also, as we run out of petroleum, we will need to find alternative ways to travel. We could use public transportation like buses and trains to reduce the number of cars.\n\nAnother reason I think there might be fewer cars is that we will eventually run out of materials like metals and plastic to make them. Even if we find new materials, our fast consumption rate will lead to a shortage.\n\nIt's hard to predict the future, but I hope there will be fewer cars and that someone will invent teletransportation, which would be very efficient for everyone.

They're happy with the compliments they get.\n\nOn the other hand, older people are busy with life concerns and family issues. They don't have much time for fun. They're often worried about things like politics or building a good future for their kids. However, some older people think vacation is important, just like work and money.

The teacher's job is to provide general information. This information should be general because the teacher already has their own opinion and might influence the students. So, just learning facts is too focused on theory, not practice.\n\nNext, once students know the basics, they need to go further on their own to understand the specifics of the subject. I think understanding ideas and concepts is a personal thing. It's something each person does for themselves. Nobody will have the same understanding of ideas because it depends on their experiences and connection to the subject.\n\nFor example, in a law class, the teacher can teach students about how society's view of gay marriage has changed. But I think it's more important for students to understand why this change happened and to learn about both sides of the argument.

Should students learn a little about many subjects or a lot about one subject?\n\nSome people think it's better to know a little about many subjects. But I think it's better to focus on one subject.\n\nFirst, it's better to study something you really like instead of studying many different subjects. This way, you can focus on one topic and finish your studies on time. If you study too many subjects, it can be confusing and you won't have time to learn each one well. For example, it's hard to combine studying literature with studying math or engineering.\n\nSecond, companies today don't want people who know a little about many things. They want people who are experts in one area. Most job ads in newspapers describe the specific skills they need. And usually, only an expert has those skills.\n\nSo, specializing in one subject is the best way to get a good job. And, being an expert in one subject doesn't mean you can't learn about other subjects too. If you're good at one thing, you might also be interested in other subjects. But it's important to focus on your main subject.\n\nIn conclusion, I think it's very important to specialize in one subject instead of knowing a little about many subjects. We all know a little about many things, but being an expert in one area makes you stand out and helps you get a good job."}

That's why software can help students remember what they've learned. This is also true for other subjects like economics and agriculture. For example, agriculture students need to apply what they've learned in a real-life setting, like a greenhouse, to understand chemistry and agronomy.\n\nMy second example is from my primary school days.

They need to prove their ideas, so they must study hard to get accurate knowledge. For example, my brother is a science major, but he wasn't interested in it.

This unhappiness also reduces their work efficiency. Imagine if most people in society faced this problem every day! Another issue is car accidents.

{"file_id": "1029696.txt", "output_essay": "I think marketing and advertising play a big role in our lives. Today, there are many products available in the market, and manufacturers are competing to make their brands and products known to people. The question is, why do people remember one product and forget another? The answer is simple: people believe one product is better than the other, so they remember it. This motivates advertisers to make their products seem better than they are.\n\nOne example of this is advertisements that show unrealistic settings. These settings might be too good to be true, like a perfect beach or a photo edited with software. I think the setting is key to making people believe what you're offering is better than what they have. It's like showing something in a perfect environment to make people want it. Another example is the people in ads; most women are very beautiful, and most men are very handsome. Advertisers use these perfect characters to make us think we can be like them if we buy their product.\n\nThe worst case is when an advertiser claims a product can do something it can't. Most ads only show the best results; for example, a toothpaste ad might show someone's teeth becoming extremely white in a clinical experiment. But during the ad, a small subtitle might say that a chemical was used to make the toothpaste work better.\n\nThis problem will get worse as new products are introduced to the market every day.

A few years ago, Sony's Walkman was the main way to listen to music. You had to buy a Walkman and cassettes to hear music. But Steve Jobs from Apple had a different idea. He created the iPod, which lets you download music into a small memory chip. This was more efficient, and you could store a lot more music than on a Walkman. Steve Jobs became famous, but Sony lost its market because its executives just kept making better Walkmans. They didn't try something new.\n\nSecond, they come up with completely new solutions to problems. For example, take postal services. Before, if you wanted to send a letter to someone, you had to write it on paper and mail it. It took time, and it wasn't efficient. Some people thought about sending information electronically, and the internet was born. Now, sending a letter is just a click away with email. Email is much faster and more efficient.\n\nSome people might disagree and say that trying new things is too risky.

For example, when a student becomes a doctor, they'll need to deal with medical issues urgently. In that situation, they can't just rely on their factual knowledge. They'll need to use their own judgment and analysis to treat the patient, which might not be the same as what they learned in a textbook.\n\nUnderstanding concepts also helps students make progress and come up with new ideas. If there are mistakes in the information they receive, they can only be fixed if the concept is clear. Then, students can question and find their own answers instead of waiting for someone else to give them new facts and figures."}

Drinking and speeding are the main causes.\n\nGas prices have been going up for a long time and will likely continue to rise.\n\nTo make a difference, we need to improve public transportation.

{"file_id": "1030852.txt", "output_essay": "Traveling is a big part of life. Most people like to travel. I think it's best to travel with a group because it's safer. When you're with friends or family in a new place, you need a guide. A guide can tell you about the history of the places you visit. They know the area well, so they can show you around. If you're in a place where people speak a different language, a guide can translate for you.\n\nOne reason I think you should have a guide is that they can tell you more about the place than you can learn from books. For example, last year my friends and I visited some historical places in India, but we didn't get a guide. We had a lot of problems because of that.\n\nAnother reason to get a guide is that they know the area and can show you new places you might not have known about. This makes your trip more interesting.\n\nA third reason is that a guide can help you if you're in a place where you don't speak the language. For example, if you're visiting Europe, you might not speak the language. A guide can translate for you and help you talk to people.\n\nIn short, the best way to travel is with a group and a guide. You can learn more about the places you visit, see new things, and avoid language problems. Plus, you'll feel safer traveling with a group."}

This essay will discuss how ads make products seem better than they really are.\n\nWhen we see a product in an ad, it's always shown in perfect light. The company wants to sell the product, so they show it in the best way possible. For example, if someone is driving a car in an ad, they're driving through a beautiful landscape. But in real life, we often face traffic jams in dirty cities. The person in the ad seems to be having more fun driving the car. The ad also has nice music to make us want the product. The music makes the product look better than it does in real life.\n\nThe actors in ads are always happy and know how to use the product. Sometimes we have trouble using a product because we don't know how to use it properly. Imagine getting a new cellphone with many features. We might not know how to use all of them.\n\nIn conclusion, I think products seem better than they really are because we don't use them in perfect conditions in our daily lives. But as long as the ad is honest and we know that our lives are different from what we see on TV, I don't think it's a problem."}

Here's why.\n\nFirst, we need to understand what 'enjoying life' really means. Many people get it wrong. Enjoying life means doing things that make us or our loved ones happy, not just showing off. Older people have lived through different stages of life, so they're more mature and wise. They don't often do things just to show others they're having fun.\n\nYoung people, on the other hand, do things that are more visible, like traveling, going to movies, or partying. They do this because of peer pressure, a need to try new things, or just because they have lots of energy. Older people might not do these things as much, but they have their own activities that make them happy, like reading, gardening, or helping their community.\n\nI also think that when we're young, we enjoy doing things for ourselves. When we're older, we get more happiness from doing things for our loved ones. For example, a father who works hard to build a safe home for his family gets just as much happiness as a young person who goes on a big adventure. This doesn't mean older people don't enjoy life.\n\nIn conclusion, enjoying life has nothing to do with age. It's a state of mind that we all try to achieve in different ways at different times in our lives."}

Most classes have a test or exam, and you need to know the facts to pass.\n\nOn the other hand, it's easier to learn facts if you understand the ideas behind them. This way, you're not just memorizing facts for the exam, but you can explain what they mean. This helps you remember them better, especially if you think about the ideas and discuss them with others.\n\nAdditionally, you should remember that you're not just learning for school or university, but for your whole life. At university, you can learn many things that will help you in your future career and expand your knowledge. You won't have the same opportunity to learn so many things for free and with so much pleasure when you're older.\n\nIn my opinion, you can't just choose one or the other.

With technology advancing and new inventions emerging, it's clear that logical thinking is key. Take Graham Bell, the inventor of the telephone. He didn't just rely on facts; he thought logically and conducted experiments to make it happen. Many early scientists didn't focus on facts either; they understood the ideas behind them.\n\nIt's better for students to study concepts and put their ideas into practice. Let's consider an example. If students only focus on facts, they might only remember that oil, petrol, kerosene, and white petrol are combustion fuels, and cars need petrol or diesel to run. But Sastry, a student, didn't stop at that. He discovered a new fuel for cars by extracting a solution from a plant's leaf and mixing it with chemicals. This achievement shows the importance of understanding concepts and working hard to implement ideas. This approach can greatly benefit society.\n\nOn the other hand, learning facts is also useful to some extent. When studying the solar system, for instance, students need to know the shape of the earth and the number of planets. In such cases, referring to facts is necessary rather than conducting experiments."}

Without fuel, buses, taxis, lawn mowers, and airplanes won't run either. I could ride my bike to the grocery store, but what's the point? The shelves will be empty because trucks won't be able to deliver goods to the supermarket. Without fuel, there will be no production, no traffic, and even our high-tech systems might fail.\n\nI don't want to make this sound too scary. There's another possibility. Since we know we rely too much on fossil resources like oil, we can change that. Many smart scientists are working on solutions to get energy from other sources. They've already found ways to use wind and sun as renewable energy sources. We can reduce our need for oil by making small changes, like buying vegetables from local farmers. This means fewer trucks will be needed. We need to start changing our energy-wasting habits now. In twenty years, there might be just as many cars on the road, but they'll run on non-fossil energy. I definitely think there will be fewer cars running on fuel in twenty years."}

Advertisers design ads to grab our attention, but not by telling us about the product itself. Instead, they talk about how it will make us feel. For example, a perfume ad won't tell us how it's made.

If they didn't try new things, they wouldn't be where they are today.\n\nTrying new things also helps you solve problems better.\n\nOn the other hand, if you don't try new things, you might stay in the same place forever. You'll do your job well, but you'll do it forever.\n\nIn conclusion, don't limit yourself. Go out there, try new things, and take risks."}
{"file_id": "1041085.txt", "output_essay": "Many students face a dilemma when choosing university subjects. Should they study many subjects or focus on one?\n\nStudying many subjects has its advantages. You gain broad knowledge and become more flexible when looking for a job or dealing with different situations. You can also discuss various topics, which helps build relationships with others. When you know a little about many things, you can join conversations easily.\n\nOn the other hand, specializing in one subject has its benefits too. People who focus on one subject have deeper knowledge and can answer specific questions better. They can solve complex problems and are in high demand by companies. As a result, they often get paid more than those with general knowledge.\n\nIn my opinion, it's better to have in-depth knowledge of a specific subject. You can solve complex problems and answer specific questions better. Companies also pay more for professionals with specialized knowledge."}
{"file_id": "1039104.txt", "output_essay": "When we think about being young or old, we need to consider the differences. What can you do when you're young versus old? This question helps us decide which one is better.\n\nThree main differences are nightlife, responsibilities, and money.\n\nLet's start with nightlife. Many young people between 15 and 20 don't know what nightlife is. As an adult, you can go to a nightclub without restrictions. You also don't have to tell anyone where you're going or what you're doing because you're independent.\n\nAnother important difference is responsibility. When you're young, you have school, which is a big responsibility. But when you're old, you can do what you want and only worry about yourself.\n\nThe last difference is money. When you're young, your parents worry about money. You can't buy everything you want because it's their money, not yours. If you want to buy something they don't want, you can't.\n\nIn conclusion, life is better for old people. If you're young, you can still have fun, but not as much as you want. However, you can wait until you grow up and become an adult."}
{"file_id": "1039122.txt", "output_essay": "I strongly agree that most ads make products seem better than they are. Today, it's clear that selling a product is more important than its quality.\n\nMany companies spend a lot of money on ads. There have been many studies on ads and their effects. For example, these studies found that ads take a few months to have an impact. That's why we see ads for a movie that won't be out for three months.\n\nAn important thing to remember is that we don't buy the product itself, but the idea of the product. Sometimes we've tried many products and know which one is better. But often we have many options and don't know which is best. If we remember an ad that explains a product's benefits, we'll likely choose it, even if it's not the best.\n\nA few years ago, a child asked for a pirate ship toy for Christmas. When he opened the box, he started crying because he didn't see the sea that was in the ad. The child had never seen the sea and really wanted it with the toy. This shows the power of ads.\n\nIn fact, we often buy more than just the product. We buy the image that comes with it. For example, some clothing brands are a status symbol.\n\nIn conclusion, ads play a key role in selling products, regardless of their quality."}

They might also think that public transportation will become more accessible and cheaper. A new way of transportation might also reduce the number of cars. Another important point is that our streets are too crowded and can't fit more vehicles.\n\nThis is clear, especially in a country like Germany. But in countries like China or other developing countries, space is not a problem. Instead, these countries will want more high-tech products like cars as they develop. They are growing fast, and it's likely that countries like India or South Africa will become developed countries within the next twenty years.\n\nA new way of transportation might be invented, but it's not coming soon, and it would take longer than twenty years to become popular and affect the number of cars.\n\nI hope and believe that public transportation will become cheaper and spread to more countries. However, I think people will always prefer cars because they are more comfortable. I used a car to get to this TOEFL center instead of taking the bus or train. Germany is a good example. Even though it has one of the best public transportation systems, its streets are still crowded with cars. This shows that having a public transportation system doesn't necessarily reduce the number of cars. In other parts of the world, countries are more rural, and building a public transportation system is much more expensive than building roads.\n\nIt's true that the growth of cars is slowing down, but that doesn't mean it will stop soon. While Europe might have reached its peak, other countries will want more cars in the coming years, and this will outweigh any decrease in Europe.\n\nThe growing population will also contribute to this. Although the number of people in Germany and other developed countries is decreasing slightly, the total number of people is still growing fast. This won't change in the next twenty years.\n\nIn conclusion, I don't see any reason why the number of cars will decrease in the next twenty years - unless something unexpected happens. Although I don't like the trend of more cars, I'm sure it will continue."}
{"file_id": "1031374.txt", "output_essay": "Based on my travel experiences, I believe that traveling with a tour guide is the best way to travel.\n\nWhen you travel with an experienced guide, you can learn from their knowledge of the place. You can develop a deeper understanding of what you see and experience.\n\nTwo years ago, I visited New York with my family. We traveled on our own at first, but we didn't learn much. We just walked around, looking at tall buildings. We even got lost trying to find our hotel. The next day, we hired a tour guide. With their help, we learned about the city's history, important places, and good restaurants. We learned many useful facts that we would have missed otherwise.\n\nTraveling with a guide has many benefits. You learn more about the place you visit, including its secrets and essence.\n\nAnother example is my trip to China with my family last year. Before we hired a guide, I thought China was a poor country with a communist government. But after our guide showed us around Beijing, I learned a lot about the Chinese culture. I was surprised by how much I learned from the guide's perspective. I changed my opinion about China and developed a more critical understanding of its culture and situation.\n\nAfter traveling in New York and China with guides, I'm convinced that guided travel is the best way. If we hadn't had guides, we wouldn't have experienced New York like locals or learned about Chinese culture from a reliable source."}

Some people think they do, while others think they are too busy with their own lives. I agree with those who think young people help their communities enough.\n\nFirst, I think young people today are more educated and aware of the problems in their communities. They know what needs to be fixed. For example, a young man who grew up in a village with bad schools knows how important good education is. Now that he has a good job, he wants to help his village by providing better education.\n\nSecond, this young man also earns a good salary, which means he can afford to help his community. He wants to make a difference and improve the lives of those around him.\n\nFinally, I believe young people today are more enthusiastic and willing to help their communities. They learn important values like responsibility and helping others in school. They know how to prioritize their time and get things done.\n\nSo, I think today's young people are doing a good job of helping their communities."}

They often come from a background of failures and risks, and after overcoming them, they achieve success. This means they know how to handle risks and problems. Successful people want to gain more success by trying new things they're not familiar with.\n\nTo try new things, they don't hesitate, but people who are not successful are afraid to try. There are many examples that support this idea. For instance, in construction, people who succeed in building big projects like buildings, dams, and towers are willing to take on even more challenging projects. They know their work and the problems they might face, so they try to solve them in a logical and planned way.\n\nIt's not just in construction. Scientists are another example. They always try to invent new things. If they didn't take risks, we wouldn't have many of the luxuries and medicines we have today. When we try new things, we get new things in our daily lives. In today's fast-paced world, successful people should try new things and take risks to become even more successful, rather than just doing what they're good at."}
{"file_id": "1039861.txt", "output_essay": "I agree that most ads make products seem better than they really are. There are two reasons why I think this is true. First, ads help companies sell more products. With so many similar products available, companies need to make their ads stand out to compete. For example, when I lost my cell phone and needed a new one, I was overwhelmed by all the options. I ended up buying the one with the most attractive ad. But after using it for a while, I realized it was hard to use because it had too many extra features I didn't need. This experience taught me to be more careful when looking at ads. Second, companies often focus on selling their products first and worry about any problems later. They think that once people start using their products, they'll find out what's good and bad about them. This approach is not great, but it's common. However, with the rise of consumer activism, this way of thinking is becoming riskier for companies. In short, I believe that most ads make products seem better than they really are."}
{"file_id": "1041350.txt", "output_essay": "I believe that both understanding ideas and learning facts are crucial for students. However, I don't think that ideas are more important than facts. Here's why: first, it's pointless to understand many concepts if we don't use them to learn facts. I think learning concepts is important if we can apply them to do useful things. So, learning new concepts is vital, but we must also learn from facts to see how they work.\n\nFor instance, as a university student, I learn many concepts in class every day. Since I study at a technical university, I need to gain a lot of experience to improve my skills in a particular subject. Moreover, learning facts is important because they can be useful in the future. Another reason I think this way is that if we only understand ideas, we won't fully understand how they work. I believe that we can only learn some things from facts and experience. A student is well-prepared in a subject if they learn both concepts and gain experience. In fact, in many companies, to get promoted, a person needs to have a lot of experience and knowledge."}

But do young people really have more fun than older people? We will look at the reasons why people think this is true, and then we will look at older people to see if it's really true.\n\nWhy do people think young people have more fun? One reason is that they are more active. They have lots of energy and are not afraid to try new things. They feel like they can do anything they want. They have big dreams and are willing to work hard to make them come true. They also have more free time to spend with friends or do things they enjoy. Because they are young, they don't have as many responsibilities. They can do what they want, when they want. They are always finding time to have fun. Another reason is that they are discovering new things all the time. Everything is new and exciting for them. They also meet their closest friends when they are young.\n\nOn the other hand, why do people think older people have less fun? One reason is that they have a lot of responsibilities, like a job, a family, and kids. These things take up a lot of time and can be stressful.\n\nBut what does it really mean to 'have fun'?

Some people might not succeed at first, but that doesn't mean they should give up. Without trying new things, we can't move forward.\n\nFor example, if a country doesn't try new things, it will stay a developing country forever. On the other hand, if someone wants to become a top student or a successful engineer, they need to take risks and try different approaches to reach their goals.\n\nIf someone doesn't work hard or try new things, they won't achieve their goals. But if they do take risks, like Sachin Tendulkar's father did when he encouraged his son to focus on cricket instead of studies, they can become very successful. Sachin is now a world-class cricketer, and India is proud to have him.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that people who try new things and take risks will definitely achieve success and stand out from the rest."}

It teaches us many things and helps us learn about different cultures. Traveling with friends can make the trip more fun. In my opinion, we don't need a guide to help us. Getting lost and taking risks together can be a fun and unforgettable experience.\n\nTraveling with friends is always part of my vacations. Last summer, I went to Spain with my friends to explore the country and learn about a new culture. We didn't have a guide, so we took a taxi to our hotel. After checking in, we asked an employee for restaurant recommendations and had a great time. On our way back, we got lost in the city and couldn't find our hotel. After walking for three hours, we finally made it back to the hotel and slept.\n\nWhen I talk to my friends about getting lost, they laugh and wish we could do it again. So, getting lost while traveling with friends can be an entertaining part of the trip.\n\nAnother reason we don't need a guide is because of the internet. It's easy to find information about the places we want to visit. When my family plans a trip, they do everything online, including finding addresses. With GPS, we can even find our way if we get lost.\n\nIn the end, traveling with a guide is not the only way to travel. There are many other ways to enjoy a trip."}

A good example is Steve Jobs' story in the tech world. Steve Jobs, the founder of Apple, knew that to be successful, you need to take risks and do things differently from others.\n\nAs Professor Porter says, the biggest advantage for a company or person is being different. Being different doesn't just mean doing new things; it can also mean doing old things in a new way.\n\nWhen we try new things, we take more risks. To be successful, we need to weigh these risks and figure out what we might gain and what we might lose if we fail.\n\nFrom my perspective, success depends on many factors: being creative, imagining new things, or doing things differently; being willing to take risks; and being able to measure those risks and plan for different outcomes.\n\nLooking at Steve Jobs again, what made Apple successful was his ability to see what would make the iPod stand out from other MP3 players. He took a new path, calculated the risks, and learned from his mistakes. Finally, he succeeded with his device.\n\nWhen someone is successful, it's because they learned from their failures and mistakes, which often come from trying to be different and taking risks.\n\nIn my opinion, success is a reward for those who have the courage to be unique."}

Sometimes they tell the truth, and sometimes they don't, so how can we know what's true?\n\nOne way to find out if a product is good is to ask someone who has used it. For example, if your cousin sees an ad on TV about a sports machine, they might buy it. Then, you hear about the machine and wonder if it's good. So, you ask your cousin about it. If they say it's not good and broke easily, you'll probably decide not to buy it.\n\nAnother way is to try the product yourself. If you really like something you saw in an ad, buy it and try it. You might be surprised, and it might be better than you thought. Just be careful not to waste too much money on things you don't need.

Being an expert in one subject is a better way to succeed, it helps you focus, and it's less stressful.\n\nOne reason I think this is true is that being an expert in one subject helps you succeed in the future. Having a little knowledge of many subjects might help you when you're a kid, but it's not as important as finding what you're really good at. Working hard on what you're good at will take you further in life.\n\nAnother reason is that being an expert in one subject helps you focus better. Trying to do well in many subjects at the same time can be distracting. Working hard on one subject helps you concentrate.\n\nFinally, I think being an expert in one subject is less stressful. For example, it's hard to be good at both writing and math. People usually don't like what they're not good at. If there are subjects you don't like or aren't good at, you should focus on what you're good at. My friend is great at art, but not good at math, so she doesn't take math classes.

After the trip, we realized we didn't have many memories of Disneyland because the group rushed us so much that we didn't even have time to take a few more pictures. So, I decided to have my own guided tour from then on.\n\nThere are several reasons why I made this decision. First, some people think group travel is cheaper than hiring a tour guide. But I don't think that's true. A tour guide isn't very expensive, and they can show you much more than you expected. You'll have time to take photos and enjoy the freedom from your daily routine. We spend money to enjoy life, but with a group tour, we just rush to the next place without really seeing what's around us. That's a waste of our money and time.\n\nSecond, with a tour guide, we can be in charge of our own trip. In a group, we have to follow the leader. We spend money to enjoy life, not to have a boss. We're on vacation, not at work! We get to decide where we want to go and what we want to do.\n\nThird, some people think group travel is safer because we can face problems together. But we should be brave and face challenges on our own. Solving problems is part of the fun of traveling. And with a tour guide, we have someone to help us anytime we need it.\n\nFrom what we've discussed, it's clear that although group travel has some advantages, they can't compare to the freedom and excitement of having our own guided tour.

{"file_id": "1040606.txt", "output_essay": "Most people use cars to get around today. The number of cars is growing, but so are the prices of cars and oil. Some people think that in twenty years, we will use fewer cars than we do now. Having a car is getting more expensive. There is less oil available, so the price goes up, and not everyone can afford it. In big cities, public transportation will get better, like in Paris, where the government is adding new bus routes. They want Paris to be a city with no cars. Some people think we need to stop using cars because they pollute the air.\n\nOn the other hand, cars are the best way to get around. With a car, you can go anywhere, anytime. You don't have to wait like you do with buses and subways. The price of oil might go up, but governments are working on a solution. For example, in France, the government wants to introduce a new oil made from crops. This oil is already used in some countries like Brazil, where many cars use it, and it's cheaper than in France. This vegetable oil can also reduce pollution in big cities. And with a car, people can do what they want, like they do at home. They can choose their own music, smoke, or make phone calls.\n\nIn my opinion, public transportation can improve a lot. But with new technologies, people will still want their own cars, and I think that in twenty years, there will be more cars on the road than there are today."}

But everyone has their own idea about life, and different ideas lead to different lifestyles. So, we can't say who has more fun.\n\nOlder people have a lot of experience and think about life differently than young people. Some older people who lived through the Second World War know how important food and money are. Instead of wasting money on having fun, they choose to live simple lives. But they don't think their lives are boring.\n\nYoung people want to show off to attract a boyfriend or girlfriend. To be popular, they like to go to pubs and bars, drink, dance, and joke with each other. But most older people already have a partner, and fashion and cars are not as important to them. They don't want to live like young people. So, it doesn't make sense to say that young people have more fun.\n\nIn some cultures, age is very important. For example, in China or Korea, older people have more control over younger people. In these countries, age affects many things, especially when people have fun. The society gives more benefits to older people. If there's a lot of food, older people get more. So, it's not true that young people have more fun when there's less to go around.\n\nIn conclusion, older people are equal to young people, and that's why nobody argues about it."}

In my view, a person's education makes them stronger in the future. So, students should never say no to further education because it can lead to a lower status in society and even depression.\n\nI think it's better to be an expert in one subject than to have a little knowledge of many subjects. This is because a student who doesn't know a subject well might get confused, but a student who is an expert can have a successful life. They will know everything about their subject, and no one can question them. They can make a lot of progress in their career.\n\nNot only will they have more knowledge, but they will also be more confident and independent financially. They can live their life comfortably and grow as a person. Other professionals will respect them, and as they gain experience, they will reach the top of their field. Their income, respect, and job position will keep increasing.\n\nAll these things will give them peace of mind at the end of their life. They will be satisfied with their professional achievements.

This is a big issue in our society because everyone focuses on their own problems and doesn't see the problems others face.\n\nSpecialized people often have another problem: they can usually only do one job their whole life. I think it's better to be able to change jobs if needed. Having a broad knowledge makes it easier to do so.\n\nIf you're an expert in one area, it's hard to get another job without taking time to learn new things.

{"file_id": "1040067.txt", "output_essay": "I strongly agree that many ads make products seem better than they really are. However, we should not ignore the benefits of ads for this reason.\n\nFirstly, I admit that most ads exaggerate about products. This is why manufacturers love making ads. The ads grab our attention by showing how great the products are. For example, we often see ads for hair care products on TV. Models or famous stars show off their shiny and smooth hair, telling us that a special product is the reason. It's really attractive. But when we buy the product and use it, we find that the result is not as good as they claim. From this view, we are misled by the ads.\n\nHowever, ads play important roles in our life. On one hand, we get introductions and suggestions from them. Imagine shopping in a supermarket with thousands of brands. There are hundreds of kinds of soft drinks. If we know nothing about the products, we'd spend a lot of time choosing. With different ads, the situation changes. We become aware of a few brands, and then we can choose from those. On the other hand, the ad industry is huge. Both customers and manufacturers need ad firms. These firms provide many job opportunities for our society every year. Therefore, ads are necessary for us.\n\nLastly, the quality and service of a product ultimately decide its fate, not the ads. We customers might be misled once, but not always. Besides, not every product is bad. Famous and lasting brands in most fields are good enough for customers. So, I think it's acceptable when some ads exaggerate the benefits of products.\n\nBased on these reasons, I believe that ads serve good functions in our society, even though they sometimes make products seem better than they really are."}

I think it's better to know a little about many subjects.\n\nI agree with this because people live in different worlds and things change quickly.\n\nFirst, having broad knowledge helps us connect with others. In my country, I was a nurse and needed to know English, sociology, and culture. I needed many types of knowledge to talk to people. I think it's important to know more than just nursing.\n\nSecond, knowing many subjects helps us understand different worlds. If I only know one thing, I won't understand others. This can lead to prejudice.\n\nIn conclusion, our society is changing fast. We need to learn many things."}

When I asked him why, he said that companies want employees with many skills. To get a good job, a high salary, and a high position, it's better to have a wide range of knowledge.\n\nIf you have multiple majors or areas of knowledge, you'll have a better chance of getting a good job. For example, if you study engineering and take some computer science courses, you'll get a job faster than if you only study engineering. You'll also work in a different department, which will make your job more interesting.\n\nIt's not hard to get a job, but getting a good salary is difficult. To improve your skills and get a good salary, you need to be different from other employees. Many people focus on one major and then look for a job. To stand out, you need to have a wide range of knowledge.\n\nNot everyone can be a manager or a leader in their company. Managers have special qualities, more education, and strong personalities. We can get different educations by having a wide range of knowledge. If you study different majors with different people, you'll develop a strong personality.\n\nIn conclusion, you can get a great job with a high salary if you have a wide range of knowledge and different areas of education.

They can get more out of life, but that doesn't mean they enjoy it more.\n\nFirst, young people want to explore the world. Older people already know the world around them. They've experienced most feelings. Young people want to try new things and feel new emotions.\n\nOn the other hand, young people are physically strong. They can do sports and move fast. They want to do things quickly to try new things.\n\nI'm young, but I don't think I enjoy life more than my parents. They enjoy life in their own way. For example, they travel, which I can't do alone because I depend on my parents. So I do other things, like going out with friends.\n\nThis fast pace of life can be misleading. Except for very old people who can't do much and those who are depressed, everyone enjoys life the same way.

In fact, I've seen this trend over the last ten years, even though it's not a good thing.\n\nI think there will be fewer cars for several reasons. First, cities are growing. Since most people now live in cities, they need to move around inside the city. As cities get bigger, more people will need cars unless there are alternative ways to get around.\n\nSecond, cities are often crowded, and people with low incomes have to find homes outside the city. This means they'll need cars to get to work in the city. Some people also dislike city life and prefer to live outside the city, but still need a car to get to the city.\n\nThe state or local community can also make a difference. When they don't want too many cars in the city, they can find solutions. A good city plan can help. If a city is planned well, it's easier to get around.\n\nThe state should also educate city residents about this issue. Many people don't care because they're comfortable driving their own cars or think it doesn't affect them. But it's not true - they don't like being stuck in traffic or dealing with air pollution.\n\nIn conclusion, I agree that there will be fewer cars in twenty years, and it will be a huge problem if it happens."}
{"file_id": "1044553.txt", "output_essay": "Time gives us wisdom. The idea that young people enjoy life more than older people is not always true. It depends on how they live and their personal habits.\n\nFor example, young people can be enthusiastic, happy, friendly, and serious. But some young people can't enjoy their lives because they don't have good experiences. They might not have good parents, schools, or surroundings. On the other hand, many older people enjoy their lives. They think their old age is the best time to look back on their experiences. They have many memories and experiences.\n\nIn my opinion, my grandfather is a great example of an older person who enjoys life just like young people. He's 86 years old and decided to start living again when he was 75, after my grandmother passed away. Some people thought he'd be sad, but instead, he wrote a book, dances in a club every weekend, opened his own restaurant, and even has a girlfriend. He might get married again soon. He has health problems like diabetes and high blood pressure, but he decided to enjoy his life and start over. I think he's a great example for young people who sometimes give up on their dreams and hopes. He's also a good role model for me, and I hope to enjoy my life as much as he does.\n\nThat's why I disagree with the idea that young people enjoy life more than older people do."}

However, I believe that people will still want to own cars because they are convenient, and eco-friendly cars are being developed.\n\nRight now, more and more cars are being made. This is because people want their own cars for easy travel. A study found that the main reason people in Seoul prefer their own cars is convenience. They can drive and do what they want, like listening to music, except when there's traffic. Even if the government improves public transportation, people won't be satisfied.\n\nAs for the environment, it's not a big problem because many countries are working on eco-friendly cars. This shows that people still think cars are practical and convenient. For example, in Japan, researchers recently created an electric car for regular people. So, in the future, more people will use environmentally friendly cars.\n\nIn conclusion, I don't agree that the number of cars will decrease."}

Education should teach students key ideas and concepts that they can understand, make their own, and use as a basis for further learning or life choices.\n\nFacts are like evidence that supports these key ideas and concepts. Students need to read, understand, and see how facts explain the main idea. Facts are important for understanding, but they are specific details that we may eventually forget. What lasts in our memory is the main idea, and that's what's most important.\n\nFor example, when we study history, we learn many facts like dates and events. These facts help us understand what happened during a specific time and why. Even if we forget the specific dates, we still remember the main idea of what happened in the past.\n\nI think it's often impossible for our minds to remember all the details we read.

They told people about products available in the market, which helped customers in many ways. These ads clearly described the product and how it could be used in real life.\n\nToday, ads have lost their original purpose. They just show the product, highlight its features, compare it to others, and make false claims about its value.\n\nFor example, ads for face creams often use girls. Before using the product, they look ordinary, but after using it a few times, they look beautiful. This is just a camera trick and makeup. If we use the product, will we get the same result? No, definitely not.\n\nTake toothpaste, for instance. Companies like Pepsodent, Colgate, and Closeup have the same ingredients, but they advertise their products differently, claiming theirs is better than others. How can the same formula produce different results?\n\nAds today just make products seem better than they are.\n\nAnother example is soap. A company like JOCIL makes soap and sells it to other companies, which then label and advertise it, highlighting its features without knowing much about it.\n\nFamous people like actors, sportsmen, and singers are often used in ads. People who like these celebrities will buy the product, thinking it must be good because their favorite celebrity endorsed it. This is another way ads make products seem better than they are.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe ads make products seem better than they are. While some products may have good qualities, not all the qualities mentioned in ads are true. They are just added to attract customers."}

With a guide, you can save time, money, and get useful information about the places you visit.\n\nI like traveling with a guide because they have experience planning trips. This means you don't have to worry about planning the trip yourself. For example, my family once visited Singapore without a guide. We missed many important places because we didn't know much about the city and language. If we had a guide, we wouldn't have had this problem.\n\nA guide can also help you save money.

It helps us understand events and think critically in different situations. It's hard to think about topics we're not familiar with. We can't even express our feelings about something we know nothing about. It's better to have a broad range of knowledge in many subjects rather than specializing in just one. Specializing too early limits our understanding of the world and makes it hard to choose which subject to focus on, causing us to miss out on other opportunities.\n\nIt's best to gain broad knowledge before specializing in a particular subject. For example, I'm studying International Relations, and my department stresses the importance of having a broad range of knowledge. I couldn't just focus on the Cold War without knowing about the results of World War I. Having broad knowledge also helps us analyze events from different angles. With my broad knowledge, I can analyze the actions of states in different ways.\n\nMoreover, if we specialize in one subject, we might not know much about other subjects. This can be a problem. It's hard to deal with a subject we have no opinion about. We can see examples of this in daily life. For instance, being a great cook is useless if we don't know how to wash the dishes. These skills complement each other. This is a simple example, but it shows the importance of having broad knowledge.\n\nFinally, with broad knowledge in many academic subjects, people can see events from different perspectives, even when reading the news. They can connect events in meaningful ways. It's also hard to choose just one important subject to specialize in. We should gain broad knowledge before specializing in a particular subject, but we can't gain broad knowledge after specializing in just one subject."}

I understood that it's tough for people without a specialty to find a job, especially a good one.\n\nMy friends who studied Economics told me that the job market has changed a lot in recent years.\n\nCompanies and factories need people to do specific jobs, so they look for candidates with special skills.\n\nAs a result, employers usually look for people who are experts in a particular area.\n\nI've seen this to be true. My friends who got PhDs or attended technical schools found jobs quickly, while those with general knowledge or university degrees are still looking.\n\nIn conclusion, I agree that it's better to specialize in one subject, because it gives you a better chance of finding a job."}

But which one is better?\n\nTo answer this question, let's look at two groups: undergraduate and graduate students.\n\nUndergraduate students take many different courses. This gives them the chance to choose a field they like later on.\n\nFor example, in the first two years of a pre-pharmacy program, we took courses like cultural studies and art, which aren't related to pharmacy. Many students changed their major after taking these courses. They found they were good at other subjects. This variety of courses helped them pick the best major for them. If students only took pharmacy courses from the start, many might fail because they didn't get to try other subjects. This is a serious issue, especially in fields like medicine, pharmacy, and engineering that affect public health and safety.\n\nGraduate students don't have this problem.

That's why I think the number of cars won't decrease in the next 20 years.\n\nThere are many arguments for and against using cars. The main argument against them is environmental pollution. It's true that cars, as they are today, use natural resources and pollute the environment to some extent. If this continues, there might be fewer cars on the road in 20 years. At some point, people will realize the harm caused by cars and try to reduce their number to protect the environment.\n\nBut this might not happen: I believe our scientists are getting smarter. They've already invented hybrid engines and engines that run on solar energy or plant oils. These inventions can't replace gas-powered cars yet, but scientists are working to improve them. It took many years for the car industry to perfect the gas engine. Given this progress, it's possible that scientists will make a significant contribution to improving these new engines in the next 20 years. Even if 20 years might be too short to develop a completely pollution-free car, I think scientists are on the right track to find an engine that reduces pollution significantly. And in another 20 years, we might be using cars that don't need natural resources like gas. If that happens, everyone will see the benefits of cars, and their numbers will likely increase."}

To make the most of their trip, it's essential for tourists to plan their vacation well. One way to do this is to travel with a tour guide.\n\nThere are many benefits to traveling with a guide. First, the guide is an expert in tourism. They know the best places to visit and how long to spend at each one. They can plan the day efficiently, unlike someone traveling alone who would spend hours deciding what to do next.\n\nSecond, the guide gets tickets ready beforehand, so the group can go straight to the attraction without wasting time. For example, visiting the Eiffel Tower in Paris can take two hours just to get a ticket during peak season. But with a guide, you can skip the long lines.\n\nThird, the guide arranges transportation in advance, making sure buses are available at the right times and know where to go. If you're traveling alone, you'd waste a lot of time getting from one place to another.\n\nTraveling with a group also has social benefits. You'll likely be with people from your home country, so you can socialize and discuss the attractions you visit. You might even make new friends.\n\nSome people might say that having a guide takes away their freedom to make choices. But this can be solved by adding a day or two to your trip or skipping certain guided tours that don't interest you.\n\nOverall, I believe that traveling with a tour guide is the best way to go.

A study at my university shows that people are becoming less willing to drive in cities.\n\nHaving a car is also becoming more expensive. One reason is that oil prices keep going up. This is a big problem for ordinary people who already have financial struggles. Another reason is that governments are taxing cars that are bad for the environment.

However, I completely disagree with this idea. Not only do I think it's unfair, but my own experience shows the opposite.\n\nOne reason people think this is because they compare young people today to older people when they were young. But I don't think there's any proof that older people were more committed back then. I think people just remember the past in a way that's not accurate. Also, big protests in the 1960s and 1970s about wars and politics might make it seem like young people used to be more committed.\n\nOn the other hand, I know that many young people help their communities. I volunteer at a local charity, and most of the volunteers are my age or younger. Young people also help their communities in other ways that might not be as visible, like being part of political parties and taking action in their communities. I have friends who do this.\n\nIn conclusion, young people are just as committed to their communities as they used to be. The reason people think they're not is that the ways they help are not as visible, like working with a charity."}

Using a tour guide is a safe and easy way to travel. When you travel with a guide, you go with a group. The guide plans out where you will go and what you will do. You can't get lost because you're with a group. It's also fun to meet new people. On the other hand, some people like to travel without a guide because they want to spend time with their family. They don't want to follow a schedule or be with a big group. They just go wherever they want. This kind of travel can be a little risky, but some people enjoy it. Traveling is important, and it doesn't matter how you do it. But traveling without a guide, without a plan, is a great experience that everyone should try at least once."}

They also have many social activities like going to the movies, traveling, and similar things. However, most young people do not have a clear life goal. They do not know what is truly important in their lives and waste their time on TV or video games. It's a shame for them.\n\nIn reality, we can see that young people today do not spend enough time helping their communities. Because of modernization, parents take their children to cities to find work. When parents are at work, their children are left alone at home or sent to daycare. These children do not have a role model who helps the community, and all they know is to have fun. There is no doubt that parents are always role models for their children. This is why young people today do not help their communities enough. Additionally, the media always sends the wrong message to young people. All the media talks about is having fun. This is another reason for this problem.\n\nIn conclusion, young people need more education and training to teach them to help their communities. Parents should also be trained to be good role models. The media needs to create good programs to teach young people about their social responsibilities. If we do these things, we can eventually see young people today spending more time helping their communities. And we will have a better world than before."}

Later, post-modern ads became popular and focused on the image or impression of the ad. Today, post-modern ads are the main type of advertising.\n\nThe problem with post-modern ads is that they try to appeal to us by highlighting the good parts and hiding the bad. They make the product seem better than it is. For example, in my country, insurance companies spend a lot of money on ads with big letters saying things like 'No extra money to pay for 2 months.' But they hide the important details in small print that's hard to read. People only see the big letters and think it's a great deal. But when they actually use the service, they realize they were tricked.\n\nAnother way ads make products seem better is by showing beautiful images. This is especially true for visual ads. The image is so impressive that people forget the product's real use is limited. Sometimes, ads even use famous people to make the product seem cool. People then copy the celebrities and buy the product.\n\nThe psychological tricks in post-modern ads can convince people to buy a product. By hiding the flaws and highlighting the good points, or by using impressive images, ads make products seem better than they are. People often get tricked by ads. We need to be aware of this so we don't get fooled. That's why I think most ads make products seem much better than they really are."}

They need to know about all the parts to be a good doctor.\n\nIn math, you need to know addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to solve a problem. You can't just know one operation and expect to get the right answer. Similarly, having knowledge in all areas helps us communicate and build good relationships with others. We need to know a little about everything to succeed in life. Having broad knowledge is good, and it's what makes someone a genius.

If I could do it again, I'd pay for a guide without hesitation. So, I fully agree with traveling in a group led by a guide.\n\nFirst, I think it's a good idea to pay someone to show me around because it's the best way to see everything in a city I don't know. The guide can show me the history, landmarks, stories, local restaurants, and fun places to go. It's all included in the price! For example, on my trip with my mom, the guide showed us all of France. My mom had visited Paris three years before, but she still learned new things with the guide.\n\nSecond, I feel safe with a guided tour because the guide knows the best routes and times to visit the city. I don't have to worry about getting lost or running into problems.\n\nIn short, I prefer to travel with a guide because it's the best way to learn about a new place. A guide is better than a book because they can answer any questions I have right away. Plus, their personal experiences are more interesting than what I can read in a book."}

On one hand, I agree that learning facts is important, but on the other hand, understanding ideas and concepts is what really helps students make progress.\n\nLearning facts is a key part of inventing something, doing research, or working on new programs for the government or society. \n\nTo explain my point, I want to tell you about my father's work. My father does research on synapses, which are the connections between neurons. He and his student group at the university in Munich studied all the known facts about neurons. This was the basis for their research and experiments.\n\nOnce they understood how signals are sent from one cell to another, they started thinking about how to block this information transfer. They used poisons like atropine, which stops specific neurons from passing through a cell membrane.\n\nThis example shows how knowing facts and discovering concepts go together.\n\nAnother example that supports my view is the political system. A student can learn all the facts about the German democratic system, like how it was set up after World War II with the help of the Americans, British, French, and Soviets. But this is not enough if they want to think of new ways for citizens to participate.\n\nFacts are sometimes a necessary background, but to be innovative and creative, you need to understand the main idea or concept.\n\nIn conclusion, I would advise students to learn facts and use them as a way to understand complex ideas and concepts easily."}

We need to see it in person and try it out.\n\nOne reason I think ads are misleading is that what we see in them is often not true. For example, a TV ad shows a new car, but we can't know how it handles on the road just by watching the ad. We need to test drive it.\n\nAnother reason is that many ads feature famous people like actors and athletes. I saw an ad for a bike endorsed by a sports star. Many people in my town bought the bike after seeing the ad, but it turned out to be poorly designed and had problems with its electronics and engine. Now they're complaining to the dealer.\n\nSo, I think we should be careful not to believe everything we see in ads and end up buying bad products.\n\nIt's also interesting to ask if the people making these ads and endorsing products actually use them. For example, an actor in my town endorses a brand of computers, but I heard he uses a different brand himself. This means he doesn't trust the product he's promoting. Most people who make ads don't use the products they're selling. They use better brands instead. So, we shouldn't always believe ads and buy products.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that most ads are just trying to make money by misleading people.

It's clear that companies have a big impact on what we buy.\n\nA company tries to send a message through its product to meet our wants and needs. They focus all their efforts on communication.\n\nAs consumers, we should be able to tell the difference between what's real and what's not. Companies often take advantage of people's innocence. So, we need to remember that ads don't always show the true qualities of a product. Everything is about the image the company wants to create.\n\nFor example, toys for kids are often made to seem better than they are. This is because kids want to believe they're great and are attracted to them. The same is true for older people. Our whole society is taught to want to be perfect and beautiful at any age. Companies know this and use it to sell their products.\n\nIn conclusion, it's hard to say if ads are realistic or not. But it's clear that companies want us to believe their product will make us beautiful, healthy, or happy. It also depends on the buyer's personality because they have the final say. In other words, it's up to us, the consumers."}

For instance, new cellphones have cameras, MP3 players, internet, and more. Another example is cameras. There have been improvements in cameras. Now we have digital cameras that take good pictures.

This is different from older people, who think about their family, retirement, and future. They save money and reduce their activities to stay healthy. Young people, on the other hand, want to spend time with friends, lovers, and enjoy modern things. They don't save money and like to use credit cards to spend more.\n\nSecond, young people are easily attracted to new things. They get excited about computer games, cars, clothes, and so on. They spend more money and time on these things. They think they have plenty of time to work and enjoy life later. But they're using their parents' money to have fun. Older people are different; they don't care about new things and just want to have a good life.\n\nThird, young people don't think about their families; they think their own lives are more important.

For example, 70 percent of people who have traveled with a guide say they had a good mood. I often travel with my parents, and we always use a guide. The guide arranges our schedule, so we don't have to worry about anything. We can just relax and enjoy the view. This makes the trip happy and easy. We also have more time to chat with each other.\n\nFurthermore, traveling with a guide can also save us money. Without a guide, we might buy something useless but attractive. But with a guide, we can avoid this. For instance, when my family went to Qingdao, a charming seashore town, we were attracted to buying seafood. But the guide stopped us because the price was too high. Thanks to his advice, we saved money and bought something useful instead.\n\nIn conclusion, traveling with a guide can help us have a good mood and save money.

In this essay, I will discuss the pros and cons of traveling without proper guidance.\n\nWhen traveling with a tour guide, you can feel safer and more confident exploring new places. This is because the guide has expertise and experience. They can also show you the most important and interesting places to visit, which saves time and money.\n\nOn the other hand, traveling with a tour guide can be uncomfortable. You can't visit places whenever you want because the guide has a set route. You also can't enjoy alone time because you have to do activities with the group, which can be boring.\n\nIn my opinion, traveling with someone is important, but it's great to do it in a group. You can enjoy many activities and exchange cultures with others. If you have a tour guide, you can see many places quickly and affordably. The most important thing is to be prepared to travel alone, in a group, or with a guide. What matters is that you're happy and having fun."}
{"file_id": "1048738.txt", "output_essay": "Many companies spend a lot of money on advertising. But why do they do that? Is it still worth it after spending thousands of dollars on ads? The answer is yes. I read an article about a drink ad featuring a famous Korean star. After the ad, the product's sales went up a lot. Why did this happen?\n\nFirst, advertisers try to make their product look good in ads to attract customers. No one wants to say bad things about their own product on TV. So, people start to think that the product on TV or in newspapers is better because of the images they see. For example, using a picture of Jessica Alba to show beauty and health makes people think, \"If I use that product, I'll be beautiful and healthy like Jessica Alba.\"\n\nAlso, ads create trust in people's minds without them even realizing it. It's human nature to think that products we know are better than ones we don't know. Ads make products more well-known. People don't trust things they don't know about. So, ads create a kind of fake trust in the product. For example, would you choose Pantene or a shampoo you've never seen, even if you've never used either? Most people would choose Pantene because they know it.\n\nAdvertising is like a magic trick that gets people to buy things. It works by using a pleasant image of a famous person and our natural preference for famous products. It makes people want to buy things. But we need to remember that \"a picture is worth a thousand words.\" We need to try things ourselves, not just believe what we see on TV."}

This depends on the type of subject.\n\nIf the subject is science, I think it's not important for students to understand. They should just learn the facts. For example, if the teacher says the sun rises in the east, students shouldn't argue about it.

Taking risks can lead you to new areas of your career that you never knew existed. For instance, developing new technology or improving existing ones. If you don't take risks, you might miss out on new opportunities because you're too busy doing the same old thing.\n\nAnother benefit of taking risks is that if you fail, you can always go back to what you were doing before. Let's say you want to develop a new product. If you don't try new ways to apply the product, you might not invent something better. For example, engineers created spray deodorants, but they found out it harmed the environment. They can always go back to the old way of applying deodorants and help the environment.\n\nThese two reasons show why taking risks is important in your career.

This is because of globalization, which has broken down communities.\n\nIt's not surprising that many young people do not help their communities.

But the product in the ad might not be the same as the real one.\n\nFor example, car companies show their cars performing well and having many features. But the real car might not be as good. They also put a small asterisk mark on the ad, saying 'under standard testing conditions.' But people usually don't notice that because the font is too small.\n\nIt's not just car companies. Financial companies also make their plans seem better than they are. They only talk about the benefits, not the risks. This is a sneaky way to trick people.\n\nIf a company wants to be successful, it needs to have a good reputation. To do this, they make their products look great in ads. Of course, some products are real, like jewelry. What you see in the ad is what you get.\n\nNew photography technology is also part of the problem. Special lights and cameras can make anything look amazing. I agree that most ads make products seem better than they really are."}
{"file_id": "1046103.txt", "output_essay": "The question is whether successful people should try new things or stick with what they're good at. This is an important issue because we face many daily choices like this. I think people should try new things and explore opportunities around them. I believe this because life is full of risks, and if someone doesn't take risks, they'll miss out on many good opportunities.\n\nFirst, I think taking risks usually brings big rewards. If you don't take risks, you won't get any benefits. For example, a bank offers a new type of investment that can earn you an extra $1,000 a year. Why not try it instead of settling for a safer option that earns less? In my opinion, someone who chooses the safer option doesn't know their own abilities, and that's a shame.\n\nSecond, life is full of risks, and you can't be successful by playing it safe. Every day, new opportunities come up, and most of them can make your life better. For example, take a risk and join a club to meet new people. You might make new friends, and that's a good thing. I believe that people who always stick with what they know will never find new opportunities, but successful people make the most of them.\n\nFinally, I think successful people don't miss opportunities. When you look at successful people, you can see that they take risks. They're the ones who not only take risks but also make the most of them.\n\nIn summary, I think everyone should take more risks to be more successful. Taking risks will bring them better things and make them successful. If Napoleon Bonaparte were alive, I think he would say 'take risks, take risks, take risks, and you'll be successful'."}

As someone who's grown older, I think I know a thing or two about this topic.\n\nThere are many reasons why I don't agree with the idea that younger people are wiser. One reason is that young people lack experience. You can only gain experience one day at a time.\n\nAnother reason is that young people often struggle with money. When you're young, you usually have a tight budget, and it's hard to stick to it because of peer pressure and immaturity. This can make life difficult, and it affects everything else.\n\nYoung people can also be careless and think they know everything. These traits are connected and can cause problems.\n\nI know these things are true because I've lived through them. That's why I don't agree with the idea that younger people are wiser. Older people are wiser, more thoughtful, and more careful. They're also more financially secure and can afford nicer things.\n\nIn short, life is a journey, and older people are ahead in this journey."}
{"file_id": "1050463.txt", "output_essay": "I completely agree with the statement.\n\nFirst, ads only show the good things about a product, not the bad things. I've experienced this myself many times. I remember the first ads for Apple's iPod. They made customers think the iPod was not just a music player with a nice design, but the most convenient player on the market. I was one of the first people to buy an iPod, but soon I was a little disappointed with my decision. The ads didn't show that you could only change the music on the iPod using one software program and one computer at a time. I still have the iPod, but next time, I'll make sure to know more about a product's features before buying it.\n\nAlso, many products don't really have the great features that ads show. A friend of mine works in marketing and does ads for different companies. When we meet for drinks and talk about our jobs, he tells me about new clients and their products. Sometimes, he and his colleagues don't even see one good thing about a product, but it's their job to make people want to buy it.\n\nAs I've shown, ads don't always tell the truth about a product and make it seem better than it is. I've learned from my experiences, and I think everyone should know that the product they buy might not be as perfect as the ad says."}
{"file_id": "1052334.txt", "output_essay": "I believe that curiosity is the main reason people invent. I strongly agree with this idea. Successful people try new things and take risks instead of just doing what they're good at. There are many qualities that make a person successful. Two of these are determination and intelligence.\n\nFirst, a person with determination never gives up. They don't accept 'no' for an answer. They study hard to achieve their goal. They're curious about what they want to achieve. They do their best to learn new things and make new discoveries. For example, Einstein was a genius. He made many important discoveries that we still use today. I think he combined his ambitions, intelligence, and determination to become someone who will always be remembered.\n\nSecond, intelligence is very important for success. If someone is intelligent, they can understand problems easily and find ways to solve them. If people weren't curious about new discoveries, we wouldn't have many of the things we have today. For example, technology wouldn't be improving, and we wouldn't be finding new ways to fight diseases like cancer. These discoveries are very helpful to humans.\n\nIn summary, you can't achieve anything without taking risks. The world is changing quickly. People need to keep learning to keep up with these changes. They shouldn't be afraid of new ideas and technology. Instead, they should think about how they can improve themselves. They should do this not just for themselves, but for the good of everyone around them."}
{"file_id": "1052336.txt", "output_essay": "I believe that helping local communities is very important and deserves more time and attention. To show this, I want to talk about my own community and how young people are committed to helping others.\n\nWhen I say 'helping communities,' I mean volunteering time and effort to make a difference locally. There are many youth groups that meet weekly to pursue their interests and goals. These groups include choirs, play groups, and sports clubs. By working together, they make their community a better place. Some groups organize public events like summer parties, and the money they raise goes to local organizations.\n\nMany young people also volunteer to help others in their community. For example, some join the fire department to help their families and neighbors in need. They attend weekly meetings and training sessions to prepare for this important work. Others become part-time or full-time social workers, helping people in need. They can work in old people's homes, helping with daily tasks or just spending time with them. Some work with people with disabilities, helping them with their daily lives. Others work with young children who are struggling at home or in school. There are many ways for young people to make a difference.\n\nAnother way to get involved in the community is to participate in local politics. This allows young people to share their ideas and make a positive impact. For example, I recently ran a campaign to improve the conditions at our local kindergarten. We informed the community about the issues and collected signatures to support our cause. We were able to make a difference and achieve our goal."}
{"file_id": "1053319.txt", "output_essay": "I agree that young people today do not spend enough time helping their communities. One reason might be that they do not see a good reason to use their free time to help others instead of doing things they enjoy. As cities grow and become more anonymous, young people may not feel appreciated for their volunteer work like they would in a smaller town where everyone knows each other. However, this is a misconception because helping others is valued everywhere. So, what do young people do with their time instead? They spend it on activities they find more enjoyable. This is a trend we can see in all ages and parts of society. It's more fun to go to the movies than help the elderly. What we need are incentives. Parents can help their kids understand the importance of taking responsibility and helping the community from a young age. Small actions can be more important and valued than we think, and all kinds of work are welcome. The community needs a strong core to create networks and attract young people through specific institutions and activities. I believe that if young people can identify with their community, they will be willing to help and invest their time."}
{"file_id": "1052180.txt", "output_essay": "This topic brings to mind the common question, 'what is better: quantity or quality.' This essay will explore the pros and cons of having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects versus specializing in one.\n\nThe first part of this essay will list and explain the advantages of each approach, and the second part will discuss the disadvantages. In elementary and secondary education, students typically study many subjects rather than focusing on one. This gives them a chance to learn about different fields and have more options for their future career or education.\n\nFor example, a student who takes physics and biology has many career choices: they could go into engineering, medicine, or other fields. On the other hand, a student who focuses on one subject will likely excel in it because they spend more time studying it. This is especially true for students in technical schools who choose their career path early on.\n\nThe saying 'jack of all trades and master of none' reminds us that students who try to learn too many subjects may not master any. Having a broad knowledge of many subjects can also cause confusion when it's time to choose a specialization. However, specializing in one subject limits career options and makes you vulnerable to economic and geographical changes. If you specialize in one subject and it's no longer attractive, you may need to start over.\n\nFor instance, a student who specializes in nursing from an early age may only consider a nursing degree. In conclusion, what is better depends on the individual and their ability to use what they've learned."}
{"file_id": "1052677.txt", "output_essay": "It's better to know a little about many subjects than to be an expert in just one. This is because learning depends on sharing information.\n\nNew ideas and inventions come from knowing about many different subjects.\n\nWhen someone has a broad range of knowledge, they can achieve their goals and become successful. Knowing many subjects makes a person perfect and confident, which is very important for personal growth.\n\nKnowing many subjects helps a person keep up with changing technology, which requires creative thinking, intelligence, and a lot of information. This helps companies progress and succeed in the future.\n\nFor example, a company that's just starting out needs people who can make a big difference. They need someone who knows about all aspects of marketing and business. This person must be committed, dedicated, and smart enough to understand the company's needs and solve problems.\n\nIf the company has trouble, this person must be able to figure out what's going wrong and come up with a solution. They need to know which area needs improvement and fix it quickly.\n\nAs society's needs and demands change, knowing many subjects makes a person more practical and able to think critically. It's more important to have a broad range of knowledge than to specialize in one area. Knowledge is divided into many subjects, so it's important to understand all of them to be good at everything."}
{"file_id": "1052664.txt", "output_essay": "Many people think that ads make products seem better than they really are. This is often true, and we experience it every day.\n\nThe main goal of an ad is to get people to buy a product. To do this, advertisers use techniques that make their product seem not only good but also better than similar products.\n\nThis is where the problem starts. Advertisers want to make you think you need their product, so they focus on its good points and ignore its bad points. This creates an unfair view of the product, making it seem better than it really is.\n\nThe car industry is a good example of this. It's a very competitive market, so advertisers make every car seem perfect for you, even if it's not. For instance, American car makers often advertise their cars as strong and durable. But they don't mention that these cars use more gas than other cars.\n\nIf you only look at the ad, you might think the American car is a great product. But if you buy it, you'll soon find out that it uses a lot of gas. You might feel like you made a mistake, that the car wasn't as good as the ad said.\n\nThis example shows that ads often make products seem better than they are to get people to buy them."}

Second, the economy might get worse.\n\nIn the future, people will value a healthy environment more because it's getting worse now. If we think of the earth as a living thing, it's not healthy. People will soon realize this and start acting responsibly to prevent more harm. This means they will reduce their use of cars.\n\nTake global warming, for example. It's already getting people's attention and making them want to take action.\n\nThe state of the environment will greatly affect society and change its economy. When this happens, individuals won't be able to afford their own cars, and this will force society to reduce car use. Other ways of getting around, like public transportation, will become even more popular. They're already used often, but not always for the right reasons.\n\nIf more people understood that fewer cars would help the planet, we wouldn't have to wait twenty years for people to stop using these harmful machines."}
{"file_id": "1052028.txt", "output_essay": "While it's true that more people are using public transportation, I believe there will be more cars on the road in the future.\n\nOne reason is that people want to own their own car, not just share one with their family. For example, a father needs a car to get to work, and a mother needs a car to take care of her kids and do errands. Even kids want their own car when they grow up and go to college. So, each person needs a car, which means more cars will be on the road.\n\nAnother reason is that people are moving farther away from their workplaces, which makes them need cars. Many people, including Koreans, prefer to live 30 minutes to an hour away from their job. This means they need a car to get to work. For instance, my professor lives an hour away from college and drives to school every morning.\n\nIt's true that some people use public transportation to save money, but that doesn't mean they don't own a car. They have a car but choose to use public transportation sometimes. When they're in a hurry or tired of waiting for the bus, they'll use their own car. So, the need for personal cars and the trend of moving away from workplaces will increase the demand for cars. Even people who use public transportation often own a car, so there will be more cars on the road in the future."}

However, knowing a little about many subjects can help you apply for more types of jobs. Being a generalist can also make it easier to get a job at a company. Once you have the job, you'll still need to adapt to the company's needs, whether you're a specialist or generalist.\n\nSecond, some people think that specializing in one field takes less time than studying many subjects. This is partly true, but experience shows that it takes the same amount of time to get a degree, no matter what you study. In my opinion, studying many subjects is better because it gives you more job opportunities after graduation. The time you spend studying is the same, but your options are broader.\n\nIn summary, students should think carefully about the consequences of studying a specific subject. They should also not believe the myth that studying many subjects takes the same time as specializing in one."}

It's better to focus on one subject.\n\nWhen I was in middle school in Korea, I had to study many subjects. We had to learn Physics, Engineering, and more. I had to take big tests every term. I wondered if studying so many subjects really helped me learn what I needed to know.\n\nMany subjects, like Engineering, cooking, or music, didn't interest me. They weren't important for my future. Many students had the same problem. It's also very hard for someone to be good at many subjects.\n\nSome people might say that to be successful, you need to be good at many things. For example, in companies, employees need to be good at math, working with people, and other skills. But if you try to be good at too many things, it won't help your career. You still need to be very good at one thing, which is what you'll do for your job.\n\nThe main reason studying many subjects is not good is that it stops you from really learning something. When you know a little about many subjects, you don't know much about anything. What's the point of knowing many things if you don't know anything important or useful? Why struggle to know many things that others can easily learn too?\n\nThere's no point or fun in knowing a little about many subjects.

{"file_id": "1057485.txt", "output_essay": "I believe that in twenty years, there will be fewer cars on the road than there are today. This is because cars mainly run on fuels that will eventually run out. As a result, the demand for petroleum and its products will increase. Over time, people may be forced to switch to public transport because fuel costs will be too high.\n\nThe government will make owning a car more expensive by increasing taxes, insurance, and registration fees. This will encourage people to use public transport, which is cheaper and has many benefits. Car manufacturers are already looking into alternative fuels like electricity and hybrid cars. Electric cars can only go a certain distance before needing to be recharged, which is a major limitation.\n\nHybrid cars use more than one fuel, but they are expensive. They may be the cars of the future. As the population grows, more people will use cars, which will increase air pollution and harm our health. The government should encourage people to use public transport, which is better for the environment, reduces traffic, and is cheaper."}
{"file_id": "1054476.txt", "output_essay": "I agree that there will be fewer cars on the road in twenty years. Here's why.\n\nFirst, many governments are limiting car use because of the serious problems they cause. For example, cars release poisonous gases like carbon monoxide when they burn gasoline. This hurts people, animals, and plants. They also release carbon dioxide, which contributes to the greenhouse effect.\n\nSecond, governments are worried about running out of natural resources, especially oil. Cars need oil to run, and it's also needed to make them. The manufacturing process requires high temperatures, which are provided by oil. Additionally, cars have plastic parts, which are made from oil.\n\nFurthermore, governments are looking for alternative transportation methods that don't have the same problems as cars. In my country, Japan, the government is investing in research to develop a 'linear motor car.' This car runs on magnetic energy and doesn't release harmful gases. Experts think it will become popular in 15 years.\n\nTherefore, I agree that there will be fewer cars on the road in twenty years due to these reasons."}

In daily life, people focus on things like clothes, beauty, and money rather than values like kindness and honesty. So, people try to show off these things instead of who they really are.\n\nSecond, the media, like TV and radio, has grown very fast and connects people all over the world. As a result, people are heavily influenced by the information they get.\n\nWe can apply these two ideas to how people see products every day.

In my opinion, both ways have advantages and disadvantages, but the second way is better.\n\nThe main advantage of specializing in a subject is that it increases job opportunities in that field. Today, companies look for people who can make a real difference. Well-prepared students are a valuable asset that helps companies make more money.\n\nOn the other hand, people who study various subjects have a better social life. They can use the information they gather to connect with others. I also think that these people are more flexible when it comes to changing careers.\n\nAlthough specializing in a subject may seem better at first, I believe that having broad knowledge is more useful in the long run. I chose to study management engineering in depth to be more competitive in the job market. However, when I meet people who study different subjects, I feel like my education is incomplete.

{"file_id": "1048952.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with the statement, and I will explain my reasons in the following paragraphs.\n\nThe environment is getting polluted at a very fast rate, making it hard to imagine people using cars in the future. Many famous people and activists are working together to save the environment from pollution. This is just the beginning of a new era in the 21st century, with many big changes and protests happening to save the Earth.\n\nIn today's world, a vehicle has become a basic need. By vehicle, I mean a car, because on average, every 2 to 8 people use a car in developed and developing countries. Earlier, a car was a necessity or a symbol of wealth. But now, it's common to use a luxurious car, even when it's not really needed. Car manufacturers are introducing new designs quickly and making a lot of money. This makes it hard to imagine a pollution-free environment.\n\nI don't think that pollution is only caused by too many cars, but it's a big contributor. According to an article in National Geographic, 42 percent of pollution comes from cars. It's surprising to see that some developed countries, like China, are changing laws to protect the environment and making their citizens follow these laws. This might be a challenge for car manufacturers in the future. In Venice, which is considered a pollution-free city, people don't use cars.\n\nMaybe someone will invent an eco-friendly car, and we might switch to that. It's unlikely that cars will be used as much in the future due to environmental problems and health hazards. There's a need to address the problems of pollution and health hazards caused by cars. As they say, 'Prevention is always better than cure.' We should take note of these problems and try to find a solution to the environmental damage."}

The school curriculum is a mix of both. But the important question is, \"How much do students remember later?\" They only remember what they understand, not what they memorize. So, it's crucial to grasp concepts in school rather than just memorizing facts and forgetting them later.\n\nHistory chapters often fail to teach us what's important. For example, Alexander the Great was a great conqueror. He conquered many places. But he was also murdered and became humble. We should appreciate his bravery and energy, but also see his flaws, like being overconfident and greedy.\n\nWe need to change our education system to help students develop their minds. A well-developed person is confident, reliable, and a good person. In the past, India's education system was better. The old schools, called \"gurukuls,\" were respected and sacred. Students focused on learning and understanding. They learned facts, but they also knew how to use them to gain knowledge, which is the main goal of education. A confident student who understands basic concepts will be more successful than one who just memorizes facts and forgets them."}

I don't think everyone will have poor knowledge, but most people won't have good knowledge. This means our society will be weak.\n\nFor example, scientists have made many discoveries because they studied many subjects. If Newton only studied why an apple fell, he might not have discovered the law of gravity.

One view is that understanding ideas and concepts is key, while another view is that learning facts is more beneficial. I believe that understanding ideas and concepts is more important. To discover something new, a student needs to learn basic concepts and ideas. Learning facts is part of the process, but it's more important to understand the ideas and concepts.\n\nIn university, we're taught that learning concepts and ideas is more important. By learning them, you can learn facts and make them more useful for society. For example, an electrical engineering student who wants to innovate transistor concepts needs to understand the ideas and concepts first. If they only learn facts, they can't be an engineer. Engineers need to be innovative and think of new things. To invent something, they need to understand the concepts and ideas.\n\nThink about communication technology. Fifteen years ago, mobile phones weren't widely used. Now, everyone uses them. Technology gets better over time. If engineers and students only learn facts without understanding the ideas and concepts, they can't improve technology. By understanding concepts, they can share information and use technology better.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning facts. If a student wants to create something new, they need to understand the ideas and concepts. If they only learn facts, they can't create something new. That's how academic learning works in universities. They teach us to use ideas and concepts to learn. By doing so, we can learn facts, but if only facts are taught, there's no way to improve society or technology."}

Some people think ads make products seem better than they are, while others think ads show products as they really are. I believe ads make products seem better to make more money, attract more people, and grow their business.\n\nOne reason is to make a lot of money. Some business owners don't care about others. They just want to sell you something at a high price, even if it's not worth it. For example, my grandfather saw a TV ad for a computer that cost three thousand dollars. He didn't know much about computers, so he bought it. But my father said the computer was only worth one thousand dollars.\n\nAnother reason is that business owners want to attract as many people as possible. They don't care about the quality of their product. For instance, my mother bought a vacuum cleaner she saw on TV. She thought it was the best one she'd ever seen. But when it arrived, it broke after just four days.\n\nFinally, business owners make products seem better because they want to grow their business. They want to sell more things and make more money. They start with one product, make money from it, and then use that money to make more products. This helps them grow their business.\n\nIn conclusion, I think many ads make products seem better than they are because business owners want to make more money, attract more people, and grow their business.

They might blame their age for their unhappiness.\n\nOn the other hand, a young, poor, sick, and lonely person might still be happy and enjoy life. They wouldn't even think about why they're happy.\n\nBeing young or old doesn't say much about whether you enjoy life or not. I think my life has improved a lot since I grew up. I won't fight my age, but I'll work on myself to improve my attitude and enjoy the important things in my life, like my two sons and my wife. If my family and I stay healthy, what more do I need?"}

They also have very little time to get our attention.\n\nFirst, advertisements are meant to attract customers. There are many companies and products today. To sell more, companies need to get people to buy their products. Advertisements are a great way to do this. For example, we see many ads every day. To grab our attention, ads often show products doing things they can't really do. My mom, for instance, often gets bad flu and buys medicine after seeing ads. But the medicine never works. This is because ads make products seem perfect, but they're not. So, she has to buy new medicine. As you can see, many ads exaggerate what their products can do to make more money.\n\nWhat's more, ads are very short, and companies need to make a quick impression. So, they have to make their products seem better than they really are."}
{"file_id": "1054940.txt", "output_essay": "Should we learn or should we understand? This is a question that has been debated for a long time. Everyone wonders which one is more important. But can we really understand without learning?\n\nI agree with this idea because I think it's not always helpful to just memorize things. I think it's more important to understand something and to develop our critical thinking. But both are really important.\n\nWe need to learn so we can understand what's happening in our lives or in our society. For example, if we want to understand a political debate or vote, we need to know what a Republican or a Democrat is. In life, we always need to know something to understand it. That's why learning is important.\n\nHowever, we should be careful not to just memorize things without understanding them. That's pointless. For instance, if someone knows how to spell words but doesn't know how to make a sentence, it's useless.\n\nAlthough memorizing things can be boring, we need to do it. The more we learn about a subject, the more we can talk about it and understand it. If we learn how the American parliament works, we'll better understand the role of G. Bush, for example.\n\nSo, I think we shouldn't choose between understanding and learning. These two things go together; they complement each other. Although nobody likes to memorize things, we need to do it to understand what's happening in our lives or society better."}

They met every day after school in the library, where they studied and helped others. Some students couldn't afford test-prep schools or college-prep programs, so the tutoring group helped them with their questions. I was one of those students because I had just moved from a foreign country, and they helped me improve my English. Now I'm part of the group and teach other students math and Chinese. I think my friends and classmates did a great job helping our community. I believe there are other student groups in other schools doing the same thing.\n\nDuring the summer, most of my friends volunteered to take care of children or elderly people. Some of these children had no parents, and some were abandoned. I once participated in this service and read stories to them. At first, I wanted to practice my English reading, but I ended up feeling emotional because I wanted to do more for them. I asked my friends to join, and we all learned from the experience. One of my friends had volunteered at a hospital, where she talked to elderly people and read to them. She said that community service was a unique experience that taught her about life and helping others without expecting anything in return. Young people do help their communities without making a big deal about it; they choose to help quietly. Once they start, they usually keep helping."}

There are three main reasons for this: technology, their happy lives, and the media.\n\nToday's technology is much better than it was 10 or 15 years ago. This means young people have more fun things to do in their free time. The problem is that most young people spend too much time on fun things like TV, video games, and computers. In the past, people did not have as much fun stuff, so they would spend their afternoons helping at community centers. Now, young people prefer to spend their time in front of a screen instead of helping others.\n\nAnother reason is that many young people do not care about others. This is because they have not had to deal with hard times in their lives. They are too happy and do not understand the value of helping others. Older people know that even a little help can make a big difference, so they are more willing to help. Young people do not realize that their help can be a big reward for others.\n\nFinally, the media plays a big role in this problem. If the media encouraged young people to help their communities, there would be more helpers. The media is what young people relate to the most, so if it told them that many people need help, they would be more likely to help.\n\nIn conclusion, the main reasons young people do not help their communities enough are the improvement in technology, their happy lives, and the media's influence."}

The problem is not with the people we look up to, but with how we measure success. We usually think someone is successful when they are famous, rich, or well-known. But that's not always true.\n\nTake sports, for example. Some players are very good at soccer, but that doesn't mean they're good at other games. Similarly, just because someone is good at one thing, like the founder of Microsoft, it doesn't mean they're good at everything else. They might not know much about mining or designing clothes.\n\nI don't think people who just sell things, like Walmart, are successful. To be successful, someone should be good at many things, like selling, manufacturing, and researching. If someone can do all these things well, then I would call them successful. Some people can try new things and still be successful."}

They believe that young people only want to make a lot of money and are selfish. However, there are some points that support this idea, and some that don't.\n\nOne thing to consider is that the connection between older and younger people is not as strong as it used to be. For example, it's not common for multiple generations to live together in one house anymore. This means that young people don't feel the same sense of community that existed in the past. But I think this doesn't mean they're not helping their communities.\n\nMany teenagers help their communities in different ways. Some help at church or with local government, like during elections. I have friends who do this, and their work is really impressive. Others work to protect the environment, which helps the community live in a sustainable way. Many students also work hard at school or university. This doesn't just mean they want to be successful; they also want to make their school or university a better place for everyone.\n\nSome might say that students who focus on their studies don't have time to help their community directly. But I think that learning is the key to making the community a better place. Young people know that if they don't work hard, they won't be able to make a good life for their community. For example, if there are no skilled workers in a town, the economy and the community will suffer.\n\nIn conclusion, it's not true that young people today don't care about their communities. As we've seen, they're involved in many activities that help their communities, even if they do it differently than older generations."}

With more companies and products, each one wants to increase its market share. Advertisements play a big role in selling products.\n\nI agree that ads make products seem better than they really are. To attract customers, companies show their products in a great light, give them lots of publicity, and hire celebrities to promote them. But when a customer buys the product, they often feel cheated and angry with the company.\n\nFor example, a company claimed their bike could travel 120km on one liter of petrol to beat their competitors. But they hid the truth that they had exaggerated the mileage. Many customers bought the bike, but when they used it, they found it didn't perform as promised. They went to the company, asking for the truth, but the company's response was not what they expected. They took the company to court and got their money back.\n\nThis example shows us a lot about the topic. The company lost a lot of money and got a bad reputation. No one would want to buy from that company again. The company thinks that publicity is everything and that people believe what they see. But in reality, seeing is not everything, and we shouldn't believe everything we see.\n\nCompanies should be honest and advertise what their products really offer. This way, they can have a good long-term relationship with customers and maintain a good reputation."}

As things change, people's goals get higher, their responsibilities increase, and they want to achieve more. Their needs have changed greatly with technology and science. This change has not made life easier, but more challenging.\n\nPeople of all ages are working harder than they did 20 years ago. A small kid is busy with schoolwork, a teenager is building a career, and a middle-aged person is improving their skills or lifestyle. Only retired people seem to have time, but they lack energy.\n\nThe recent changes in technology have not only made life easier but also changed the way people think. Today, even kids think about what they can gain from giving something up. Everyone is focused on what they can become, how much they can earn, and how to make more money. They live a busy life where they believe 'Time is Money.'\n\nThey don't want to spend time on something that doesn't benefit them financially. According to management science, people's social needs come after their financial needs.\n\nIn such a society, people rarely think about their communities and take time to help.

You won't have time to play sports, and your health will suffer. You also won't have time to spend with your family and friends, and you'll feel lonely.\n\nSecond, even if you work hard and know a little about many subjects, you'll only know basic information about each subject. You won't be good at any one subject. For example, a doctor who knows a little about history, computers, and plants might not be a good doctor. If everyone knows a little about many subjects, they can do many jobs, but they won't do them well.\n\nIn conclusion, I think people should be experts in one subject and have some knowledge of other subjects, but not spend too much time on them.

In today's society, the idea of community is not as strong as it used to be. In small towns and villages, people still care about their community, but in big cities, many people live alone and do not even know their neighbors' names.\n\nYoung people are not involved in their communities, so they do not think about helping them. One problem is that young people grow up in a society that does not care about others. As a result, they do not learn how to be part of a community and give back to it.\n\nThey should learn this at school, but if their parents do not care, they will not care either. Another problem is that young people have many other things on their minds, like going out with friends or working. Helping the community is not considered cool, and their friends might make fun of them if they do.\n\nAlso, helping the community usually means volunteering, which means you do not get paid. Many young people want to earn money, so they do not volunteer.\n\nAll these reasons explain why young people do not help their communities enough. But it is very important that they do. A community is not just a group of people living together; it can be a helpful network of friends. But to be part of it, you need to get to know the people and work together. Communities also have financial problems, so they need volunteers to help. If young people do not help, things will disappear. They will wonder what happened to the bus that took kids to school or the mall that was built in the park. That is why it is so important for young people to learn how to be part of their community and help it."}

This is what the given statement is about.\n\nI agree that most advertisements make products seem better than they really are. For example, laundry detergents. Each brand says it's the best, making your clothes look new and removing every stain. They compare their products to others, saying theirs is better. But I don't think this is true. Some ads claim their detergent doesn't bleach clothes and still looks new after 30 washes. This is impossible.\n\nAnother example is shampoo. If you believe the ads, every shampoo makes your hair shiny, strong, and not greasy. But this is not true. Shampoos often don't meet our expectations.\n\nMy last example is cigarettes. In ads, cigarettes seem to make you feel free and happy. But is this really true? Don't they have disadvantages or dangers? Of course, they do! A few years ago, no cigarette ad said that smoking affects your health and can cause cancer. Today, they warn customers in ads and on cigarette boxes, but the warnings are often small and ignored.\n\nIn conclusion, remember that advertisers want to sell their products to make money. So, they sometimes exaggerate or lie about what their products can do. Be careful and compare products to find out which ones are best for you or which ones you shouldn't buy because they can harm you or others."}

For example, in my country, about 80 percent of college students need to work part-time jobs to pay for their education. This makes it unfair to compare young people today with those in the past.\n\nIn my country, Turkey, the sense of community and sharing that existed 15-20 years ago is not as strong as it used to be. However, there are now more charity organizations and members than before.\n\nFrom what I've seen, most people who join these organizations are between 18 and 30 years old.

They show you putting dirty clothes in the washing machine and taking them out looking like new. I've tried it, but it doesn't work. So, those ads definitely make the washing powder seem better than it is. Another example is energy bars for sports. Ads say they'll give you superhuman power and a perfect body. I thought it was a cheaper way to get fit, so I tried. But I was disappointed. My fitness level didn't improve, and my body didn't change. I was disappointed with ads' promises until I saw Ovomaltine's new ad. Their chocolate powder ad doesn't claim to make you stronger, just more enduring. It says, 'Ovomaline - not better, but longer.'

When I got to the Architectural School in Milan, I found that I could easily handle difficult subjects like math and structure because my mind was trained to process different types of information.\n\nI believe it's essential for all students, regardless of their background or goals, to learn how to understand ideas and concepts, not just memorize facts. When you understand an idea, you can think critically about it, develop your own views, and approach problems in a more effective way.\n\nFor students, their future is the most important thing, and understanding ideas and concepts will give them the skills to tackle any problem in life."}

I completely agree with this statement.\n\nToday's ads are much more advanced than they were a few decades ago. But the main idea of an ad has always been to get people's attention so that products can sell better. In the past, ads would exaggerate a product's features and customer reviews. This made a product seem better than it really is. Fake customer reviews created a sense of happy customers. While these techniques were already creating a false idea of a product, it's only in the last one or two decades that advertising has become so complex.\n\nPeople, both kids and adults, are fooled by the image that modern ads create about a product. This image is called 'The Brand' in marketing and advertising. Modern ads create connections in our minds between certain products and behaviors. For example, if you drive a certain car, you're cool. Or if you use a certain perfume, you'll be more attractive to others. These connections create illusions, making it hard for people to make smart choices about products.\n\nWhat's more, with this kind of advertising, a product doesn't have to be good to be successful. A regular clothing line can cost twice as much with a celebrity endorsement. These techniques make consumers and companies focus on the image, not the product itself.\n\nThis fake image also contributes to what's called crazy consumerism.

When you're older, you enjoy different things. You want to get married, have kids, buy a nice home, take family vacations, and succeed at work.\n\nSecond, the responsibilities of a student are very different from those of an older person.

When you're older, you have many more responsibilities. If you have a family, you need to take care of them by working, buying food, and paying bills. Having responsibilities can make it harder for adults to enjoy life. But for some, having responsibilities can be a good thing because they feel useful.\n\nFinally, young people may enjoy life less than older people because they usually have less money. As a student, it's harder to take vacations or go to the movies often. You often have to work and study at the same time to pay for fun things and school.

Today, customers and investors are drawn to companies that take risks and offer new products. The world is changing, and companies that can anticipate new trends will survive. For example, easyJet is very successful because it understood the trend of low-cost travel before others did. It was a risk, but it paid off.\n\nWhile it's important to be good at what we do, people who focus too much on experience can be inflexible and struggle to adapt to change.

Here's why: Many people are worried about the environment, and governments are passing laws to protect it. People are also trying to reduce their impact on the environment. Cars are a big part of the problem because they release carbon dioxide, which causes pollution. If people use public transportation instead of driving alone, we can reduce pollution.\n\nCities are growing, and more cities will have public transportation like subways, trains, and buses. This will give people a cheaper way to get around. To save money and time, people will choose public transportation over driving alone. For example, my teachers only drive alone on rainy days because our city's subway is cheap and comfortable.\n\nHaving a car is also expensive. You have to pay for gas, car taxes, and more. These costs will make people less likely to own a car.\n\nFinally, traffic jams and parking problems will also make people less likely to drive alone. Finding a parking spot is very hard.\n\nIn summary, people will be less likely to own cars because of concerns about the environment, convenient public transportation, high car expenses, traffic jams, and parking problems."}
{"file_id": "1061074.txt", "output_essay": "I agree that ads make products seem better than they are. Producers use the latest marketing trends to promote their products. They use methods like promotions, discounts, and door-to-door selling to get people to buy. These methods make people want to buy without knowing what the product is really like or what it can do.\n\nAds make products look appealing and easy to use. For example, a car ad might show the car going fast and highlight its fancy features. But the ad doesn't tell you that speeding can cause accidents or that technology is always changing.\n\nA good ad should show how a product can help people and the environment. If a car ad showed how comfortable and spacious the car is, it would be more helpful.\n\nAdvertising is taking over the marketing world. Ads on banners, flyers, and stalls give people information and make them think positively about products.\n\nUsually, a product is not as good as it looks in an ad, and this can hurt the consumer. Some ads give us useless information or offend people's cultural or religious beliefs. For example, an underwear ad might show a man running behind a horse, which is not true.\n\nIn conclusion, people should be aware of what they buy and how it will affect them or others. They should think about whether a product will still be useful in the future."}

They focus too much on their studies and waste time on personal activities. They do not understand the importance of helping their communities.\n\nIn Taiwan, parents want their children to do well in school more than anything else. They want them to study hard and do not expect them to focus on other things. As a result, young people do not spend much time on other activities, including helping their communities.\n\nYoung people are still young and prefer to have fun, such as playing video games or watching TV, rather than helping their communities. They would rather stay indoors, especially during hot summer days in Taiwan.\n\nFor example, my nephew is a teenager, but he knows very little about his community. He prefers to talk to his friends on his phone and spend time with his girlfriend. He only helps his community when his school requires him to do so and grades his work. When I suggested that he do community service, he was surprised and thought it was a strange idea.\n\nIn conclusion, it is a common problem that young people do not help their communities enough. This is because their parents and the community do not encourage them to help and do not reward them for doing so. As a result, young people are losing touch with their communities."}

While it's good to have some knowledge of many things, it's not as important as being an expert in one area. Anyone can learn other things if they take the time. But if you focus on one subject, you'll know more about it than others do. This kind of knowledge is more useful. For example, imagine you own a company and need to hire someone for marketing. You have two choices: someone who went to a general university or someone who went to a business college. Who would you hire? I'm not saying the university person is bad, but I would choose the business college graduate. I want someone who knows a lot about business and has a clear idea of what they're doing. This is how the real world works. Many successful people, like the CEO of Microsoft, are experts in their field. Knowing a little about many subjects might help you choose a career, but if you already know what you want to do, I think it's better to focus on that one thing. Even if it takes time and effort, don't give up. You might not get appreciation from others, but you'll eventually get the recognition you deserve."}

Both driving cars and using other transportation have their good points. It's hard to say what will happen in twenty years - if there will be fewer cars or not. But if I had to guess, I wouldn't say there will be fewer cars than we have now. I don't agree with the idea that there will be fewer cars. Here's why.\n\nFirst, many people love owning cars. After working hard to buy a nice car, they like to show it off by driving around the city. It's like a dream come true for them.\n\nSecond, Toyota, a big company in Japan, makes a lot of money and helps Japan's economy. We can see that people will still want to buy cars in twenty years.\n\nThird, I think families should take road trips because it helps them bond more than staying at home. Even if they get stuck in traffic, they can have good conversations. Driving is a fun way to spend time together.\n\nIn conclusion, because of these reasons, I don't agree with the idea that there will be fewer cars.

Even though everyone enjoys life in their own way, I think young people enjoy life more than older people.\n\nThere are many reasons why I think this. First, young people are usually healthier and have more energy than older people. Many fun activities need a lot of energy. As people get older, their energy levels go down. They have to worry about their health all the time because it gets worse with age. They might have a hobby they love, but they can't do it because of their health. For example, an older person who loves music might have trouble hearing because of their age. They often need to take medicine, which can make them feel tired. Young people, on the other hand, have lots of energy and are usually very healthy. They don't get tired easily and live life at a fast pace.\n\nYoung people can do things like adventure sports, travel, party, eat, and drink without any problems. Older people might find these things difficult. Second, young people are more independent than older people. They don't need someone to take care of them, and they can drive themselves wherever they want. Older people often worry too much about small things and don't like to try new things. They think some things are wrong, but young people think they're fun. Older people also value money more and like to save it for later. Young people might spend money on fun things that make them happy.\n\nIn conclusion, I think young people enjoy life more, and I'm sure many older people would agree that they had more fun when they were young."}

I took risks, like moving to a new town for better education, but I also kept doing what I'm good at - math and science.\n\nI think people can do both - take risks and do what they're good at. For example, a man who's great at selling TVs worked for a company for a long time. Then, he realized he could start his own business and took a big risk by quitting his job. He started a company named after his son and became successful because he knew what he was doing.\n\nThis story shows that taking risks and using your strengths can go hand in hand. I believe I should do both, as long as it feels right. My life is about trying new things and taking risks every day.\n\nI don't agree that successful people only try new things and take risks. People are in charge of their own actions, and success depends on that. You can be successful by doing what you're good at or by trying new things.\n\nI know my future is in science, but I also know I need to take risks to achieve my goal of becoming a Meteorologist.

I believe young people enjoy life by doing things like going to parks or beaches and playing extreme sports. They can stay out late at night, partying or dancing, and then wake up early for work. They're not afraid to take risks. Many young people get financial help from their parents, which gives them more time to have fun. Parents want their kids to have a better life than they did. Technology and society also make it easier for young people to try new things and have fun. Young people don't worry too much about the future; they just want to live in the moment.\n\nOn the other hand, older people feel the effects of aging on their bodies. Even if they take care of themselves, they can't do things for as long as they used to. Sometimes that's okay because too much of anything is bad. Older people see life differently. They do the same things as young people, but not as intensely. They learn to appreciate the small things in life and develop the ability to notice details. Noticing details helps you see what's truly special. Focusing on quality over quantity is an important skill to learn. The good news is that everyone will experience both sides of life at some point. I'm a 37-year-old man from a Latin background. I love my faith, and at this point in my life, I identify with older people. I prefer quality over quantity."}

In cities, people can easily get around without a car because of the good train, subway, and bus systems. I think similar systems will develop in the suburbs too. However, I think the idea that there will be fewer cars is too narrow-minded because it only thinks about developed countries.\n\nSecond, we need to think about the whole world. There are many countries that want to develop and become richer. In these countries, I think the number of cars will increase. The reason is that they need cars to transport goods and develop their economy. I think having good transportation is very important for these countries.\n\nIn conclusion, when we think about the development of the whole world, I don't agree with the idea that there will be fewer cars."}

I have three reasons to support this.\n\nFirst, understanding what we learn helps us learn more effectively. We don't just memorize facts, but also remember them better. If we only memorize, a computer could do a better job.\n\nSecond, my teachers always said that students should learn how to learn, not just gain knowledge. I believe that's the real purpose of education - to teach students how to think and solve problems. In my high school, teachers emphasized memorization over understanding. We had to copy facts into our minds to get good grades. We didn't have time to think deeply about the ideas. As a result, I only remember a few things from my high school textbooks now.\n\nThird, understanding what we learn is how we develop our culture. We gain knowledge from others and create new ideas. If students don't learn to understand and think deeply, what would our future society be like?\n\nIn short, I think it's not only important but also necessary for students to understand ideas and think more about what they learn."}

It didn't have as many features either. The ad was misleading.\n\nMost ads show products in a way that makes you fall in love with them. But when you buy the product and it's not as good as you thought, it can damage your trust in ads and the company that made it. You feel disappointed and let down. Advertisers are tricking people into buying their products at high prices, which makes them money but breaks trust. Ads should be more honest and only show what the product really has. If advertisers want to show something that's not in the product, they should tell the company to add it and then advertise it. That way, they're not cheating customers and are showing a true picture."}

If they don't, they might lose their jobs. This shows how ads make products seem better than they are.\n\nWhen a company spends money on an ad, they expect to make more money from it. Ads are expensive, so companies want more people to buy their product to make a bigger profit.\n\nTo do this, ad makers try to make their product seem like the best choice. They want people to think they're making the right decision by buying it. Ad makers have many skills, including knowledge of marketing and who to target.\n\nFor example, I overheard some students in the library talking about a marketing project. They didn't care about the product's quality; they only cared about how to sell it. They wanted to find the best way to convince people, even if it meant being dishonest.\n\nI've also seen this in my personal life. My eleven-year-old sister always asks my mom for products she sees in ads. Sometimes my mom buys them, but they're not always high-quality. I've noticed this happens often with products marketed to kids and teenagers, who care more about how a product looks than its quality.\n\nIn conclusion, I think ads are often used to make more money for companies or to create a brand name.

Bill Gates created Microsoft to make computers affordable and efficient. To pursue this, he had to drop out of Harvard University and focus on his business. This must have been a tough decision, given Harvard's competitiveness. Now Bill Gates is one of the richest men in the world.\n\nMy father is another example. Born into a poor family, he got into the toughest medical school in my hometown in South Korea through his own efforts. However, he changed his major to engineering, giving up an easy path to success. After studying engineering, he pioneered biomedical engineering and became the first doctor of biomedical engineering in Korea by introducing the subject to his college. If he hadn't done this, he would have been a medical professional, but not the first biomedical engineer in the nation.\n\nI've taken a big risk to be successful - coming to America. I could have continued my education in top institutions in my native country, as a selected student in science. Yet, I wanted to try new things, even if it meant risking what seemed important at the time.

My brother, on the other hand, can do what he wants.\n\nAnother reason is that people are different. They have different personalities, habits, and lifestyles. Some older people like to stay at home, while others go out more. The same is true for young people. Some have a lot of responsibilities, while others don't. This means young people have more freedom to choose what they want.\n\nIt's hard to say who enjoys life more because people are different. Some are emotional, while others are strict.

However, I don't agree that there will be fewer cars on the road in the next twenty years.\n\nFirstly, the growing population will make the world more crowded, and each person will want their own car. Compared to the past, we have many more cars today. For example, in Seoul, Korea, three out of ten people had their own car ten years ago. Today, the number of cars is five times more than in the 1990s.\n\nAdditionally, twenty years is not enough time to develop and use new technology. The government has been trying to build a new subway system for ten years, but it's still in the planning stage. For instance, a government expert said they would introduce a new aircraft system in five years, but the next day, an article criticized the government for not finishing a military system change that had been planned for ages. The article also said that people no longer trust the government.\n\nIn conclusion, we all hope for fewer cars on the road in the future.

When they study hard to get the skills they need to find a job, they are contributing to the country's wealth.\n\nSome people argue that modern societies don't do enough to help people who need individual attention, not just financially but also in terms of time. For instance, there are not enough volunteers to care for elderly people who need personal help. Instead of blaming young people for being selfish, we should look at who is helping to change the situation. Modern societies have become too reliant on the government to solve social problems. So, it's fair to give credit to people who take action by voting, protesting, or participating in politics to make social issues a priority.\n\nIn conclusion, there are many ways to help a community, and we can find young people who make a positive impact, whether by working hard at school or by voting, depending on the culture or country."}

With more free time, they can travel, take holidays with their families, and do other activities. Think about what young people are doing when older people are enjoying their lives. University students may be busy writing assignments and studying for exams. Those with jobs may be working extra hours in the office. How unhappy they are!\n\nSecond, older people have more money than young people, which makes their lives more comfortable. Since they've worked longer, they earn more and have more savings. This allows them to afford long trips to places like Paris or Rome. Young people, on the other hand, can only take short trips and go hiking. While short trips and hiking can be fun, they can't compare to romantic trips abroad.\n\nThird, older people can manage their lives better than young people because of their more extensive life and social experiences. Older people know what's most important to them. They know that enjoying life is more important than making money or working. They value spending time with their family members, so they try to be with their wives or husbands as much as possible. In contrast, most young people don't know what's important to them. They focus on making money and getting promoted at work, neglecting the happiness of being with their family members.\n\nIn conclusion, I think older people enjoy life more because they have more time, more money, and can manage their lives better."}

I believe there are three main reasons why the number of cars will increase: new resources, growing populations, and new technologies.\n\nThese factors will keep increasing the demand for cars.\n\nFirst, we are developing new energy sources to replace fossil fuels, such as solar energy and hydrogen energy. These energies are good for the environment and can be obtained almost endlessly. By refining these technologies, we can use cars without harming the planet in twenty years. This is a strong point in favor of cars.\n\nSecond, cars are becoming more convenient. For example, navigation systems using satellite communication help us reach our destinations easily. Moreover, cars are becoming safer, with stronger bodies that save many lives. These new technologies provide more comfort to car users, which means the demand for cars will remain strong.\n\nThird, the world's population is growing rapidly and will continue to do so for at least twenty years. This means there will be a continuous demand for cars. Although we are creating new types of trains, I think people will prefer cars that provide safe energy and convenience. In fact, I saw a newly built subway in New Delhi, India, that was not widely used by citizens.\n\nAs stated above, there are three reasons why the demand for cars will remain strong: new resources, new technologies that make driving more comfortable, and the growing number of people who need cars.

The number of cars on the road might increase depending on the rules set by the government. I think this because new technology is making older models cheaper and adding new features that were not possible a few years ago.\n\nMore and more people, including those who are not very rich, are buying cars. This is because car manufacturers are offering easy payment plans and banks are giving out loans to buy cars. Some companies are also offering deals to trade in old cars for new ones, which is helping to sell more cars.\n\nThere are many benefits to owning a car. You can go wherever you want with your family, and it's helpful in emergencies. Cars are also a status symbol. Many people want new cars with special features that their old cars don't have. Some cars are even considered special because they are rare or vintage.\n\nYou can drive to different places on your own schedule and at your own speed. Nowadays, there are many types of cars available with special features like conference rooms or bedrooms. These features are helpful for busy people who don't have a lot of time.\n\nWith all these benefits, it's hard to believe that there will be fewer cars in the near future. However, there are also some drawbacks to owning a car. They pollute the air and use up natural resources. But, with new technology, some cars are being made that don't pollute the air, and some even run on solar or electric power.\n\nSo, I think the benefits of cars will outweigh the drawbacks, and there won't be a big decrease in the number of cars in the near future.

The world is changing fast. For example, the Internet has made the world smaller, and email has made communication faster. To succeed, we need to adapt. We need to try new things and take risks instead of doing the same old things. For example, people in the IT industry are successful because they adapt quickly. They try new things that no one has done before.\n\nSecond, successful people try new things to improve their methods. Doing the same things over and over doesn't lead to improvement or progress. To be successful, we need to be better than others. Even if we're better than others at one time, we can become average or worse over time. For example, Ichiro Suzuki, a famous baseball player, always looks for new ways to improve his batting. He's one of the most successful people.\n\nThird, successful people have a challenging spirit.

However, I believe that most ads make products seem better than they really are.\n\nFirst, let's define what an ad is - a way to sell a company's products. To do this, the ad needs to make the product appealing to people, which affects their decision to buy it or not. For example, if you want to sell cookies, you want many people to buy them. So, you need to catch their attention. You might use technology to improve your cookie's features, like making the color brighter or suggesting the best way to eat it. This means you can't just use the original features of your cookie in the ad. You need to make it seem better than it really is.\n\nAnother thing is that ads can trick kids into wanting products, like transformer ads. These ads show transformers flying, which is impossible because transformers don't exist. So, when you buy a transformer for your kids, they might be disappointed because it's not like what they saw in the ad. This is another reason why ads make products seem better than they really are.\n\nAdditionally, competition is another reason why ads make products seem better than they really are. In a competitive society, businessmen compare themselves to others. Ads are a way to improve their business, and sometimes they focus on the ad's effect rather than the product's quality. When you watch an ad, you might want to buy the product, which shows that the ad affects you, not the real product. You might not have even used or tasted the product before.\n\nFrom what we've discussed, we can conclude that most ads make products seem better than they really are."}
{"file_id": "1070118.txt", "output_essay": "Why don't young people spend enough time helping their communities today? I think there are several reasons for this.\n\nFirst, young people have more money and options to enjoy their free time, so they might prefer to have fun with friends instead of helping the community.\n\nAnother reason is that people's living situations are changing. Many young people move to a new city to study or work, and they change jobs and homes more often. This means they don't stay in one place for long, and they don't feel connected to the community. When you don't know people well, you're less motivated to help.\n\nThe main reason young people don't help their communities as much is that they've become more focused on themselves. Families and communities are not as important to people as they used to be. People are more independent and don't need community support as much.\n\nConsidering all these factors, I agree that more and more young people don't spend enough time helping their communities."}

In our jobs, for example, if we need to work with another team, knowing something about their work makes it easier. Even if we don't know everything, it's appreciated.\n\nAnother example is in our personal lives. It's nice to be able to discuss things with someone new. Without some knowledge, how can we connect with others? We would miss the chance to meet new people. I think having some knowledge is a big plus in life. It's like a promise to be welcome wherever we go.\n\nOn the other hand, I think we can't just stop at knowing a little about many things. We need to find something exciting to work towards. This means we need to be good at one thing. In our jobs, it's essential to be good at something specific. Nobody can get a job if they don't know enough about it. That's why we start with general education and then focus on what we want to do.\n\nI also think it's valuable to be good at something. It proves to ourselves that we can do something special, something that defines us.\n\nIn conclusion, I think we need both approaches. We need to learn about the world to interact with others, but we also need to be good at something to be helpful."}

Young people were enthusiastic about taking responsibility. For instance, in the Middle East, 30% of high school students failed between 1989 and 2000. However, between 2001 and 2006, the failure rate increased to 70%. This shows that young people today are not taking their responsibilities seriously, which affects future generations. This lack of education also affects the city's finances.\n\nMoney is another major problem in society.

For example, if someone wants to work in a library, will they be better at their job if they only know about books and publishing? I don't think so. I think they will be better if they also know about history, anthropology, and science. You can learn technical skills on the job, but you can't replace the broad knowledge you get from school and university.\n\nAnother reason I think broad knowledge is important is that it makes people more flexible. They can easily switch from one job to another. They can adapt to changes. For example, you can be a banker one day and a manager the next.\n\nIn my opinion, a good citizen needs to have broad knowledge to make informed decisions.

In school, I studied many subjects, including Latin and ancient Greek. In university, I took 25 exams on different aspects of economics.\n\nI believe it's essential to have a broad knowledge of many subjects because today's work requires flexibility. Many things have changed since the early 20th century when Henry Ford introduced the idea of 'work specialization.'\n\nHowever, in some cases, it's different. For example, an engineer needs to know a lot about a specific subject and specialize in a particular area of construction. The same applies to doctors.\n\nOn the other hand, my education is general because I want to become a manager. A manager needs to be able to solve many different problems in different ways. You can use your skills to find new solutions to problems.\n\nFor instance, if you have a problem selling a product because the market doesn't like it, you have two options: remove the product from the market or find a creative marketing solution to make the product appealing to the market.\n\nIn conclusion, I think you should choose your education based on your interests and future job."}

This shows that young people want to be respected for helping their community.\n\nSecond, young people care more about the environment, which helps them contribute to their communities. They have more chances to learn about environmental issues. As a result, they care more about the environment around them.

Many people think young people have more fun because they are healthier, faster, and stronger. My mom used to say that teenagers think they are superheroes. They take risks, stay up late, go to parties, drive fast cars, and might even do illegal drugs. But this doesn't mean young people have more fun. I read a great book called 'Tuesdays with Morrie.' It's about life and shows how a young man learns from an older person. The older person has had many experiences and teaches the young man that he needs to learn from his experiences, let go of some emotions, and then he can feel success, love, and pride. Morrie, the teacher, says that once you know how to die, you know how to live because you learn to enjoy life more. My point is that older people know how to get more from each new experience, and they probably enjoy life more. There are some young people who are very mature and find ways to have fun even in bad situations, like those who don't have a lot of money. They learn to make the most of their few chances to go out or party. I think older people have more fun because they know how to enjoy life, and young people are just trying to do too many things to have fun and not getting much out of their daily experiences."}

It's true that we need people who know a little about many things, but their knowledge is based on what experts have discovered. Experts are the ones who make new discoveries and create new knowledge. They can do good research on a specific topic. That's why I think experts are more important.

For example, they visit elderly people at home, organize town activities, and plan parties.

You're also better prepared to handle changes in the job market. For example, if there's a problem in a certain industry, you can easily switch to another field. On the other hand, workers, including managers, need to be experts in their field. In my opinion, the market needs people who are both specialized and can share their knowledge with others. This helps companies make money through teamwork and cooperation. As a student, you should try to learn as much as possible about different fields. After you finish your studies, you can focus on developing a specific skill. This way, you'll have a broad knowledge base and a specialized skill, making you a valuable worker. For instance, workers with limited education may struggle if their company changes its strategy or if there's a major change in the market. To be attractive to employers, you need to specialize, but you also need to keep learning and expanding your knowledge to minimize risks and adapt to changes. This is what's called 'life-long learning,' and I believe it's the best approach in today's society."}

Successful people try new things and take risks instead of doing what they already know. This is why some investors are very successful today. People want to try new products and styles they've never seen before, rather than repeating the same idea.\n\nInvestors try to make a high profit in business. To make customers feel different, a company needs to change. For example, if a company sells home appliances like freezers and microwaves, and then starts making cell phones and computers. Customers will quickly have a different impression of the company, since they think it only sells home appliances. Buyers won't need to go to different places to buy freezers and computers if they want to buy them at the same time.\n\nBusinesspeople should also be willing to take risks. Risk doesn't always mean something bad. People who take risks are likely to achieve success. Creative work can surprise customers. We never know what customers want. If buyers are surprised by a company, they'll definitely have a good impression of it. For example, in clothing, designers sometimes need to take a risk if they have a very different design idea. They're not sure if the audience and buyers will like it. Even if they don't like it, at least they tried.\n\nTwo common methods can help achieve success: trying new things and taking risks.

This can happen in church, sports clubs, or social groups. Church activities, for example, teach young people the importance of helping others, like those with disabilities. However, with more time spent watching TV and using media, community activities are seen as \"uncool\". It's more important to be popular and stand out as an individual. Another reason is that people don't trust their government. They feel pressure to succeed in life, so they focus on their own goals. When people see that government officials are more interested in helping themselves, they become more selfish. With the internet, people are aware of government officials' selfishness and the risks in life. I think this pressure and lack of honesty have led to young people not helping their communities enough. But since society is aware of this issue, there's a chance to teach a new way of thinking.

It said that California is taking car manufacturers to court to reduce CO2 gas emissions. The article also said that there are about 36 million cars in California for about 35 million households. California is a great example of a place where cars are essential for getting around. It's also the richest state in America, so it shows what could happen if a country develops to that level and needs more cars. Many people think that in twenty years, China will be much richer than it is today. If we look at how fast its economy is growing, we can say that by 2026, China will be as rich as California. This makes me think that the statement is not true. China has a huge population of about 1 billion people, which would mean about 400 million households and potentially 350 million cars needed. I'm not saying China doesn't have cars now, but the number of cars will increase greatly. We should also consider other growing economies like India. Europe has a lot of cars, and efforts are being made to reduce pollution by increasing alternative transportation. But this is possible because Europe's territories are relatively small compared to huge countries like India or China. As the population grows, there will always be more people on earth, and therefore more potential car drivers and buyers. The car has become a symbol of freedom since the Ford T model was introduced in the 1920s. There's no sign that people will invent a new symbol of freedom to replace the car. If they do, people might start using alternative transportation more, and car usage might decrease. However, this is unlikely to happen in the next twenty years. A change in people's psychology takes time. Finally, the argument that petrol will run out in a couple of decades is not valid. New petrol reserves are being found, and new energy sources like biometric fuel and electric cars are being developed.

For example, take an electric motor. If you don't understand how it works, you can't make motors of different sizes or for different uses. If you just memorize facts about motors, you wouldn't have all the things that make life easier, like power windows in cars or robots that can move around. These things are possible because people understand how motors work.\n\nNext, understanding a concept helps you think of new ways to use it or combine it with other ideas to create something new. For example, there's a device that can scan printed pages and turn them into typed text on a computer. This device uses many different concepts together. It uses scanning technology to read the page, and then pattern matching technology to recognize the letters. You can't come up with new ideas like this just by memorizing facts.\n\nHowever, facts are still important because they help you visualize things and understand their scale. For example, take the Saturn rocket that took people to the Moon. If you don't know how big the rocket was, how much fuel it used, or how many inventions were needed to make it work, you can't really appreciate how amazing it was. But even though facts are important, they're not as useful as understanding the concepts that make things work.\n\nIn summary, it's clear that understanding ideas and concepts is much more important for students than just memorizing facts, even though facts do play a role."}

A person who truly understands a subject can solve new problems better than someone who just memorizes the basics. They can use their knowledge if they understand it deeply. In Japan, students often lack these skills. We rank low in international research, while countries like the US rank high. The reason is that our education system focuses too much on memorization. We have to take tough entrance exams to get into high school and university, so we often just memorize facts without thinking deeply about them. But if students understand the concepts, they can improve their skills.\n\nUnderstanding the nature of problems is also more enjoyable for students. They feel happy when they find a solution or understand a concept. So, they can keep studying with joy. We all want to do what we like, not what we dislike. This also helps improve their academic skills. If students just memorize everything, they will stop studying. Personally, I didn't like studying until I went to university. I couldn't find joy in studying because I had to memorize so many facts. But in university, we have to think for ourselves, and now studying is enjoyable.\n\nBecause of these benefits, I believe students should focus on understanding.

But then I'll explain why it's hard to do that.\n\nKnowing many subjects is great. That's why I learned about many topics in school. It's amazing to know about history, biology, and astronomy. If I knew all these things, I could talk to a biologist or a historian. But can you really know many subjects without being an expert in one?\n\nIn fact, my biology knowledge wouldn't be as good as a biologist's. This means someone who knows many subjects isn't an expert in anything. So, it's hard to find a job. I think it's better to be an expert in one subject to get a job or give accurate information.\n\nIn conclusion, I think it's better to be an expert in one subject. But it's also important to remember other subjects exist. So, it's necessary to read about other topics. For example, a biologist should know some history, even if they won't be as good at it as biology, because they might need historical information to explain what they're studying."}
{"file_id": "1069391.txt", "output_essay": "Many students wonder if they should specialize in a particular field or attend a general university to explore different subjects. I think both options are good, but it depends on what you want to do.\n\nFirst, I believe students should not specialize too early. In high school, it's essential to learn about various subjects before choosing a major. This helps students discover new fields they didn't know about and find ones that really interest them.\n\nThe choice to specialize or not also depends on the job you want to do. Some jobs require knowledge in many areas. For example, journalists need to be able to write about different topics. Some journalists specialize, but most can write about anything.\n\nPersonally, I think it's interesting not to choose a specialization. Someone who doesn't pick a major field of interest will be curious about more things than someone only interested in history or philosophy.\n\nHowever, there's a danger in knowing a little about many things. Society also needs experts who know a lot about specific areas. For instance, teaching biology requires being an expert in biology. The same is true for all teachers. In some countries, teachers teach two subjects, but I think that's not a good idea because they can't know two fields well.\n\nIn conclusion, society needs both specialists and people with general knowledge. Personally, I liked learning about many subjects before specializing. This helped me discover biology, physics, and other fields, which I wouldn't have discovered without my high school classes."}

Being happy is a personal thing that depends on age, culture, beliefs, and many other factors. From my experience, I've learned to enjoy life every day.\n\nWhen I was a kid, I had trouble making friends and having fun. Family problems made me very shy. I often felt stuck in uncomfortable situations and couldn't ask for help. This made my childhood sad.\n\nToday, some young people struggle to say what makes them happy because of pressure from their friends. Many teenagers do things they don't want to do because they're afraid to be different. As we grow up, we become braver and learn to say no. We become more confident and comfortable with who we are.\n\nAs we get older, we learn to overcome problems and become wiser. We learn from our own experiences and those of others. The more we know about ourselves, the easier it is to find happiness. It takes time to figure out what makes us happy. This understanding comes with age and experience.\n\nI believe the opposite of the original statement. A shy person who can't ask for help, a teenager who feels pressured, and someone with little experience will have a harder time finding happiness. As I get older, I get wiser. When I make a mistake, I learn from it. I once heard that growing older is necessary, but growing up is a choice. I agree with that."}

How well they can do this depends on their experience. The only way to gain experience is to try new things and take risks to find new solutions. Just observing things is not as effective as trying them out and learning from them.\n\nIn daily life, we meet new people and face new situations that are all different. In tough situations, our past knowledge can be helpful to some extent. If we think of a problem as having many unknowns, changing one unknown can affect the outcome. Our immune system works in a similar way - it responds more strongly to pathogens the second time around.\n\nPeople also seek new experiences to refresh their lives. A life of just eating and sleeping is not worth living. It's not about how long you live, but how you live. People who are afraid to take risks to improve their lives are actually afraid to change who they are. So, they stick to what they know. But humans should be different from plants, and that's what makes us unique.\n\nIn conclusion, experience is crucial in finding solutions to problems and gaining new perspectives."}

He used to sell vegetables, but he got interested in communication and started learning about it. It was a completely new field, but he was determined and confident. He worked hard and became a master in that field.\n\nNext, there's Sachin Tendulkar, a cricket legend. He wanted to be an engineer, but he loved cricket. So, he took a big risk and chose cricket over engineering. He worked hard and became a famous cricketer. The risk paid off.\n\nI believe that a person who tries new things and thinks differently can be successful.

However, there are many who stand up for what they believe in through protests, discussions, and more.\n\nSome people spend their free time working with organizations that help others. You can see people volunteering on weekends, cleaning parks, helping in hospitals, and assisting with local projects to help foreigners settle in.\n\nThese organizations have changed the way we work on human rights issues by introducing volunteers. A volunteer is someone who wants to make a difference in their community. They care about issues like the environment, human rights, and animal welfare.\n\nMany people are worried about the state of the world, and young people are among them.

Many people keep trying until they succeed.\n\nLook at the technology we have today and the new ideas being developed. In the past, it was hard to create power. But scientist Edison, who made a special turbine to get power from water, didn't give up. He did many experiments, took big risks, and won an international award.\n\nI don't agree with people who just do what they already know. God gave us the ability to learn, and we should try to learn more and improve our skills to create new things. When people do the same old things, they won't get anything new in life, and they'll stay in the same place. We should try new things, even if they're hard and have risks. If we keep trying, we'll get results.\n\nFor example, take Newton, who became very successful in science. He was sitting under a tree when an apple fell on him, and he wondered, 'How did it fall?'

Things like gadgets, friends, movies, and parties are taking them away from their families and communities.\n\nIf they're not having fun, it's often because they're under a lot of pressure to study. Their schoolwork and curriculum make sure they're studying all the time.\n\nMost schools focus on teaching theory, not practical skills. This means students don't get much chance to experience the outside world.\n\nApart from school, many young people aren't interested in helping their communities. They're becoming more self-centered. For them, it's all about 'me first.' Everything else comes second.\n\nAnother reason they don't get involved is that they don't understand the importance of close family ties. They don't know much about sharing and caring. In the past, big families kept people together. They were more patient, caring, and understood the importance of community. But now, with smaller families, that sense of unity is lost.\n\nLast month, the Mumbai bombing shocked the whole nation and made us question our unity and safety. The terrorists involved were young men. And when we look at who helped the victims, we see it was mostly older people.\n\nIt's not that all young people are unhelpful, but many are too self-centered to help their communities. Their modern values, distance from religion, and shyness also play a role.\n\nSometimes, they think that one person can't make a difference, so they don't try to help.

This is because broad knowledge is more useful for our studies than one specific subject. It helps us understand the whole study and gives us more options to choose from when selecting a major.\n\nToday, many jobs require a range of skills and knowledge. Having a broad knowledge of subjects like math, physics, and chemistry provides a wider range of skills than specializing in one subject. For example, as a lawyer, we need to know not only the law but also economics and humanity. Broad knowledge helps us in our work by giving us more information to solve problems.\n\nMoreover, studying many subjects helps us choose the right major. I'm currently facing this problem - which major should I choose? Although I've studied some subjects, I'm still unsure which one suits me best. This is important because I'll use my major knowledge after graduation and earn a living in that field. If I choose the wrong major due to lack of interest or inability to study, I won't be able to succeed in the future. Broad knowledge makes it easier for me to choose the one I like best and study it well.\n\nIn conclusion, while one specific subject can be a skill for some people, like painting, I believe that broad knowledge is better than specializing in one subject."}

It makes us more appealing to customers, clients, and future employers.\n\nAfter I finish my undergraduate degree, I plan to get a master's degree in law and specialize in one area of law. Today, professionals are becoming more specialized because there are so many changes and topics to study.\n\nFor example, when someone is getting a divorce, they won't go to a surgeon or a corporate lawyer. They'll go to a lawyer who specializes in divorce law because that lawyer is more likely to help them.\n\nIt's also not efficient to try to learn many subjects. Some people have multiple degrees and spend their whole life studying. They might know a bit about economics, finance, or banking, but it's impossible to know them all well.\n\nAdditionally, studying many subjects can be expensive. In the end, you might not be able to compete with someone who spent less time in school but is an expert in one area.\n\nIt's also impossible to learn many subjects and know them all well. It shows a lack of focus and decision-making. Some students change their major many times and can never decide what to study.

We should also be thankful for what we have in life, such as youth, health, or skills, and feel enriched when we share these gifts with others.\n\nI agree that young people don't seem focused on their community's needs, and I think they're detached from the idea of community altogether. This is a complex issue with many reasons.\n\nFirst, our society values time, especially free time. Modern life is demanding, and there are many entertainment options, so we see our time as a luxury and get frustrated when we can't use it freely.\n\nSecond, Western societies have become more focused on pleasure and self-enjoyment. We think it's our right to have fun, make our own choices, and get instant gratification. This is especially true for young people, who feel they have the right to play and have fun, and resent being asked for help or support.\n\nIn a culture that values self-absorption and pleasure, taking time to connect with people from different backgrounds seems unnecessary, and this leads to another worrying trend. There's a growing gap between young people and older generations or those in need. These are the people who need more time and support within the community, and it's the younger generation's duty to look after them.\n\nIn conclusion, the values that have become central in our societies are now central in young people's vision of life.

But if you're an expert in one area, you know the basics and important parts, and you're the go-to person for that topic.\n\nFor example, my major is Robotics and Control, so I'm very good at it. When there's a problem with control systems at the factory, I can quickly understand the problem and find a solution. If I didn't specialize, I'd have to research, get rid of my confusion, and then try to solve the problem. This would take longer and might not be as effective.\n\nMost companies today care about getting things done quickly, and they can't wait for you to learn what you need to know.\n\nSecond, when you know a little about many subjects, it's hard to show that you're qualified. People will ask what you're an expert in, and if you say you know a little about everything, they might not think you're good enough. Today, teamwork is key, and nobody wants someone who thinks they can do everything alone. You can't compete with a team of experts.\n\nIn short, I think it's important to specialize in one area.

Even if the company hires the second person because they know a bit about both chemistry and biology, they would still get a lower job and less pay than the first person.

If older people enjoyed life less, the world would be a sad place. Some young people don't enjoy their lives, and some older people do. This shows that the idea is not true. If life is not enjoyable, then what's the point of living?\n\nI think this idea comes from a young person's perspective and is not well thought out. At first, it seems true, but as we get older, our idea of what's enjoyable changes. For instance, reading poetry might not be enjoyable at 13, but at 65, it can be fully appreciated.

For example, some countries have a short history, but they are now among the world's biggest economies.\n\nIn the past, there was no electronics science.

In the solar system, the Earth moves around the sun, but it seems like the sun is moving. When we travel, it seems like the surroundings are moving, and we are standing still. We also think the Earth is flat, but it's actually a sphere. These examples show that we understand ideas and concepts better than facts.\n\nHere's a technical example.

They won't be remembered because they only do what they're told.\n\nThe second group includes people who make the world a better place. Examples are Albert Einstein, Thomas Edison, Mahatma Gandhi, and Yuri Gagarin. What makes them special is that they were curious and excited to explore new areas. Einstein and Edison made big discoveries in science, giving us gravity and electricity. Gandhi changed the political world with his non-violent approach. Because Gagarin went to space, we can think beyond Earth. These people shared some common traits. They were willing to work hard and take risks to prove their point."}

They will learn facts, but not because someone tells them to. Instead, they will learn because they are interested in the subject. This interest grows because they understand the idea or concept.\n\nFor example, take global warming. If a student understands how temperature affects the climate, they can explore deeper and see how everything connects. This can be a fascinating experience. It's also important to have a teacher who can make the subject exciting. If the teacher explains the idea or concept well, they don't need to bother students with boring facts.\n\nIt's also important to give students time and support to discover things on their own. This builds their confidence. It's like a positive cycle. When a student becomes more confident, their interest grows, their research becomes more intense, and their results become more accurate. They will learn the facts because they want to know more.\n\nThey don't need a boring lesson to learn the facts. Once they understand an idea, they can learn easily."}

As humans, we want to learn more. In university, one subject is not enough.\n\nI'm a student at La Sorbonne Nouvelle University, which is top for foreign languages. I'm majoring in English and German, but there are many other languages to learn, like Spanish, Italian, Arabic, Chinese, or Hindi. After graduating, students often apply for jobs in commercial trade or International Business. Knowing many subjects is very useful in this context. If two graduates apply for the same job, I think the one who knows different languages will get it.\n\nMy university is also famous for cinema, dramatic art, and communication. It's possible to major in both Foreign languages and Cinema or take theater classes.\n\nHowever, I think students need to focus on what they really want to do and be. Then, they should try to get as many chances as possible to succeed. Knowing many subjects can confuse students. They try to learn many subjects because they're interested in many fields. If you ask them what they prefer most, they don't know.\n\nThis is why many students fail their first year of college. Most university failures in France are caused by a mistake in choosing majors, which is caused by bad information after the twelfth grade.\n\nIn conclusion, it's interesting to have knowledge in many fields, but students need to focus on success."}
{"file_id": "1076604.txt", "output_essay": "Can we say that successful people are those who take risks and try new things instead of doing business as usual? I think so. There are two ways to try new things: creating a completely new product or making small changes to how a business runs. Even small changes can be a big risk.\n\nFirst, let's look at big changes. Many company leaders have succeeded in creating very profitable products that changed their company's story. For example, Steve Jobs at Apple launched the iPod, which was a new product that changed how people listened to music. It was a big risk, but it paid off and created a new demand for Apple's product.\n\nStarbucks also took a big risk by changing how people drink coffee. Instead of drinking it in a caf\u00e9, people now drink it on the go. It was a big change, but it worked out well for the company.\n\nSecondly, small changes to a business model can also be very successful. For example, Dell created a new way to make computers by letting customers order customized parts. It was a small change, but it was very successful."}

If people only do what they're good at, they'll only be good, but they won't be successful unless they take risks and face new challenges.\n\nTrying new things and overcoming challenges is what makes a person successful in my opinion. For example, a talented athlete is not successful just because they're good. They need to test their skills against others, improve, and risk losing to become successful. If they don't take risks, they'll never know how good they really are.\n\nOpening a new business is another example. A businessman won't succeed unless he takes a risk and invests his money. It's not just about improving oneself, but also about seeing how one compares to others.\n\nTaking risks and facing challenges is the only way to succeed in life. Talent is important, but it's not the only factor. Famous athletes, businessmen, and superstars all faced challenges and overcame them, which is what makes them successful."}

First, ads should tell us what a product can do. This means the product's quality, like if it's reliable and has a guarantee. Advertisers should stop using fancy labels and packaging because they cost extra. This makes it hard for ordinary people to buy these products, even if they're necessary for daily life. Second, advertisers use famous people to promote products and offer them a percentage of the sales. Third, they use colorful designs and animations to make products look more exciting than they are. This works on kids and makes their parents buy things for them. The fancy stickers also make products more appealing. All of this increases the product's cost. In conclusion, I agree that most ads make products seem better than they really are."}

Most of these organizations are made up of young people. I believe that young, motivated people can serve and help their communities.\n\nYoung people are usually very motivated. However, they might not find the time or the right way to help their communities. For example, I'm a lawyer, and I often work 10 to 12 hours a day. On weekends, I have to study and review papers. So, I don't have much time for social work. But that doesn't mean I don't want to or that I don't think helping my community is important. It's just that our fast-paced world forces us to prioritize. But I try my best to participate in community work when I can.\n\nIn college, I did a lot of charity and social work. I was part of a social club, and we completed many beneficial projects that I'm proud of. We weren't the only club - there were over 50 clubs at my university. We believed that the important thing is to help people who need it and make their world better. For example, in the summer of 2002, I participated in a project where we painted a primary school in a poor district. The students helped us, and it felt great to see their happy faces.\n\nI believe that young people are a vital part of society. All they need is the right direction.

For example, if you're talking about Organic Chemistry and you know about it, you can ask questions or have a big discussion with experts. This makes a good impression and helps you make friends.\n\nBroad knowledge also helps you get a good, well-paying job. Today, companies look for smart people who understand many things. If you have a good understanding of what companies need, you can get a good job. For instance, knowing how to use a computer and its programs can get you a good job with security.\n\nIn today's fast-changing society, it's good to know about different topics.

In my opinion, older people enjoy life more.\n\nFirst, young people have less free time than older people. They have to work hard to secure their future, so they don't have much time to do what they like. Older people, on the other hand, have fewer work responsibilities and shorter work hours. Many are even retired, so they can spend more time with family and friends.\n\nSecond, older people have more friends than young people. As they've lived longer, they've met more people and can have fun with many friends. It's happy to be around many friends, and it creates a pleasant atmosphere.\n\nThird, older people have fewer worries than young people. Many older people are retired, so they don't worry about keeping their job or making more money. They've already done that when they were young. Now, they can focus on enjoying life. They can travel, visit friends, and have fun without worrying about work. Young people, however, still face heavy work and pressure from society, so they can't enjoy themselves as much.\n\nFor example, my father works over 40 hours a week to pay for my studies abroad, and he doesn't have much time to have fun. My grandmother, on the other hand, has a lot of free time and fewer worries, so she can play and have fun with her friends.\n\nIn conclusion, I think older people enjoy life more than young people because they have more free time, more friends, and fewer worries."}
{"file_id": "1077768.txt", "output_essay": "It seems that young people have more time to have fun. But it's hard to say if they enjoy life more than older people. Everyone enjoys their life, just in their own way. So, both young and older people enjoy their life, but differently.\n\nOlder people work hard to provide for their family. They often can't take a break all day. Even in Asian countries, they rarely get a year-round vacation. They are very loyal to their family. Although they might complain, they won't give up. Sometimes they enjoy supporting their family and raising their kids in better conditions. This is the life they truly enjoy every day.\n\nYoung people have a lot of free time. They don't have to work, except for simple homework. So, they have more time for themselves. From my experience, having more time doesn't mean more happiness. In fact, young people often waste their time more than older people do. But it's clear that if young people use their time wisely, they have a better chance to really enjoy their life.\n\nIn conclusion, the key point is not how much time you have, but how you manage your life. Although older people have less time to enjoy themselves than younger people, they can manage their life better, so they can enjoy the result."}

So, before I share my opinion, I want to make the statement more specific by focusing on a particular place or culture when talking about young people and their communities.\n\nI'll use my home country as an example.\n\nCommunities always change as society changes, and these changes bring challenges for people of all ages.\n\nIn the 21st century, there have been big changes in the job market and technology. Many jobs have been sent to Asian countries, and factories have moved to the Far East. This has caused many young people in Europe, including my home country, to lose their jobs.\n\nIn the past, communities were wealthy, and people had secure jobs that allowed them to take care of their families and participate in social activities. Now, young people struggle to earn enough to live comfortably.\n\nI agree that they spend less time helping their communities. This is because they have to spend a lot of time looking for jobs or working multiple jobs just to get by. They won't have time or energy to help their communities.\n\nAs a result, young people who face economic problems will have to stop doing things like volunteering or taking care of family members or neighbors. Only those who are lucky enough to have a stable income will be able to do these things."}

I believe that young people today do spend enough time helping their communities.\n\nThere are many ways to help communities, such as volunteering, taking care of people, and participating in community activities. Many young people today help their communities by volunteering. For example, a recent news report in Taiwan showed that more and more students are volunteering at places like libraries and hospitals during their summer breaks. This is a big change from the past. Ten or twenty years ago, students in Taiwan were only focused on their studies and were not allowed to do volunteer work. But now, young people are more willing to give up their time to help others.\n\nIn addition, young people today care more about people and animals in their communities. For example, there was a news report about a man who was cruel to his cats in Taiwan. The young people were angry and worked together to find the man's address and report him to the police. The man was punished because of the help from these young people who care about animals.\n\nMany young people also participate in community activities. For example, I have a friend who joined a dance club in his community. He met many people with similar interests and helped them when they needed it.\n\nIn conclusion, young people today do spend time helping their communities.

There are many reasons why I think this is true.\n\nFirst, let's look at science and technology. For example, a biology student who doesn't know anything about electricity might not be able to fix a simple problem like a blown fuse. A technology student should also know what to do when they get sick.\n\nNext, if a student only studies the history of their own country, they might not know much about world history. This can cause problems when they're asked about important events.\n\nDesigning a computer is another example. Many people work together to design a computer, and each person needs to understand how their part fits with the others. If they don't, the computer won't work.\n\nFinally, someone who knows only science or technology might struggle in the business world if they don't know about the stock market. This is also true in politics. If party members only know about their own party, they might lose their position if they don't know about other parties.\n\nIn short, I think it's better to have a broad knowledge of many subjects.

In a world where many brands are good, ads need to stand out. This means making the product sound even better than it is.\n\nThe ad world is all about competition. This has led to a situation where making a product sound better than it is has become normal. I saw an ad recently that said a house was a 'mansion with lots of greenery.' But the actual house was just a small two-bedroom apartment. Sometimes ads go too far.\n\nThe car industry is one of the worst offenders. A car dealer in New Delhi was fined and shut down for a year because they lied to a customer about a car.\n\nSome people think it's okay to make ads that are not true. A recent survey in the US showed that many people don't see a problem with this. It shows that we have gotten used to it, and it's now a part of advertising. You can see it in the local newspaper.

Sometimes, we took risks to be successful. I think successful people are different from others; they're not afraid of risks, so they try new things. That's why we always get to enjoy new high-tech products.\n\nSecond, if people do the same thing over and over, they won't know what they're good at, and they won't improve. They should try new things when they're young to see if they can do what others can do, even better. For example, you're a vice president in a company because you did a good job. If the president gets fired, you might want to take the top job. You won't know if you don't try.\n\nThird, if you're already good at something, why not challenge yourself to do even better? If you know your mistakes, you can avoid them next time and do better. Then, you'll be successful in your job. For example, if you've worked in a store for a long time, you've learned a lot, and you know how to run a company. Now, you want to open your own store. You just need to take risks and make yourself successful.\n\nIn conclusion, many people try new things and become successful. That's why our living standard is getting higher.

For example, my brother enjoys his life. He rides his bike to college, meets friends every evening, and talks to them about movies. Then, he visits his friends' homes to have a good time. Finally, he goes home, eats well, and sleeps. \n\nOlder people have their own way of having fun. For example, my grandmother is very relaxed. She gathers people and chats with them all day, which is entertaining for her. She watches old devotional movies and enjoys feeling close to God. Sometimes, she visits holy places like Tirupathi and Shirdi. She eats what she likes and spends money as she wants. \n\nI think both young and old people enjoy life, but in different ways. \n\nIf we look at real-life examples, we can see that a typical teenager who goes to college or has a job lives a comfortable life. They think this is a special age that will not come again. Similarly, older people want to enjoy their life in their final years, so they do what makes them happy, and others support them. \n\nSo, I partly agree with the statement."}

For example, you can buy a product, change it, and sell it. However, this can be risky, and you might not be able to sell the changed product.\n\nSuccessful people in my country often try new things to achieve their goals. They sometimes lose, but if they win, they make more money. For instance, there's a big Turkish company that started as a shoe company. They made and exported shoes and were good at it. One day, the owner tried something new. He sold everything and bought land to grow onions. He didn't know how to grow or sell onions, so it was a big risk. He found a farmer to help him, and they came up with a new way to package onions, like 1-pound or 3-pound bags. They sold them directly to markets, making it more profitable and convenient for consumers.

For example, helping at a sports event or babysitting your neighbor's kids is also a good thing. This way, you help your neighbors have some free time and enjoy their own interests. Today, many young people have many different hobbies. So, they are busy with other things and don't want to give up their free time. They are not as motivated as they used to be. You can see this in different organizations; they don't have enough students to help them. Another issue is money. It's not certain that they will get paid for their help, but money has become very important to young people. Why should they help others and give up their time without getting anything in return? These things don't matter as much. I'm pretty sure most young people have the time to help, but they're just not interested. If you help others, you can get a lot back. If parents helped in the community themselves, it would motivate some kids to do it too. Mostly, I agree with the statement, but there are still some people who do their best. They give their time and don't care about money. I know people who raised money to help kids buy toys. I babysat at various events so parents could enjoy their time and not worry about their kids."}

To do this, they need to make people believe they need the product or that it's the best one. This means they might show the product in a way that's not entirely true.\n\nSecond, ads are made to increase profits.

On the other hand, an older person is someone who has finished their career.\n\nFirst, let's talk about how young people enjoy their lives. I believe students try to do many things. It's said that this is the best age to travel. Young people don't need a lot of comfort to travel. They also don't have many things that can keep them in one place. So, they have all the reasons to travel, discover new countries, and learn about new customs. But are they really enjoying life? It's true that it's easy for them to travel, but are they mature enough to remember their experiences? They don't have the same approach as their parents would have when visiting new countries.\n\nIt's also important for them to try new things like being responsible and managing a budget. These things can limit their lives.\n\nNext, let's talk about what life is like for an older person. If they're healthy, I think this is the best time. Their kids have finished school, and they've managed to educate them. They can finally enjoy their life and get the benefits of their years of working. They can travel, cook, play sports, and join clubs. They have time to do what they want. On one hand, they have a lot of time, but on the other hand, they don't. They've planned many things to do, but it's hard to do them all. They often ask themselves, 'Can I still do this?'\n\nIn conclusion, I think older people may enjoy their lives more.

For example, at my institution, there is a big problem with standing water on campus, which attracts mosquitoes that can cause serious illnesses. But despite this, the students don't seem to care, even though they might be affected by it. If we don't take action, the situation could get worse. However, if young students are willing, we can make a difference.\n\nSimilarly, there are issues like educating poor workers and their children who work on campus. Young students can help by organizing free classes, which could greatly benefit the children and give them a better future. But so far, nothing has been done.\n\nYoung people often don't listen to advice from seniors or elderly people. They do what they think is right.

We live in a high-stress world, especially in developed countries, where people often don't have time to focus on their values and help their communities.\n\nIn the past, young people didn't do the things they do today. We used to have stronger relationships with each other and relied more on others. Industrialization, technology, and new discoveries have changed the world.\n\nFirst, parents want to give their kids everything they didn't have when they were young. But this can be a mistake, and kids don't learn to appreciate the value of things.\n\nSecond, kids' schedules are often too busy. They go to school, learn music, sports, languages, and more. By the time they get home, they're exhausted and don't have the energy to help their communities. This is what I see in middle-class families in Spain, where I live.\n\nThird, TV is a big problem.

The reason is that studying one subject deeply gives you a thorough understanding of it. This is crucial for research and new ideas. It also helps make a positive impact on society.\n\nMany modern innovations are the result of in-depth study and research. For example, advances in telecommunications wouldn't have happened without breakthroughs in fiber optics. These advances have changed the way we communicate. Distance is no longer a problem.

By studying one subject deeply, you can make a meaningful contribution to the world's development.\n\nIt's easy to learn a little about many subjects. But to be successful, you need to study seriously. Reading about many subjects can broaden your thinking. However, you can easily get basic information about other subjects. In today's world of technology and information, it's easy to access information. Moreover, we don't live in isolation, so social interactions can help us learn about other subjects.\n\nThe modern world is driven by technology and science.

For example, they can go camping without much planning, while older people need to plan carefully.\n\nYoung people are also more willing to take risks. They know that if something goes wrong, they have time to fix it. This allows them to push themselves and enjoy life fully.\n\nIt's true that young people are busy, but they can still find time to enjoy life. They can have fun at work, at home, or with friends. You don't have to wait until you're old to enjoy life.\n\nMost fun things cost money.

The number of cars and their impact on the environment are often discussed in our daily conversations and political programs. In my opinion, I believe there will be fewer cars on the road in the near future than there are today. Let me explain why.\n\nFirstly, everyone - the government, households, and corporations - needs to take care of the environment. We all know that many things are going wrong, such as global warming. Global warming is causing glaciers to disappear, which can lead to the disappearance of the Maldives in less than twenty years. If we do nothing, we will lose our planet. Cars are a major source of pollution, which contributes to global warming and many diseases. So, we need to reduce the number of cars.\n\nAdditionally, other transportation modes are improving rapidly. For example, in Paris, having a car is impractical due to heavy traffic. Taking the bus is a better option because we can arrive on time. Driving in Paris takes much longer than taking the bus.\n\nFurthermore, safety is a major concern in our society. We should reduce the number of cars because of the many accidents that occur. It is unacceptable.\n\nIn conclusion, I think there is a solution: replacing our polluting cars with eco-friendly cars that respect the environment. These cars can run on solar power or non-polluting oils. I believe this is the best solution because we cannot force people to stop using their cars."}

On the other hand, I know it's hard to balance social goals with personal goals, especially for young people. I can relate to them because I'm one of them.\n\nI don't help in my community or participate in social programs. The reason is that my daily schedule is already full. I think it's better for kids between 11 and 15 to help in their communities without pay. Older young people are busy with their education and future, and younger kids may not be confident or responsible enough to help.\n\nMany community projects in Germany are done by young people who have finished school. If they don't want to join the army, they can choose to do social work in communities, hospitals, and so on. The truth is that young people usually don't help for free. They always look for payment and don't do it just to be helpful. I'm sure there are many things young people could do to help their community."}

This way, a person can gain a deep understanding of their chosen field and spend enough time to master it.\n\nOur world is organized into different areas of expertise. Everything is categorized and divided. A good example is college programs, which are divided into faculties like Engineering, Business, Teaching, Music, and Medicine. Each field requires specialized knowledge, such as math, biology, languages, or politics.\n\nIt's impossible for someone to know everything about everything. If a person dedicates their life to studying one subject, like astronomy, they will gain a lot of knowledge and go further than someone who studies a little bit of many subjects. This takes time and effort, and there isn't enough time to gain expertise in many subjects.\n\nIn school, kids get a basic education. Then, they can choose to focus on the subject they're most interested in. This doesn't mean they can't learn about other subjects, but they'll be an expert in their chosen field and contribute more to society.

There are good and bad things about knowing many subjects, but I want to talk about the good things because they are more important.\n\nFirst, knowledge is never bad. It's always useful. For example, I'm a math teacher, but I also like to paint. I took classes to learn about painting, drawing, and colors. When my friend invited me to an art show, I was able to understand and appreciate it because of my knowledge.\n\nSecond, life is complicated and we need different kinds of knowledge to make it easier. For instance, I'm a student, and I don't need to know about economics, like interest rates, in my daily life. But when I applied for a job at a bank, the manager asked me if I knew about interest rates. If I wanted the job, I had to know that. So, having that knowledge made my life easier.\n\nMost importantly, people who know a lot about many subjects are often very successful. For example, I read about Einstein's life and saw that he knew a lot about many things, like science and math. This knowledge helped him make new discoveries.\n\nIn conclusion, knowing many subjects makes our lives easier and happier, and it helps us succeed."}

We think we have a lot of time left, so we should make the most of it before we have big responsibilities like a job and family. Sometimes, young people think enjoying life means being careless and irresponsible, but that's not true for everyone.\n\nI don't agree that young people enjoy life more than older people. I think older people enjoy life too, just in a different way. One reason is that older and younger people don't always talk to each other, and they have different ideas of what it means to enjoy life.\n\nFor example, I like to travel and meet new people. I always ask my mom to do it with me. But she says her biggest joy now is to raise her kids well and see them succeed and be happy. When she was younger, she enjoyed herself in different ways.\n\nSo, I think older people enjoy life just as much as younger people, and sometimes even more.

They think that having a good job, a high salary, and nice things is more important than being a good person and treating others well.\n\nHowever, it's not fair to say that all young people are like this. Many young people help their communities in different ways. Some volunteer to help people with problems, such as disabilities, illness, or being alone. Some even travel to other countries to help people affected by natural disasters, wars, and diseases.\n\nIn short, because of the way our society is, some young people forget to help others.

But in a group tour, we can't do what we want because we have to follow the guide. For example, when I went to Paris alone, I took a guided tour to visit a museum. I did it because it was cheaper for groups. But I didn't enjoy the tour because there were too many people, and I couldn't see everything I wanted to see or get the information I wanted.\n\nAlso, traveling alone is better for using our time well. We can't get back the time we waste, so it's important to use it wisely. But in a group tour, it's easy to waste time. Research from Harvard shows that people who travel alone use their time twice as well as those who travel in groups. Plus, people who travel alone are more satisfied with how they spend their time and their whole trip.\n\nIn short, the best way to travel is alone, not in a group, because it makes us happy during the trip and helps us use our time well."}

Data analysis uses logic to think about questions. So, when people have a problem, they can think about it in different ways and solve it.\n\nKnowing many subjects makes people feel confident. They can talk about many things with others. For instance, a student at a party can talk to people from other majors if they know a lot of subjects. If they only know one subject, it's hard to find something to talk about, and they might feel shy. People will lack confidence.\n\nIn conclusion, it's better to know many subjects than to focus on just one.

Young people are braver than old people because they can do what they want with their bodies. Old people can't do those things anymore, so they live regular lives and support their children to do what they can't. Young people enjoy seeing their children do what they suggest.

Car prices are lower now than they were in the past. If this trend continues, even ordinary people will be able to afford a car in five or six years. As a result, many people will buy cars, and the number will go up quickly.\n\nMy second reason is that cars are safer than two-wheelers. This idea is spreading in countries like India, where two-wheelers are common. If this idea becomes stronger, people who own two-wheelers will replace them with cars, and the number of cars will increase.\n\nMy third reason is that cars can carry many people at once, unlike bikes and scooters. Bike and scooter owners will also want to buy cars. As fuel prices go up, people will prefer to spend money on cars and travel together rather than using individual transportation like two-wheelers.\n\nFinally, many people think owning a car is a status symbol.

As the population grows and resources shrink, there are fewer spots in good schools and universities. Students must compete for these limited spots.

We can't expect someone to take time out of their busy schedule to help the community.\n\nWhen young people start working, they are expected to work hard to secure a better future.\n\nDespite these challenges, I won't deny that many young people are careless about their community.

I have three reasons to explain why.\n\nFirst, ads aim to sell more products. No producer wants to show their product's weaknesses. Instead, they highlight the good things and hide the bad. For example, a medicine ad will only tell you what it can cure, not its potential risks. Some customers might even get hurt because of these hidden risks.\n\nSecond, producers exaggerate their product's abilities in ads to sell more. This makes the product seem much better than it is. For instance, mineral water is good for your health. Some producers claim it can cure illnesses, which is not true.\n\nThird, ads are a tool to sell products. Advertisers need to make the product look excellent to please the producer. This means they make the product seem better than it really is.\n\nIn conclusion, most ads don't show the real product. They make it seem better than it is. The government should do something about this to let customers know the truth."}

Let's say you got a degree in sports and want to work abroad. If your university didn't teach you a foreign language, you won't be able to fully adapt to your new surroundings.\n\nYou'll only be able to work in a small field with limited responsibility. I'm sure you'll soon feel uncomfortable and regret not learning more.

This applies to our situation.\n\nWhat about students who took business classes besides their major? They learned how to plan, set goals, and manage people. These skills would open up more job opportunities, like managing sports events or running a sports business.\n\nI'm sure that having a broad knowledge of many subjects helps everyone.

This lack of awareness stops young people from helping.\n\nFrom my own experience, I have seen a decrease in the number of young people in my community who are willing to help others. As the president of Key Club, a community service group at my school, I find it harder every year to get new members to join. I remember when we had 40 members, but now it's hard to get 20 people to attend meetings. The only reason some people help is to look good on their college applications. I'm sure not everyone feels this way, but I think most people do.\n\nEvery year, we get more money donations to Key Club, but we have fewer members. This shows that young people today do not want to spend time helping their communities. We have been taught to expect something in return when we give, but when we help others, we don't get anything tangible back. So, young people don't want to help. Instead, they give money, thinking it's a fair trade for not giving their time. But even giving money can be stopped by greed.\n\nIt's sad to see that today's young people, who will be tomorrow's leaders, are not willing to spend their time helping others when they can. It's time for society to teach young people to be willing to help others.

We hear about studies every year that show the number of cars is increasing. This might be because people have more money now. When my father was young, Italy was a poor country, and it was just starting to become modern. So, the current situation doesn't support the idea that the number of cars will decrease.\n\nHowever, there are other things to consider. Our planet can't support our growth. We're running out of oil, and we haven't found a good alternative yet. There's hydrogen, but it's expensive. Electric cars aren't as good as regular cars either. So, if hydrogen is our only option, it will probably be too expensive for a family to afford more than one car.\n\nAnother thing that affects the number of cars is what our governments do. Traffic is getting worse every year, but we can't keep building new roads forever. There's a limit. Some cities are already making changes. For example, you have to pay to drive into London. Milan is doing something similar. Maybe this will lead to better public transportation.\n\nSome countries have found different solutions. The Netherlands, for instance, has the most bicycles in the world. If you walk around Amsterdam, you'll see bicycles everywhere. This is because the government built bike-friendly streets.

Just because a famous actor uses it, it doesn't mean the product is well-made.\n\nCompanies often show the good things about their products in ads, but they hide the bad things. Many studies have shown that companies often make the bad things hard to see. They put the negative information in small print so people don't notice. People see the big words like 'This product is pesticide-free' or 'This product is a world-first.' Some people think making great ads is necessary for companies to make money. However, companies have gone too far. They should think about people's rights. People have the right to buy what they want based on the information ads give them."}

When factories and manufacturing plants used this approach, production increased greatly. While specialization has its downsides, such as limited knowledge in other areas, its benefits far outweigh its drawbacks.\n\nOne reason specialization works is that people eventually realize they are better at some things than others or have a passion for a certain field. They see that other knowledge is not useful for their chosen subject. For example, if someone wants to be a mechanical engineer, why do they need to know about Shakespeare's writing techniques?\n\nI know what I want to do in life, and studying subjects like Spanish and Business takes time away from my goal of becoming a research scientist. I enjoy reading about medical breakthroughs, but learning Spanish only frustrates me and gives me low grades. I doubt the importance of Spanish in the long run; it might help me communicate with some people, but how many will I meet?\n\nThrough my experiences, I've learned that knowledge in all areas is important, but so is specialization. In my opinion, knowing one thing very well is better than knowing a little about everything."}

When you understand an idea, you can think of the facts related to it. When you put an idea into action, you can see its good and bad points, which makes you think about the facts.\n\nThe process is simple: first, you come up with an idea, then you think about its results, then you try it out, and finally, you learn the facts from it. So, the facts come from the idea itself.\n\nJust learning facts without knowing what they mean is like eating food without knowing what it is. You might enjoy the food, but it's silly not to know what you're eating.\n\nIn today's world, understanding ideas and concepts is essential. If you're not keeping up, you're not doing your job well.\n\nWhen you understand an idea, you start thinking about it, and that helps you come up with new ideas. It makes you think critically. Knowing the facts is part of this process if you make understanding concepts a habit.\n\nSo, I think it's more important for students to understand concepts and work with them, knowing that they'll also learn the facts along the way."}

I think the number of cars will keep growing, even if they change how they work.\n\nAs the population grows, so do our needs. Cars are becoming a basic need for people today. New technology has made it possible for ordinary people to own a car. Car prices have never been lower, and they will keep going down as technology improves. This will make more people able to buy cars in the near future.\n\nIn the past, only the main breadwinner in a family owned a car. Now, even kids and other family members use cars for their own needs.\n\nToday, small two-seat cars are popular. This means that a family of four using one car now might use two small cars later.\n\nAlso, buses and three-wheelers usually pollute more than cars do. Now, cars that run on electricity or solar power are being made. These cars will be affordable and will help reduce pollution, so governments will support them.\n\nHowever, more cars will mean more traffic problems.\n\nSo, I believe that the number of cars on the road will keep growing, and so will traffic problems, but pollution will decrease."}

They provide the framework for all academic tasks. Without ideas, we would live in a world that doesn't care about understanding and developing our minds.\n\nSometimes education can become dull because it focuses too much on ideas. To really understand, we need details and small facts that make our learning more interesting and help us see the world in a new way.\n\nGood teachers are those who can inspire their students with a simple fact, like a date or a number, and use it to explore new ideas and possibilities. This helps students understand and remember important concepts.\n\nLearning is like a game. When we search for treasure, we need to stay focused on our goal, but we also need to pay attention to the facts and extra information we find along the way. The best way to educate students is to find a balance between ideas and facts, which works for all subjects, from math to art. This balance helps us find true wisdom."}

It's clear that well-educated people care more about their community than those who are not well-educated. For example, someone who graduated from university has knowledge of what a community needs and can make good decisions for it.\n\nAnother reason is that young people are influenced by the people they live with. Don't young people want to be like their parents? If their parents don't care about their community, neither do the young people.\n\nDaily events can also affect young people in a bad way.

My friends have had the same experience. So, it's common for ads to look better than they really are. We can say the same about other situations.\n\nLike my experience, people are easily influenced to want products used by famous people, such as artists, models, actors, or actresses. Companies use this method. That's why we see ads everywhere today. They're on TV, radio, in newspapers, magazines, and even on trains and buses.\n\nTake online shopping on TV as an example. The buyer shows their happiness after using the product on screen. Or, the salespeople or famous actors appear on screen, saying the product is good. Then, people who watch the program decide to buy the product. We don't know if what they say on screen is true until we try the product ourselves.\n\nThe salespeople also emphasize that the product is cheap or comes with gifts, but only for a limited time.

For example, shoe-making techniques are already well established, and people in this field know how to make high-quality shoes at low costs. Second, change is inevitable, and people who don't take risks will be left behind. If a shoe-maker only uses leather and doesn't learn about other materials, they might have to retire soon. The most important reason to try new things is that it can create a connection between what we already know and what we will learn.\n\nOn the other hand, many famous people have achieved success by specializing in a particular field, from army commanders to artists to shoemakers and athletes. The reason is that there are many talented people trying to be the best in their field. They need to improve their skills and gain knowledge, which requires hard work.

This is because of gifts, parties, and friends wishing them a happy birthday. But older people often feel sad and ashamed of getting older, and their birthday reminds them of those feelings.\n\nHow people enjoy life depends on their age. It's different for kids, teenagers, or adults.\n\nKids seem happy most of the time. They can enjoy small things for hours and keep smiling and laughing without a reason. Kids don't have to worry about important things because their parents try to keep them away from troubles.\n\nAs kids become teenagers, the way they enjoy life changes. The main reason teenagers enjoy life is freedom. Even though this often leads to small fights with their parents, teenagers want to prove they can be independent. When they feel free, teenagers find new hobbies, sometimes forbidden, but they enjoy taking risks.\n\nIn contrast to kids and teenagers, adults can't enjoy life as easily. Being an adult means having responsibilities. Adults have to work to earn money and have many commitments, which keep them from having fun and enjoying life. Moreover, when adults have kids, they try to give their kids the happiest life possible. So they don't mind sacrificing their own happiness for their family's benefit.

{"file_id": "1088466.txt", "output_essay": "I believe that learning facts is more important than understanding ideas and concepts. I'll explain my idea using the example of the controversy surrounding Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution. Knowing ideas and concepts doesn't mean we understand the topic and can act on it. Take the argument over Article 9, for instance. The question is whether to revise it or not. It's true that understanding its history, which has kept Japan peaceful for 60 years, and its idea of giving up war after Hiroshima and Nagasaki, is important. However, just understanding these ideas won't protect us from terrorism. So, what do we need to live in peace? We need to learn the facts about Japan today and how to maintain peace. What if North Korea launches missiles at Japan? Do we fight back or use our self-defense forces, which don't fit with Article 9? Understanding ideas and concepts isn't helpful in our daily lives. It's a good idea, but it's not practical. What I want to say is that it's not the importance of Article 9 that matters, but learning facts and knowing what to do next is more important in our real lives."}

In fact, I've often used information I learned in my first years of university, especially in biology and chemistry, which aren't part of my usual work.\n\nAnother point is that when students understand ideas and concepts, they can connect them to others to learn new things or make theories about unknown topics. This is crucial for creating new ideas or advancing science and engineering.\n\nMoreover, it's the foundation of social progress. When students understand more ideas or concepts, they do better in their studies and future work.\n\nOn the other hand, if students just learn facts, it's harder for them to connect the dots between different facts because they might not see how they relate.

This is different from older people, who have experienced a lot in life and tend to be more calm and peaceful.\n\nHowever, just because people tend to behave in certain ways doesn't mean we can predict how they will develop as individuals. What really matters is how people choose to make the most of their lives.\n\nWhen we talk about most people, we should remember that young people are more open to trying new things and feeling excited than older people, who often prefer a quiet life. To society, this may seem like older people are not enjoying life as much.\n\nYoung people have the energy and freedom to explore new things, which is a natural part of who we are. When we discover and explore, we feel happy. Young people take advantage of their physical and mental abilities to seek out enjoyable experiences more often than older people do, and they usually achieve their goals.\n\nMy grandfather used to love playing soccer when he was young. He got so much joy from it that he never missed a game. Now, at 70, all he wants to do is rest. He told me, 'Soccer was my life; once it's gone, you're left with just memories.' Now I play soccer, and it's a big part of who I am. If I didn't play, my life wouldn't be the same because it brings me so much joy.\n\nSo, I believe young people enjoy life more fully, not because I'm being unfair, but because it's a natural part of life. It's like a flower blooming and then wilting - a person lives, grows, and eventually dies. Older people may find joy in different things, but they've already reached a peak in their lives that they once considered true happiness. This paves the way for younger people to discover and search for the same kind of joy, making their levels of happiness higher."}

This is how jobs are divided.\n\nHowever, being an expert in one area can make people seem boring. Knowing a little about everything makes people more open-minded and interesting.

This means there would be no new discoveries or inventions.\n\nIn conclusion, I think that both specializing in one area and knowing a little about everything have their drawbacks. But if I had to choose, I would say that specializing in one area is better because it doesn't lower our standard of living.

But in reality, it may not work that well.\n\nAdvertising for clothes, home appliances, cars, and technology also has a big impact on customers. Some people buy products just because their favorite celebrity is in the ad.\n\nI think that good companies don't need to advertise much.

For example, a heart doctor can help patients better than a general doctor can.\n\nSecond, we all know the risks of knowing only a little about something. If we don't fully understand one subject, we can't use our knowledge to achieve anything. We don't know where to go next, and we might have to stop in the middle of a project because we don't know what's ahead. This can also affect how well a society grows.\n\nFinally, to become an expert in a subject, we need to start by learning about many subjects, even if they're not directly related. This helps us understand our favorite subject better. So, knowing a little about all subjects is the first step to becoming an expert in one area. For instance, a heart doctor needs to know how the whole body works, not just the heart.\n\nIn conclusion, specializing in one subject not only helps us develop our skills but also helps us use the knowledge we gain from all subjects.

But we can't discover anything new without trying. So, people should try new things to improve themselves, but they should think carefully before making a move. For example, a businessman who invests all his money in stocks might lose everything. So, I think new approaches are important, but people should think before they act. If they're careful, they can minimize risks and enjoy the benefits of trying new things. It's not always risky to try something new. In fact, we can't achieve anything in life without taking some risks."}

However, I think that in the future, there will be fewer cars on the road. This is because technology is advancing quickly, and new ways of transportation are being developed.\n\nWe've seen new modes of transport emerge in recent years, such as hovercrafts, underground rails, and supersonic aircraft. As people rely more on these new ways of transportation, I believe there will be fewer cars on the road.\n\nWe often read about new airline companies opening up in the news. Low-cost airlines have been successful in Europe and are being tried in countries like India. People are changing the way they travel between cities or countries because of these new airlines. They offer cheap rates, especially for business travelers, who have many options to choose from. As a result, people are starting to use cars less for short trips. With the success of these airlines, I'm sure we'll see more business models like this, which will lead to fewer cars on the road.\n\nSociety is changing quickly. We're seeing new types of communities emerge. In some, people live and work in the same area, while in others, they live and work separately. If these communities become widespread, people will need to use different modes of transportation. In the first case, they won't need to travel, and in the second case, they'll prefer public transportation like underground or overhead rails. This will make their commute faster and reduce their reliance on cars.\n\nIn conclusion, as times change, people are relying on different modes of transportation to reach their destinations faster and more easily. These factors suggest that in the future, cars will be replaced by other modes of transportation. I hope that cars don't become extinct like the dinosaurs."}

It's better to know a little about many subjects than to be an expert in one area. This can help people make friends, find new skills, and get good jobs.\n\nKnowing many subjects can improve social lives. For example, if someone talks to people who like sports, they can discuss sports even if they don't like it. This helps them make friends by communicating easily.\n\nLearning many subjects can also help people discover new skills. For instance, a doctor who studies dance might find a new interest. This is a big difference between being a doctor and a dancer.\n\nFinally, knowing many subjects makes it easy to get a better job. If people have many skills, companies are likely to hire them. For example, two people are interviewing for a job. One knows many things, and the other knows only one thing. The boss will probably hire the first person.\n\nIn conclusion, knowing many subjects can help people make friends, find new skills, and get good jobs."}

{"file_id": "1085846.txt", "output_essay": "Over the last century, advertising has become a major activity in our lives. It's everywhere: on TV, in the street, in the subway, and even on our cars. We can't avoid it. Some people think that advertisers make their products seem better than they really are. Do they? Is advertising that simple? Don't they think about the risk of customers getting disappointed?\n\nThe question seems simple: of course, advertisers make their products look good. They get paid to sell things to people who don't need them. They need to create a need in customers' minds and make them want to buy their product. How can they do that without making their products look good? They're not just selling a product; they're selling a dream. That's why ads often show perfect results, like super clean laundry or shiny hair.\n\nBut is it always like that? Don't advertisers worry that people will stop buying their product if they feel deceived? Actually, some advertisers use other techniques to sell their products. They might criticize their competition to make their product look better. What matters is that the buyer chooses their product. For example, Coca-Cola once made an ad where a little girl was disappointed to get a Pepsi instead of a Coke. Advertisers can also use reverse psychology to make people curious. \n\nIn conclusion, while there are other techniques, most advertisers make their products seem better than they are. Even though people know ads aren't always true, they still fall for them. That's how our consumer society has grown."}
{"file_id": "1089601.txt", "output_essay": "When it comes to student learning, there's been a lot of talk about this issue in the last ten years. Some people think that learning facts is more important for students than understanding ideas and concepts. Others disagree. I think understanding ideas and concepts is better because it has more benefits.\n\nFirst, people who think learning facts is important forget that practice is key. I remember that successful people in society have strong skills that help them in their work. You can't learn these skills in class; you need to practice them in real life.\n\nAnother important reason I think understanding is better is that facts you don't understand will soon be forgotten. For example, some students copy others' work to hand it in to the teacher, but they don't understand what the answers mean. They only learn to do, not to understand. So, they don't really learn.\n\nOf course, learning facts also has some benefits. For example, teachers give us the right answers, which saves time; they show us the shortest way to get results; and they help us make a better life.\n\nBut when we consider all these factors, the benefits of understanding ideas and concepts are more important than the benefits of learning facts. In conclusion, it's clear that it's more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts."}
{"file_id": "1085090.txt", "output_essay": "I strongly agree with the statement 'Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.'\n\nI will explain why I think this is true.\n\nThe world is changing fast. If we stick to old ways and ideas, we won't make progress. Think about it - if Graham Bell hadn't tried new things, where would our communication be today? If the Wright Brothers hadn't taken risks, where would our transportation be? It's all about thinking differently and creatively to be successful.\n\nOur minds are very creative and can think of many things in many ways. We shouldn't limit ourselves to traditional ideas and rules. We need to try new things from a young age. For example, when solving a math problem, a child should think of a new way to find the solution, not just follow the teacher's way. This helps the child understand the problem better and remember it forever. This is how children become successful, and it stays with them throughout their lives.\n\nAt first, people might criticize our ideas, but we shouldn't give up. We should remember that great people are often criticized. To be successful, we need to keep trying new things, taking risks, and forgetting old ways of doing things. We should challenge those who criticize us.\n\nTrying new things involves risk, but we shouldn't be afraid. We should always aim for success, even if it's hard. Success that involves risk is more satisfying than success that doesn't. It's like they say - 'The fruit gained from a great risk is more tasty.'\n\nHistory has shown that trying new things, thinking differently, and taking risks leads to great success. That's why I believe in my statement."}
{"file_id": "1086263.txt", "output_essay": "I agree that most ads make products seem better than they are.\n\nOne reason is that ads are based on surveys done by professionals to find out what people want to hear. For example, if a company wants to sell a new skateboard, it will ask teenagers who skateboard what they want in a perfect product. It will also ask their parents, who will pay for it. The company will then use this information to create an ad. The ad will show the product as perfect, just like the people surveyed wanted. But when people buy the product, they might be disappointed because it's not as great as they thought.\n\nAnother example is ads for Kraft's dinner products. These ads target parents and kids who make lunches at home. The product is shown as a healthy and easy lunch. The kids in the ad look happy to eat it, and it looks tasty. But it's easy to see that Kraft's dinner products are not healthy and don't taste great.\n\nAd designers know that people are more likely to buy a product if it looks nice. That's why products come in colorful boxes with nice designs. They also use pictures of attractive people to make the product look appealing. People might buy the product because they want to be like the person in the picture. But the product itself might not be that special.\n\nIn conclusion, I think ad companies are good at finding out what people want and making ads that show people how to get it. They show people how to achieve their dreams. But sometimes, dreams don't come true."}
{"file_id": "1085663.txt", "output_essay": "I don't think the given statement is true. I understand the reasoning behind it, but I don't think it's accurate.\n\nFirst, we need to look at why someone who only meets success is more likely to take risks. When you succeed in a project, you feel happy and satisfied. The more you achieve your goals, the more confident you become. This confidence grows and grows, making you want to achieve even more. For example, when you start a business and it does well, you think about expanding. If it keeps doing well, you might diversify your business. That's why big companies like Bouygues are involved in building, mobile phones, and more. Virgin makes music discs and also develops its own mobile phone programs. These companies take risks by entering new markets because they believe in their success and have the support of their customers.\n\nHowever, new things aren't always done by successful people. Creativity, for instance, has nothing to do with success; it's about personality. An artist might not always be successful, but they will still want to create. That's why many painters made breakthroughs after many failures. Another example is Alain Baraton, a famous gardener in Versailles. He failed in school, but later developed a passion for gardening and created new arrangements around the castle. You can't be successful all the time, but that doesn't mean you're not willing to try new things. Someone who wants to be recognized by society but hasn't achieved that goal will probably try everything they can.\n\nIn conclusion, success is not as closely tied to 'boldness' as the statement suggests."}

They focus on their own free time, such as playing video games and watching TV.\n\nMany young people do not spend enough time helping their communities. With the development of technology, many things seem interesting to people, especially young people who are curious about the world. They want to experience and try many things, including some bad things like smoking and drinking.\n\nUnlike today's people, past generations learned to value their communities because they felt responsible for their environment. They were taught this from a young age.\n\nUnfortunately, today's values are different. People focus on having fun, but they ignore their responsibilities to their communities and society. In school, we learn to be responsible for our surroundings, but many of us have forgotten what this means.\n\nThere are many examples of helping communities. For instance, keeping a community clean and organized is everyone's job because we are all part of the community. But many young people do not realize the importance of this job. When older people ask for their help, they often respond with bad attitudes, thinking it's a waste of time. If we look closely, we can see many negative things that will happen when these young people grow up. Our society will suffer if it's led by lazy people.\n\nHowever, our society has already started to correct the attitudes of young people. They began by requiring community service in schools. This is an important step because school is where everyone goes. Besides community service, many schools now also teach the importance of protecting the environment. I think these two things are starting to work in many young minds.\n\nFinally, before we do anything, we should remember that Earth is our home, and we are all its owners. While we enjoy our lives, we should also do something for our community. The community is not only our home but also belongs to our children. Even a small contribution to the community can make a difference in society. Lastly, we should provide a clean and healthy environment for our children."}

But in a group, it feels like you're with family - brothers, sisters, uncles, and grandparents. You feel happy spending time with everyone, and you don't have to worry because the guide shows you around.\n\nIn a group, you don't have to worry about safety or feeling lonely. You can also get discounts on tickets and packages, which is a big advantage.\n\nI remember when I was in high school, we took a trip to New Delhi. We had a blast on the train, singing songs, dancing, and joking around. When we got there, we visited all the tourist spots together and had a great time.\n\nWhen I went to the same places alone, I felt bad and didn't even want to see them. Another good thing about group travel is that you don't miss your friends who can't come with you. You don't even notice the time passing because you're having so much fun.\n\nEveryone wants to travel, but they worry about the time and money it takes. If you travel alone, you spend more money on things you need. But in a group, the cost per person goes down as more people join. So, you can have a successful and happy trip on a low budget with security and company."}

For example, opening a new business without expertise is a bad risk. But if you ask for advice and make a smart decision, it's a good risk.\n\nAnother example is applying to a university to get a degree. Some people are afraid of rejection, so they don't try. If you don't work hard and take risks, you might regret it in the future.\n\nFor these reasons, I believe successful people should take risks and try new things in life."}

We should take risks and try new things to succeed because it gives us chances to improve, correct, and benefit from life.\n\nTrying new things helps people in many ways. For example, Bill Gates learned about computers when he was young. He used this knowledge to create Windows, a unique computer system. This new skill made him the richest man in the world. Trying new things always helps people gain more. That's why people keep learning even after they start working.\n\nWhen we try new things, we improve in ways we can't if we just do what we already know. For instance, if I read a book I've already read, I won't learn much. But if I read a new book about improving my personality, I might change my ways. I can do things better. Also, trying new things helps us correct our mistakes. We can compare and rethink how we do things. We might think we're doing things right, but actually, we're not.

Their parents teach them to behave this way.\n\nWhen young people are small, they start to think only of themselves. They cry and throw tantrums to get what they want, and their families give in. This is because families don't teach them to think about the world and how to survive in it. As a result, they grow up and enter a world they don't know how to live in. They're not ready for the real world. They do many things as they grow up, but they don't take the time to understand their communities. So, how can they help their communities if they don't know what they need? I don't think this is the young people's fault.

They say they like it because they want to avoid people, planned schedules, and have time to themselves. Although this is a good reason, traveling in a group with a guide has many benefits we should consider.\n\nTraveling in a group with a guide is safer than traveling alone in a foreign country. When we travel alone, we may encounter many dangers, such as fraud or accidents, because we are not familiar with the country. For example, many Koreans have been cheated by foreigners during a trip to East Asia. This can include murder, robbery, and more. If something bad happens, we may become too embarrassed to handle it properly. However, guides are usually from that country, so they know the country's conditions and situations well, which reduces the danger.\n\nTraveling in a group is also very convenient and helps us see important places. Tour companies plan and book everything, so we can just follow the schedule and enjoy our trip. For instance, we don't have to worry about not having a hotel room because the company has already booked it.

She spends a lot of time studying English, math, and science, but all she wants is to stop going to the academies.\n\nMoreover, just learning more and more without understanding is not helpful at all. For instance, another student at my academy has to take three classes every day because his mom wants him to.

This is because he's trying to learn too much at once.\n\nIt's clear that having a lot of knowledge is useful and important. However, I think the way we study should be more efficient.

On the other hand, taking risks can be stressful, but it can also lead to growth. It is important to think carefully about the risks you take and how to approach them.

We don't have to waste time searching for them. We get a good overview of the area without missing anything.\n\nThird, a guide provides valuable information about the places we visit. We learn how, why, and when things happened. This gives us a complete understanding of the area.\n\nAnother advantage is that a guide helps us communicate with locals. This is important because we might not speak the language. A guide translates for us, so we don't get confused.\n\nA guide can also help us find affordable accommodations. We don't have to pay too much for a place to stay.\n\nIn conclusion, I think having a guide is worth the extra cost. They make our trip easier, more enjoyable, and more informative."}

Many people are good at what they know, but what makes successful people stand out is their ability to do new things.\n\nSuccessful people try new things and take risks because that's what makes them successful. If you're good at something and keep doing it, you're not learning new things; you're just staying in your comfort zone. To be successful, you need to take risks and be more than average.\n\nSuccessful people try new things because if they don't, they won't be successful. Being good at what you do is not bad, and it's part of being successful. However, it's not enough because you need to learn more and do more. That's why being good at what you do is not the same as being successful.\n\nI agree that successful people try new things and take risks instead of just doing what they're good at. Successful people want to be good at everything they do."}

It means doing things that make us happy.\n\nYoung people have a lot of energy because of their age. They can do many things like traveling, riding a bike, and running. They can also spend time with their kids and grandkids. This makes them happy and gives them a sense of achievement. They may not feel the need to try new things because they are already happy with their life.\n\nOn the other hand, young people may not have as much fun as we think. In today's world, we need to focus on getting a good job and education. This means we have to work and study hard from a young age. We may not have time to enjoy life until we retire, which is when we are older.\n\nBut enjoying life is not about how old we are or what we do. It's about being happy with our life and the people around us. We choose whether to enjoy life or not, no matter how old we are.\n\nSo, let's ask ourselves: do we want to enjoy life or not?"}

But do ads show the truth about products, or do they make them seem better than they are? I think ads make products look better than they really are because they don't talk about the dangers. They also don't show the real price.\n\nFirst, ads should change how we shop. They make products look better than they are. For example, McDonald's shows pictures of their burgers to attract customers. But the burgers in the pictures are fake and look fresher than the real ones.\n\nWhat's more, ads don't show the dangers of these products. Take McDonald's again. We know their food can make people overweight. But the ads don't mention this because McDonald's wants people to buy their food. Another example is toys for kids. They are often made in China with low-quality materials. Sometimes, they are even toxic for kids.\n\nThese dangers are not mentioned in the ads, which I think is wrong. Thirdly, the real price is always hidden in the ads. For example, airlines offer cheap flights, like one flight from Munich to Berlin for 30 Euros. But this price doesn't include extra fees like airport charges or fuel costs. The real price is about 55 Euros, almost double the advertised price.\n\nIn short, ads distort reality. McDonald's shows fake burgers and hides the dangers of their food. Toy companies make toxic products look attractive. And false prices annoy consumers.\n\nAs for me, I think ads should be stopped. People should buy products because they are good quality, not just because the ad makes them seem better than they are."}

It will give me more job opportunities and allow me to specialize further, making it easier to get a master's or doctorate degree.\n\nSome people might think I'm wrong and that general knowledge is better. But nowadays, people tend to specialize in a major rather than having general knowledge.

Most companies want employees who can come up with new ideas, such as new products and services. When employees create new products, companies can make more money. For example, I interned at a company in my country two years ago. I saw that top managers always talked about innovation and encouraged me to be open to new ideas.\n\nSecondly, people's demands are changing fast. When we buy a new product, we often get bored with it after a few months. To meet these demands, we need people who can take risks and create new things. For example, Bill Gates, the owner of Microsoft, is a great example. When he first developed Windows, he took a risk and started his own company after IBM rejected his offer. Now, his products are used all over the world, and he is very successful.\n\nLastly, creating new things gives people a sense of fulfillment. We are born to create and survive. Everyone has skills to create new things, so they use them.\n\nIn summary, successful people always try new things and take risks. Most of the time, they are successful and happy. Doing routine tasks is boring, and people who do them do not have enough fulfillment."}

From my perspective, young people are less responsible than older people. The way to enjoy life has changed over the years. Today, young people have fewer problems than they did forty years ago. For example, a boy relies heavily on his parents, which means he has less responsibility and is often unhappy.\n\nOn the other hand, older people have reached a stage of maturity that allows them to enjoy life more. They can appreciate small things, like having dinner with friends or taking a trip with family.\n\nIt's true that young people have a lot of energy, but that's not the whole story. There are cases where older people don't enjoy life because they have big problems, like not having a job or being very tired.\n\nIn my opinion, young people don't enjoy life as much as older people when conditions are equal.

I think young people today don't give enough time to helping their communities.\n\nFirst, young people have many things to do. Their careers are very important to them. They want to have a perfect life and be good family members. They work hard, and time is limited. Helping their community comes second to their job.\n\nSecond, young people want to spend time on themselves. They relax by doing things they enjoy. For example, they travel during their free time. Some have hobbies, and some like to be alone. They focus on themselves and don't have time for their community.\n\nFinally, young people's schedules are different and can change. This depends on their personality. Some are very hardworking, while others are lazy. Environmental changes also affect them. They can easily change their behavior. As a result, they might not prioritize their relationships with family and friends. Their jobs can easily affect them, and they might forget about their loved ones.\n\nIn short, finding time to help others can be hard due to specific reasons. Giving time to help others is up to us. Today, everyone wants a good life or job."}
{"file_id": "1090891.txt", "output_essay": "In general, young people enjoy life more than older people do. This is because young people can adapt to new things easily. Older people find it hard to do that. But older people had time to get used to the world, and they must have enjoyed it back then. So, I agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do.\n\nI am part of the young generation, and I enjoy my life. I like going to school, exercising, and exploring the world. To do these things, you need to be brave, have a healthy body, and want to try new things. But it's hard for older people to do these things. Some older people still have these qualities, but most are less motivated. For example, my grandmother only wants to do her daily routine, like taking care of the house or talking to friends. One time, I asked her to travel with my family, but she refused, even though she was healthy. She just didn't want to leave her home and usual environment.\n\nOn the other hand, we young people are not afraid of new things or environments because we have big dreams for the future. This makes us enjoy life more than older people. I think older people should find things they like to do to enjoy their life. It might help them fit in with society and the public. If they don't do that, they will spend the rest of their life unhappy or bored. To avoid this, they should try to find things they like."}

If they take a physical exam, they will get good results. So, young people should enjoy their life.\n\nSecond, young people need to have many experiences.

For example, in traditional Japanese arts like Kabuki or Noh, performers practice the same stories every day from a young age until they die. We all think they're successful in showing Japanese culture through these arts. The same is true for craftsmen and professional baseball players. They get better by doing what they know best every day. These examples show that the original statement is not true.\n\nAlso, even if trying new things can bring success, 'new things' must mean things that are new to everyone, not just one person.

New energy sources are being explored, and better ways to use resources are being researched all the time.

People are already switching to alternative sources, such as hybrid cars that run on both electricity and fuel. Scientists are trying to harness the power of hydrogen, which is abundant on earth and could reduce our dependence on other fuels.\n\nGovernments are promoting the use of public transportation, like buses and trains. For example, the United Arab Emirates is building a metro train system. Governments want to reduce people's reliance on cars. However, not everyone will use public transportation all the time.\n\nMany people need to travel short distances frequently for work. Some people prefer not to use public transportation or need to travel in controlled environments due to medical conditions. These people will always need personal transportation that is comfortable. This need can only be met by a vehicle like a car.\n\nTherefore, cars will always be a means of transportation and will not decrease in number.

{"file_id": "1093616.txt", "output_essay": "People don't always become successful by trying new things and taking risks. If someone has a formula for success, they shouldn't change it unless they want to or have to.\n\nCarlo Ancelotti, the coach of AC Milan, an Italian soccer team, said, 'A winning team doesn't change.' The next day, AC Milan won the Champions League using the same players. This shows that if something is working, it's often best to leave it alone.\n\nNot everyone has a clear path to success. In these cases, trying new things and taking risks is necessary. For example, the son of a factory owner will likely be successful because he inherits a well-run business. But a skilled worker in the factory might not be successful unless they take a risk and start their own business.\n\nIn society, risks are often necessary for success and progress. Competition from others can push people to innovate and try new things. While this can lead to some people failing, it also leads to new and innovative things being created.\n\nIn conclusion, success isn't always about trying new things and taking risks, but sometimes it's necessary."}
{"file_id": "1094286.txt", "output_essay": "I don't think young people enjoy life more than old people. They just like to live their lives in different ways. Young people love having free time, playing with friends, and trying new things. For example, summer holidays are the busiest weeks of the year. They don't have to think about school, and they can play or go to the beach every day.\n\nPersonally, I'm 22 years old, and I enjoy life because I can hang out with friends, go dancing, or visit pubs. I also love life because I have many opportunities. I want to learn more, achieve my goals, get a good job, and start a family.\n\nOld people enjoy life just as much as young people, but they prefer quieter and more relaxed places. They've already lived through the busy part of their lives.\n\nMy 78-year-old grandmother is a good example. She likes staying home to watch TV, read books, cook, and spend time with friends. On holiday, she likes to sit in the sun, take walks, and enjoy the scenery or eat ice cream.\n\nI think young and old people both enjoy life, but they have different interests and ways of living.

But if they analyze the situation and understand why the event happened, they'll enjoy the subject more, feel smarter, and remember the dates and names better.\n\nI think learning shouldn't be boring. If you just memorize everything to get a good grade, you're not really learning. You're just dealing with problems and getting tired and bored.\n\nStudying can be fun if you understand what you're learning. You'll feel smart. If you just learn facts without understanding them, you'll feel bad and less intelligent. So, I think teachers should encourage students to develop their intelligence, not just memorize a lot of information.\n\nTruly smart people can solve problems on their own. If you need to read something many times to understand it, you're not really learning. It's pointless to live like that because, at the end of your life, you'll regret not using your true intelligence."}
{"file_id": "1092270.txt", "output_essay": "It's natural for people to be afraid to try new things. Failing can be very unpleasant, and the easiest way to avoid failing is to do nothing. However, history shows us that the only way to improve and be successful is to take risks and try new things, even if it's hard or painful.\n\nThe Western world as we know it today was shaped by industrialization. This period in history was a time when new machines and ideas made it possible to produce more goods, better quality products, and improve people's lives. If people hadn't taken risks and failed many times before finding solutions, none of this would have happened.\n\nA good example of the results of taking risks is the development of airplanes. We've all seen old movies of the first plane prototypes, which looked more like toys than real planes. But after years of trial and error, someone finally got it right. Now, we can travel to places that would be impossible to reach otherwise.\n\nI have a personal example from my experience as a Brand Manager of a wine company. Many people didn't believe we could create a wine that's as fun as beer. But my team and I believed it was possible. After making many mistakes, we finally developed \"FRESSCO,\" a new brand that combines wine with fresh fruit in innovative packaging. The result is that FRESSCO is now one of the top 3 wines sold in Chile and a real competitor to beers.\n\nIn conclusion, even though it's always a challenge to try new things, it's essential to know that innovation is the only way to progress. Mistakes can be painful, but the reward of doing something new makes it all worth it."}

I agree with this approach for several reasons. First, you can become an expert in that area. Second, you can get better job opportunities. Third, you can solve specific problems.\n\nWhen you focus on one area, you can gain deep knowledge and explain complex ideas. For example, someone who studies economics in college, graduate school, and gets a Ph.D. can develop theories about how people spend money and how it affects the economy.\n\nHaving a specialized degree can also lead to better job opportunities. For instance, if you have a Ph.D. in Computer Science, you can work for top companies like Microsoft.\n\nAdditionally, specializing in a field can help you solve real-world problems. If you study medicine, you might find a cure for diseases like HIV, cancer, or diabetes.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that being a specialist in a particular area is better than having general knowledge. Being a specialist means being an expert, and that can lead to better job opportunities and a chance to make a real difference."}

However, if you plan to visit Egypt, for example, you'll need a guide.\n\nA tour guide is someone who knows the area and its history. When you travel, time is important, so you want to see and learn as much as you can in a short time. A tour guide can help you do this.\n\nA guide not only knows about history and important places but also recommends good restaurants, fun places, and areas to avoid for safety reasons.\n\nI remember when I visited Mexico with friends. We hired a guide to visit some ancient ruins. On the bus ride to El Carmen, the guide told us about the ruins, so we knew what to expect when we arrived.\n\nI'd like to visit Egypt with friends in the future, and we'll definitely hire a guide.

He says that to become a leader, you need to think outside the box and try new things. You need to take risks and be aware that you might fail. But successful people will keep trying to achieve their goals.\n\nAs a specialized purchaser for Walmart, one of the largest retailers worldwide, I have faced many challenges that require me to work well under pressure and competition.

There are also subjects like Biochemistry and Economic Law that combine many areas of study.\n\nAlso, experts need to know a little about other subjects to work with other experts. They need each other's knowledge, experience, and research. For example, a Physics professor can learn a lot from a Math professor, which can help their ideas and theories.\n\nMoreover, knowing many subjects opens your mind and gives you more information. You can't find this information in a single lab or classroom. For example, a Law professor can't know about Arabic poetry unless they talk to an Arabic Literature professor. They can also learn about people's inventions and see life from different angles.\n\nIn conclusion, I think having broad knowledge has many advantages, improves relationships between experts, and opens your mind."}

This process helps students keep growing mentally. Facts are helpful, but they only go so far. Facts can actually prevent learning because most of what you do with them is memorize and store them away. They might come up when it's convenient, but ideas stick around.\n\nI attended a Model UN debate meeting in 2005. My classmates and I were chosen to represent our school, but we didn't know what to expect. Our demanding teacher had us re-enact last year's meeting, and it took us a while to get it. But once we did, our doubts disappeared, and we understood the concept. Model UN is more than just an extracurricular activity; it's a chance to succeed. We learned to think for others, speak for those who can't, and come up with solutions to global problems. That's what Model UN is really about, and we knew that before we even started. When we got to La Ceiba, we had an amazing learning experience.\n\nOur teacher could have just given us a list of facts, but that wouldn't have been enough.

Cars cause pollution, and when people use them more, pollution gets worse. This is because of bad gases like carbon dioxide from cars.\n\nSecond, when everyone uses cars, it creates traffic jams. People get stuck in traffic and can't do what they want on time. So, they will prefer using buses and subways, which are faster.\n\nThird, it's clear that people will always die, even with medical progress. In the future, there will be fewer people getting married and having babies, so the population won't grow much.\n\nSo, people won't use more cars in the future than they do now. They care about the environment and don't want to be late for their appointments. As they say, 'Time is money.'"}

The definition of success is important here. If success means having a lot of money, then it's not that simple. But one thing is clear: people who try new things have a better chance of succeeding.\n\nIn areas where people have already made a lot of money, there's not much left for others. It's like a monopoly. For example, a few people control the fossil fuel industry, and it's hard for others to get in.\n\nSome things, like our looks or intelligence, are given to us. But we can still improve our chances of success by trying new things. Even if it's risky, people who try new things can achieve great success. Those who only do what they're good at can't easily catch up.\n\nI want to achieve great success. To do this, I need to improve my creativity and find new things to explore.

This helped us understand technology and philosophy better.\n\nThere are many examples of people in history who risked their wealth or lives to try something new they believed in.\n\nIt's human nature to want to learn and gain wisdom. But to get new knowledge, we must be willing to take risks and try new things. We can't just follow what others have done.\n\nTo be successful, you need to stand out from the crowd, and that means taking some risks. One way to do this is by trying new approaches and inventing something new or learning new skills. Successful businesspeople, for example, are known for taking risks. They try to make things better, and their success shapes our economy and society.\n\nPeople like Bill Gates changed the world. He started in a small garage, working on something that seemed crazy at the time. He took a risk, and it paid off.\n\nThe financial markets also show that taking risks can lead to success. But it's not just about taking risks blindly. We can gather information and use it to make smart decisions about the risks we take. To be successful, we need to be informed and willing to try new things.\n\nI agree with the statement that taking risks is necessary for success."}

People need to work alone, but they also need to work for the group they belong to, like their school or family. Many teenagers do not know their responsibilities as students and family members.\n\nUsually, people learn to be part of a community in their family. Children should study, respect older family members, and parents should work for the family and help their kids become better adults. They should also love and have a good relationship with each other. Unfortunately, many young people avoid getting close to their parents. They do not listen to their advice and instead move away from home. They prefer to be with their friends rather than spend time with their brothers or sisters.\n\nAnother example is in their schools. Students need to attend classes, study for exams, and prepare for their future careers. Lately, many students think school is a place to have fun or escape from home without preparing for lessons. They see school rules as challenges to break and get attention. As a result, schools have to make stricter rules to control them. This causes the community to fall apart. Teenagers need to give up some of their freedom to have a peaceful school life.\n\nIn conclusion, young people should sometimes act like adults to control their lives better. If they can be good students, friends, sisters, brothers, daughters, and sons, they can create a better community and enjoy their lives."}

In my opinion, it focuses too much on success rather than values.\n\nIn school, we take many classes and write exams. But often, we don't have enough time to study, so we just memorize key facts to pass. However, we quickly forget what we memorized, and after a few months, we're left with very little.\n\nThis isn't good preparation for life. At school, we often only learn how to recall facts quickly. But if we learn through enjoyable activities like group work or role-plays, we remember the main ideas better. We don't feel pressured to memorize quickly, and we can enjoy learning. When we enjoy learning, we take more away from it.\n\nTeaching ideas and concepts can include good ways of behaving that we can't learn from just facts. Students can learn important values and strategies for their future. If they understand the idea behind what they're learning, they can apply it in daily life. I think that's what school should do.\n\nSchool should prepare students for their future. It's up to schools to teach values and virtues, especially when parents fail. Values can't be taught by memorizing facts. They can only be taught by practicing them. So, I agree that it's more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than to just learn facts."}

However, I believe that traveling with a guide and a group is the best way because you can see the most popular sites quickly and learn social skills by interacting with others.\n\nFirst, a guide who knows the area can help you save time and see the best places. Some people say this type of travel doesn't work for everyone in the group. But a good guide has experience with different types of travelers and can plan the best route for most people. A survey by the Korean National Research Center found that most people who traveled abroad wanted to go with a guide who knows the area. They said a guide could take them to the most important sites they wouldn't want to miss. They also said it would save time instead of traveling alone with a map.\n\nMoreover, traveling with a group helps you develop social skills. These days, social skills are important for success. When you travel with a group, you can learn to get along with others. For example, if you travel to India with a group, you might have to deal with difficult people or confusing situations. But you can learn to stay calm and get along with others. Traveling with a group creates memories not only of the places you visit but also of the people you meet. You can also use the social skills you learn to succeed in life.\n\nIn conclusion, traveling with a group is the best way to travel because it's efficient and helps you develop social skills."}

For example, my parents thought it was a dream to own a car when they were young. But now, I don't feel the need to own a car. The importance of having a car is changing.\n\nThirdly, there are many alternative modes of transportation available, such as trains, airplanes, and ships.

I'd like to describe two significant conversations I had.\n\nThe first conversation was with an 80-year-old woman living in a retirement home. She was very sick but always smiled. We talked a lot, and she shared great stories about her life and her late husband Karl. She felt at peace with herself and the world. I asked her what her secret was, and she said, 'I know life can be cruel, but I'm lucky. I thank God for what I have and enjoy every day.' It's all about perspective.\n\nThe other conversation was with a girl my age who wanted to kill herself because her boyfriend had left her two days ago. She thought life was over.

In my opinion, facts are just as important as ideas and concepts.\n\nFirst, ideas and concepts need facts to exist. You can't separate them. For example, when learning about force in physics, students need to do experiments to understand that there are different kinds of forces everywhere. If a teacher just draws a symbol and says, 'This is force,' they will confuse the students.\n\nSecond, students need to know both ideas and concepts and detailed facts to pass exams. For example, in a biology exam, students need to remember specific examples of animals to describe how they reproduce. I don't think anyone can write down everything the teacher wants without knowing the facts. Even if some exams allow students to bring books, remembering the facts saves time.\n\nThird, knowing facts can help students get a good job. For example, I study computer science, which involves a lot of programming. Mathematical concepts and ideas help me learn computer science theories. But when I looked for a job, I realized that knowing facts, like computer parameters, really helped me get a job as a programmer.\n\nIn conclusion, while ideas and concepts are important, facts are just as important for students."}

Small acts of kindness, like helping an elderly person cross the road, are also ways to serve the community. I believe that any work, paid or unpaid, done with good intentions counts as helping our community.\n\nUnfortunately, many young people today do not spend enough time helping their communities. I know some young people who have never done any volunteer work. They are not interested in helping others, not even their family and friends. Since they only think about themselves, they will not help the community.\n\nMany educated young people feel they should help their communities, but they get distracted. Peer pressure, new technology, media, and pop culture teach them to focus on themselves and live a happy, materialistic life. It's a shame, because many young people are led away from their civic responsibility. No matter how much their parents tell them to help, it's hard if they have many distractions.\n\nSome young people do help their communities by doing community service. However, they often do it for the wrong reasons. Even if they're not getting paid, they might be doing it for points, a good resume, or an award. If they're only looking for rewards, they won't help as much as they could. Their desire to help will also fade quickly.\n\nIn some cases, it's understandable that young people choose other activities over service. Students should prioritize their studies, and young people should have some freedom to pursue their interests.

I have mixed feelings about this question.\n\nOn one hand, it might seem like young people enjoy life more if you look from the outside. This is because they live life more actively. They try new things, have fun, and make their own experiences to develop their personality. For example, students like to go to parties or play soccer at the beach because they know they won't have the chance to do that later in life.\n\nOn the other hand, older people have a lot of experience. They don't feel pressure to act like young people anymore. I think they also had an exciting life when they were young. But as they get older, things like family, health, and financial security become more important. So, in my view, they enjoy life in a different way. They get satisfaction from taking a healthy walk in the park or having tea with their husband or wife at a nice restaurant. Unfortunately, people who observe from outside might get the wrong idea that older people don't enjoy life.\n\nIn the end, I think neither young nor old people enjoy life more.

If you don't sell enough, people won't trust your product, and you won't make money. Without money, you can't produce goods, and your company will eventually close.\n\nLook at big companies like Coca-cola.

From my experience, I think people were generally happier as kids. They lived life freely, without worrying about what might happen.\n\nFirst, I think kids are happier than adults because they don't care about material things. They live life without thinking about the consequences. They can do what they want, and they follow their hearts. People say that adults are driven by money and interest, but kids are guided by happiness and pleasure. For example, a young boy doesn't care about what his mom is doing. But his mom has to take care of him and protect him from harm.\n\nWe can also say that kids are healthy, which means they can live life without worrying about money, jobs, and other problems. They spend most of their time playing with friends without distractions.\n\nFrom my experience, I can say that being a child is the best time of your life. You don't have to worry about anything except playing outside. You're not stressed about your future or the world around you. But saying adults don't enjoy their lives is wrong; it's just a matter of priority, and you have less to think about."}

I believe this because success rarely comes without taking risks in life. Today, we live in a competitive world, and to succeed, we need to try new things.\n\nTo succeed, we often try new ways. We think these ways will bring us success, and we take risks. I think that if people only do what they're good at, they can achieve some success, but they won't reach the highest levels.\n\nEveryone has their own idea of success, and it depends on how much risk they're willing to take. For some, success means being happy and at peace. For others, it means achieving great things and being the best. They're willing to take more risks to get there.\n\nFor example, in cricket, a batsman needs to take risks to score quickly. Sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesn't. It all depends on whether someone is willing to take risks to succeed. I don't think you can achieve success without taking risks.\n\nI often wonder if success always requires taking risks. Is it possible to succeed without taking risks? I haven't found the answer yet, but maybe I'll figure it out when I achieve success."}

I've noticed that people are becoming less friendly with their neighbors. That's why I think we should spend more time helping our communities.\n\nBut how? Many young people today don't have time for their communities because they're too busy with homework, activities, and entertainment. They don't spend much time in their neighborhoods, so they don't interact with their neighbors. They might read about community service in school, but they don't do it. When you ask them why, they say, 'I don't have time.'\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to give young people more free time. Schools should let out earlier so young people can spend more time in their communities. Teachers should give less homework on weekends so students can do community service. Parents should not make their kids do too many activities or go to extra classes. If we don't make these changes, schools will actually teach young people to ignore their communities.\n\nSome people might say that young people will just play video games with their extra time. But I think that if people feel connected to their community, they'll try to make it better. The government and schools can help by promoting community service and social responsibility.\n\nIt's everyone's job to get young people involved in community service again. We shouldn't just blame young people for being lazy. I hope that one day, we can rebuild the strong bonds between neighbors."}

I believe it's essential to know about the things around us. Studying only one subject is not enough in today's world. For instance, to become a doctor, a student must take science classes like biology, chemistry, physics, and math, as well as elective classes like politics, economics, and humanities, to understand how things work.\n\nAs an engineering major, I've completed most of my science classes, but I've also taken classes like history, art, and sociology. These classes helped me understand the importance of other subjects. I learned about topics like politics, history, sociology, and world religion. I was surprised to find out how important these subjects are to understand our society. After taking these classes, my view of the people around me and the society we live in changed positively.\n\nSomeone who doesn't get to learn about other subjects will struggle to find a job because their knowledge is limited. In the modern world, companies look for people with knowledge of various fields, not just one field. For example, a computer programmer with a background in electronics has a better chance of getting hired than a programmer who only knows programming.\n\nIn my opinion, it's crucial for us to have knowledge of all aspects of life. In universities, it's common for students to have a double major, which means having a degree in two fields. They know what companies look for after graduation. Having knowledge of other fields is like having an extra tool. We should definitely have knowledge of other fields as well."}

If I were guiding a group, I'd take them to places like the 'Chenghuang' temple and the 'Wai Tan' bay. I could share with them the different aspects of local life, from food to communication.\n\nI remember a story from my country where a group of foreign travelers visited Hunan province. They stayed for three days without a guide and got caught in a flood caused by heavy rain. They fell sick, but luckily, a local guide helped them. She could communicate with them and found medicine made from a special plant. This shows how important it is to have a tour guide, even for safety reasons.\n\nFinally, I want to talk about Xu Xiakeng, a famous tour guide in ancient China. He said, 'Don't change your travel plans, but a guide will help.' This means that a tour guide is crucial for a group, as everyone who travels has the same dream."}

A person's actions are often shaped by their upbringing. Family, school, friends, and TV influence their personality. The values a young person learns early in life are often wrong. It's true people don't help their communities enough, but there aren't many good role models to follow. So, people become the best they can be. I know some people want to help others, but they're a small group. I'm very interested in this topic. In fact, I work at a call center that helps students from my country who have family problems and can't talk to anyone about them. That's why I think it's very important to encourage people to do the right thing and help those around us. The best way to start is with ourselves."}

They want to be happy. Older people usually don't have as much energy to do all the things young people can do. When you're old, you might not be as healthy, and you have to spend time going to the doctor, taking medicine, and staying at home more. You think carefully before going out.

{"file_id": "1101246.txt", "output_essay": "I don't completely agree with the idea that young people don't spend enough time helping their communities. Although some people think that young people are not as interested in social and political issues as they were in the 1960s, I believe that young people want to help their communities.\n\nIt's a fact that young people are aware of the problems in their communities because they are part of a family that belongs to the community. The more they live with their families, the more they help their communities. For example, in villages or minority groups, young people participate in charity programs, such as visiting hospitals and helping older community members. They even join non-governmental organizations to help their communities.\n\nOn the other hand, there are some current problems that make it hard for young people to stay connected with their communities and families. Globalization has created a global village where people have universal goals rather than community-focused ones. This makes it difficult to keep young people interested in their communities. However, this doesn't mean that young people don't want to help their communities.\n\nIn conclusion, we might think that young people prefer to focus on personal and global goals rather than community ones. But we shouldn't forget that they are also active in helping their communities and finding time to help, even when they're busy with school or work. In short, young people today do make time to help their communities, despite the challenges of their globalized and internet-based lives."}

What happens when there are so many cars that there's no room to move?\n\nThis is a scary thought. But in twenty years, there might be fewer cars on the road than there are today.\n\nIsn't that a big claim? Even if the world population stops growing, it will still be bigger than it is today. And with more money, more people will buy more cars.\n\nThat's true. But if we look at what's happening now, we might see fewer cars in the future.\n\nMany countries, especially those with a lot of people, are building better public transportation systems to fix city traffic. These systems are cheaper and make life better by reducing traffic jams and pollution. So, it's not surprising if more people start using public transportation.\n\nAlso, fuel prices will likely go up a lot in twenty years as oil runs out. In that case, it will be cheaper for people to use public transportation.\n\nWe can already see this happening in countries like India. The Delhi Metro is a success story. With good service at low prices, even rich people in Delhi prefer to use the Metro instead of their cars. Similar systems in cities like Indore and Bhopal are getting popular.\n\nSo, the day might come when you're the only one driving on the road!

First, if we visit a country where we don't speak the language, the tour guide can help us. They can assist with booking a hotel, finding restaurants, and more.\n\nAlso, a tour guide can teach us about the local culture and customs. This way, we can prepare for our trip and avoid mistakes.\n\nAnother reason is that we want to see many new places and learn about the history, art, and culture of the area. A professional tour guide can provide us with this information.\n\nIt's possible to do these things on our own, but it would take a lot of time. \n\nLastly, traveling with a group is safer than traveling alone.

But when we use them, they don't live up to our expectations, even though they're expensive. For example, soaps, shampoos, and cosmetics are often advertised to look amazing, making us want to buy them.\n\nThird, many ads use famous people to promote products, which has a big impact. People buy these products just because their favorite celebrity is in the ad.\n\nIn India, famous movie stars advertise drinks like Coke and Pepsi, and people start buying them, even though they contain harmful chemicals. After the media raised concerns, people started using them less.\n\nSometimes, ads make us think products are improved, even if they're not. The world has become very focused on advertising; a product can only be successful if it's advertised well.\n\nTo sum up, advertising is a powerful tool for manufacturers to sell their products, but it can come at the cost of people's trust in those products."}

On the other hand, I love German and American cars. They have many nice features and advanced technology. You can drive them fast and have a lot of control. One thing to note is that many German cars are too expensive. So, their ads are accurate and worth watching.\n\nLet's look at another example: food.

For example, different cultures use words like 'Uncle', 'father', and 'mother' to show not just family relationships but also social status, power, and economic situations.\n\nOn the other hand, 'facts' are examples or statements that can be easily understood. For example, 'Uncle' is a term used for a father's or mother's brother. But in some cultures, 'uncle' is also used for any older male, even if they're not related.\n\nIt's hard to separate ideas and concepts from facts because they're connected in many ways.\n\nWe can understand ideas and concepts by looking at the similarities between facts. For example, if we see that in a culture, all providers of food and security are called 'Father' or 'Mother', it means there's more to it than just family relationships. It's no coincidence that Hitler was called 'Fuhrer', which means 'father'.\n\nOnce we understand an idea or concept through facts, it helps us understand new facts. Whether they support or oppose the idea, it doesn't matter.\n\nSo, looking at facts is both the starting point and the way to develop concepts.\n\nIn this light, it's foolish to think that ideas and concepts are more important than facts. Both are equally important for real learning. Students need to understand concepts by learning facts. At the same time, concepts help us learn many facts. Both are necessary for complete learning."}

They teach important principles that can be used in life. Knowing about the environment can help an architect choose materials that won't harm the planet. This makes them a more knowledgeable person.\n\nIn school, we learn about many subjects like History and Geography. We might wonder, 'Why do I need to know this? Will it help me in the future?' But later in life, we realize that this knowledge is valuable. We might not need to know how high Mt. Everest is, but it's nice to remember such details. It gives us a sense of pride and happiness.\n\nFocusing on one subject can give us more time to master it and be better than others.

They use many trials and errors to create an ad that will impress buyers. When you see the ad, you might be tricked into thinking the product is better than it really is.\n\nThe psychological effect comes from how we think. Sometimes products look nice and glamorous just because we can't have them. We naturally want what we can't have. So, when you see an ad for a product you can't afford, you might want it even more.

As a result, we could apply that knowledge to other theories on our own.\n\nSecondly, the purpose of school education is to prepare us for life after school. If we understand ideas and concepts, we can apply them in real-life situations. This makes our time at school worthwhile. For example, I recently faced a complex problem at work, but my university math project helped me solve it.

They think good grades are more important than helping others. So, they spend more time studying for good grades than doing volunteer work. For example, my brother, a high school student, got angry when his school asked him to help his community. He thinks helping his community is a waste of time and does not improve his grades.\n\nAdditionally, young people do not feel connected to their local communities, so they are not willing to help. They think they can move to other places whenever they want. Therefore, they do not feel the need to help their local communities, sacrificing their own time. For instance, according to KBS, Korea's national broadcast station, 70% of young people do not feel the need to help their local society. When asked why, they said they did not feel connected to their communities.\n\nIn conclusion, young people do not spend enough time helping local communities to meet their needs.

Young movie stars, musicians, athletes, and others are winning the hearts of millions and making a lot of money. But it's great to see that many of them use their money to help others. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is a good example. Bill Gates started it when he was young, and he and his wife have done amazing work to help people with AIDS and cancer.\n\nIf we look at school kids, we see that helping others is becoming a natural part of who they are. They feel proud when they help those in need. Kids think they're heroes when they do something good for someone else. It's also great that schools and colleges are making community service important when they decide who to accept. This encourages young people to get involved. Even if they do it for personal reasons, it shows them how good it feels to help others and makes them want to do more.\n\nWe can look at many examples of engineers and doctors who graduated from top colleges and could make a lot of money.

For example, computer companies change their models often, even if the changes are small. They have to make their products look better than before, even if it's just a new look.\n\nIn conclusion, I agree that most ads make products seem better than they are. This is because companies need to advertise and people want \"better\" products. It's unlikely to change, so consumers need to be smart and not believe everything in ads."}
{"file_id": "1105857.txt", "output_essay": "People get an education because knowledge is the foundation for young adults. This means that complex math problems or historical dates are not directly applied to society.\n\nIf I had to choose between understanding ideas and concepts or learning facts, I would choose to understand ideas and concepts.\n\nThere are two reasons why I agree with this statement.\n\nFirst, when you focus on understanding ideas and concepts, you can learn faster and easier. This is because learning becomes fun and interesting when you try to understand things for yourself. For example, I noticed that I got high grades in subjects where I understood the concepts well. On the other hand, I got low grades in subjects that I found boring. This shows that understanding is more important than just learning facts.\n\nSecond, the ideas and concepts you understand stay with you for a longer time. I still remember the math formulas I learned in high school because I understood them well. When you understand ideas and concepts, you can apply them to other areas, and they stay with you even as you get older.\n\nIn summary, understanding ideas and concepts is more important than just learning facts. It helps you learn faster with a positive attitude, and you can apply it to other areas. Based on my high school experience, I strongly agree with this statement."}

When I see older people, they're usually sitting on a bench with their dog, watching others walk by. But their idea of fun is different, more impressive and emotional. I think they might not have as much fun as I do, but they enjoy life more than I do.\n\nWhen I visited my grandparents, I tried to figure out what they did all day. They went to bed earlier than I did, and they didn't watch as much TV as I did. When I tried to teach them how to use the computer, they didn't understand, and I gave up. Then, I realized that their idea of fun was different from mine. When it was my bedtime, my grandmother was still awake, watching TV dramas. I asked her what made her happy, and she said it was seeing me and my mom have a good day and hearing us laugh. She said she was happy with her life and wouldn't regret it, even if she died the next day.\n\nIn conclusion, I don't understand how older people enjoy life, but what my grandmother said touched my heart. I believe that older people enjoy life more than younger kids like me who only know how to play video games."}
{"file_id": "1105047.txt", "output_essay": "There are different views on what is more important for students to learn: facts or ideas. If I had to choose, I would say it's more important to learn to understand ideas. I will explain why I think this is true and how ideas and facts are connected.\n\nAs a student and young researcher, I care about this topic a lot. I think it's more important to understand ideas because facts can be learned outside of school. For example, in my research on the gentrification of Harlem, I'm more interested in understanding the whole process than in learning facts and details. It's important to understand concepts like class, place, and territory. I believe schools should teach students to think for themselves and give them the tools to understand and solve problems.\n\nHowever, I also think that saying ideas are more important than facts is a problem. How can you understand an idea if you don't know some facts to put it in context? Even if you can learn facts in different ways, you still need them. For example, if I don't know how many people are affected by gentrification or how much rents have increased, how can I understand what's happening in the neighborhood? I think ideas and facts are connected, and you need both to really understand something.\n\nIn conclusion, while understanding ideas is more important in theory, it's not that simple in reality. To really understand an idea, you need to know the context and the facts."}

To do this, they make the product seem better than it really is. Today, the image of a product is more important than what it can actually do.\n\nAdvertisements tell us what kind of person we are. The things we buy say something about us. For example, a Diet Coke is not just a drink to quench our thirst. It's a drink that makes us look attractive, thin, and like we know how to live well. Even the brand on our pencil says something about us because of how ads show it. We can seem hardworking, determined, or even rebellious.\n\nI agree that ads make products seem better than they are. They change what a product does into a sign of who we are and our status. So, they're not just selling the product, but also the message it sends.

It helps students understand real life, discuss different topics, argue about issues, and improve themselves.\n\nKnowing many subjects also helps students explore different fields and choose the right major.\n\nI believe that learning about many subjects, especially in the first and second years, helps students understand what's happening in the world.\n\nStudents who study education, social studies, politics, arts, and math can understand their country's and society's problems better. They have more ideas than students who only study one subject.\n\nMost students can't make the right career choice in their first year because they don't have enough knowledge and experience.\n\nFor example, when I was in my first year, I had to choose my career without knowing much. If I had learned about many subjects, I might have chosen differently. At least I would have known if my choice was right for me.\n\nIn conclusion, I think it's better to learn about many subjects before focusing on one.

They know life is tough, so they learn every day to improve.\n\nI agree with this because I have personal experience. After I graduated, I looked for a good career with a high salary. I found a good job in a company in my country. I got a good salary, but I asked myself, is it enough to reach my goal? No, because I had to save money for my wedding, buy a house, a car, and pay for the future. Then, I decided to join the stock market.

First, students won't be able to confirm if what they know is true, which can make them less interested in the subject. Second, they won't be able to apply their knowledge in real-life situations, which is the main purpose of learning. Therefore, learning facts is more important than understanding ideas and concepts.\n\nWhen students only learn ideas and concepts from others, they might not find them interesting because they don't see how they work. If they don't experience facts for themselves, they might doubt if the ideas and concepts are true. This lack of experience can make them less interested in learning, which affects their learning habits negatively.\n\nStudents who don't have the skills to apply their knowledge in real-life situations often lack experience. As they grow up, they need to have a lot of knowledge and experience to know how to use their knowledge in different situations.

It's hard to change the industry's structure in just twenty years. Scientists and engineers are working to improve cars using modern technology. More efficient and eco-friendly cars are emerging. The pollution caused by cars will likely decrease significantly in the near future.\n\nSome people think new vehicles will replace cars. There might be alternatives, like mass transportation, in the near future. However, I don't think this will lead to fewer cars.

It seems to me that young people are especially guilty of this. However, I don't blame them directly. They should have learned about helping others in elementary school. Families should also take care of this issue.\n\nMy first point is that you shouldn't wait until you have money to help your community. Young people think helping others is a waste of time. But it's not their fault. Their families don't talk to them about the importance of helping others. Teachers and schools don't encourage them to help either. For example, when I was in high school, my teacher encouraged us to visit the elderly home. We also planted trees in the forest every month. But the school stopped these activities because they cost too much. I believe young people don't understand the benefits of helping their communities.\n\nAnother reason young people don't help is that their schoolwork is too busy. They have to study and pass their classes. These responsibilities stress them out. However, they can help in their free time. I believe most young people spend their time playing video games, chatting online, or following celebrities. They can join a helping organization instead.\n\nIn summary, I agree that young people don't help their communities enough. But it's not entirely their fault.

{"file_id": "1102427.txt", "output_essay": "Today, travel agencies offer tourists various travel programs with a tour guide. These programs are convenient because we don't have to plan our own schedules, and we have a guide and a reserved bus. However, I don't think traveling with a guide is the best way to travel.\n\nFirstly, we can't have as much fun planning our trip if we use a guided program. I learned how important and fun it is to plan my own trip when I went to Europe last summer with two friends. We met often to decide where to go, what to eat, and what to buy. I think we had an equally exciting time planning our trip as we did during the actual trip. With a guided tour, we can't make our own unique choices.\n\nAdditionally, we might be limited by the group's decisions and behavior even if we have different ideas. For example, we might get to choose what to eat, but we have to follow the majority's choice. It's sad that we can't try the exotic foods we want when traveling abroad. We also can't use public transportation because of the reserved bus. I found it interesting to use foreign subways, trains, and buses during my trip. I would have missed that experience if I had traveled with a guide.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe traveling with a guide is not the best way to travel. We can have more interesting and exciting moments when we plan our own trip. We can also do what we want, go where we want, and take risks when we travel alone. We can experience small things that locals do, like using public transportation and walking around. These are the advantages of traveling alone."}

When you're with friends, you want to spend time together and do what you want, not follow a schedule. In a big group, people often want to see different things, and arguments can happen. One way to avoid this is to let each person do their own thing and meet up later. This way, everyone gets some time to themselves and can refresh. The biggest reason I think it's better to travel without a tour guide is that it takes away from social and cultural experiences. Exploring a new city on your own is a unique experience that a tour guide can't provide.

Most ads have their own style, but my brain always notices the color first. Even if the product isn't great, I often buy it because of the color.\n\nThe second reason is sizes. When we shop online, we can't see the size of the product. This can be a problem when buying big things like refrigerators or cars. Online shopping is often cheaper, but it can be a shock when we get the product.\n\nThe third reason is words. Words can change how we feel. For example, a vintage shop had 100 clothes left. The owner was confused because only 1 or 2 clothes sold each day. Then, he made a poster that said: \"Only 50 clothes left!!\" This worked, and all the clothes were sold in one day. Like this, words are very important in ads.\n\nThe last reason is people's feelings, or personality. On TV, famous people advertise many products.

Sometimes, this can be cheating when false information is given or unreliable promises are made. Companies should tell the truth about their products' advantages, features, and services. They should present them in an attractive way without lying or cheating. One way to do this is to list the materials used to make the product. If the materials are good, the company can say so. Another way is to show the effort that goes into making a product and the planning that makes it perfect. Some ads use cultural ideas to attract customers. For example, they might use a traditional saying as a logo. Another fair way to advertise is to study what customers like and use that to sell the product. For instance, packing toys in bright boxes can attract kids. Manufacturers around the world are giving their products attractive names, but this is not manipulating customers.

Apple even changed their name from \"Apple Computer\" to just \"Apple\" to show they were moving into the entertainment business. Today, Apple sells not just computers but also music players, phones, and other products and services. \n\nThis shows that being innovative and taking risks can lead to long-term success, while doing the same old thing can lead to failure."}

There are some reasons why I think young people enjoy life more than older people do.\n\nFirst, young people have a lot of energy. They like to play sports, travel, and work. They can do many things. Even when they're tired, they keep going without resting enough. If they sleep well, they're fine the next day.\n\nAlso, most young people don't have serious health problems. Many older people have health issues, even if they've lived a healthy life. As people get older, it's natural to have health problems. Most young people don't have these problems.\n\nAnother reason is that young people and older people live differently. When I visited a retirement home, the activity director said it would be helpful if I could visit often. This would help them escape boredom. They usually stay at home because it's hard for them to go out alone. So, if they don't have outside activities, they spend their time watching TV on the sofa. Young people, on the other hand, can go anywhere and anytime they want. They can choose how they spend their day, but older people can't.\n\nThese reasons show that young people tend to enjoy life more than older people do. Young people have advantages that let them enjoy life more, so they should make the most of it. If young people help older people have fun, older people will have a better life than they used to."}

It was a special experience for me because I got to spend time with people who really needed me. I didn't do anything big; I just talked to them and gave them attention. It may not have seemed like much, but it meant a lot to them.\n\nI also like spending time with my elderly neighbor who lives next door. She's often alone, so my boyfriend and I visit her sometimes. If she needs something, we go to the store for her. I try to help her even when I don't have a lot of time, and she always appreciates it.\n\nAnother way to help people is to look after kids. In high school, I used to babysit some kids at my church in the afternoons. Their parents worked during the day, so they would stay with me and my friends. We helped them with their homework or played games with them.\n\nIn the end, I think young people do spend a lot of time helping others, even when life gets busy. They take care of others, and I believe that's very important."}

A tour guide has all the knowledge about a place and can share it with us.\n\nTraveling alone doesn't achieve the purpose of traveling. We want to explore new places, but we don't know where to go or what to do. A tour guide shows us the right places and tells us things we wouldn't know otherwise.

Although it may not seem clear right now, with car sales rising each year, many factors will lead people to use public transportation more and more.\n\nOne reason is pollution. Another is the lack of space. People are also becoming more aware of the problems with cars. With the price of gas going up and up, people are starting to see their cars as a burden. It's unlikely that gas prices will go down, since fossil fuels are limited.\n\nCars that run on alternative energy sources, like fuel cells and solar power, are not yet affordable. All these factors suggest that people will turn to public transportation as a solution. It's not only cheaper but also safer than driving a car.\n\nThe growing population in cities is causing a big problem with traffic and parking. People are tired of wasting time in traffic jams and parking lines. They're realizing that if most people use public transportation, it would be better for everyone in terms of space and time.\n\nBicycles are becoming popular again for many reasons, including health. In fact, many people in China ride their bikes to work every day.\n\nSo, it seems that the idea of having a car for everyone may not happen.

The older people around me are saying the same thing. But I do not agree with them. In my opinion, young people want to help charity, but they do not have enough time because life is very busy nowadays. Young people have a lot of work to do, but they still find time to help their communities. For example, they visit their families during celebrations. If they can, they give to poor people. Last night, I saw a TV show where many people gave money to a charity to plant trees. Most of the people who gave money were young. Actually, there were no older people there. This is an important point. Many people say young people are not doing enough, but maybe older people are not doing enough either. There is an old saying from the Hittites that shows older people have always complained about young people. People in the future may also complain about young people. But this does not mean young people are not helping. In conclusion, young people today do give enough time to their communities, even though they have a lot of work to do.

You can live without meeting people face-to-face or leaving your house. Many young people think their community is too small, so they use the internet to feel like they're part of something big and important. They don't care if their neighbor needs help or if their town is clean. They think they're above all that.\n\nFor example, I read about a new way of life in Japan where people don't have personal relationships unless it's online. They break away from their families and friends and live alone. They use the internet for everything - work, shopping, making friends, and doing everyday things.\n\nHearing about things like this, I hope that in the future, young people will help their communities - maybe online communities - but the main idea is to be part of something."}

Young people are also lazier than they used to be, and they see helping the community as work, which they don't enjoy. This might be because of the pressure to do well in school, which feels like a requirement rather than a choice.\n\nSecond, the world is becoming more competitive and interesting, so young people are focusing on their studies and other activities instead of helping their communities. They have goals like getting into good universities or enjoying life, and I've never met a young person who wants to spend their time helping others. As a result, few young people feel they should help their communities.\n\nIn conclusion, young people don't help their communities because it's not fun and they have more important things to do.

Traveling with a group is also more fun than traveling alone. You can meet new people, make friends, and enjoy your time. It's also cheaper to travel with a group than to travel alone.

Recent events show communities fighting each other, so there's no unity.

Additionally, some of these concepts can be harmful.

But with a group and a guide, the trip is more enjoyable and successful. The guide explains things briefly and interestingly, making the tour more knowledgeable.\n\nTours often involve long journeys, day and night.

Traveling with a group and a guide means they can help each other and make the trip a success.\n\nDuring the journey, people face many problems like food and shelter. But with a group, they can help each other with these issues. If the vehicle breaks down, they can have a good time with their friends while they wait. They can pass the time happily and make unforgettable memories.\n\nFor example, engineering students on an industrial tour, like visiting Tata Motors in India, benefit from traveling with a group. They can share their knowledge with each other and see things more interestingly. Similarly, office staff can improve their industry by visiting other industries with their teammates and a guide.

TV ads are the most effective way to convince us to buy a product. We can see people using the product, which makes it more appealing. Written ads in newspapers are less effective because they're not interactive.\n\nSecond, ads make products seem better than they really are. For example, a frozen pizza ad shows a hot, savory pizza. But when we buy it, it's just a normal frozen pizza, not a homemade one.\n\nThird, ads lure us into buying products.

For instance, toothpaste that claims to make our teeth white as snow, or soap that promises to fix all teenage skin problems.\n\nIn conclusion, ads make products seem better than they really are.

I think this is a good solution because it has been shown to work.\n\nMany governments also support public transportation. In some countries, like France, the cost of using the subway is very low. I would rather take the bus or subway than drive my car. On the other hand, the cost of getting a driver's license has increased a lot in recent years. As a result, people are more likely to use public transportation.\n\nHowever, some countries like India and China are not ready to reduce their car production. Their economy depends on it. So, environmental issues are not their top priority. Although they know cars pollute, they are not taking action to solve the problem.\n\nMany steps have been taken to address this issue.

This is crucial because the ultimate goal of university education is to develop independent thinking. For instance, when students start learning, they need a teacher's guidance. But later on, they must solve problems by themselves.

With so much information available, scientists need to focus on one area to make a meaningful contribution.

For example, scientists are building on Einstein's Relativity Theory, but they've spent their whole lives studying that subject. To study science professionally, you need to specialize in a specific topic.\n\nSecond, you need to have a broad understanding of many fields to work on a specific topic because scientific fields are connected and depend on each other. While it's true that you need to cover many general topics before you can specialize, academic subjects are now so complex that you can't afford to spread your effort too thin. In fact, most education systems are designed this way: you take introductory courses in many subjects, and then you specialize in one area for graduate studies and research.\n\nIn conclusion, the question of whether to have broad knowledge or to specialize in one subject is important. While both approaches have advantages, it seems that specialization is necessary in modern science due to its depth and complexity. Specialization is unavoidable, and every academic should pursue it, but not without understanding the basics of related subjects."}

This is important for everyone.\n\nWhen they face problems, friends can help sometimes, but parents may not be able to. This is what true friendship is about.

It's a fun way to spend time with friends. They're happy and enjoy themselves. In college, there are competitions, sports, and entertainment events where they can participate and have fun. They can also go on trips with friends or classmates.\n\nWhen exams come near, they should study hard and prepare well. If they're struggling, their friends can help them out. Older people can't do these things. As they age, they have to be careful about what they eat and take medicine daily.

If their new venture doesn't work out, they still have the gains from their past successes. This means they have less to lose than someone who could lose everything by trying new things.\n\nSecond, the more successful you are, the more you want to achieve. You know that what you've done so far won't get you more success, so you need to find new ways to do things. These new ways often come with bigger risks, but they can also lead to bigger rewards. If you're someone who likes taking risks, you won't stop after your first success. You'll keep looking for more.\n\nThird, and most importantly, experience helps you overcome fear. If you've taken a risk and succeeded, you've taken a big step. You've shown yourself that you can do it, and that makes it easier to do it again. You can't predict every risk, but you know how to deal with unexpected things. This means you're less afraid of them.\n\nThese reasons show that you can't achieve great success without taking great risks, and that's why I agree with the statement."}

Employers also expect their employees to have basic knowledge of current events, politics, and economics.\n\nSo, it's clear that it's important to know about more than one topic. However, students need to focus on one subject to compete with others in the job market. They need to know as much as possible about that subject and stay up to date with the latest developments.\n\nMoreover, having only general knowledge can be dangerous in some cases. For example, a doctor who only knows a little about medicine can be a big risk.\n\nThe service sector also relies on people being experts in specific areas. Nobody can know everything about every subject, and that's why we need professionals.\n\nIn conclusion, students should specialize in one subject and also learn as much as they can about other subjects.

In my opinion, instead of increasing pollution by adding more cars, we should reduce the number of cars. We can replace them with big buses and trains. This will provide easier, cheaper, and faster transportation for workers and the government. To use the train, people will buy tickets to travel from one place to another.

In my opinion, being in a group means you're no longer in control of your time. Unless you're willing to impose your ideas on others, you can't do what you want. You have to respect others' wishes and stay within the group's plans. It's also annoying to listen to someone complaining all day because they don't like the schedule.\n\nAnother issue is that the tour is already planned, so there's no room for sudden changes or unexpected visits. This can make the trip less exciting. If the tour company provides poor service or the guide lacks knowledge, your experience can be disappointing and frustrating. Some tour companies and guides also take you to places where they have partnerships, so you're encouraged to buy things from those places. I dislike this practice because it feels like they're controlling me.\n\nMy advice is to choose a tour company carefully. Read reviews and ask friends to find a company that fits your needs and wishes. As for the group, my suggestion is to go with the flow and focus on what makes you happy. Try to ignore any small annoyances."}

Second, cars are comfortable to use. Another important point is that there is no good alternative.\n\nMany people need cars to get to their jobs. My parents, for example, can only get to work by car because public transportation is not convenient for them.\n\nIn big cities, public transportation is not always available. In smaller cities, it may not exist at all, and biking is not an option. So, people need cars.\n\nI don't see why this will change in the next twenty years. Having a car is usually the fastest and most comfortable way to get around. People like the convenience, so they won't give it up easily.\n\nAnyone who has owned a car knows how nice it is. I don't think people will change their minds about this in the future.\n\nWe also don't have a better way to travel. The car industry provides many jobs, and a decrease in car sales would hurt many people. The oil industry is also very powerful and wants people to keep buying oil.\n\nMany people depend on these jobs, and I don't think politicians can change this. Even though the population in some countries is decreasing slightly, I still think many cars will be sold in the future.\n\nIt would be good for the environment if there were fewer cars, but I don't think that will happen in the next twenty years because of the need for cars and the lack of alternatives."}

{"file_id": "1115860.txt", "output_essay": "There is a lot of talk about young people today. The question is, do they spend enough time helping their communities? In my opinion, they don't. In the past, young people were more involved in their communities. Now, there are many things that distract them.\n\nFirst, many young people waste time on computers. Computers were meant to be helpful, but they have become toys or game machines. No one has stopped this because games are a big business. For example, young people could use computers and the internet to learn about their country and its place in the world. This would make them more interested in their communities.\n\nSecond, I think young people don't take their school lessons seriously enough. Schools teach important lessons about communities, like history and geography. Everyone should know their country's history. Geography is also important for helping the community. Schools teach people to love their country, after their family. These are well-known facts, but people don't take them seriously. They think of school as a playground.\n\nYoung people are like diamonds. They need to be shaped and guided. If they are not taught to help their community, they won't be able to do it. So, if a young person doesn't help their community, it's also their family's fault."}
{"file_id": "1114626.txt", "output_essay": "I completely agree that the best way to travel is with a tour guide. My opinion is based on several reasons.\n\nFirst, traveling is about exploring a new place and seeing its attractions. To do this, you need a local guide who knows what they're doing. They can take you to popular tourist spots, like beautiful scenery and natural wonders.\n\nFor example, I went to Egypt with my family and we had a great tour guide. She showed us amazing places, like the Pyramids, Sphinx, and museums in Giza. We even learned about hieroglyphs. Having a local guide is perfect because they want to show you their town and make you love it.\n\nSecond, a tour guide can help you avoid trouble. They often have security guards who know how to handle problems that can make tourists unhappy or uncomfortable, like getting lost, dealing with beggars, or even being in danger.\n\nThat's why I think tour guides are necessary. They can help you have a great trip and avoid giving a place a bad name because you didn't see the best it has to offer."}
{"file_id": "1118568.txt", "output_essay": "There are many benefits to knowing a little about many subjects. These subjects are connected, and if students only learn one area, they might not fully understand other subjects. In my opinion, it's better to have a broad knowledge of many subjects than to specialize in just one.\n\nSome subjects require knowledge of other subjects. Without this, students won't fully understand the material or know how to find the answers. For example, students need to know math before they can use it in an accounting class. On the other hand, having broad knowledge helps people understand what they read in the news and share their opinions on various topics. If people only focus on their area, they'll miss out on meeting new friends.\n\nSpecializing in one area can be good for a person's future career because they'll have a deep understanding of their field. In fact, after graduation, people can gain more specific knowledge on the job. This is better than learning it in school, so they don't need to focus on it. If students focus on one subject in university, they'll miss out on learning about other areas."}

To make it happen, you need to work hard, and that makes you a stronger person.\n\nSecond, trying new things gives you a new point of view and more knowledge, which helps you become more successful. For example, I took a big risk by joining my high school cheerleading team. I used to be very shy and didn't like doing things in front of others, but cheerleading gave me the courage to be myself in front of a crowd. The practices were tough, and that made me a stronger person.\n\nThird, trying new things lets you meet different people, learn from them, and get a new perspective.\n\nThese are the reasons I agree with this statement."}
{"file_id": "1114229.txt", "output_essay": "I completely agree that traveling in a group is better than traveling alone with a guide. Today, there are more safety concerns than ever before. So, it's a smart decision to travel in a group.\n\nFor example, when you visit a new town or country and don't know much about it, it's better to travel in a group. This way, you're less likely to get confused. You might face many difficulties in a new place, like finding a place to stay, eat, and communicating with locals. Traveling in a group with a guide is a good option.\n\nA guide is familiar with the local language and culture, which helps a lot. They can tell you about the places you're visiting, making your trip more enjoyable. Plus, it's cheaper to travel with a group because everyone shares the cost.\n\nExploring a new place alone can be risky. You might encounter small security problems, like someone stealing your purse at a train station. But if you're in a group, thieves are less likely to target you. You can also ask your group members for help if something happens.\n\nTraveling alone in a new place is always risky. You need to be very careful with yourself and your belongings. On the other hand, traveling in a group keeps you safe from these small problems.\n\nIn conclusion, traveling in a group with a guide is a good idea. It makes you safer and allows you to enjoy your journey."}
{"file_id": "1111103.txt", "output_essay": "I completely agree that understanding ideas and concepts is more important for students than learning facts.\n\nIn my opinion, understanding ideas and concepts is crucial for students. To understand a topic, like physical science, we need to know the basic concepts and ideas. For example, to understand light, we need to know the laws of reflection and refraction. This helps us to think for ourselves and understand the topic better.\n\nFrom a student's perspective, it's essential to be clear about the concepts and ideas first. This helps us to generate our own thoughts and ideas about the topic. This technique boosts our confidence and morale.\n\nOn the other hand, if we focus too much on finding facts, we may fail most of the time. This failure can lead to negative feelings and a negative attitude, which can affect our future. Facts are important, but we can learn them later. At a student's age, we should focus on learning concepts.\n\nTeachers also agree that concept-building is more important. When we're in class, our teachers stress more on understanding concepts than finding facts. I believe that concepts are essential for students to think critically and make good judgments.\n\nIn conclusion, concepts are what make students clear about a topic and able to think critically. They help us to generate ideas, get things done, and succeed academically and professionally."}

But after thinking about it, I realized that it's sadly true that many don't.\n\nYoung people are often too busy with their own lives to care about others. They focus on what they think is fun or cool, and it's hard to get them interested in other things.\n\nWe can see this in how we communicate with our families. We use email and instant messaging even with our parents and siblings. This means we have less face-to-face interaction. So, it's no surprise that many young people don't help their communities.\n\nI think the main problem is that many young people don't know how to help. They might feel they have nothing special to offer. But if we show them that they can make a difference, I think more young people will find joy in helping their communities.\n\nYoung people have a lot of energy and enthusiasm. They can come up with creative ways to help their communities. They can do simple things like tutoring younger kids, visiting old people, or organizing events for the whole community.\n\nI agree that many young people don't help their communities, but I believe they can. They just need to put their devices down and take the time to help. Instead of telling them what to do, we should show them by doing it ourselves. If we get the whole community involved in a project that everyone likes, I think we can make a difference."}

I have several reasons for this.\n\nFirst, trying new things makes people more well-rounded. For example, when I was in junior high, I didn't like studying subjects like history, art, and music. I had never been to museums or concert halls. But when I got to university, I decided to give them a try. As a result, I became a person who can talk to anyone. This shows that trying new things makes people more well-rounded.\n\nSecond, people can find what they're best at by trying new things. For instance, four years ago, I applied for a new project at my company that I wasn't sure I could do. I had been a salesperson for five years, but I tried working in the production field of a computer company. I did well because I knew what our clients wanted from our products. If I hadn't tried something new, I wouldn't have succeeded in the job.\n\nSo, I definitely agree that trying new things and taking risks, rather than doing what we know well, is what makes people successful."}

This subway will let you reach any place in the city in just a few minutes.

In 20 years, science will have made a lot of progress. Scientists might develop flying cars that can build their own tracks, using space wisely.\n\nThere might also be advanced motorcycles that are safe and secure, replacing cars.

They can't combine two problems to find a solution. If they don't know what 'add' means, they can't say one plus one equals two.\n\nSecond, knowing why something is true shows how the facts fit together. Students always want to know the reasons behind what they see. Just learning the answers is not enough.

For example, you might learn from a past mistake or wrong decision.\n\nLet me share a personal experience. In 2007, I hurt my knee during a physical education class at school. We were playing kickball, and I slipped on the court floor. It took me a long time to recover, and the doctor told me not to play sports again. But I didn't listen and started playing basketball as soon as I could. I even joined my school's Varsity Girls Basketball Team. Now the season is over, and I'm glad I took the risk. If I got hurt again, I wouldn't regret it because I learned a lesson: to listen to my parents and doctor.\n\nAnother example is when I joined my school's chess club. I had never played chess before, but I learned a lot about logical thinking. I enjoy playing chess, even outside of the club, and I'm proud I took the risk and joined.\n\nSome people love seafood, while others hate it. I think it's a matter of choice and experience. If you're raised eating something, you're more likely to enjoy it. I love seafood and Japanese food, especially sushi. My friends and I eat sushi every week. One of my friends had never tried sushi, but I convinced her to try it. Now she loves it, and we go to our favorite Japanese restaurant together every week.\n\nExperience is something that happens once and can be used many times.

Older people, on the other hand, cannot enjoy life in the same way. Young people can have fun even when doing everyday tasks. But older people often create stress for themselves while doing their jobs. Being healthy is important. If you're fit and fine, you can live life to the fullest. But older people often have health problems that stop them from enjoying life.\n\nI have a lot of respect for my grand aunt, who lives on our street. I've been watching her since I was in the 5th grade. She was very active and alert back then. She had a small problem with diabetes, but she didn't let it stop her. Now, things have changed. Most of the time, she can't even walk properly. She's suffering from painful health problems. Whenever I see her, I realize how great it is to be young. Young people can easily overcome most health problems because their bodies work properly.\n\nAnother reason older people are not enthusiastic about life is 'Negativity'. Older people often stop working after the age of 55 or 60, which makes them lazy and prone to diseases. Young people are always ambitious about their careers and goals, which motivates them to enjoy life rather than see it as a burden.\n\nYoung people like to socialize and make friends to go out with. Older people prefer to be alone. My grand aunt used to love parties and get-togethers. But now, she dislikes crowds and prefers to live alone. Young people are free to live life with enthusiasm.

I wanted to visit Sanjusangen temple, but it wasn't on the tour plan. So, I couldn't go.\n\nSecond, on a group tour, you usually don't have enough time to look around. You need time to understand the history of a place. When I went to Todaiji temple on my school trip, I didn't have time to read about the temple or the statues. I also think that when you walk around a place or town, you might find good things you wouldn't find on a group tour. For example, you might meet kind people or find delicious food. When I traveled to Tokyo alone, I got lost. But people helped me, and that was a great experience."}

Whether it's the best way to travel or not depends on many things.\n\nImagine you're a busy worker and you want to take a vacation. You have a week or two and you plan to go somewhere. Most people want comfort in this situation and they want to see the main sights. In this case, a guided tour is the best option: the tour company will take care of everything - all you have to do is enjoy. The guide will tell you what most travelers want to know, and you don't need to read a book to learn about the sights. You don't have to worry about the risks and uncertainties of traveling alone.\n\nBut traveling with a group and a guide also has some limitations. If you want adventure or a personal experience, it can be frustrating. I experienced this when I visited a Turkic tombstone in rural Mongolia with a group of tourists. The tombstone was amazing, and I wanted to try to read the inscription on it. But we only had two hours, and I had to leave with the group because the others didn't share my interest. I felt frustrated and decided that I would go back alone someday. This shows the downside of guided travel - you can't decide where to go or how long to stay. You can't fully experience the place because it's a group experience, not just yours.\n\nPersonally, I prefer to travel alone if I have enough time.

I believe there are many benefits to young people doing community work, and they should invest more time in it.\n\nOne clear benefit is that communities save money. If many young people help the elderly, tutor younger kids, and clean public areas, the community can use that money for other important things.\n\nAnother benefit is that when young people work together on meaningful tasks, they are less likely to do things that harm their communities. This includes petty crimes and vandalism.\n\nLastly, the young people who do community work also benefit. At first, I didn't realize this, but after doing community service, I saw the world in a different way. I learned a lot from talking to and helping elderly and disabled people. I felt I benefited from the experiences of an old man who lived through two wars or the unique perspective of a blind teenage boy on issues like love and dating. And in doing community work, you meet many new people."}

The guide took us to places we didn't want to visit, and he chose an expensive hotel because he got a commission from the hotel.

There are two reasons for this: trying new things can lead to success, and new things often have problems that need to be fixed for us to grow.\n\nFirst, trying new things can help us make progress and develop new technology. For example, when people were trying to develop space travel, they had many failed launches. But they kept trying and eventually succeeded. This shows that trying new things and taking risks can lead to success.\n\nSecond, if we do the same things all the time, we won't grow. For example, if you learn something in school but don't use it, it's useless. People naturally want to learn new things and use what they already know.

There are some examples that might seem to prove the opposite, but I believe they are not typical. A young person is usually healthier and more athletic than an older person. They also have fewer responsibilities. When you have fewer things to worry about, life becomes more enjoyable. Fewer responsibilities mean fewer worries. Another reason is that young people are physically fit. As people get older, they have trouble doing simple things like riding a bike or running. When you can't do basic things, you can't do more complicated tasks. Health is also important. Nobody likes going to the pharmacy or hospital. Older people have to take care of their bodies all the time, taking medicine or getting treatments. Even if you're not at that point yet, you know it will come sooner or later. But a healthy body is not enough; a healthy mind is also important. It's a fact that as people get older, their mental abilities start to decline. This affects their whole life, but let's focus on the mind. Even activities that don't need physical strength, like playing chess or doing crosswords, become harder. These are problems that most young people don't have.

My dad taught me things I didn't learn in school. For example, my school didn't teach me why water forms around a cold glass. I was curious, and my dad told me the answer. I want to do the same for my kids.\n\nAlso, knowing many things helps me get a job. Let's say I took geometry, biology, and psychology classes in college.

If I couldn't be a geometry teacher, I'd have nothing to do.\n\nFinally, I can try out many subjects and then pick one to focus on. I'll learn and try out many subjects, and then I'll have a good idea which ones I like. For example, let's say I got really interested in biology.

I think the most interesting part of traveling is experiencing different ways of life and values. And you can only do that by making your own choices.\n\nFirst, traveling with a guide can make it easy to get information about the country you're visiting. You don't need to buy a guidebook or research online before you go. The guide will tell you everything you want to know, like good restaurants, fun theme parks, and beautiful sights. But without a guide, you have to find all this out for yourself, which helps you understand the place better.\n\nSecond, to really experience different ways of life, you need to meet local people. But on a guided tour, you don't get much chance to do that. The guide plans most of your time, so you don't have much free time. And when you're with a big group of people from your own country, it's harder to meet locals."}

Trying new things helps people discover new sides of themselves.\n\nWhen I was in South Korea, I was a good student. I studied hard to get good grades in middle school. I always got A's in Korean classes. I loved studying Korean literature and writing creative stories and poems.\n\nOne day, my dad suggested I study in America. He thought I could learn about a new culture and language. I was worried when I heard his idea. I thought I could only learn Korean. Moving to America seemed too hard for me. But I thought about the good things I could get from America. I could learn a new language and experience Western culture.\n\nAfter three months, I decided to leave South Korea. I took a risk and went to America. I was ready to challenge myself. When I first got to Dallas, I was amazed by the size of my high school. There were many great students and teachers. It was hard for me to follow the classes, but I didn't give up. I studied after school and tried to talk to students from different countries. This helped me improve my English.\n\nI studied hard, and now I'm very happy with myself. I'm getting good grades at school, and I made many friends. I'm also learning Spanish at school. Things that seemed impossible are happening now. Taking risks and making changes made me a better person. I think I made a good decision. Coming to America gave me opportunities for my future.\n\nI'm not going to stop now. I'm planning to learn about journalism and photography. These are things I've never studied before. I think taking risks and trying new things helped me grow. I learned a lot from new experiences, and I'm happy with it. I'll keep learning, and I'm confident this will make me a successful person in the future."}
{"file_id": "1116071.txt", "output_essay": "I agree that young people enjoy life more than older people. Some people may disagree, but I have three reasons to support this idea. These reasons are health, knowledge, and transportation.\n\nFirst, I think young people are healthier than older people. I remember playing on the beach with my family. My cousins and I were running, swimming, and having a lot of fun. But then my aunt called us to come out because my grandfather had fainted. This shows that older people often have health problems that stop them from enjoying life.\n\nSecond, young people know more about fun places to go than older people. Most people my age know about many entertaining places. Older people often don't know where to go because they didn't grow up with the same things we have today. For example, my friend's grandparents wanted to go out one day, but they didn't know where to go. They had to ask my friend for help.\n\nThird, young people have better transportation options. Many older people can't drive because they didn't learn how when they were young. Today, most university students can drive, but older people didn't have that chance. Young people can also use buses, subways, and trains easily. Older people often need to sit down, but public transportation doesn't always have enough seats.\n\nIn conclusion, I think young people can enjoy life more than older people. This doesn't mean all older people are the same, but many of them face these challenges. I think it's better for young people to enjoy life now and for older people to enjoy a quieter, more relaxing life later."}

They don't focus on the outcome of their work, but on the effort they put in. This is what makes them special. If they don't try new things and stick to what they're used to, they won't be successful.\n\nFor example, a biologist might start researching a particular species. They conduct experiments, make hypotheses, and keep going until they succeed. They go on expeditions, have adventures, and study the behavior of different animals. It's a tough journey that takes a long time, but if their conclusions are right, they're successful. However, they don't stop there. They keep researching and trying to learn more.\n\nThe same is true for a business owner. A successful businessperson doesn't just stick to one product. They experiment and launch new products. If the product is a hit, they're successful. If not, they try to learn from it and move on.\n\nSuccess isn't about doing the same job every day. We should try new things and experiment because there's still so much to learn. Even if we're not successful, we can still learn from our mistakes and gain knowledge in different areas."}

Today, older people have many opportunities to stay active and healthy.

{"file_id": "1116768.txt", "output_essay": "I think most ads make products seem better than they are. I only buy products I've seen on TV.\n\nWhen a new product comes out, it needs to be advertised. If no one knows about it, no one will buy it. Ads help people recognize a product, and if it's good, they'll use it regularly.\n\nBig brands spend a lot of money on ads. This shows how important it is to advertise a product. Ads have been around for a long time - even ancient people used them, like carvings on stones.\n\nYou can't know if a product is good until you try it. Even if a product has a lot of ads, if it's not good, people won't buy it. The product itself has to be good, or ads won't help. For example, my dad bought a car after seeing an ad, but it turned out to be faulty. He told his friends not to buy it, and the company didn't do well in India.\n\nToday, ads are a big business. Companies hire famous people to promote their products. Kids are influenced by this - if their favorite star promotes a product, they'll want to buy it. Every industry needs ads to promote their products. For example, movie stars promote their movies, and models promote cars. Even malls and other businesses create hype for their products. This shows that ads help products reach people.\n\nYou can only know if a product is good or not after trying it.

{"file_id": "1118901.txt", "output_essay": "Many successful people in history were willing to try new things and take risks. But does that mean all successful people do so? I don't think so. I think successful people are those who are the best in their field. If someone can do one thing better than others, they will be successful. From this point of view, successful people don't always have to try new things and take risks.\n\nWe often see someone who tries something new and succeeds, so we say successful people always try new things and take risks. But I think that's too simple. We only see the successful ones, not the ones who fail. Trying new things and taking risks also means there's a high chance of failure. That's why many people prefer to focus on what they already know and work hard to beat their rivals.\n\nJust trying new things is not enough. We need to spend more time and energy to make them better. And making them better is often harder and more complicated. If someone is only willing to find or invent something new but not willing to improve it, they won't succeed. On the other hand, if someone is willing to work hard to find ways to improve, they are more likely to succeed than the original inventor.\n\nTake Japan as an example. Americans invented cars, but they didn't spend time to improve them. The Japanese spent a lot of time and money to improve cars. Now, Japan is the biggest car-producing country.\n\nSo, I think the key to success is not trying new things, but being willing to work hard."}

In the past, young people in Korea were very helpful. They built houses and fixed things, which was hard work. They did it without hesitation. But today, young people do not care about their communities. They have different attitudes now.\n\nAnother reason is that young people are too busy to help their communities. In Korea, students have a lot of schoolwork. They go to school at 7 am and come back at midnight. They have no time to help their communities. In the past, there were more people who were not students, and schoolwork was not as hard.\n\nSome young people want to help their communities, like taking care of elderly people or children. However, in Korea, parents do not want their children to help their communities. They want their children to focus on studying for university instead.\n\nConsidering all these factors, people are becoming more selfish, not just young people but also their parents and adults.

However, I believe traveling with a tour guide is better because it's safer and saves time.\n\nFirst, traveling with a group and a tour guide is safer. The guide knows the area well and can warn us about dangerous places. We're also safer in a group. We're less likely to get lost, robbed, or meet troublemakers. For example, when I traveled to Hong Kong alone, I got lost because I couldn't speak Chinese. I was scared and cried.\n\nIn addition, traveling with a tour guide saves time. We don't have to plan everything ourselves, like researching places to visit and booking hotels. The guide takes care of these things, so we can focus on enjoying our trip with the group. We can talk about our feelings and share experiences with each other. According to a 2007 study, 75% of people said they had a more enjoyable trip when they traveled with a guide. They said it was because they didn't have to worry about planning.\n\nFor these reasons, I think traveling with a group and a guide is better. It makes the trip more fun and safer. People should consider this before planning a solo trip."}

However, specializing in one subject is also good because it allows us to learn more about it. After thinking about these two options, I prefer to specialize in one subject.\n\nFirst, when we specialize, we can learn a lot about a subject and discover new things. This is only possible when we know a subject very well. For example, when I was in college, I learned about a new program in Java during my summer break. My teachers appreciated me a lot for this.\n\nSecond, when we specialize, we can find the problems in a subject and try to solve them. We can also try to reduce these problems. For instance, scientists who study the ozone layer try to reduce the harm to it. They are experts in their field and know how to reduce the harm.\n\nThird, only an expert in a subject knows everything about it.

You need someone to help you find places, shops, restaurants, and hotels. A tour guide who knows the country well can help you with these things. Second, I think it's safer to travel with a guide. I remember when my family and I went to Italy, we met some bad people. If we had a guide, it would have been easier for us. Third, we travel to relax and take a break from work and responsibilities. If you want to do that, you should avoid problems like asking for directions or not speaking the language. You might ask silly questions like 'Where is this hotel?' or 'What's the best restaurant?' A tour guide can help you with these things. In short, I prefer to travel with a guide to avoid these problems."}
{"file_id": "1120829.txt", "output_essay": "Teaching, learning, and studying are all about methods. During our school and college years, we've had the chance to experience many teaching methods from our professors. Some teachers think it's more important for students to understand ideas and concepts, while others believe that learning facts is what matters.\n\nIn lectures, professors try to teach their students a certain idea or concept. Lectures can be boring, but they're necessary. What will students remember on the day of their exam from their lectures? What are they supposed to remember? I think making studying enjoyable starts with understanding the material. Once we understand it, it makes sense in our heads.\n\nUnderstanding a lesson starts with understanding the ideas and concepts, which are the main parts of the material. But to understand these ideas and concepts, especially complex ones, it's helpful to start by learning the facts.\n\nLearning the facts makes it easier to understand the ideas and concepts. For example, if a student wants to understand Einstein's concept of relativity, a big idea in physics, it's better to start with the facts. Once the student understands the facts about relativity, they can better understand the concept as a whole.\n\nSo, I believe it's equally important to understand ideas and concepts and to learn facts. The two are connected and help us understand the material better."}

{"file_id": "1120555.txt", "output_essay": "Today, almost every product is advertised to consumers. These ads introduce products and try to convince people to buy them. While ads are good for marketing and introducing new products, they can also create wrong or exaggerated expectations about a product for three main reasons: ads are a marketing tool, people have different expectations, and ads can manipulate our emotions.\n\nFirst, ads are designed to make people want something, but they often focus on selling rather than informing. For example, ads are created to increase sales and profits, not just to let people know a product exists. The growing number of ad agencies and the money spent on ads show that making money is the main goal. As a result, the consumer's happiness is often ignored.\n\nSecond, people want different things from a product. One person may want a product to last a long time, while another may want a lower price. Ads should appeal to all potential buyers, but they often hide negative features. This can lead to buyer disappointment.\n\nThird, ads use techniques that can influence our emotions and make us buy things. For instance, when we see someone enjoying a product, we may feel hungry or thirsty. This can make us buy something without thinking, which can lead to disappointment.\n\nAdvertising plays a big role in producing and marketing new products. Every company uses ads to sell their products. It's clear that ads work, or companies wouldn't use them.

People are wondering if it's faster to walk or drive. This is a serious concern. Every problem has a solution, but that solution often creates another problem.\n\nI agree that there will be fewer cars in twenty years. To solve this problem, some cities are promoting mass transit. They are making it cheaper and encouraging people to carpool. They are also building subways, trains, and monorails to reduce the number of cars on the road. In twenty years, people will not rely on cars as much.\n\nLondon is a good example of a city that uses mass transit well. People can take the subway instead of driving, which reduces traffic. Other countries will likely follow London's example.\n\nTokyo is another city that uses mass transit, but not as well. They have underground stations, but the system cannot handle many people. This solves the problem of fewer cars, but creates another problem of crowded stations.\n\nThese examples show that there will be fewer cars in twenty years, but that doesn't solve the main problem. The problem is not the cars, but the people driving them. If mass transit is used well, people will be distributed evenly among different routes. But if it's not used well, the problem will just move to another place. There will be fewer cars, but it's up to each country to solve the main problem."}

First, middle-class families have a better life now. Second, families are smaller.\n\nSpain has changed a lot in thirty-five years. We used to have many poor people, but now most people are middle-class. This means there are fewer differences between rich and poor people. As a result, young people do not feel the need to help their community as much.\n\nAnother big change in Spain is that families are much smaller now. Thirty years ago, most families had many children. Today, most families have only one child. Parents often overprotect their only child, and this child grows up to be less concerned about helping others.\n\nThese are just my opinions, and there may be other reasons why young people do not help their community. However, I think these two reasons are the most important. It is also important to remember that there are exceptions - some young people do help their communities a lot."}

I believe in people's intelligence and think we're all capable of inventing something that will make us rich.

You're willing to do whatever it takes to make it happen. You're very motivated, and that's why you succeed. This motivation shows your ambition, and that's how you'll make it. For example, Beatrix Potter became famous because she believed in her idea and had enough motivation to keep going despite refusals and disapproval from her father.\n\nOnce you've succeeded, you want to feel that way again. You feel like nothing can stop you. If you try something new or invent something, it's because you don't like doing the same thing over and over. It's more exciting to invent something and think about how to make it real.\n\nFinally, you try new things because it makes you successful. You don't want to be like everyone else; you want to stand out. Even if you're good at something, you need to try new things or find a new way to do it. This shows you don't rely on what you already know. It shows you want to improve yourself.

I'm convinced that understanding ideas is more important than memorizing facts. I'll explain this in two parts.\n\nFirst, ideas are more important because facts are just examples of those ideas. In class, teachers often use examples to help us understand the main idea. For instance, to understand how music calms people, we might learn that hospitals often play classical or jazz music. But the music itself isn't the point - it's just a way to understand something bigger.\n\nWhen we form our own opinions, we use the ideas we've learned to think. This is why it's more important to learn ideas than facts. Using our previous example, we might think about the importance of music in the world. We could conclude that music calms people, and without it, there might be more wars, making most people sad. This shows me why ideas are important.\n\nAs I've shown, to learn better, we should focus more on ideas than facts. But we still need facts to understand those ideas.

In my opinion, it's better to specialize in one subject. I'll explain why in the following paragraphs.\n\nFirst, specializing in one subject saves time and energy. We can't do everything well because we don't have enough time. If we focus on one subject, we can spend enough time on it and be successful. For example, a computer science student who studies art won't have time to study their major well, which will affect their grades. So, it's better to focus on one subject to make the most of our time.\n\nSecond, specializing in one subject helps us get a good job in the future. We'll find a job we like if we focus on one subject we're interested in. Then, we'll have the knowledge we need to get the job. For example, if we study biology, we'll learn a lot about it and can talk about it in a job interview. This will make a good impression on the manager, and we'll get the job easily.\n\nIt's true that knowing many subjects makes us knowledgeable. But if we don't know much about each subject, it can cause problems in the future.

They try to solve them. They have passion and motivation to achieve their goals and dreams. They always look for new things and never stop trying. They work hard to reach their goals. Successful people are different from others. They may not have the best environment or situation, but they make time to achieve their goals. They read books and learn from others' experiences. This helps them try new things, even if it's risky. Others' experiences also give them new opportunities. It's not easy to try new things because they have to adapt and overcome problems. So, successful people never give up and spend time to achieve their dreams and goals."}
{"file_id": "1122148.txt", "output_essay": "I think it's impossible for anyone to know everything, and being a 'Jack of all trades and master of none' is not ideal. In both professional and academic fields, specific knowledge is highly valued.\n\nIn many cases, specialized knowledge is essential. For example, in medicine, general doctors are important, but specialists like heart doctors or brain doctors are crucial for specific treatments.\n\nHaving too much general knowledge can make it superficial and not very helpful in solving complex problems. In science, for instance, a general understanding of biology is necessary, but a person who studies the classification of living things and a person who studies the physical properties of living things have different areas of expertise and can't help each other with their specific problems.\n\nThis doesn't mean general knowledge is not important. Applying knowledge from one subject to another requires understanding both subjects. For example, to apply math principles to biology, you need to know both subjects. However, it's better when two specialists, a biologist and a mathematician, work together.\n\nI also believe that our brains have limitations, and we should use them wisely. We should focus on solving problems in specific areas. Too much unnecessary information takes up space in our memory and is rarely used.\n\nSo, having some general knowledge is good, but having only general knowledge is not useful. To apply knowledge in a useful way, you need to specialize in a particular subject."}
{"file_id": "1118709.txt", "output_essay": "Today, colleges offer many programs for students. Students have different opinions about learning many subjects versus specializing in one. I think specializing in one subject can lead to great success.\n\nFirst, when you learn many things, you can't learn deeply. For example, in high school, I learned a lot, but I couldn't focus on one subject because there were too many topics. I couldn't see how they connected, so it didn't help me. I prefer to learn one subject, and it helps me focus.\n\nSecond, today we have experts in each field. If you know a little about many things but not much about one subject, you can't do much. Many people excel in their field and become experts. If you focus on one subject and learn a lot, you can help people who need you. But if you learn a little about many subjects, you don't get specific skills.\n\nLastly, we don't have time to learn everything. There are many subjects, and if you choose one, you should focus on it. For example, as a nursing student, I think about patient care and learn a lot about it. I don't have time to learn many subjects because I'm not perfect in one subject. One subject has a lot to learn, so I decided to focus on one. When I master nursing, I can improve my care skills. I'll be a better nurse when I graduate. I think focusing on one subject makes you an expert in your field.\n\nIn conclusion, there are many subjects in life. Everyone wants to learn everything, but we can't because each subject has a lot to learn. In my opinion, specializing in one subject is better than knowing a little about many subjects because you can learn a lot deeply."}

This is because they are too busy with their own lives and don't think about the community.\n\nYoung people, from school age to working adults, have their own problems. After a long day, they want to relax and watch TV. They rarely think about their community or even themselves.\n\nIn the past, our ancestors and grandparents cared about their family and community. Despite having limited resources, they made the most of it. They communicated and interacted with people in their society, unlike many people today who don't have time for their friends or relatives.\n\nI think people should learn about their society and the people around them. This way, they can see those who are struggling and make an effort to help them.\n\nI remember an experience from my college days. I saw a man who had an accident lying on the road, bleeding. No one stopped to help him because they were too busy. We all had to watch him die on the road. I think this should never happen again. Everyone should help their community in any way they can. This shows they care about others and are willing to help.\n\nFrom a young age, people should be taught about morals and society. Those who learn morals will never neglect their community. Everyone should take time to help their community.\n\nI've seen many older people who do a lot for their community. In my area, we didn't have medical services, so a group of 55-year-old residents came together and requested a hospital from our local authorities. They took a risk for the community, but young people were too busy with their careers and didn't care.\n\nI think every individual should do something for their society. This gives them self-satisfaction, which is the most important thing for a person."}

This means people only see the good side and are more likely to buy.\n\nSecond, many companies make similar products, which creates competition. To win, these companies try to make their products look better than others. They might even exaggerate some small advantages that aren't really there. However, big companies with good reputations are less likely to do this.\n\nThird, companies only pay for ads if they think they'll make more money. If the ad doesn't show how the product meets customers' needs, the company won't make an ad.\n\nLast, ads are designed to make products look better than they are.

People who succeed try new things and take risks because success gives them the energy to do more.\n\nWhen someone achieves their goal, they want to try new things and explore more in the same field. They also want to apply what they learned to other fields. For example, Sir Isaac Newton discovered gravity. If he had stopped there, many things would still be unknown today. Instead, he used his discovery in math, physics, and science. Imagine if he had stopped taking risks and looking for new ideas. There would be no progress.\n\nAnother great scientist is Einstein. He came up with the idea E = mc\u00b2 and the theory of relativity. He used these ideas in his daily life, and it amazed the world. These great men didn't stop after they succeeded. They used their success to find new things.\n\nIf someone who is successful doesn't want to explore their field, their success is not very important. Anyone can do what is already known, but only a few can use their success to discover new things. It's good to be smart and use your ideas in different ways, but to be successful, you need to use your ideas in many fields.\n\nSuccessful people always try to make new things and take risks. They never think of success as the end of their work. Success is not the end. If you keep trying and taking risks, you will benefit, even if you don't succeed every time."}

I see many ads on TV or in newspapers that make products seem perfect, but they're not. I think most ads make products seem better than they really are.\n\nWe see this kind of ad in all industries. Car, tech, or consumer goods - it doesn't matter. They all use ads to convince us to buy by highlighting some points, but not giving us all the details. For example, an ad for an MP3 player might say it has 1 GB of storage and a radio. But many people don't know that the radio doesn't work well everywhere, or how many songs they can store on it. Some people buy it without thinking, while others ask questions before buying.\n\nAnother trick is with prices. Ads show prices without taxes, and when you find a product you like, you're happy. But when you go to buy it, it's often too late to change your mind. So, you buy it.\n\nIt's clear that most ads make products seem better than they are. But if we make marketing classes more important and teach people about these tricks, we can prevent this. These classes should be required, not optional."}
{"file_id": "1126329.txt", "output_essay": "I agree that advertisements often exaggerate the quality of a product, sounding like a pushy salesperson. Many brands use aggressive marketing to compete with others and show how they're better. For example, the Walt Disney Company has been advertising a lot over the years through TV, the internet, movies, and mail. They repeat these ads many times, but they often sell a fantasy that's not true when you actually go to Walt Disney. They don't tell you about the long lines in the sun or waiting to eat at restaurants. This is a big mistake because the ad gets our attention and seems better than reality. This shows how people can be fooled by ads, and reality is different when they get to Walt Disney. Other ads, like food or diet plans, show people achieving their goals, but they don't tell you how much it costs. They manipulate numbers and sell dreams, taking money from customers who can't achieve their goals. In my opinion, people need to be smarter when they see an ad that impresses them. The advertisers just want their money, not their happiness. That's why it's called marketing."}

This is because we need to use ideas and concepts to analyze facts.\n\nUnderstanding ideas and concepts helps us analyze facts. Most school subjects are based on facts, but we won't fully understand them unless we know the ideas and concepts behind them.\n\nFor example, when studying the structure of an airplane, we learn facts about the plane. But if we also learn why certain materials are used and how they work together, we'll have a better understanding of how the plane flies efficiently.\n\nWe use aluminum instead of iron to make the plane's skeleton because it's lighter. This is an important concept to know.\n\nIn math, ideas and concepts are crucial for solving problems. We need to understand the idea behind a problem to find a solution. Just knowing the facts isn't enough.\n\nFinally, ideas and concepts are important in our life philosophy. While philosophy is based on facts, we need to understand the concepts behind them. For instance, getting married is a fact of life, but we need to understand the concepts and ideas behind it. We should get married not just because it's natural, but because humans are social and need a partner and family to be happy."}
{"file_id": "1115678.txt", "output_essay": "How can someone enjoy life? What do you need to enjoy life? Young people usually have fewer problems. When they're very young, they don't have much to worry about. Their parents take care of everything. They don't even think about things that might worry them. Worrying stops people from enjoying life, so young people enjoy life more than older people in that way.\n\nBut to really enjoy something, you need to be free of worries and appreciate what you're doing. Young people don't have much life experience, so they can't appreciate things as much as adults do. Someone once said, 'You don't know how good something is unless you've experienced something bad.' Older people have experienced bad things, so they know how to appreciate good things.\n\nEnjoying life also means achieving your dreams. This can be a certain lifestyle, having a family, a good job, or something material. Young people don't have access to certain things like a good job; they can't drive a car yet, and when they can, they usually can't afford their dream car. If they're really young, they might not even think about these things, so they won't miss them. But as they get older, they have all kinds of dreams, and many of them aren't fulfilled because they don't have the money, age, or knowledge. Older people, however, have had time to work towards their dreams. They're more likely to have achieved their most important dream.\n\nThis enjoyment can be stopped, though. This happens when older people look back and remember what they didn't achieve rather than what they did. Young people don't often look back that way. They remember the good things first.\n\nIn addition, young people are happy with very little. For example, when a child drops their ice cream, they cry. But as soon as they get a new one, they stop crying and are happy again. An adult might think about wasting money all day and let the bad occasion erase the good one.\n\nI can't agree or disagree with the statement as a whole. For me, it depends on the person's attitude. But if someone is looking forward and recognizing their achievements, then they enjoy their life more than anyone else."}

Ads often don't show the truth because of several reasons. I will explain some of these reasons from my point of view.\n\nFirst, companies exaggerate their products' benefits because of strong competition. Each company shows its product as the best in ads. When I was a kid, I was often disappointed with toys I got as gifts because they seemed bigger on TV.\n\nAnother issue is quality. The quality we get is often worse than what ads promise. For example, sports shoes don't last as long as I expect, considering the price.\n\nMoreover, customer service is often a problem. Ads focus on quality and responsibility, but it's hard to get a good response to our questions or complaints. I've had bad experiences with telecom companies' call centers, wasting time and money.\n\nAds also use tricks to grab our attention. On TV, we see beautiful people or strong music, so we focus on them instead of the product. Famous people, like actors or athletes, are also used in ads.\n\nIn summary, I don't believe what ads show because they make products seem more attractive than they are. Ads are often not true."}

There are many sides to this idea, so it's hard to give a simple answer.\n\nFor example, if you like playing football, you might not have fun if you're old. A young boy has more energy and can play for a long time, but an old man gets tired quickly.\n\nOn the other hand, if you like playing the guitar, your age doesn't matter. You can enjoy it whether you're 10 or 70 years old.\n\nMaybe young people enjoy life more because they have fewer worries. They're innocent and can have more fun.\n\nFor instance, a grown-up has many responsibilities and no free time, so a young child can do what they want and have fun. The grown-up has a lot of problems and can't enjoy life like their child.\n\nAnother important point is that older people often have more money. They can do what they want because they're rich. For example, if you're 20 and want to buy a yacht, you might not be able to afford it. You might have to wait until you're older.\n\nIn the end, I think the biggest issue is that older people often get sick. This is a big problem and makes me think that young people enjoy life more."}

In my opinion, the best way to travel is not to follow a large group.\n\nPeople often join a group because it makes them feel safe or because they want to fit in. But when it comes to traveling, this can be a problem. When you're with a group, you can't always do what you want. You have to follow the tour guide's plan, and this can be frustrating. You might not get to visit the places you want to see or do things at your own pace. This can ruin the whole point of traveling, which is to relax and have fun.\n\nSome people might say that a tour guide can give you good ideas and make your trip better. But we've all heard stories about tourists getting cheated or taken advantage of by tour guides. It's not that tourists are better at avoiding scams on their own, but it's even worse when you trust a tour guide and they take advantage of you.\n\nTraveling means different things to different people. Some people want to get away from the city, some want to explore new places, and some want to have exciting adventures. You can't do these things if you're following a tour guide who has to keep everyone together and on schedule.\n\nThere's no right or wrong way to travel, but we should be able to do what we want when we travel."}

In this essay, I will explain why I think this way.\n\nFirst, young people spend more time on entertainment like TV, video games, and sports. Young people are the main customers of the entertainment industry. Older people tend to focus on their own hobbies and don't like to interact with others. Also, older people don't have the energy to enjoy life as much because of their age. Young people, on the other hand, have plenty of energy to play outside and enjoy themselves. They like to play with each other and socialize.\n\nSecond, young people are more open to new and trendy things, which is important for enjoying life. For example, young people like playing with skateboards, which is a popular new sport. Older people are not comfortable with this sport because they worry about safety. So, older people tend to stick to simple and traditional games.\n\nAdditionally, most older people prefer to stay at home rather than go out. Young people, however, prefer outdoor activities. Outdoor activities are the main form of entertainment today. As a result, many older people who stay at home miss out on opportunities to enjoy life.\n\nIn conclusion, young people enjoy different types of entertainment and are more open to new things than older people. This is why I think young people enjoy life more."}

Some people think that most ads make products seem better than they really are, but others don't agree. I agree with the first opinion.\n\nFirst, ads use pictures and colors. For example, I ordered clothes online because they looked beautiful pink, which I like. But when I got the clothes, I was disappointed because they were an ugly pink that I don't like. So, ads can make products seem better than they really are.\n\nSecond, on TV shopping channels, the hosts introduce products. For example, my aunt watched a TV show about kimchi. The hosts ate the kimchi and said it was delicious. They also showed the kimchi in a nice way, so my aunt thought it looked good and ordered it. But when she ate the kimchi, it tasted bad.\n\nAdditionally, many companies show their products winning awards in ads, so we believe them and buy the products. But this may not be true.\n\nIn conclusion, based on these reasons and examples, I think that most ads make products seem better than they really are."}
{"file_id": "1122215.txt", "output_essay": "I strongly agree that traveling with a tour guide is the best way to travel. This is because it has many advantages over traveling without a guide.\n\nFirst, let's talk about traveling without a guide. When we travel on our own, we often rely on our own research to learn about a place. However, this research can be limited, and we may miss out on important information about the area. We may not know about hidden gems or the history and culture of the place.\n\nOn the other hand, traveling with a guide has many benefits. Guides have a lot of knowledge about the area and can share it with us. I personally experienced this when I traveled to the northern part of India with my college group. Our guide showed us around the Taj Mahal and told us about its history, culture, and significance. We were amazed by how little we knew about the monument before the guide's explanation.\n\nThe guide also showed us another beautiful monument near the Taj Mahal that we didn't know about. When we faced time constraints, our guide helped us plan our trip so we didn't miss anything. He even recommended good local food.\n\nThroughout the trip, we learned a lot of new things, including historical information about the places we visited. In conclusion, I believe that traveling with a guide is very helpful and informative. It's not possible to know everything about a place on our own, so having a guide can make a big difference."}

For example, a young couple may want to take a vacation to travel and enjoy their love and life, but they may not have enough money since they just started working. Also, taking time off may affect their career advancement. On the other hand, they have to take care of their parents or kids.\n\nMany young people lack entertainment facilities due to financial reasons or because they have to obey their sponsors.\n\nYoung people face a lot of pressure and do not have enough experience to handle problems. On the other hand, older people have many friends, colleagues, and family members who support and care for them. They have also gained properties and financial independence throughout their lives.\n\nHowever, some older people may have health issues, which are mostly manageable now. Older couples can enjoy themselves without worrying about others. They often believe that what happens, happens, and they do not worry much about the future.\n\nAn old man once said that life has three stages: the first thirty years, you have good health and a job, but not too much responsibility, and you have time for leisure and entertainment, but not enough money. The second thirty years, you have good health and money, but you have to work hard to succeed, and you do not have enough time. In the later years, you have time and money, but not good health.\n\nIn summary, I think I enjoyed my life when I was young because of friendship, passion, and love, and experiencing the joy of building a family.

This is not only a logical idea, but it's also supported by evidence from around the world. Some of the richest people in the world were ordinary people with great ideas. For example, Bill Gates decided to create a new tool, the personal computer, instead of improving existing ones. He took a big risk, but it paid off, and now he's remembered as a genius.\n\nSome people have also succeeded in bringing good ideas to other countries with different cultures. A good example is Starbucks coffee, which is now sold worldwide, even in China. The managers took a big risk, but it worked out. Although Chinese people traditionally drink tea, many young Chinese now drink Starbucks coffee to be like Americans.\n\nOn a smaller scale, we can all try taking risks to get what we want and be happier. For example, you can decide to study in the United States. At first, it will be tough because of the language and being away from family and friends. But if you stick with it and overcome the difficulties, you'll get a valuable degree from a great university, which will give you better job and income opportunities.\n\nIn conclusion, I think it's always worth trying new things and taking risks.

I think this is clear in many situations. For example, think about the stores we shop in, which are filled with colorful packaging. I'm sure we've all bought something just because it looked good on the outside. We can also think about TV ads, which show us products that seem like perfect solutions to our problems. But often, they only solve one problem: how to spend our money. The fashion industry is another example. We've seen many models who look healthy and happy, but later find out they have serious problems like anorexia. This happens a lot. The point is that society shows us a fake version of reality, hiding the truth behind advertisements and other things.

For instance, when I read fashion magazines, I see many attractive pages that promote products like cosmetics, clothes, watches, and perfumes.

The models make the products look fun to use, which attracts people and makes them want to buy. Sometimes, people forget that they don't look like the models. This is a mistake. After buying, people often feel the products aren't as good as they expected because they didn't really need them.\n\nAnother reason ads are appealing is their high quality. Companies try hard to make good ads to compete with others and get a bigger market share. Research shows that 90 percent of fashion companies think they should spend money and time on ads. For example, hiring a famous designer can cost 10 times more than an employee's monthly salary.\n\nAs a result, ads are sometimes better than the products themselves. That's why I agree that most ads seem better than the products they sell."}

We notice what stands out from the usual, something new and special. To be successful, you need to take risks. Oscar Wilde said that an idea that's not risky is not an idea at all. Let's look at some key points to prove this.\n\nFirst, we consider people successful when they achieve a special social status through their hard work. What makes someone successful varies from culture to culture, but it's always about being exceptional. Nobody thinks someone is successful just because they have a normal job. Success means finding new solutions and ideas.\n\nSecond, people only recognize success when it's visible. If something doesn't stand out from the norm, we can't tell the difference. Success is about being different and unique. It's about doing new things.\n\nThird, since success is about being different and new, it's also about taking risks. When you try something new, you can't be sure if people will like it or not. That's the risk you take. To stand out, you need to be new and different, and that means taking risks.\n\nIn conclusion, we've shown that success comes from being different, exceptional, and taking risks.

I agree with this idea and want to discuss it further.\n\nFirst, I want to talk about trying new things. When I was growing up, I heard stories about successful people like Edison and Nobel. They achieved their dreams by using their imagination to try new things. People always want new, interesting, and convenient things, so when someone invents something new, others will buy it and be happy. This can bring in more money and sometimes even fame. So, trying new things is a good way to be successful.\n\nThe second reason is about taking risks. Risks can be dangerous, but if we prepare, we can reduce them. When we create new things, there are always some risks involved. However, if we take care of ourselves and prepare for bad situations, we can reduce the damage when things go wrong.\n\nWe always want new things, and trying new things can be a shortcut to success, even if it involves some risks. Sometimes, overcoming difficult situations can make us important people. For these reasons, I believe that trying new things and taking risks can help us become successful people. It also makes us positive and thoughtful people."}
{"file_id": "1127395.txt", "output_essay": "People have created a way to leave home called traveling. Traveling is a fun option for you. However, it's not always what you want. You can travel with a group and a tour guide or with a group without a guide. I prefer to travel with a group and a guide because I can learn more and have a set schedule.\n\nThe first reason I like traveling with a guide is that I can learn about the new culture. The guide tells me lots of information about the place I'm visiting. For example, if I travel to South Africa, I would not understand anything without a guide.\n\nThe other reason I prefer a guide is that they plan my schedule. I don't waste any time. I take advantage of every opportunity. If I travel without a guide, I might not wake up early. A few years ago, I went to Cuzco in Peru without a guide. I didn't learn anything about the monument, and I regret it now. It was a waste of time.\n\nSo, whether you travel in a group or alone, try to get a guide and prepare your trip carefully. This way, you can enjoy it."}
{"file_id": "1126528.txt", "output_essay": "Traveling is very interesting to me, but people disagree on how to do it: alone or in a group. I don't agree with this idea, and I have four reasons why.\n\nFirst, I want to go wherever I want. It's helpful to have a tour guide, especially when I've never been to a place before. They can show me which areas to avoid. But on a guided tour, I have to go to places I don't want to visit. Planning my own trip is also important. Time is limited, and planning is the first step.\n\nSecond, traveling opens my eyes to new things. I've been to Brazil many times and met many people. I learned about their lives, thoughts, and likes. I like meeting new people, including Brazilians, and I want to talk to them. Traveling helps me make new friends, but this only happens when I travel alone.\n\nThird, traveling helps me think about who I am and who I want to be. At home, I don't get stimulated, and it's not good for my health. But in a new place, I can clear my mind and learn new things.\n\nLastly, I know some people like to travel with friends or family, but I don't find it interesting. When I'm with others, I can't think or enjoy things on my own.\n\nI want to travel alone every year and go wherever I want. I want to improve myself."}
{"file_id": "1127473.txt", "output_essay": "I think young people enjoy life more than older people. Young people are active and can travel, play sports, and attend parties. They spend time with friends and have few responsibilities.\n\nOlder people often have health problems. Some need medical care and can't leave their homes. They know their life is mostly over, which is not a happy thought. Many older people can't enjoy life, but some don't want to. I know healthy and wealthy older people who stay home and are sad.\n\nOn the other hand, young people are just starting their lives and must work hard to succeed. This struggle is not always fun. In school, they must study hard to get good jobs, and in university, it's the same. When they have free time, many waste it playing video games. Some young people are unhappy with society and live on the fringes.\n\nIn contrast, many healthy older people have a comfortable income or are retired. They can take luxurious trips and don't have to worry about success. Instead of school or career stress, older people can play with their grandkids or walk with friends. I think that's great.\n\nOlder people can look back and see what they've achieved. That can be very satisfying. Overall, I think both young and older people can enjoy life, but I believe older people do so more often."}
{"file_id": "1124369.txt", "output_essay": "Students understand ideas and concepts. They also learn facts. In my view, it's essential for students to understand ideas and concepts before learning facts. There are many reasons for this, which I'll explain with examples.\n\nUnderstanding ideas and concepts is crucial before learning facts. For instance, consider a chemistry lab experiment. Without knowing the idea behind the experiment, what would you do in the lab? If someone does the experiment without understanding the idea, accidents can happen. In a chemistry lab, we need to be careful. If we're not careful, the experiment will go wrong. For example, H2SO4 is a highly acidic substance. I remember a time in college when some students didn't understand the experiment and wanted to do it anyway. One of them added water to H2SO4, and it caused a big explosion. My teacher scolded him, but that's not the point. The point is that he did the experiment without knowing what he was doing, which led to bad results.\n\nTake another example: some countries conduct nuclear experiments. If we make a mistake, whether we know what we're doing or not, it can cause a big explosion. In such places, we need to understand the ideas and concepts; otherwise, we can't do anything. Nuclear energy is powerful, even more powerful than the sun's energy.\n\nMoreover, understanding ideas and concepts provides safety and detailed information about what students want to learn. If students learn about concepts and ideas, they understand the whole point of what they want to learn from facts. This way, nothing goes wrong when they apply what they've learned.\n\nSome people might learn facts without understanding the ideas and concepts, but that's not the same. In my view, we should understand ideas and concepts before trying to learn facts."}

This problem has been growing over the years. New technologies like the internet, mobile phones, TVs, DVDs, and computer games have changed people's goals and priorities. \n\nNowadays, teenagers prefer to watch DVDs or play with their phones instead of spending time in their communities. I think one reason for this is the education they receive from their parents and schools. It seems more important to know how to use the internet than to read books.\n\nAnother reason is that communities should offer activities that interest teenagers. For example, they could organize concerts, football games, or other sports events. They could also create a library with internet, books, CDs, and DVDs, or perform plays or go to the theater.\n\nIt's also important for young people to know more about their community and the environment. When they enjoy their community, they will be excited to help with any activity or project.\n\nIn conclusion, if a community offers a range of fun and new activities, young people will be happy to help make their community a better place."}

One reason is that young people know how to have fun. They go out with friends and laugh a lot. Older people used to know how to have fun, but now they have a lot of responsibilities. They think about work and worry about many things.\n\nYoung people enjoy life because they don't think about the future. They live in the moment. But older people can do that too. We often say that the best time of life is when you're retired.\n\nWhat about older people who travel and start living the life they want? I think middle-aged people enjoy life the least. They have too many things to remember, too many things to do, and too many things to worry about. Young people enjoy life because they don't have much to think about. They go to school, hang out with friends, and have relationships. They have some homework, but that's not so bad. They enjoy life because it's easy.\n\nIn the end, I think that even though young people have an easy life, many of them don't really enjoy it. Teenagers are often in a bad mood, complain a lot, and disagree with others. But what they're good at is not caring. Older people, even though they have a harder life, know how valuable life is."}

You won't be able to do new things, and technology wouldn't be as good as it is today.\n\nFor example, without scientists, we wouldn't have ways to study and learn in school. They learned and invented many theories by trying and experimenting.\n\nAnother example is business. If you want a good business, you need to try new ways and ideas to make it bigger and better. If people didn't try new things, technology wouldn't be as good as it is today. People would just do what they're used to and wouldn't get to experience new things.\n\nTechnology is getting better every day because of scientists and others who try to make new and improved things.\n\nI completely agree with this idea. Without trying, learning, and experiencing, nothing would have been invented, learned, or used today. People would just do what they're used to."}

And for those who have started families, it's even harder.\n\nFor example, I'm 27 and I finished my degree. Now I want to do a postgraduate program abroad to improve my skills and knowledge. To do that, I have to work many hours. I also have to worry about my apartment, bills, and rent. In a few years, I want to have a child.\n\nEven though things are tough, I wish I had time to help my community. But life moves so fast, I think it's impossible for now.\n\nIn my opinion, young people today have too many problems to help their communities. Maybe if things slow down, things will get better."}
{"file_id": "1132072.txt", "output_essay": "I agree that young people enjoy life more than older people. My main point is that young people have a lot of energy to do what they want. For example, if someone wants to play outdoor games, a young person can just go and play. But an older person can't do that easily because they have to think about their health restrictions. They might not have the energy to play games, so they have to settle for easier things like watching TV or having dinner with family.\n\nAnother reason I agree is that young people can travel easily. When friends plan a trip, it's easy for young people to handle problems like bad weather or walking long distances. But older people need help in these situations. They need to take their medicine when the weather changes, and they're not sure if their body can handle it.\n\nSo, young people can enjoy life more because they have the energy to do what they want. But older people can still find ways to enjoy their life. They had fun when they were young, and they can find new ways to have fun now."}

However, we need to weigh the pros and cons to make a decision.\n\nI believe it's crucial to learn several subjects to increase our general knowledge. Today, it's essential to be aware of various fields, such as politics, ecology, communication, and business. This requires knowledge of history, biology, and mathematics. If not, we won't care about important issues in our lives. That's why we need to gain a lot of knowledge in college.\n\nAfter learning many subjects, you can choose one that fits your personality, skills, and motivation. Then, you can express yourself better in that subject. If you weren't interested in other subjects, it's hard to think maturely and completely.\n\nIn conclusion, be open-minded and look around you, regardless of your specialty, to use a wide range of skills."}

In my view, young people are too busy with their own lives and don't care about the problems in their community. They think someone else will take care of these issues.\n\nThose who have a good life are the least concerned because their parents help them and solve their problems. They don't think about what will happen when they grow up and their parents are no longer there.\n\nI know this is a bad situation, but it's what our parents teach us. For example, when we litter and don't pick up our trash, or when someone vandalizes property with spray paint. These people don't think about the consequences; they do it because they want to.\n\nI wish young people would be more careful and think before they act. They need to know that the problems in society affect them too. I think politicians should create more programs for young people to help solve these problems.\n\nWith the help of the whole community, I believe our community can become a better place."}

But that doesn't mean we don't want to help. In the past, young people didn't do much for their communities, but that's changing. More and more young people are getting involved in helping others.\n\nThere are many organizations that help people in need.

Some organizations help women, and others fight against illegal prostitution.\n\nThere are many groups working to make our communities better, and more people are joining them. To sum up, I think more and more young people are helping others, even if we don't have as much time as we'd like. But we're making an effort to find time to help, and that makes us more human."}

I can play with others and understand the game well.

I need to focus on both.\n\nWe need to try out different subjects or sports before choosing one. We need to be sure about our decision.\n\nIt's the same with subjects. I can learn the basics of each, but I need to focus on one and prepare well.

I don't like traveling alone because I think it's more fun and informative to travel with friends. When you travel with friends, you can ask the tour guide many questions and get more information. I want to share an example from my own travel experience to show this.\n\nI'm a history student, and in my last year of college, I had to write a thesis about the Taj Mahal. I went to New Delhi, India, with three friends to see the monument. We hired a great tour guide who showed us around. We were amazed by the history, beauty, and effort that went into building the Taj Mahal. There were many areas we had never heard of before, and our guide told us about them. We asked the guide many questions, and I only asked about one-tenth of them. I realized that if I had traveled alone, I would have learned much less and gotten lower scores on my thesis.\n\nWhen we got back home, we added up our expenses and found that it was only 40% of what it would have cost if we had traveled alone. From this experience, I believe that traveling with a group and a tour guide not only helps you learn more about the place you visit but also saves you money and strengthens your friendships. You'll remember your travel experiences for the rest of your life."}
{"file_id": "1129154.txt", "output_essay": "I believe this statement reflects my thoughts and actions. I think it's essential to understand everything you're taught.\n\nThis is a debated topic, but I have a clear idea of what I think.\n\nOne reason I agree with this statement is that learning facts doesn't give you a sense of satisfaction. There's a famous quote by Ignatius of Loyola S.J. that says, \"Knowing doesn't satisfy the soul, but understanding and relating to things internally does.\" This quote is thought-provoking because when you learn a fact, you don't fully grasp its concept. For instance, in philosophy, you can know a philosopher's viewpoint, but if you don't understand it, you'll never know what they truly meant.\n\nAnother reason is that our brains tend to forget things we learn but don't understand. For example, you might forget what you learned in 9th grade when you're in 10th or 11th because you didn't fully understand it. On the other hand, if you learn something and understand it well, you'll remember it forever. Even if you forget it, you can recall it with a little thought and apply it to other areas of your life.\n\nLastly, I think people who only memorize facts without understanding them usually have fewer resources to succeed in life. This is because they lack understanding and interpretation of essential matters. In contrast, people who truly understand what they're taught can solve problems faster and think more originally."}

Famous people like Leonardo da Vinci were interested in many things. Also, knowing a little about many things can help you in your career. It doesn't mean you can't be an expert in one area.\n\nHaving an open mind and knowing a little about many things is a big advantage in today's fast-changing world. We need to be able to adapt to new situations. If we only know one thing, we might not see the whole picture and might not be able to handle changes.\n\nIt's okay to be very good at one thing, but it's not good to only know one thing.

In fact, most ads are for bad products.\n\nToday, ads are everywhere. You see them on TV, on your computer, and even on the street. But why are there so many ads? The answer is simple: companies want to sell their products and make money. All ads are created to make unsuccessful products successful.\n\nSo, why do companies advertise their products? Is it to make them famous? Maybe, but the main reason is to sell and make a profit. If a product is really good, it doesn't need to be advertised. I remember when I was young, I loved a certain brand of chocolate. I never saw an ad for it, but one day I did, and it said the product had changed. I bought it, but the price had gone up, and the packaging was fancier. That's the power of advertising: if a product is good, it doesn't need to be advertised.\n\nAds are very effective because they often offer something for free. I've seen people gather outside stores to get a free deal with a product. But what's the real reason for the free offer? Nothing is really free. There's always a catch, like a decrease in quality. My mom once bought vegetable oil because of an ad that said it was cheaper. But later, she found out the expiration date had already passed.\n\nSometimes, ads tell complete lies. Our favorite celebrities don't really use the products they advertise. They're just trying to sell more products.\n\nFrom my experience, I've often gotten bad products because of ads, so my advice is to not believe everything you see in an ad."}

There are two main ways they do this: changing the color of the product's packaging and changing its name to make it seem high-quality.\n\nFirst, ads change the color of the packaging to grab attention. Usually, dull colors make people think a product is old-fashioned, while bright colors make them think it's modern. For example, in Turkey, people prefer bright-colored pencils to dull ones. That's why many advertisers want manufacturers to make bright-looking pencils to boost sales.\n\nSecond, advertisers want manufacturers to change the product name to sell more. In Turkey, they often give a foreign name to the product instead of a Turkish one to trick people. This makes people think the product is high-quality because some Turkish products are not very good. There's a real example of this in Turkey. A spaghetti company changed its product name a few years ago and gave it an Italian name to make people think it's an Italian product. As a result, they sold more products. This is how they make their products seem better, even if they're not.\n\nIn short, many advertisers make products seem better using these tricks.

For example, when you want to buy a car, you look for specific information about the type of car you want and don't just follow the ad from a car company.\n\nSecondly, ads are not mainly used to influence customers' choices. Companies use ads to be the best seller. This is clear when you want a specific car and have a choice between multiple companies.\n\nSome people might say that young boys are easily influenced by ads. But this can be countered by the fact that they don't make their own purchases. When they want something, they ask their parents to buy it for them. And parents don't always give in to their children's desires because they know what's important for them.\n\nWhen considering the quality of products, we should think carefully.

Young people no longer ride motorcycles; instead, they drive small cars. Because of this, in many cities, you can't drive every day of the week. For example, in Bologna, you're not allowed to drive on Mondays from 8:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m.\n\nDriving is a huge problem, especially at certain times, because you waste a lot of time stuck in traffic. For instance, when you go to work, you might spend a long time in your car, and then you have to spend even more time looking for a parking spot.\n\nI hope that because of all these problems, things will change in twenty years.

I think young people do not spend enough time helping their communities. I will give some examples to explain why this is happening.\n\nFirst, young people spend more time in school than before. Students usually stay in university for four or five years, which is longer than in the past. Young people often say they are too busy to help others. Even at 20, we feel like we have too much to do. We have schoolwork, group projects, sports, and other activities, but we don't make time for anything else. However, we can find time to go to the movies or hang out with friends. For example, we would rather take a three-week vacation than spend one week helping a good cause. There must be another reason why young people don't care.\n\nSecond, we live in a society that focuses on individual success. Everyone thinks about themselves. Young people believe in God less than before, which could be a reason. There are not many religious events that bring people together to help others. But religion can be a good way to get people to work together for a good cause. This is all a result of the values and education we get from our society.\n\nToday, parents do not teach their children to share with others.\n\nIn short, I think it's unfair, but it's true: young people do not spend enough time helping their communities, but I'm sure..."}

When we know about many subjects, we can easily talk to people from different backgrounds because we won't be completely clueless about what they're saying.\n\nAnother reason we should know about different subjects is that we never know what challenges we might face in life. To handle difficult situations, we should have at least basic knowledge in every field. This helps us adapt to new situations and find ways to overcome them.\n\nIf we only know about one field, we might not be lucky enough to succeed in it. To keep our options open, we should know about many things in life. For example, a clerk who only knows how to enter data manually might lose his job if his company starts using computers. But if he's updated himself on new technology, he can easily learn to use computers and keep his job.\n\nThis example shows why it's important to stay informed about what's happening around us. As they say, 'a little knowledge can be dangerous.' So, I believe it's in our best interest to know about many fields, not just one."}

Instead, people can use the train, bus, or bicycle, which is easier and cheaper. The train is especially quick and affordable.

Once a kid understands addition, they can do many different addition problems.\n\nWhat I mean is that understanding a concept helps you understand many related facts.\n\nHowever, I think there's a risk in focusing too much on ideas: we might forget about reality. Reality is important because it's what we're trying to understand. If we don't connect ideas to reality, we're just speculating, which isn't helpful.\n\nI think we need a balance between understanding ideas and learning facts. A good way to teach a concept is to give examples from real life.

For example, I can help my friends if they need me, even if I have to study. If I care about my friends, I will help them in any way I can. But to do this, I have to give up some things I like to do, like playing video games or going to the mall. I think people who say young people don't help their communities only know selfish people who only think about themselves. In university, students spend a lot of time together. They attend classes, talk during breaks, have lunch together, and become like a family. In a family, if someone has a problem, the others help. This is what happens in university too. Helping each other makes it easier to pass exams and enjoy university life. Young people also help their families a lot. As they grow up, they take on more responsibility and realize that helping their parents is important. They can help in different ways, like working part-time to earn money or cleaning the house.

This is because many big companies have cut jobs due to slow economic growth and globalization, which often moves jobs to cheaper areas.\n\nOlder people are also affected by these job cuts. At the same time, European governments need to raise the retirement age to keep their social systems working.\n\nThis situation can cause frustration on both sides. When older people who want to work but can't, or who have worked for decades and are now retired, see young people hanging out and doing nothing, they might think young people have it easier.

They experienced World War II and had to work hard to rebuild their countries.\n\nYoung people in Europe are lucky to grow up in a safe and often wealthy environment.

This approach has been successful in Japan for a long time, so it's an important step in learning. Second, learning facts is necessary for having correct ideas. If students don't learn facts, it's unlikely they truly understand ideas and concepts.

These people have a hard time achieving success.\n\nTaking risks is important, but you also need to be smart about it. You need to think carefully about your plan. For example, if you want to start a business, you need to do your research. You need to see how your product will affect the market and make sure you have enough money. Starting a business takes a lot of courage because it might not work out.\n\nYou need to be brave and confident to succeed in this competitive world. If you fail, it's not the end. You should keep trying until you get it right. It's also important to learn from your mistakes so you don't make the same ones again. Failing once shouldn't stop you from trying new things."}

I think good ads should make products look efficient to influence consumers.\n\nAds for skin care products are very good at twisting the truth. They use models with perfect skin, regardless of the product. Then, they show the model using the product and telling the audience how much it helped her. It doesn't take long for the audience to believe it. The problem is that the product probably didn't help the model at all - she already had perfect skin. And that's not even counting the computer editing...\n\nHowever, I think we need to realize that the ad did its job. It put an idea in the consumer's mind, and sales will happen. That's what marketing is for: selling products. I think it's mostly the consumer's job to ignore ads. We know they're not true, so why do we believe them?\n\nDon't get me wrong: advertising is regulated, and it should follow the rules. There are laws that forbid lying or deceiving in ads. If a skin care product can really improve skin, it's up to the consumer to figure out what's real and what's exaggerated. As long as the ad doesn't promise the same results for everyone, the marketing firm is safe.\n\nI'll conclude by disagreeing with the opposite view: how can anyone disagree that ads make products seem better than they are? That's just how it is. To anyone who thinks ads tell the whole truth, I have a bridge to sell you..."}

They might not help their communities enough, but this could be because they don't have enough time or have different priorities.\n\nToday, young people are more focused on themselves because we live in a society that values individuals over communities. As a result, they spend their time on personal activities instead of helping others.\n\nFrom my own experience, I can say that I'm not interested in community activities. I've lived in several countries, and I've noticed that young people behave differently depending on where they live. For example, in Sweden, people are very independent, while in Spain, they are less independent. Spanish people might care more about their communities than Swedish people do. So, to understand the issue, we need to look at the specific context.\n\nSociety is responsible for this situation because it's built around individual needs. Rules are made to benefit individuals, making them the top priority. However, there are strong nationalistic movements in Europe that focus on communities. If European communities become stronger, it could change how young people think, and they might start helping their communities more.\n\nIn conclusion, I agree with the statement, but we need to consider some important factors. Young people behave differently depending on their country and culture, but overall, they don't spend enough time helping their communities."}

They use these things to make their lives more enjoyable.\n\nYoung people are excited about new technology and use it to have fun. Older people are not as familiar with these things. Because technology is changing fast, young people have more energy and can do what they want. They make friends in public places, attend parties, and think creatively by using new technology, which helps them enjoy life.\n\nOlder people often think they had more fun when they were younger. They want their children to enjoy life because they feel their own lives are almost over. As people get older, they often have health problems like heart issues, high blood pressure, and diabetes. The growth of industries and factories, as well as pollution, affects people's health and makes older people think they can't enjoy life anymore.\n\nIn my experience, older people also want to have fun and be part of social life."}

Lectures usually cover ideas, concepts, and facts that students need to learn and use. I believe that students should focus on understanding ideas and concepts rather than facts to be successful. Understanding ideas and concepts gives students lasting knowledge and a complete understanding of topics.\n\nWhen studying, students have two options: memorizing facts or understanding main ideas and concepts. If they choose to memorize, their knowledge will be lost soon. That's why understanding ideas and concepts is more useful than learning facts.\n\nAnother benefit of understanding ideas and concepts is that it gives students a complete understanding of the subject. Ideas and concepts are more meaningful than facts. Facts are often just specific cases or situations and have limited meaning. It's clear that ideas and concepts are more important for students.\n\nIn conclusion, it's up to students to decide whether to focus on ideas and concepts or not. The alternative is to memorize facts. Understanding ideas and concepts is more lasting and gives students a complete understanding. Considering the two benefits mentioned earlier, it's clear that ideas and concepts are important."}

This statement is true in some cases, but not in others, making it debatable. I will provide examples to support my point in this essay.\n\nThe term 'enjoyment of life' means different things to different people. Everyone tries to live their life in their own way. If 'enjoy' means partying, then young people might do it more often than older people. However, older people also celebrate and have fun.\n\nI agree that younger people have better conditions to enjoy their time. They are energetic, active, and enthusiastic. They enjoy playing sports, exploring new places, watching movies, going on picnics, dancing, and trying different foods. This is their way of enjoying life.\n\nIf we say that young people enjoy life more, it means older people are not enjoying life at all. But that's not true. Older people enjoyed the same things when they were young, but they lost interest over time and don't have the energy to do them continuously. Now, they enjoy life in different ways, like sitting in a chair, taking a sunbath, reading the newspaper, and giving advice to younger people. They might not be able to eat certain foods due to health issues, but they still enjoy them in secret. As leaders of the household, they have responsibilities to take care of. This is also a way of enjoying life, just differently.\n\nIn summary, this point is debatable and needs more research to reach a conclusion."}

I can go anywhere I want and stay as long as I want. If I want to go shopping, I don't have to ask anyone else. I can explore small shops and find new things. This means I have control over my trip.\n\nTraveling alone is also more exciting. For example, when I went to Italy, I stayed in a hostel and met new friends from other countries. We went to popular places, ate at restaurants, and visited parks and rivers together. We still keep in touch by email. I even went to a concert I didn't plan to attend, and it was amazing.\n\nThat's why I think traveling alone or with a friend is the best way to go."}

There are two reasons why.\n\nFirst, I think it's important to be adaptable. When you try new things, you can find solutions to problems. If you only use traditional ways, you might not solve the problem. For example, when I was a kid, my mom couldn't pick me up from school one day. She had to go to the hospital to see my sick grandmother. There were no cell phones, so my mom was worried. I decided to go to the library, where I met my brother. He took me home.\n\nSecond, you need to be brave. When you try new things, you have more chances to succeed.

{"file_id": "1135299.txt", "output_essay": "I strongly agree that young people enjoy life more than older people. Enjoyment is a sign of being fresh and young at heart. Age plays a big role in how much we enjoy life.\n\nOne main reason is that young people have fewer responsibilities and worries. They may still depend on their parents or have some support, which makes them feel free and adds to their fun. Older people, on the other hand, have families to take care of and their enjoyment is limited to their families and close friends. As people get older, they tend to feel more satisfied with life and their needs become simpler. They focus more on emotional support than enjoying life. For example, in some countries like India and Sri Lanka, older people find joy in spiritual activities and may even give up enjoying life altogether.\n\nAnother reason is that young people are generally healthier than older people. As we age, our bodies can't do everything we could do when we were young. For instance, young people can eat as much chocolate as they want, but older people can't.\n\nYoung people are also more adventurous and like to take challenges, make new friends, and expand their social circle. Older people tend to stick with their existing friends and don't mix as easily. Additionally, older people may have already enjoyed life when they were young, so they feel complete and don't have a strong desire to enjoy life anymore. Therefore, it's convincing to believe that young people enjoy life more than older people."}

This is because people do not talk to their neighbors as much as they used to. For example, in my community, there was a chance for kids to visit a home for elderly people. Only two kids showed up. The others did not come because they were afraid to meet new people.\n\nThe final reason is that young people are not interested in helping their communities. Schools do not teach the importance of helping others and joining community activities. They only teach what students need to know for exams.

There are some solutions, but they're too costly. However, when we find a clean and affordable fuel, it will lead to a big change in the car industry.\n\nCars release too much carbon into the air, which is bad for our planet. They pollute too much, and we can't keep ignoring the problem. People will soon realize how harmful cars are to the environment, and they'll prefer to use bikes or clean cars.\n\nWe have the technology to build clean cars, but car manufacturers aren't making them because governments and people don't understand how quickly carbon is harming our planet. If we keep polluting, the effects will get worse and happen more often in the next 10 years. This will make everyone want to stop polluting before it's too late.\n\nCars are being banned in many cities. For example, the mayor of Paris closed some roads to cars and opened them to buses to encourage people to use public transportation. In Mexico City, people can only use their cars one day a week to reduce air pollution.

Now, cars are getting cheaper, and more people can buy them. Rich people will keep buying new cars and selling their old ones. Poor people will buy these used cars at a lower price. This means more and more people will own cars.\n\nWhy do rich people buy more cars? It's because they want faster and more unique cars. Car companies make more unique cars because they know rich people like them. Rich people will always want these cars, and poor people will always want to buy used cars at a lower price.\n\nMost people want to own a car. I think this is because of jealousy. When someone sees someone else with a car, they want one too. When a rich person sees their friend with a cool car, they want a unique car too.

{"file_id": "1129532.txt", "output_essay": "Most people think that enjoyment comes from experience, but I believe that we enjoy things more when we first try them. There's a saying that something is attractive until you get it. This means that when you want something and can't get it easily, you want it even more. But after you get it, you lose interest. This is just how people are. So, this means that younger people enjoy life more than older people because they're trying new things for the first time. I agree that young people enjoy life more than older people.\n\nTo support my opinion, first, I want to talk about young people's nature. They're very curious and want to try new things, even if they might be dangerous. For example, when I was a kid, I was curious about parachutes and once jumped from my rooftop with an umbrella. I didn't know what fear was back then. You can't expect older people to do something like that. Even if they don't know the risks, they won't take the chance.\n\nSecond, young people don't worry much about what's right and wrong, but older people do. Older people know the importance of ethics from their life experience and always try to follow them. Teenagers, on the other hand, don't follow moral values or do so reluctantly.\n\nThird, I think you can enjoy life more if you don't have many rules to follow. Older people have responsibilities to their family and society. Young people, however, are free to do what they want. For instance, I like to dance in public, and I do it whenever I can. But I know some older people can't do it because they worry about what others will think.\n\nLastly, young people are open to new ideas and cultures, while older people have a narrower view. It's easy for young people to adapt to a new culture and learn from it. Older people, however, are more set in their ways and want to preserve their own culture.\n\nIn conclusion, although older people enjoy life based on their experiences, I believe that young people enjoy life more. The main reasons are their desire to try new things, lack of responsibilities, less concern for what's right and wrong, and more energy to enjoy life."}

If they succeed, the product will sell, and the company will make a profit.\n\nIn a competitive world, manufacturers need to make their products seem the best they can be. Studies show that well-advertised products are the most popular among customers. If you make your product look appealing on TV, magazines, or other media, customers are likely to be interested. They might not buy it right away, but they will at least check it out.\n\nThe actual sales of a product depend on how well it matches the advertisement and the competition it faces.\n\nIn my opinion, advertising is a necessary part of the marketing process.

Some students are too busy with schoolwork or their parents do not give them free time. So, I think young people do not have time to help their communities. Now, I want to talk about the time they have and why I think they are too busy.\n\nI have seen many students who struggle with their schoolwork and busy schedules. I think students need time to help their communities. When they help, they get life experiences that teach them more than school. Life experiences are important because they teach us things we need to know. Communities are also important. When we talk to others, we learn new things. For example, studying with friends is better than studying alone. Our lives are changing, and people do not have free time anymore. Young people are busy, and students are no exception.\n\nIn my opinion, if we have time to talk to people and rest, even with a busy schedule, it will make things better. I believe that if they help their communities, they will study more effectively."}

I believe this for several reasons.\n\nFirst, I had a personal experience. I bought a lotion that promised to help me lose weight. The ad showed a before and after picture. But after using the lotion, I didn't lose any weight.\n\nSecond, some companies make their products look better by leaving out important information or putting it in small print. This information is important, like side effects.\n\nOn the other hand, if companies don't make their products seem good, they won't be able to compete with other products. They won't be able to stay in business.\n\nIn conclusion, most companies today have to make their products seem very good. If they don't, people won't buy them because they don't think they will work or meet their needs."}

Marketing teams handle this.\n\nI agree that most ads make products seem better than they really are.\n\nBecause of globalization, we can find almost anything we want in each country, especially in developed countries. This means there is a lot of competition since there are many products available to customers. The choice is huge, and it's hard to decide which product to buy when we don't know much about them.\n\nAs a result, brands launch many ad campaigns. They try their best to create the best campaign. Using ad techniques, they make their products seem as good as possible. They need to get people's attention.\n\nWhen we see a billboard or a TV commercial for a new food product, it's often very appealing, and we get excited to try it. But we're often disappointed. For example, when McDonald's launches a new burger, it looks great in the picture. However, when I try it, the bread is too dry, and the cheese is not what I expected. I wonder why things are not the same as in the ad.\n\nAd agencies have big budgets and use impressive techniques to make products seem better.\n\nNot only do products look different, but they also don't work as promised. Some products claim to do certain things, but when we try them, the result is not what we expected.\n\nFinally, I want to add that this doesn't just happen with products. It also happens with famous people. The stars we see in magazines look perfect, but in real life, they're not the same. We can be very surprised. This is all because of marketing, which makes everything or everyone seem perfect."}

Cars are fast and comfortable, so people use them a lot. If a new car with better technology and speed comes out, people will buy it. To meet people's needs, a new vehicle might come out, like a small aircraft. People will prefer this new vehicle, and cars will be used less.

This basic knowledge helps me in my daily life. After I graduated, I decided to study marketing and got a degree in Business Administration with a focus on marketing. I had to take finance and accounting classes, which weren't my favorite, but they helped me understand marketing better. These classes were related to marketing, and that's what matters.\n\nI don't think it's necessary to study a little bit of everything, like medicine, architecture, and politics, just to have a broad knowledge.

They think this is a fact, even if she's going to live on campus to continue her education. But I don't think it's a fact.\n\nWhen I talked to my parents about it, they said it's a fact because it's been done for years. But I don't agree.\n\nAnother thing they believe is that an Egyptian can only marry another Egyptian. When I ask why, they say, 'That's just how it is.' But I don't think that's a good reason.\n\nWhen I lived in Egypt, people told me that a man can marry someone from another country, but a woman can't. When I asked why, they said it's because the kids will be the same as their dad. For example, if the dad is Ethiopian, the kids will be too. But I don't believe that.

The world can change suddenly, and it's hard to predict what will happen. If you only know one thing, you might lose your job. But if you know many things, you can start something new.\n\nAnother reason is that it's more fun to know how to do many things. If you can do things outside of work, you can enjoy yourself and meet new people. This helps build relationships with others.\n\nIt's our responsibility to balance everything in life. For example, many people today are only interested in computers and technology. But who will take care of the environment and the country if no one knows the basics of ecology? We should know what's happening in our community, society, and country.\n\nTo be successful, you need to have general knowledge. Many successful businesspeople have experience and knowledge in many areas. Take the owner of McDonald's, for example. He's not just a businessman, but also a real estate expert. This helps him open many McDonald's restaurants around the world.

So, how do ads deceive customers? The way they describe a product can be very subjective.

That's also a form of persuasion, and nobody seems to mind.\n\nIn my opinion, the statement 'most ads make products seem better than they really are' is true.

{"file_id": "1134094.txt", "output_essay": "The debate about people's success based on the risk they take should be divided into two parts.\n\nOn one hand, there are people who try new things and take risks to achieve their goals. On the other hand, there are people who stick to what they know and do well.\n\nBoth types of risk-takers can achieve success. People have different views about their ability to take risks. I'll use two friends as examples.\n\nOne friend is 35 years old. He did very well in school, scoring 1.2 on his final exams. He then studied law and finished university in less than four years with excellent grades. At 26, he started working for a big company, helping with legal questions for consulting contracts. He was very cautious and avoided taking risks, maybe because of his first experience in the business world. He worked in the same office for almost nine years without trying new things or taking big risks.\n\nMy other friend is 28 years old. He finished school with average grades, around 2.5. After school, he started his own business, offering IT solutions to small and medium-sized companies. Many companies used his services, and he had regular customers. He then had the idea to expand his business to other countries, starting with Austria in 1999.\n\nBanks helped him by lending him a lot of money. After two years, he had four offices outside Germany and owed the bank 4,500,000 Euros. However, his business failed due to the crash of the new market, and he lost almost everything in two months. He would not be able to pay back the bank in his lifetime.\n\nFrom these two examples, we can conclude that a person's risk level is not determined by their school grades or university status. People who take risks can achieve success faster, but they also risk falling down if they make mistakes. On the other hand, people who avoid risks may not achieve success as quickly, but they are less likely to fail.\n\nUltimately, each person must decide what they want to achieve and how fast they want to get there. This will determine their risk level and success."}

He took a lot of risks, but it paid off. His courage and hard work changed our lives.\n\nSecond, people are afraid to try new things because they're scared of failing. But failure is a step towards success. Even if you fail, you gain valuable experience. This experience will help you reach your goals. This is how people become successful. If you don't try, you'll never get there.\n\nThird, if you don't try new things, you'll fall behind. In today's world, everyone is trying to overcome challenges to achieve their goals. If you stop learning and just do what you already know, you'll be left behind. So, taking risks and trying new things is the only way to succeed in this competitive world.\n\nIn short, trying new things and taking risks are key to success.

These cars don't need gasoline, so we won't need to find a replacement for cars.\n\nThe world has grown a lot over the past century. Cities have gotten bigger, and more people live in them.

As the world continues to grow, cities will get even bigger, and more people will need cars. Cars will also become more affordable, making them accessible to more people.\n\nOur cities have developed in a way that makes cars the most efficient way to travel.

By doing this, they can understand what the teacher did in their own research life and what they expect from their students. In class, students can learn a lot from the teacher.\n\nSecond, students who want to do research need to think about what research means. Research takes a long time and can be hard for some people because of their personality. People who want to do experiments need to be patient. When students want to do research, they need to learn about the system they're using, and then they can become good researchers.\n\nIn conclusion, understanding the ideas and concepts of the information they get is very important for students.

They would rather learn the final results that have been proven over time.\n\nLet's look at two examples: Newton's law and the making of steel. In the past, it was important to prove Newton's law by doing experiments. Now, students don't care about doing their own experiments; they just want to learn the formula and use it to get a good grade.\n\nSimilarly, many cultures experimented with iron to create steel. They studied how iron reacted with air and developed techniques to make steel. But students today only care about understanding how steel is made to get a good grade. They don't care about proving it to themselves.\n\nThe reason for this is that students are only focused on getting a degree. They are not allowed to think about what they really like. It would be better if students could study what they love.

I think we need to change the way we learn in many ways. I believe that people should have the chance to understand ideas and concepts first, because that's what shapes who they are. For example, most children develop their personalities by the time they're ten years old, based on what they've learned and experienced. Even a soldier learns to love their country from a young age.\n\nIf I could change how we teach our students, I would build a special city for learning. It would be based on values like loyalty, love, teamwork, and encouraging individual talents. There would be no regular tests, because students would learn that exams aren't always the best way to measure learning. Instead, they would have weekly debates about big topics like enthusiasm, ethics, and racism, to prepare them for real life.\n\nIn conclusion, learning concepts is the key to having a balanced family, community, and country.

When people learn facts, they get tired of them, which makes it hard to develop their creative thinking.

It makes them uninterested. As a result, learning facts stops students from growing their knowledge.\n\nSecond, understanding ideas and concepts helps students find better facts. This is because they can find better facts through experience. For instance, my son learned more by understanding ideas than by learning facts. I was disappointed when he didn't understand something. But after he changed his learning method to understanding ideas, he found better facts.

To really remember something, you need to connect the facts and turn them into bigger ideas.\n\nSecond, it's not enough to just know things - you need to understand them too. Memorizing a lot of facts doesn't mean you automatically understand them or can see how they relate to other things. You might not see the bigger picture.\n\nThird, when you actually use what you've learned, you need ideas and concepts, not just facts. For example, as a doctor, it's not enough to know where the knee is - you need to know how other body parts affect the knee too. Knee pain might not come from the knee itself, but from another part of the body.\n\nIn summary, I think students should learn both facts and concepts. Facts provide a foundation, but understanding concepts helps you make sense of what you've learned and use it effectively. What matters most is being able to use what you've learned, and that requires a deep understanding of the facts."}

I agree that successful people try new things and take risks instead of just doing what they're good at. This can involve inventing new things, seeing things from a different perspective, or finding new solutions to problems.\n\nFirst, consider inventing new things. Inventors take risks when they create something new because they don't know what will happen. But if they succeed, they gain recognition and respect. They learn from their failures, which helps them in the future.\n\nSecond, think about finding new solutions to problems. If the Indian President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam hadn't taken a risk by launching a rocket into space, we wouldn't know much about other planets. Although the first launch failed, he didn't give up and eventually succeeded.\n\nThird, look at the scientists who invented new metals by conducting risky experiments. They put their lives on the line, but their discoveries made them famous and important.\n\nThese people didn't just stick to what they knew. They took risks and made groundbreaking discoveries.\n\nIn conclusion, everyone should try new things and take risks. This will lead to better results and more success."}

First, the main goal of advertising is to sell, and sellers want to show their products in the best light. They want to make their products look attractive to buyers.\n\nThe main goal of advertising is to make products likable and attractive. This can lead to misrepresenting the real product. For example, food products are often shown in a way that makes them look more appealing than they really are. Advertisers need to show all the good features of the product, which can make it look bigger or better than it really is.\n\nSecond, advertising can make people think that if they buy a product, they will feel or look a certain way. For example, shampoo ads often show a woman with beautiful hair. The buyer may think that if they use the shampoo, their hair will look like the woman's hair in the ad. This is not always true, but it's what the buyer assumes because of the ad.\n\nThe sellers' goal to sell their products can lead to misrepresenting them, making them seem better than they are. This is because buyers make assumptions based on the ads they see."}

The ad makes the product seem better than it really is.\n\nThis is especially true for ads about food, cars, and clothes. But it's not the product itself that's made to seem better, it's what's around it. You often need a pretty girl, a handsome guy, or a big, shiny house to sell a sausage or a T-shirt. So, it's the things linked to the product that are made to seem better than they are.\n\nHowever, some ads don't make the product seem better than it is. This is true for ads about services, like road safety or bank loans and insurance. These ads are more serious and have fewer lies.\n\nOverall, I agree that ads often make products seem better than they are. This is not surprising, and most people know it. The goal is to create a need and increase sales.\n\nIn short, ads try to make products seem better than they are, but this is more true for goods than services."}

Today, there are many messages competing for our attention, so it's hard to stand out. To be effective, an ad must grab our attention and make us want to buy. One way to do this is to exaggerate what a product can do.\n\nWhen we look at some ads and the products they promote, it's easy to see the difference between what's promised and what we get. This means we're aware that advertisers often exaggerate, and we don't fully believe their messages. I don't expect cleaning products to work as well as they do in ads, and I don't expect breakfast biscuits to look perfect like they do in pictures and commercials. We all take ads with a grain of salt and adjust our expectations accordingly. The challenge for advertisers is to find a balance between reality and exaggeration. If their ads are too far from the truth, they risk losing customers after the first try."}

I believe that many ads make products seem better than they really are, and there are two main reasons for this.\n\nThe first reason is that ads make products look amazing, so we think we need them. But often, they're not as good as they seem. For example, I saw a TV ad for a hair straightener that made it look really cool. I bought it, but it was terrible and damaged my hair. My boyfriend saw posters for a party that promised a lot, but when he got there, it was all a lie.\n\nThe second reason is that there's no one to control ads, especially online. This means companies can do what they want and take advantage of people. I know someone who booked a service online and paid for it, but when she went to pick it up, they told her she had to pay more because she didn't come on the right day.\n\nIn short, we need to be careful with these ads and make sure we're dealing with trustworthy people. In my opinion, the government should regulate ads in the media. Remember to be critical when you see these ads."}

As a twenty-year-old, I'm part of this group, and I believe there are some important points to consider.\n\nFirstly, young people want to help. They want to feel needed and useful. They want to know that their help is making a difference.\n\nThe problem is that society often portrays young people as lazy and only interested in having fun. This is not true. Many young people travel to other countries to volunteer and help those in need. But they can also make a difference in their own communities.\n\nThe issue is that their own communities often don't ask for their help. They don't realize that they can make a difference right where they live.\n\nIn conclusion, I think society doesn't encourage young people to help. This is because young people either think they're not needed or they go abroad to help others. However, there are some young people who take responsibility for their communities and want to help make a positive change.\n\nFrom my perspective, these individuals see the needs of their community and want to help as much as they can."}

People need to know what products are available and what they're like. That's where advertisements come in, helping us learn about what we're going to buy. But ads need to be honest about the products they're selling, and not give us a false idea of what they're like.\n\nAdvertisements always give a one-sided view of a product - the seller's view. First, they try to make us think we need it. Then, they convince us that what they're offering is the best. They always try to make us think highly of the product. Sometimes, we can think a product is great and buy it without even trying it out. We might not really need it, but if we see it on TV, we might think about buying it and come up with a reason to do so. Often, the product ends up unused in the garage or somewhere in the house.\n\nAdvertisements always try to make us like the product because they want to grab our attention and compete with other products. When a new product comes out, it needs to be good enough to compete with similar products that already exist and win over customers. That's why some products might look good but aren't as good as they seem in the ads.\n\nI think most ads make products seem better than they really are and lie to us to make money. Customers need to be careful when they buy things and try to make sure they're getting a good deal."}
{"file_id": "1147734.txt", "output_essay": "I agree that most ads make products seem better than they are. Here's why. First, ads often exaggerate what a product can do. For example, some beauty products claim they can make your skin look better in just two weeks. The ads use catchy slogans and amazing effects to get your attention, so you buy the product. But there's no real proof that the product works that well.\n\nSecond, ads are carefully designed to make the product look perfect. They use special lighting and computer effects to make the product look great. Take shampoo ads, for instance. The models' hair always looks shiny and smooth. But it's not real. The company spends a lot of money to make you think their shampoo is that good.\n\nFinally, ads often sell a lifestyle, not the product itself. It's not the product that's appealing, but the idea of a better life that comes with it. The product might not be great, but if you want that lifestyle, you'll buy the product. For example, an ad for a house might show a happy single woman living alone. It's not the house that's important, but the idea of being happy and independent.\n\nIn conclusion, ads are designed to promote an idea and often exaggerate the product. So, they make products seem better than they really are."}

Being an expert is what makes you special and gets your name in history books. I strongly disagree with the idea that knowing a little about everything is better.\n\nFrom history and personal experience, I know that being an expert in one area makes you stand out. It's the best way to be successful in life.\n\nFor example, a famous biologist made a big discovery in biology. What made him different from other biologists was his focus on pea plants. He studied them for over 20 years and won a Nobel Prize. He will be remembered, and his work will help society.\n\nAnother example is a famous French writer named Sylvia Plath. She's famous for her poems that make people feel sad and emotional. What makes her different from other poets is her use of metaphors and descriptions. Her work is still popular today, and many poets try to copy her style.\n\nEven famous people like Michael Jordan are experts in one area. He's known for his basketball skills. His college coach said he only knew how to play good basketball, and he proved it by winning a lot of money and fame.\n\nIn conclusion, these examples show that being an expert in one area makes you famous and gets your name in history books.

I know someone who became very rich. This person is my grandfather, and he lived a peaceful life until he passed away. When he was young, he was a good student who loved to learn new things. He didn't care about making money; he just wanted to know everything. His teacher thought he could be a great math teacher because he was excellent in math. The teacher suggested he focus on math, but he refused. He wanted to learn about many subjects, not just one. So, he kept studying, but he couldn't go to college because he was too poor. After high school, he looked for a job. Many companies didn't want to hire him because he didn't have a college degree. They wanted people with good education. So, he worked as a daily laborer. He wasn't a regular employee, but he worked very hard. While working, he continued to study everything he could. After eight years, he saved some money. He wanted to start his own business, so he opened a small store. He knew how to run it because he had studied a lot. He used all his knowledge to make his store successful. The store grew bigger and bigger. He got married to a nice woman and opened another store. He eventually opened four stores before he passed away.

It's hard to imagine life without cars. With the growing population and the idea that everyone needs a car, I don't think the number of cars will decrease in the next twenty years.\n\nCar pollution is a big issue being discussed everywhere.

However, this causes problems. Most ads on TV, in magazines, and elsewhere only show the good side of a product. They make it seem perfect, but this is not true.

Good opportunities are also important. Sometimes, you get a great opportunity and you decide to try, and that's the key to your success. Additionally, many successful people had a good idea at the start, but they don't take new risks for years. For example, Bill Gates is very successful, but he doesn't take risks or try new things. He developed a famous computer company, but he didn't try to do other things.\n\nMany successful people focus on one area and become the best at it. They don't want to change their image by trying new things. So, they don't try new things or take risks, but they are successful because they know exactly how to do their job well. This is the opposite of the statement we are discussing.\n\nIn conclusion, I think there is no one way to be successful, and that's why it's hard to run a successful business.

It also depends on individual attitudes.\n\nMany young people have busy schedules and cannot find time to help. It depends on their attitudes. I have seen people who choose to ignore helping others.\n\nSome young people think helping is a waste of time, even when they have plenty of time. They prefer to have fun and are reluctant to help. This is because they do not know the benefits and happiness they can get from helping. Studying is not enough; one should also have a helping nature.\n\nOn the other hand, there are many youth organizations that help their communities and people in need. We have blood banks where young people register daily. They collect blood and send it to hospitals for free. They organize events and give prizes to encourage blood donation. We also have organizations that collect money and send it to people affected by natural disasters. When the tsunami left many people homeless, these organizations collected a lot of money and gave it to them, winning their hearts.\n\nSo, it's not that young people don't help; it's that they don't spend time due to a lack of awareness. Young people are energetic and dynamic, and all we need to do is motivate them and teach them about the importance of helping. Elders should teach young people about helping others and spending some time on these activities.\n\nIn conclusion, young people do not spend enough time helping, but they are not cruel and will lend a helping hand when needed."}

This might be good if the guide is going to the places you want to see. But I don't think so. I prefer to travel alone.\n\nThe best thing about traveling alone is that you can do what you want. You can look up the place you want to visit online, learn about it, and find out how to get there. Then, you can just go whenever you want. You don't have to visit places you're not interested in or have already seen.\n\nAnother good thing about traveling alone is that you can go whenever you want. You can travel at any time of the year. If you like a place, you can stay longer and explore more. You don't have to worry about what others think.

I'm sure almost everyone has bought something because they remembered an ad for it. Ads are tempting and play on our emotions. They're also visually appealing, making us want what's being shown. Often, ads feature a woman with a perfect body, few clothes, and a big smile. This makes women want to be like her and men want to be with her. At this point, the product itself isn't as important as the feeling the ad creates. For example, a cigarette ad shows a beautiful woman with a glowing cigarette. Do people really want to start smoking, or do they want to be as attractive as the woman? This proves that ads make products seem better than they really are.\n\nAnother point is that even if people try not to be influenced by ads, they still are. We're surrounded by ads everywhere we go - on billboards, trucks, school blackboards, and in magazines. These ads stick in our minds. When we go shopping, we remember what we saw and might buy those products. But when we use them, we realize they're not as good as we thought. We're surprised that the ads tricked us into buying something that's not as great as it seemed.\n\nIn conclusion, we're constantly surrounded by ads trying to sell us things. It's hard to know if a product is really worth buying or if it's just trying to trick us. It's important to remember that not everything advertised will affect everyone the same way.

Consumers can't tell the difference between a good product and one that just looks good. What's more, these low-quality products often cost a lot more.\n\nFor example, take Timberland shoes. In my country, many people buy them because of the ads. These shoes cost almost three times as much as a high-quality pair you can find in a store. The only difference is the advertising. I'm not saying Timberland shoes are bad, but the only difference between them and others is the price.\n\nI could give more examples, but the problem is the same: we should care more about quality and getting a good deal for our money."}

For example, a marketing manager at a company that sells everyday products needs to know about finance to make good decisions about a new product. If they don't know about finance, they might make a plan that's too expensive and gets rejected. Knowing about other subjects like finance, strategy, and human behavior helps them make informed decisions.\n\nOn the other hand, we live in a very competitive world. The most successful people are often experts in their fields. For instance, doctors need to specialize in areas like dentistry or pathology and get advanced degrees. Most people wouldn't go to a general doctor for their medical problems.\n\nI think we should take a balanced approach. This way, you can be a well-rounded person who makes good decisions and is an expert in your field. If the marketing manager knows a little about many subjects, they might struggle to come up with a good marketing plan.

For example, in Korea, middle school students have to learn about 12 subjects. But this has become a problem because the education system doesn't consider students' abilities or interests. As a result, more than 50% of Korean middle school students are unhappy with their academic program and think it's a waste of time.

I didn't know what to do. Then, I remembered learning how to make a traditional Korean dish called \"Bulgogi\". This made me realize the importance of having broad knowledge.\n\nOverall, I think it's better to learn many academic subjects and gain broad knowledge because it will help us in life.

While some facts are necessary, like knowing fire is hot, most students understand ideas and concepts. This is because understanding lets them make it their own. Plus, it's easy to learn. To start, understanding comes from experience. You can't just learn a fact; you need to try it. It's better to do something once than to read about it ten times. This is especially true because our memories don't last long, but ideas and concepts can stick with us."}

However, as people's interests change over time, the director needs to consider a new approach. If they don't, they might lose clients. That's when taking a risk and trying something new is important.\n\nFrom my own experience, I've found that taking risks has led to more success. I love art, so I've taken many drawing and painting classes. One teacher gave me a low grade because I always used the same drawing method and never tried anything new.\n\nSo, I decided to try pastel paint instead of charcoal. My teacher was impressed with the color composition, which was a change from my usual black and white drawings. I got a better grade not because the picture was better, but because I tried something new.\n\nTrying new things exposes you to different perspectives and makes you more open to new ideas. If you always stick with the same thing, you show that you're not flexible. It also shows that you can only be successful in one area.\n\nIf you try and practice different things, you can show expertise in many areas. If you don't take the risk of trying something new, you'll never know if you could be more successful."}

I think trying new things helps us think and use our minds, and that's how we create new things. When we try new things, we feel excited, unlike when we do routine things that make us feel like machines.\n\nSometimes, starting something new makes us think a lot before doing it. That's normal, but we need to find a balance between trying new things and using what we already know. It's not always easy, and it depends on the situation. If I'm trying something new that won't hurt me and isn't dangerous, why not? It can help me discover new things and think of better ways to do things. If everyone does the same thing, who will find new ways to do things?\n\nLife is like school; we learn by trying things ourselves. We should remember that there's no limit to what we can learn, and the way to learn is by doing and making mistakes. When we make a mistake or try something new, we always learn something, even if we don't realize it at the time. We might see the benefit later. In conclusion, I think trying new things helps us become creative and is the best way to learn in life.\n\nIf we don't try new things, I think we limit our future and control knowledge, which will stop us from moving forward."}

This makes it easy for companies to sell products that look great but are not worth the money. Throughout history, many bad products have flooded the market and deceived customers.\n\nEven a famous company like Apple has produced and advertised some products that were not worth their price. For example, the first iPod they released had many technical problems. When it first came out, it sold very well, but the batteries would break after two weeks and only last an hour when fully charged. Since many people bought the iPod, this problem affected almost everyone who owned one.\n\nAnother issue was the headphones that came with the iPod. They would break if you listened to music at maximum volume. This showed that the headphones were not designed well. Despite these problems, the iPod remained popular because it was a status symbol at the time. Steve Jobs, Apple's CEO, led the design and marketing efforts that influenced many customers. The iPod's sleek design also contributed to its popularity. At the time, the iPod cost $300-$400, which was expensive compared to other MP3 players. It was not a better product, but people still bought it.\n\nMarketing strategies can make new products seem better than they are. This leads to products being sold at prices they don't deserve, which is unfair to customers. However, customers are also to blame for not researching products before buying them."}

I don't agree with the idea that 'in twenty years, there will be fewer cars than there are today'.\n\nIn the past, people used to walk to get from one place to another. The invention of the wheel changed everything. After that, people created many new vehicles for transportation. They started with carts and wagons pulled by animals. Then, they invented bicycles, which made traveling easier. Next, they created motorcycles, which were faster and needed less effort. Later, they designed vehicles that ran on fuel. Some were for carrying goods, and some were for people, like trucks and buses.\n\nThen, people thought about comfort and privacy, and that's how cars were invented. Cars were a luxury in the past, but now they are a necessity. This change happened because of globalization and our needs. At first, there were very few cars, and people thought they were amazing. But now, in developed countries, many people have more than one car.\n\nThe big problem with cars is that they cause traffic jams and pollution. That's why many governments are trying to reduce the number of cars by charging more taxes and parking fees. But people are willing to pay because they are addicted to cars. The question is, will there be fewer cars in twenty years? I don't think so. People who own cars won't get rid of them.\n\nNew technologies will come that will reduce pollution. Some people are already using solar-powered cars. Another reason is that the population is growing every day.\n\nIn conclusion, based on these reasons, I believe that the number of cars will not decrease in twenty years; instead, it will keep increasing."}

There are two main reasons for this: confidence and logical thinking.\n\nFirst, understanding ideas and concepts helps students feel confident. You might think that learning many things makes people confident. But without understanding them, nobody can use them with confidence. Facts are common, but ideas and concepts give deeper knowledge. As society gets more complex and competitive, the goal of education has changed. It's no longer just about knowing many facts, but about understanding whole ideas and concepts.\n\nSecond, understanding ideas and concepts helps with logical thinking. I took a history class in my first year and learned many important facts. I got a good grade, but I forgot most of the facts soon after the final exam. In contrast, when I took a physics class, I found it hard to understand the ideas and concepts, but I learned to think logically. This helped me get better grades in other classes too.\n\nIn summary, understanding ideas and concepts is necessary for students to gain confidence and logical thinking."}

In this case, a guide can help.\n\nSecond, when we visit a historic site without a guide, we may only see the buildings and not understand their significance. Each historic site has a story behind it, and the main reason we visit is to learn about its history. Since we are not familiar with the site and its history, a guide can explain it to us. For example, when visiting Mahabalipuram, a famous historic site in India, a guide can explain the meaning of the rock temples and carvings.\n\nLastly, the most important thing is to achieve our goal of learning something new.

They don't even have time to find out what's going on in their community, let alone help it.\n\nPeople prefer to spend their free time on fun activities rather than helping others. Although helping the community is important, people can't be forced to do it. Those who don't help don't know what it's about and think it's boring.\n\nAnother reason people don't help is their busy schedules. They work during the week and want to relax on weekends. They think of helping as a job and wonder if they should get involved or relax instead.\n\nMany people don't know what helping their community means, so they don't participate. They need to understand how helping can improve society. People are more concerned about themselves and don't pay attention to what's happening around them.

Advertisers study the products carefully and make them sound more useful and valuable. They often present unrealistic claims to convince people. For instance, an ad might claim that a certain type of paper can make users healthier than other types of paper. It may sound ridiculous, but ads often make such claims.\n\nSecond, companies that pay for ads are focused on making a profit. They want to increase sales and earn more money. To do this, they try to make their products more attractive to the market. As a result, ads often ignore the facts. In China, there are many illegal ads that mislead people and have negative effects on society.\n\nThe last reason is that people sometimes want to believe in amazing claims made in ads, even if they're not true. For example, an overweight woman might see an ad for a weight-loss medicine and dream of becoming as fit as the model in the ad. She's not looking for a real product, but a fantasy.\n\nSo, ads often appear better than they really are and are accepted by society."}

I remember when my dad thought about expanding his drug store. It was a big opportunity, but he didn't take it because he was worried about his family.\n\nTrying new things also takes a lot of work. Why bother if you already have a good job? \n\nBut I think it's worth it. When you try new things, you can discover new things about yourself. It's fun and exciting. When I try something new, I get to learn and grow. If you don't try, you'll never know if you'll like something better. For example, I started a small copy shop when I was in school.

I once bought a video-CD player because of its ad. The ad showed all the good things about the player, so I thought it was the best choice. But I was wrong. The player broke easily and didn't work well. I made a mistake by believing the ad.\n\nMy friend had a similar experience with a skin product.

But who's to blame? Companies want to show their products in the best light, and that's what I would do too. On the other hand, we don't want to listen to long ads that explain everything in detail.\n\nThe problem of misleading ads is not new. In my opinion, people should be smart enough to know that companies will say anything to sell a product.\n\nFor example, when a cellphone is advertised, the commercial might say: This is the best cellphone ever. But who can prove that? It's an exaggeration and probably a false claim.\n\nAnother example is food and drinks. How can a commercial seriously say: This is the most delicious burger ever? A customer who buys and tries it expects a great burger. But what if they don't like it? This means the ad industry can't control our taste or advertise products properly.\n\nSo far, I've been talking about the bad apples in the ad industry. However, there are companies that show their products honestly without exaggerating or lying. Especially when comparisons are made, the customer can trust the ad.\n\nIn the end, it's up to the buyer to decide whether to believe an ad or not."}

Over time, his business grew, and he bought more networks in Italy and other countries. But he didn't stop there. He used his money to buy a football team, AC Milan, and became its president. In 15 years, he made it one of the world's top teams. But he still didn't stop!

For example, traffic and communication take more time and effort today. As a result, young people don't have time to take care of their own needs, let alone help others.

For example, in crime scene investigation, we don't know the cause of death until we examine the body. A small detail can be crucial, but we can't find it in textbooks. The same applies to teaching biology in school; students understand concepts better through real experiments.\n\nSecond, learning from facts helps students remember things better. Seeing how organs work and respond to each other leaves a strong impression, making it easier to remember. As a high school student, I prefer lab classes to classroom lectures; they're exciting and impressive.\n\nThird, learning facts helps with emotional development by making life more interesting through experiences and connections.

When you follow a guide, it feels like you're working. When I travel alone or with friends, I can go anywhere I want and eat what I like. We talk, laugh, and enjoy ourselves.\n\nAnother reason is that I can spend as much time as I want in places I love. If I find a beautiful spot, I can stay there for a long time. If I get tired, I can stop and rest. I can even grab a drink at a caf\u00e9 along the way. No one can stop me.\n\nSome people think that a guide can show you many things and you'll learn more. But I don't think it's necessary to learn from a guide. It can be tiring too. On vacation, I think we should enjoy and learn by trying and seeing things ourselves. We'll discover more when we try new things.\n\nThe best way to travel is on your own or with a few close friends. It will give you an unforgettable experience, and your friendship will grow stronger. I'm not saying that traveling with a group is bad, but I think it's not as good as traveling on my own. It can be tiring. So, I don't think traveling with a guide is the best way to travel. Enjoy your trip!"}
{"file_id": "1156452.txt", "output_essay": "It's hard to understand many facts if they're not explained by ideas, concepts, and examples. I think they go together because without facts, there are no ideas. For instance, take war. We've had war for centuries, and everyone knows its bad effects: hunger, poverty, people leaving, frustration, psychological problems, kids losing parents, and families losing homes.\n\nBut in my view, students can understand all the ideas and concepts about war throughout history. If they can learn from the facts, it won't happen again.\n\nAnother example is when a teacher explains a psychological problem in class. If they just state the fact that people have psychological problems, students will wonder why. But when they explain that people with emotional needs (like those who didn't get enough love from their parents) often try to fill those needs, students understand.\n\nIn a business class, when the professor says, 'The customers are always right,' we understand what they mean when they explain it: a business needs customers to work. It doesn't matter what the company thinks; it's the customers who matter.\n\nFor example, when customers are treated well, they'll recommend you to others (friends, neighbors, family...). But if they're not satisfied, they'll tell everyone, and it'll be bad for business. Everywhere, not just in class but also at home with our kids and family, I think it's hard to learn facts if there are no ideas and concepts to understand."}
{"file_id": "1147775.txt", "output_essay": "A world with fewer cars sounds unlikely today, but I think it will be a reality in twenty years. I have several reasons to believe this. \n\nFirst, the world's population is growing every day. We might expect more cars on the roads, but we forget that land is not growing as fast as the population. With limited land, we will soon run out of space for our cars. Then, we will need a mass rapid transport system, which will discourage car use. This has already happened in Delhi, India, where the Delhi Metro Rail system was built to deal with the stress of too many cars. Now, we see fewer cars on the roads because people find it more convenient to take the train to work at a low cost rather than owning a car.\n\nAnother reason is the fuel shortage. The oil crisis is real. It's getting harder to meet the world's energy needs. Soon, oil prices will increase a lot. We can already see signs of this. Running a car will become very expensive. Research on alternative fuels like biofuels or solar power is still in its early stages. So, it will be hard for people to afford fuel for their cars. In India, petrol prices have been rising, and my family only uses our car when necessary or when all four of us need to go out together. Otherwise, we use bikes or public transport.\n\nThe last reason is that people are becoming more aware of environmental pollution. Cars use fuel, which pollutes the environment. Some countries, like those in the Nordic region, encourage their citizens to use bicycles, which are more eco-friendly. Bicycles are also healthier than cars because they keep riders fit. Conscious citizens support these ideas. This trend is catching on, which makes me believe it will become very popular in the future. In that case, the future of cars looks bleak.\n\nTo conclude, I believe that cars will become rarer in the years to come due to a lack of land and oil. These resources will become scarce because of the growing population, making cars less viable. Finally, when people become more eco-friendly, they will look for alternatives to cars, affecting their prospects."}
{"file_id": "1156687.txt", "output_essay": "I agree that most ads make products seem better than they are. Ad makers want to send a message that makes the product appealing to customers. They leave out anything that doesn't fit this message. Most of the time, they don't care about being honest. Let's take cigarettes as an example. If ad makers want to make cigarettes appealing, they won't talk about the bad effects. Instead, they'll focus on the good things. They keep important information to themselves, even if it might hurt the buyer. This way, the customer is fooled by the positive ad and thinks it's a good idea to buy cigarettes.\n\nThis kind of strategy is also used to sell food. Many companies want to make their products seem healthy because people want to stay slim. Ad makers create commercials that make the product seem healthy and good for fitness fans. They often exaggerate certain ingredients that are only a small part of the product. For example, some ads promote chocolate bars with 'a lot of milk' even though there's hardly any milk in them.\n\nAnother way to get customers to buy is to appeal to how they see themselves. Beer ads, for example, try to make men feel tough and attractive to women. Men think this kind of beer will make them seem more rugged and appealing, even though the brand is not special and is similar to other beers.\n\nCompanies use these tactics to make more money, no matter how it affects customers."}

We also use them to go out at night when buses and trains might be crowded or unsafe.\n\nOn the one hand, cars are a convenient way to get around because they are easy to use and don't require waiting in line for tickets. However, I think we should ask ourselves if cars are really the best way to get around cities. Or will they become a big problem in the future? I think that in a few years, cars will be a bad way to get around because of the growing number of drivers and the increasing problem of pollution.\n\nIn my opinion, in twenty years, there will be fewer cars on the road because our lives will improve. I believe that scientists and engineers are working on alternative ways of transportation and fuels that are less harmful. For example, I think that in the future, our cities will have more train transportation to move large numbers of people, reducing traffic and pollution problems."}

The number of cars is increasing everywhere. I don't think the number of cars will decrease in the future. Instead, we will see more cars than we do today. They play a major role in transportation.\n\nFirst, many people see cars as a status symbol. They buy cars to show off their status rather than using them for a real reason. Cars affect people of all classes, from the lower middle class to the upper class. So, cars are here to stay.\n\nSecond, cars are more comfortable. People prefer cars because they can easily reach their destination without waiting for public transportation. It's less stressful and helps people relax compared to other ways of traveling.\n\nCars can be used anytime and make our work easier. Finally, car prices are decreasing, making them affordable for even middle-class people. This means more people will buy cars.\n\nAs a car owner, anyone can make plans easily and carry them out. For example, planning a picnic. Cars can be used for both official and personal purposes. They don't pollute much, and they're not bad for the environment. Cars are not only personal vehicles but also used as public transportation, like taxis. So, cars have an impact on every part of our lives, helping us reach our destinations and enjoy luxuries.\n\nIn conclusion, I can't imagine a road without cars, as they have many advantages."}
{"file_id": "1159567.txt", "output_essay": "I think traveling with a tour guide is the best way to travel. If you visit a country and know a bit about it, you can manage on your own. But if you want to see many places and don't know much about them, a guide is necessary. Without a guide, you can still visit places, but you might miss out on many others. You might also have language problems. Just seeing a place without knowing its history is a waste. A guide can explain the history and importance of a place. If you know everything about the places you want to visit, you don't need a guide.\n\nWhen visiting a new place, you might want to learn the local language. The food might not be good either. A guide can help with these problems. They know the language, so you can communicate easily. They also know where to find fresh food. Another advantage of having a guide is that they know all the places to visit in the area. They can recommend good hotels that fit your budget. It's better to travel with a guide whenever you can."}
{"file_id": "1157923.txt", "output_essay": "Teachers can use different methods to help students remember important information. Some think it's more important to help students understand ideas and concepts than just memorize facts.\n\nWhen students develop their own ideas about a topic and come to their own conclusions, it can really help them remember. For example, if a history student thinks about how people in Germany felt after World War II and imagines their feelings of desperation and hopelessness, they learn through experience.\n\nUnderstanding ideas and concepts also helps students apply them to real-life situations and other subjects. For instance, if a student learns about social behavior in one example and understands the idea, they can easily observe and compare social behavior in their own community and in other countries.\n\nMemorizing facts has its limits, especially in exams. For example, in history class, students need to remember dates to avoid getting events mixed up and to get a basic understanding of time periods.\n\nOverall, it's more beneficial for students to be able to use learned ideas and concepts in many areas, not just in school, but for their whole lives, rather than just memorizing facts that they might forget after the exam."}

To me, it means being famous and making the world a better place.\n\nA good example is McDonald's, a famous fast-food chain in the US. I read a book about McDonald's. The founders were two brothers who sold burgers at a drive-through restaurant. This was new and innovative at the time. But they didn't stop there. They changed how they made burgers by giving each person a single task. This made serving food faster. As a result, McDonald's became the biggest burger company in the world.\n\nTrying new things always involves risk. It's great when new things work out, but it's a problem when they don't. It's like a lottery - we can't know if something new will be successful.\n\nAnother example is the person who created the iPod. This product is one of Apple's biggest hits. The idea of making the iPod light and able to hold a lot of music was popular. Apple was the first to make products like the iPod. Trying new things helped Apple succeed.\n\nThat's why I agree that successful people try new things and take risks instead of just doing what they're good at."}
{"file_id": "1155387.txt", "output_essay": "When we study, we have to choose between learning many subjects or focusing on one. This can be a tough decision. In my opinion, focusing on one subject, at least by the end of our studies, is more interesting. I will explain the good and bad points of each choice and share my thoughts.\n\nKnowing a little about many subjects can be appealing at first. You don't have to choose between the subjects you like, and learning one subject can help you understand another. For example, learning about animals in biology class can help you in ecology class. Switching between subjects can also help you not get bored. However, you don't have enough time for each class, and it can be frustrating to only learn the basics in your favorite subject.\n\nThe other option is to focus on one subject. The good thing about this is that you learn more and more about a subject you like and become more confident. You also make fewer mistakes. The main problem is that when you need basic knowledge of other subjects, you don't have it, and you might not have time to learn it. This can waste a lot of time. Another problem with focusing on one subject is that you might be too focused and can't see your own mistakes.\n\nIn the end, I prefer to focus on one topic rather than knowing a little about many subjects. The main reason is that you can only be good at something if you practice often. I don't mind asking for help if I need knowledge about another subject to do my work. Also, to start a career, you need to be good at at least one thing."}

For example, it limits my free time. When I'm with a group, I have to think about others, so I can't take my time when I want to buy souvenirs.\n\nOn the other hand, there are more advantages to group travel. Last year, I went to Australia with a group. At first, I was a bit nervous because it was my first trip abroad. But as we started talking, my nervousness went away. When I lost my wallet, the people I was traveling with helped me find it. I was really touched by their kindness. The tour guide also taught me a lot about Australia. Before the trip, I didn't know much about Australia, but the guide taught me about its history and the Aboriginal people. I had read a book set in Australia where the main character climbs Uluru, so I wanted to climb it too. But the guide told me that Uluru is a special place for the Aboriginal people and they don't want us to climb it. I didn't know that.\n\nOverall, thanks to the group trip and the tour guide, I had a great time. That's why I agree that the best way to travel is with a tour guide in a group."}

Young people have more energy than older people. This energy helps them participate in many activities. However, this is only true if they use their energy for positive things.\n\nWhen you're young, you're always learning. You often discover new places and things, and you enjoy learning about them because it's a new experience. For example, driving is more fun for young people than for older people. This is because driving is a new activity for them, whereas older people may be frustrated with traffic and other issues.\n\nIf you ask a school child about this during exams, they might give one answer. But during their vacation, they might give the opposite answer. This shows that young people are still immature and don't understand their responsibilities as much as older people do. Young people have fewer responsibilities than older people, which can make older people's lives more stressful.\n\nIn conclusion, life is great.

I will explain this idea by looking at the field of business.\n\nIn Switzerland, a master's student can choose to focus on one subject, like finance, or take a broader approach that covers many subjects, including marketing, human resources, finance, and leadership.\n\nTo show what I mean, let's look at two jobs in a company. A general manager and their team don't need to be experts in one area. They have to deal with many different issues, like leadership, marketing, and finance. They need to make quick decisions, so a broad education is helpful.\n\nOn the other hand, someone working in a bank needs deep knowledge of the financial sector. They don't need to know a little about everything. It's better to have solid knowledge of one area, like finance.\n\nOf course, knowledge is always a plus.

On TV, it looked really tasty and healthy, but when I ate it, it wasn't good, and I got sick. I couldn't sleep all night.\n\nIn my opinion, it would be better for food or clothing companies to spend their money making their products better or cheaper instead of spending it on ads.\n\nThe problem is that what's good for business is not always what's good for people.

Also, public transportation has become more convenient thanks to new technology, so people might use cars less.\n\nMany people are worried that there will be fewer people in the future.

They care more about their own success than about helping others. This is because of the increasing competition. To succeed, each young person is busy improving themselves. As a result, they forget about the community. They are too worried about their own progress to care about community issues. Each of them wants to be the best, and they don't want to waste time on others.\n\nAnother reason is the high rate of crime, such as corruption, violence, and robbery. If young people spent more time helping their community, wouldn't things be better? Most criminals are young people from the community. Instead of helping their community, they cause suffering and trauma.\n\nI also think that young people are not helping their community because they are moving away from moral values and discipline. Today's young people want to be independent and do not want to learn about helping others. They learn how to use technology to improve themselves, not to help others. For example, most young people spend a lot of time on the internet.

When students only see a concept in class or read its definition, it's hard for them to remember it. But if they see a real-life example of the same concept, it's easier to remember because they can relate it to their own life.\n\nFor example, in my human resources class last semester, my teacher helped us connect the theory to real life. I remember one class where we learned about job interviews. She had a classmate go through a mock interview, explaining each step and showing common mistakes.\n\nIt was very helpful for everyone in class. Later, when I got my first job, I remembered what I learned and applied it.\n\nLearning facts also helps us share them with our own experiences.\n\nOn the other hand, I've had classes where we learned many concepts and definitions, but didn't know how to use them. I think all that information gets lost.\n\nIn conclusion, learning in a classroom or on our own is always better when we understand facts and relate them to real life.

There are many products available in the market, and similar products are made by many companies. This gives customers many choices.\n\nThe differences between these similar products may be small. Advertising helps make these differences seem bigger. For example, car manufacturers may make their cars seem special by comparing them to a lounge or a spaceship in their ads. This gives them something to focus on when selling their product.\n\nBut, as they say, things are not always what they seem. Many customers are tricked into buying a product because of how it's presented in an ad. This happens a lot. You can read about it in letters to the editor in newspapers. For instance, I know someone who wanted to buy an apartment. He looked at many brochures and visited construction sites. He chose an apartment based on its brochure. The brochure said the rooms were spacious and had many amenities like a gym and sauna. But when he moved in, he found big rooms with plumbing problems, no gym, and a sauna that didn't work. The ad made it seem like a dream apartment, but it wasn't.\n\nFrom the advertiser's point of view, their job is to make the product look good, even if it's not. For example, a popular razor ad shows famous athletes using it. But a customer had skin problems from using that razor, according to a newspaper. The company made money and sold the product successfully.\n\nThere are many examples that show ads make products seem better than they are, and I agree with this idea."}

There are several reasons why I think this way.\n\nFirst, owning and driving a car will become very expensive. The price of oil will go up, and we can already see this happening. The government also cares about the environment and will increase taxes on cars. As a result, not everyone will be able to afford a car.\n\nAnother reason is that there will be more ways to travel from one place to another. For example, a new high-speed train will be built in Munich soon. Many people will choose to use this instead of driving a car. Researchers are also working on new, environmentally friendly ways to transport people.\n\nA third reason is that more people are moving to big cities for work. In big cities, you don't need a car because traffic jams make it slow. My friend, who studies in Munich, takes an hour to drive to university. But with a bike or the subway, it only takes half an hour. I think many people will choose to use a bike or the subway instead.\n\nIn conclusion, there are many good reasons why there will be fewer cars on the road in twenty years."}

Some people think that most ads make products seem better than they really are. I agree with this.\n\nThe main reason ads were created is to increase sales. So, ads promote products and must convince buyers that they need them. To do this, products are often presented as the best ever, even if it's not true. Ads are designed to attract customers and make them buy.\n\nFor example, we often see TV ads that claim a product has been tested by many satisfied customers. However, there's no proof of these studies, and the results can't be trusted.\n\nTo make products appealing, many technological tools are used to improve their image. Today, software can fix and edit pictures. Ads are often shown on TV, and the best way to attract customers is to show a beautiful product with nice colors and shape.\n\nFor instance, food ads often use this tactic. When a cake is advertised, its nice color and shape will attract customers. So, customers will buy the product, thinking they'll get the same thing they saw in the ad. But they'll be disappointed because the cake can't look as good in reality as it did in the edited picture.\n\nIn conclusion, ads often use false information, and it's hard to distinguish between honest ads and false information."}

I don't think that's true. There are many young people helping their communities. Maybe adults say that because they haven't seen it.\n\nHow can young people show adults what they're doing? Do they need to show off? No. Young people today help their communities in their own ways. For example, a DJ club. From an adult's view, they might just see young people having fun until morning.

Every day, we read in the newspapers that petrol prices are going up. Petrol is at its highest price, and it might not go down in the next few years. With limited oil reserves decreasing every hour, it will be hard to drive a car. Maybe people will start using public transport like buses or trains. This would make the environment better because there would be less pollution and noise. We can see that public transportation is getting better, like with the Transrapid.\n\nOn the other hand, we see that new cars are still being made. Almost every adult has driven a car at some point. For many people, cars are a status symbol and a way to show off their lifestyle. They like to show their position in society. Some people don't want to give up driving because it's a comfortable way to get somewhere quickly and easily. For many people, especially men, cars are more than just a way to get around. They're a hobby, and they like to show them off and compare them with others.\n\nIn conclusion, I think there will be fewer cars in twenty years because some people will have to stop driving their own cars. Insurance and petrol will become too expensive when prices keep going up."}

However, I think we will all benefit from not having cars. We just need to get used to other ways to travel. First, people should start using public transportation. This will help companies improve their services, and they will be ready for the change in twenty years. Next, we should invest more in finding alternative ways to travel and making them cheaper, like airplanes, trains, and ferries. The government should also improve the roads, airports, and harbors for these types of travel. Right now, cars are the biggest source of pollution, so this change will be good for the environment and for us. Scientists are working on finding new ways to power cars, because we might run out of gasoline in twenty years. We need to find new ways to power cars. There are new cars that run on hydrogen, electricity, or solar panels, but they are still experimental, and we're not sure how well they will work. Finally, there will be fewer accidents on the roads, because most deaths in the Western world are caused by car crashes."}

{"file_id": "1159249.txt", "output_essay": "When it comes to learning, some people think that memorizing facts is an easy way to understand things. However, I believe that students need to understand ideas and concepts rather than just memorizing facts. This is because understanding ideas and concepts helps people think more broadly and use their knowledge in more practical ways.\n\nFirst, understanding ideas and concepts helps students think more broadly. Memorizing facts only helps people recognize certain things. But these facts only allow students to learn those specific things. This limits their imagination and prevents them from understanding bigger ideas. For example, a famous Korean scientist, Ho Jin Moon, was taught only facts when he was young. His parents thought this would limit his understanding, so they moved to America. There, he learned more about ideas and concepts. When he grew up, he returned to Korea and argued that students should focus on understanding ideas and concepts.\n\nAdditionally, understanding ideas and concepts helps people use their knowledge in practical ways. Today, people are busy and often focus only on facts. But basic ideas and concepts in education are connected. In science, understanding these concepts makes it easier to learn new things. For instance, a study by the Korean National Research Center found that most scientists think understanding ideas and concepts is more important. This is because it helps students connect their knowledge to different fields. For example, understanding electronic science is useful for engineering students.\n\nIn conclusion, I strongly believe that students should focus on understanding ideas and concepts because it helps them think more broadly and use their knowledge in more practical ways."}

First, having broad knowledge helps in the future. You won't do the same job your whole life. For example, my father is a priest and also runs a kindergarten. He studied teaching in college and later studied religion. He talks to many people and has many hobbies. This helps him in his work and daily life. Second, broad knowledge helps you make good friends. You meet many people with different interests. If you only know one thing, conversations can be boring. Finally, if you only know one subject, you might be very good at it, but you'll miss out on other opportunities and relationships. I think it's not a good way to live."}
{"file_id": "1161586.txt", "output_essay": "People always try to get the most they can. When it comes to learning, it's the same. But sometimes, they have to choose between knowing a little about many subjects or a lot about one subject. For me, I'll choose the latter, but I'll also try to find a balance.\n\nToday, new knowledge is being discovered every day, making it hard to learn a lot about many subjects and still learn deeply. Knowing a little about many subjects might seem appealing, but it's not practical. In the academic world, there are experts in almost every field, each with their own research interests and achievements. If someone spends most of their time learning about many subjects, they won't have time to do research. Besides, it's easy to find information now, so it's not necessary to know everything.\n\nOn the other hand, if someone specializes in one subject, especially a valuable but less-explored field, they can become an expert and do important research. As long as researchers share their results, work together, and communicate, it doesn't matter if they don't know everything about many subjects.\n\nAt the same time, it's also important for a researcher to know some basic information about related subjects. This can broaden their perspective and give them new ideas. This won't take too much time.\n\nIn summary, I think it's better for someone to specialize in a subject, but it's also good to know some related information, which can make their work most effective."}

For example, ten years ago, most people didn't know the value of computers, but Bill Gates did. He took a risk and tried something new, and it made him a lot of money.\n\nOn the other hand, people who only do what they know are not like successful people. They have an open mind and are willing to take risks. For instance, if a businessperson tries a new idea they've never heard of, it can be very risky if it doesn't work.\n\nThere are two possible outcomes when trying new things: success or failure. Most people are too afraid to try new things because they're scared of losing everything. As a result, they start to think they don't want to learn new things.\n\nBut successful people don't think like that. They know there are risks, but they're not afraid.

The reason is that a tour guide will take you to popular places that might not interest you.\n\nFor example, last year I went to Goa, a popular tourist spot in India, with my friends. Goa is famous for its beaches, churches, and nightlife. But we were more interested in the electronic music scene, known as 'Psy Trance.' We didn't want a tour guide to show us the churches and beaches, so we explored the city on our own.\n\nWe bought local maps, rented bikes, and asked for directions. It was a great experience! I wouldn't have enjoyed it as much if we had used a tour operator.\n\nTour guides are mainly interested in making money. With all the information available in books and online, you don't need a guide to travel. So, I strongly recommend traveling alone and skipping the tour guide.

I don't agree with the idea that they don't care. People often judge young people without understanding their situations and how things have changed for them.\n\nFirst, I've noticed that it takes many good actions to be appreciated, but one bad action can be criticized. People often judge a whole group based on one person's behavior. A few bad examples have led people to think that young people don't care.\n\nSecond, life has changed a lot for young people. The world is more competitive now than it was ten years ago. Education and jobs require more effort. Time is limited, and young people are busier than ever. I don't think people fully understand this. Yet, young people are still helping their communities. For example, when someone dies, young people are often the ones who help the family.\n\nMany young people have dedicated their time to helping their communities. Some are involved with or run organizations that deal with important issues like education, food, and shelter. These people have given their time and energy to make their communities better.\n\nIn the end, I think people will always have different opinions on this topic.

They don't even understand what their teachers are saying. I think this is bad for young students. If teachers only teach what's in the book, students will think the same way. This will also stop children from using their imagination. Getting high grades is a big problem, especially in Japan. I saw on TV that there are no students who like to read, learn new things, or know why studying is important.\n\nI think teachers should teach children to be interested in learning new ideas, not just facts. Children should think for themselves. This will make them smarter and more interested in learning. Another big problem is that many Japanese people can't speak English. I saw a graph on the news that said Japan is the worst. In high school, students learn English from teachers who are not native speakers. They study grammar and how to talk, but I think this is not very helpful. Students need to practice listening, writing, and speaking with native English speakers. This will make them more interested and help them understand better in class. I don't think learning facts is bad, but if students only learn facts, they will lose their own ideas and imagination. That's why I think understanding ideas and concepts is more important than just learning facts."}

But that's not true.\n\nAs a young person, I feel like my life is very limited. I go to school every day, do homework and projects, and prepare for college. Preparing for college is stressful because most students want to go to good colleges. To get into a good college, I need to work hard in school and do many extracurricular activities. Even if I want to do something, I often don't have the time or permission.\n\nTo achieve my goals, I need to go to college and study in the field I want. Without that education, it's hard to get a good job or earn a lot of money. I also need to listen to my parents because I'm not an adult yet. If they don't agree with what I want to do, I have to give up or change my mind. I don't have freedom at school or at home.\n\nOlder people are different. They can do what they want because they have freedom and don't have financial problems.

There are many reasons why it's more important to understand ideas and concepts than to just know facts.

If they only know laws, they'll become outdated when laws change. But if they know how to think logically, they can adapt to changes. \n\nIn any career, it's essential to stay updated with new technology and research. For a historian, learning facts is necessary. But for a doctor, it's not just about knowing facts. \n\nTo make progress, we need to improve processes and evolve with society. That's why universities have research departments. Without research, there would be no progress in many industries. Students need to understand ideas and concepts to make new discoveries. If they only know facts, they won't be able to come up with new theories. For instance, understanding ideas and concepts has led to improvements in telecommunications, making long-distance calls possible. \n\nIn conclusion, if we only focus on learning facts, society won't progress.

Some might say young people are lazy and only think about partying. But I think that's because they have more energy and are more active. Young people might party for a short time, but older people spend a lot of time watching TV, playing cards, or socializing. Of course, some older people use their time well by working, taking care of their yard, or joining a sports team. Some people are sick and can't do what they want. But I'm talking about the average older person.\n\nYoung people do more in both having fun and working than older people. I don't know anyone who thinks life is just about having fun. My friends and classmates work hard and study to get a good job and earn money to support their families. Especially with so many people unemployed today, young people have to work harder to get a job. It was different in the past when jobs were easy to find and factories needed workers.

Plus, there will be less traffic, especially in subways.\n\nAs technology improves, more people will prefer using public transportation, and fewer will want to own cars.\n\nAnother reason there will be fewer cars is that people are becoming more concerned about the environment.

As a result, more and more people will stop using cars.\n\nIn conclusion, public transportation is getting better, and people are getting more worried about the environment.

You should know the basics in different subjects. This is what happens in schools. Students are expected to be good in every subject, like math, languages, biology, chemistry, and sports. So, students need to focus on every subject to get good results.\n\nOn the other hand, some people might ask, 'Why should a student who is good at math also be good at sports?' This is a different way of thinking. Some parents think it's enough if students are talented in certain subjects, because after school they go to university, where they focus on one subject they choose.\n\nI think the best solution is a mix of both ways. I believe people, especially kids, should have a basic education in every subject. It doesn't make sense to send kids to a special school, like a science school or sports school, too early. Students should learn basic information in politics, geography, and other important subjects. I think it's a good idea to send kids to a regular school first, and after they graduate, they can decide where they want to go and which university fits their interests. This way, students will have the basic knowledge they need in society, and then they can focus on a special subject."}

Many modern companies and university scientists are good examples. To be successful, you need to know a lot about your field, and extra knowledge can be a distraction. Since the days of big inventions are over, everyone specializes in a very narrow area. We now have experts who know almost everything about a small subject. This is necessary to some extent. Who else can work with nano-composites, for example, except someone who has studied it for many years? But when a broader view is needed, these experts often fail. How can they know about new medical methods that could be used in nano-composites if they only studied nano-composites? This lack of interdisciplinary skills can be a disadvantage.\n\nMoreover, someone who knows a lot about one field often lacks interest in other things and misses out on life.\n\nThe other extreme is people who know a little about everything but not much about any specific field. These scientists might have interdisciplinary skills, but they lack the knowledge to combine things in a useful way. There is no need for them in academia, since a certain understanding of specific problems is always needed.\n\nI strongly support the idea of combining these two types. I know we can't gain specific knowledge in all academic subjects. That's an impossible dream.\n\nI prefer the humanistic approach.

For example, Edison invented the light bulb, but he didn't make it better. Later, others improved it by making it last longer and changing its color. This shows that trying new things and taking risks is a good idea. Another important point is that new inventions can lead to even more new inventions.

We see them everywhere - on TV, in newspapers, online, and on the streets. Sometimes, we even get ads in the mail, like ones for restaurants and shops.\n\nOften, ads don't tell the truth about a product. I think they make products seem better than they really are. We might buy something because we've heard a lot about it, but when we use it, we realize we made a mistake.\n\nThe product isn't as good as the ad says, and we probably spent more money than we needed to. We could have bought a similar product that wasn't advertised.\n\nI think ads are especially powerful with kids. They ask their parents to buy something because they saw it on TV and liked how it looked. They believe they can do what they saw in the ad.\n\nIn conclusion, I think we should be careful when we see ads. When we buy something, we need to be careful because a product we've never seen before might be just as good as the one being advertised. We'll probably save money."}

To be successful, you often have to take risks.\n\nWhen you look at successful people, you'll see a pattern. They're open to new ideas, try new things, and always look for ways to improve. They're not afraid to take risks, and that's how progress is made.\n\nIf you only do what you've always done, your vision will get smaller, and your success will stay the same. Many people succeed by breaking out of their routine. This can be risky, but it's often necessary. If you fail, you might lose your job or money. But if you don't take risks, you'll never know what could have been.\n\nThink about it. If no one had taken a chance on Larry Page and Sergey Brin, Google might not exist today. But they did, and it paid off big time.\n\nTo get ahead, you have to be open to new ideas, try them out, and see if they work. It's the only way to stay ahead of the competition.\n\nNothing is guaranteed, and you won't get anywhere if you just stick with what you know. In most cases, you have to work hard to be successful, and even then, there are no promises.\n\nTake stock brokering, for example. The people who make the most money are often the ones who take risks and invest in uncertain stocks. If you're not willing to take risks, you won't succeed in the long run.\n\nBeing open to new things and taking risks will get you further than just doing the same old thing every day."}

But I think traveling alone is the best way to travel. It's more comfortable, and I can do what I want without anyone telling me what to do.\n\nWhen I travel alone, I feel very comfortable. Group tours can be noisy and confusing. But when I'm by myself, I can have a calm and peaceful trip. For example, when I went to Japan with a group, we had to wait for everyone to be ready to move. It made me angry. I wish I had gone alone, and I think it would have been a more memorable trip.\n\nTraveling alone also helps people become more independent and strong. When you're alone, you don't have to follow any rules. You can plan your trip and decide what you want to eat and where you want to stay. You'll learn many things you can't learn from books. For example, when I was in my last year of school, I planned a four-week trip to America. I booked my flights, restaurants, and hotels. It was hard, but I learned to be independent, improved my language skills, and made new friends."}

I believe it depends on the kind of person you are.\n\nSome people are very successful doing what they've always done. They're usually very good at it, and their experience and knowledge help them make good decisions, which can lead to great success.\n\nOn the other hand, people who take risks and try new things are often more open-minded. They need to adapt to new situations and be flexible. They need to pay attention to changes and adjust to their environment. It's also likely that people who seek new challenges are more motivated than those who do the same thing every day, because they won't get bored with their daily routine.\n\nNot only do new challenges bring new opportunities for success, but I also think that having knowledge in many areas, rather than being an expert in one area, provides more options for success. Being able to discuss many topics can earn you respect from others. It's easier to give an objective opinion when you have experience in many areas. I think having a broad range of basic knowledge is more impressive than being an expert in one area. People with common sense and many interests might be more likely to get hired than an expert who has never looked beyond their area.\n\nAlthough I can see how experience in familiar things can lead to success, I personally prefer learning new things and taking some risks. Despite all these arguments about success, I also think that life is more worth living when you have the chance to face new challenges and learn new things."}

There are many amazing things to see and experience, like new cultures, ways of learning, and discovering things you never knew existed.\n\nIf you want to learn about a city's history, a tour guide is a good choice. But if that's not what you're looking for, it might not be the best option.\n\nPersonally, I like to explore cities on my own. I'm also interested in the nightlife, so I wouldn't want a tour guide to join me and my friends at night.\n\nWhat you prefer depends on how you see things and what stage of life you're in. As a student, I'd rather travel with friends. But in 10 years, I might want to learn more about the city's history and culture rather than just going out with friends.\n\nSo, whether or not to take a tour guide depends on what you want to get out of your trip.

And to be successful, we need to be open-minded, take risks, and try new things.\n\nThere are two kinds of people: successful and unsuccessful. In my opinion, successful people are open-minded and always ready to try new things. They like to take risks to achieve success. On the other hand, some people avoid risks and new projects because they are afraid of trying.\n\nIf we look at professors and scholars, we can see that they are successful. They are not afraid to make mistakes because they believe that mistakes can lead to success. Other people, however, are afraid to take risks and make mistakes. They stick to their own rules and don't try new things. For example, an unsuccessful student might have a fixed study schedule that they set for themselves.\n\nIn conclusion, successful people are not afraid to make mistakes and take risks. They are always looking to learn and improve. But if we don't take risks and try new things, we won't achieve the success and comfortable life we want.

For example, many big computer companies are owned or run by people who took risks in the 1970s and 1980s by investing in new computer products. These people took risks and succeeded.\n\nThis is in line with the idea that 'more risk means more gain.' So, it's likely that someone who takes risks will make more money than someone who only does what they know best. This is assuming the person taking risks is well-educated and not just a gambler.\n\nIf someone only does what they already know how to do, they won't gain more experience and knowledge. For example, if someone only does what they know, they will probably never fail. This might seem good, but it's not. Failing is important because we learn from our mistakes. That's why successful people have often failed many times. Many rich people today have gone bankrupt many times.\n\nFinally, trying something new often leads to a new product. After getting the right trademark, this gives the person the exclusive right to sell it. For example, many successful drug companies became successful by inventing new drugs. This was only possible because they took risks and did things differently. It's important to note that this applies not just to professionals but also to artists. Many artists have been successful because they did their art differently and took risks."}

From my own experiences, I've learned that traveling alone gives us more chances to learn about the place, more time to explore unknown areas, and more opportunities to talk to locals.\n\nFor example, when I went to Cambodia last winter, I was with a tour group led by a guide. Before I went, I knew I should study about the places I would visit, but I put it off because I thought the guide would explain everything. And that's what happened - the guide told us all about the ancient sites, so I didn't need to find out more. But when I went to Europe by myself this winter, I felt I had to study about the background information and history because there was no guide to answer my questions. Planning my own trip made me take more responsibility to learn about the places I would visit.\n\nThis isn't just about my own experiences. When we travel with a group led by a guide, we have to follow the tour company's schedule. We don't have much free time to explore new places beyond the famous tourist sites. But when we're on our own, we don't have to follow a fixed schedule. We can go anywhere we want. We can visit local markets or take a walk down the streets - ordinary places where we can experience the local culture.\n\nAlso, when we're traveling with a guide, we're too busy following the schedule to talk to the locals. Traveling with a guide often means just visiting famous sites and taking pictures. But when we're on our own, we have more chances to make friends with the locals. Even with a language barrier, we can use body language and talk to locals about their lifestyle and culture. Traveling with a guide misses the chance to learn about a country firsthand.\n\nTraveling with a tour guide does have some benefits. We don't have to plan our schedules, and we don't have to worry about not knowing something because the guide is there to explain. But from all my travels, the most memorable experiences were those when I traveled alone. From planning my itinerary to studying about the country, exploring new places, and meeting people on the street is truly the valuable and real journey I'll never forget."}

The main issue with cars is that they need oil, which is very expensive today. We need to make a change. New technologies are necessary to solve this problem. A good start is the new generation of hybrid cars. These cars have two engines: a traditional one and an electric one. They are very fuel-efficient. They run on oil in normal mode and charge the batteries for electric mode. After a short drive, especially fast ones that produce more energy, you can switch to the electric engine. We need to support research to improve inventions like this. In the future, it will be more important to invest in research.\n\nAnother point is that many countries are now buying cars.

I had a problem I wanted to solve, so I worked on it and finally found the solution.\n\nMy father is a good example too. He failed in business, but he didn't give up. He kept trying and eventually succeeded. I want to say that we should not give up and keep working hard.\n\nMany people know about Thomas Edison. When he was a child, people thought he was stupid and foolish. His parents were worried about him. One day, he brought an egg to his mom and said, 'I can make a chicken, mom, it comes with a baby.' He kept trying to figure things out and eventually succeeded. He invented the light bulb by himself. Anyone can try new things and not be afraid.\n\nIn conclusion, I think successful people have one thing in common: they are not afraid to try new things and take risks. We need to keep trying, experiencing, and challenging ourselves. We can learn from their lives and lifestyles."}

He took a risk that could have ruined his life, but he believed in his dreams.\n\nSpace missions are risky. There's a huge risk of losing money and lives. But brave people have risked their lives for their dreams and for humanity. We know a lot about planets, satellites, and space because of them. Astronauts have traveled to space despite having doubts about returning to Earth. If they hadn't, we would still be ignorant about the universe.\n\nBusiness is a field with a lot of risk. Nothing is guaranteed, and there can be huge losses. But people take risks to achieve more. It's the same with the stock market. The path to success in business is full of traps, and successful people avoid them.\n\nMany successful people have taken careful risks to get where they are today. Kevin Pietersen, a great cricket player, moved from South Africa to England to keep his passion alive. He took a risk by leaving South Africa, despite being warned he wouldn't be able to play for his country again. If he hadn't, the cricket world would have missed a great player.

The progress humans have made is closely tied to what people discovered when they tried new ways.\n\nTake Christopher Columbus, for example. If he hadn't sailed across the ocean, putting his life at risk, America would not have been discovered.\n\nOf course, taking risks has its downsides. It's rare to try new things without facing some costs, like losing respect or social status. In the past, many people died trying to build airplanes. But because of their persistence, we can now fly from one continent to another in just a few hours. Those who succeeded are remembered as pioneers and founders of our modern world.\n\nFor me, the real issue is understanding the balance between the benefits of new things and the risks involved.

Students who know a little about many things tend to be more open-minded, make friends easily, and are more successful after graduation.\n\nIn today's business world, all businesses are connected. Let's say a student graduates and looks for a job. If they have a degree in business, a degree in finance, and some leadership experience, they're more likely to get hired than someone with just a Ph.D. in finance. This is because a higher degree usually means higher pay and more power, but it limits them to one department. On the other hand, a student with a broad range of knowledge can help in multiple departments, making them more valuable to the company.\n\nHaving knowledge in many areas also opens up more job opportunities and higher salaries.

Concepts are the basic ideas behind a subject. They come from books, writings, or a summary of what's already been done. Without a concept, students can't do a task properly. For example, choosing a major requires understanding the basics of the course.\n\nFacts are important because they tell us what's true. They're essential for every task. In my opinion, learning facts helps us prepare for real-life situations. For instance, taking a new test requires practice tests to get experience. If a student only knows the ideas and concepts, they won't do as well as someone who has practiced.\n\nAnother example is starting a new business. A person needs to learn the ideas, concepts, and facts about marketing. They need to observe how other businessmen work and learn from their daily experiences. Having an idea and basic knowledge isn't enough to succeed in business. Without learning facts, there will be less profit.\n\nThese examples show that having only half the knowledge can be dangerous.

Another solution is to have strict rules, such as fining companies that mislead.\n\nSecond, these ads only show the product's good points and don't mention its weaknesses. This means buyers don't know the product's limitations. For example, a product that only cleans smooth surfaces might be used on a rough surface, damaging the product. This problem is caused by the ad, which didn't mention the product's limits.\n\nFinally, there's a lot of competition between companies, which leads to ignoring some ethical values.

Hyundai Santro uses a famous actor, Shahrukh Khan, to promote their car in India. In the ad, he goes on a long drive with his girlfriend. But we know he doesn't really drive that car in real life. Still, people are impressed and buy the car because they think it must be good if he uses it. I own that car, and it's good, but not because of the ad. The ad makes you think that if you drive that car, you'll get a good-looking girlfriend, but that's not true.\n\nAnother example is an ad for Bournvita, a drink for kids. They claim that if kids drink it, they'll grow faster and healthier. But if that were true, the producer would be the richest person in the world.

While a group tour may be convenient because a guide knows the area and has a plan, I think traveling alone is more enjoyable.

For example, if you visit a tourist spot with a group and you like it, you have to leave because of the time limit. But if you're alone, you can stay as long as you want.\n\nNext, you can meet local people. When you're in a group, locals aren't interested in talking to you because you're already with a lot of people. But when you're alone, locals notice you and might talk to you or be friendly. They can also tell you where to go better than a guide or book. You can learn about the local traditions and culture, which books don't tell you.\n\nFinally, you can be independent.

This is clear when we look at nomads, shifting agriculture, and similar examples. However, I'm not trying to discuss history, but rather to start a debate about whether there will be fewer cars in the next twenty years. In my opinion, the number of cars produced will increase rather than decrease. I'd like to support my view with the following reasons.\n\nThe car industry has grown a lot since the invention of the wheel. It's unlikely that this growth will slow down. Firstly, economic forecasts show that living conditions will improve, giving people more free time. This means people will have more time to spend with their families and go on vacations, and cars will allow them to travel farther.\n\nEven if we focus on the wealthy, there's another reason to believe car production will increase. There's a strong focus on using science and technology to improve things, including cars. A lot of money is being invested in making solar cars and more fuel-efficient cars. It's unlikely that this investment will go to waste. This suggests that people want to own more cars in the future.\n\nLastly, as people's income increases, they tend to use public services less. For example, middle-income earners often prefer to own personalized goods when their income rises. When people have the money, they want to own things, and with economic growth worldwide, people will likely switch from public transport to owning their own cars.\n\nTherefore, I believe that there will indeed be more cars in the years to come."}

However, some ads might not show the whole truth about a product's strengths and weaknesses. I think these ads are the exception.\n\nThe people who create ads can't lie about a product. If they did, customers would find out after buying the product, and they would never buy from that company again.\n\nCompanies want to make customers happy, and that wouldn't happen if they showed fake ads.\n\nAs I said, I think ads show the best part of a product without showing the negative parts. However, I don't think ads make products generally better than they really are."}
{"file_id": "1165229.txt", "output_essay": "I think the best way to travel is by yourself, not with a group led by a tour guide. In my country, there are many travel agencies that go to different countries. However, traveling alone is better because you don't have enough time with a guide, you can control your time and where you go, and you can find the same information on your own.\n\nFrom my experience, tour guides don't give you enough time at each site. For example, I once went to the Northeastern United States. I visited New York first. I loved Broadway, with its musical posters, commercials, and stores. But the guide only gave me one hour. I wanted to visit the stores and see a musical, but all I could do was take pictures and buy a souvenir. When you travel, you need to have the freedom to stay and do what you want. You might want to see a musical, have a cup of coffee, or go shopping.\n\nWhen you travel alone or with your own group, you have more control over your time and where you go. When I was in Cuba, I wanted to go to the beach, but it was raining, so I changed my plan and stayed indoors. In the evening, I enjoyed dinner on the beach when it was cool. If you travel with a group and a guide, you can't change your plans. You might go to the beach on a rainy day, or you might go somewhere you don't want to go and waste hours on a bus.\n\nPeople use tour guides because they don't know the place well. But with the internet and many books about a place, you can find all the information you need. You can find maps, good viewpoints, and great restaurants. Then you can choose where you want to go on your own. My parents once went to Italy with just a book and had a great time without any problems.\n\nFor these reasons, traveling alone or in a small group is fun and practical. Having a flexible schedule and doing what you want are the most important things when you travel."}

Teenagers have a lot to deal with just helping themselves, so maybe they're the only age group that shouldn't be blamed for being a bit selfish. But even when people reach their twenties, there are still many ignorant and selfish people. This problem exists at every age.\n\nIt's easy to blame young people, but many middle-aged and older people also ignore problems when they're uncomfortable.\n\nThis doesn't mean the idea that young people today don't care enough is wrong. If many people of all ages don't help their communities enough, then young people are part of the problem. But in my opinion, young people are often the most willing to help, at least after they get through their teenage years. This is because there are often more open-minded young people than older ones.\n\nThe word 'nowadays' is also important. In the past, family ties were stronger, so families helped each other more. But a community is not just about the people we love, but also about people who are very different from us. Helping the community means helping everyone, even if we don't agree with them. In the past, it was less common to help strangers, but it's more common today. Even though many charity organizations have older members, it doesn't mean young people don't care. Often, young people are the ones who want to make a difference.\n\nI totally agree that not enough people help their communities, but we can't just blame young people today. It's a problem that has always existed."}

Traveling with a guide is better because we don't know the history of the places we visit or the monuments they have. A tour guide knows all about the history of a place.\n\nWith a guide, we don't have to worry about planning where to go. The guide knows all the places and can plan our schedule according to our needs. They know which places to visit first and last. They also tell us where to stay, how much money we need, and the best ways to get around. They explain the culture, behavior, and history of the places we visit.\n\nHaving a guide can also save us money. They can give us good advice on where to shop, stay, and eat. If we travel without a guide, we might get lost or have problems. We might not know where to go or what to see. We could even get off track from our route. So, it's better to travel with a guide who can help us in many ways."}

Each person had a job to do to help the family and community. They worked together. Now, we usually have three or four people in a family. I think this is true.\n\nI also think that young people today do not help their community enough. They do not learn from older people what they can do to help. They are too busy.\n\nFirst, young people cannot find older people to teach them. I believe it is important for young people to learn from older people how to help their community. Usually, older people teach them. But now, we live separately from older people, so young people do not have the chance to learn.\n\nNext, young people are too busy to help. They have a lot to do every day and do not even have time to rest. After school, they go to extra classes. They spend most of the day at these classes. For example, my 14-year-old sister has two extra classes after school and comes home around 10:00. She does not have time to help her community.\n\nIn conclusion, I agree that young people do not help their community enough."}

I believe that successful people keep trying new things and don't get stuck on one thing.\n\nWe've seen many businesspeople who tried different industries. Although they succeeded in some and failed in others, they still came out on top. A good example is the Indian businessman, Tata. Tata started his business career by making cars. He worked with foreign companies to provide the best technology to customers. The business started with trucks but soon grew to include other types of vehicles. Recently, Tata introduced the cheapest car in India for ordinary people. This journey is amazing. But that's not all Tata did.\n\nTata also started other businesses, such as tea, salt, computers, and phones. He's successful in these businesses too. Now he's planning to buy the famous brand 'Jaguar'. Tata took big risks when he started each new industry. But big rewards require big risks. A person with a vision can handle these risks and come out on top. These are the qualities of a successful person.\n\nIf Tata had only focused on making trucks, he wouldn't have had such a big impact on other industries. He tried new things, and it paid off. His success is due to the way he took on new business opportunities.\n\nSo, it's clear that someone who only does what they already know how to do well will have less chance of success than someone who tries new things and takes calculated risks for bigger rewards."}

After considering the pros and cons, I believe that having a tour guide is better. I'll explain why.\n\nFirst, a tour guide saves time. Imagine walking around a big city without a plan. You might see some nice views, but you'll likely get tired and lost. With a tour guide, you'll see more interesting places and learn how to get there easily. You won't need to think about anything except having fun.\n\nSecond, a tour guide saves money. They often get discounts from hotels and can give you coupons for shopping. This means you'll spend less money on your trip.\n\nThird, a tour guide makes your trip more efficient. You'll visit more places and have everything arranged for you. When you arrive at the airport, a bus will be waiting for you. When you go to a restaurant, your meal will be ready. When it's time to leave, someone will tell you what to do.\n\nFinally, with a tour guide, you can share your experiences with other travelers and easily find someone to take a photo of you. In conclusion, traveling with a tour guide saves time, saves money, and makes your trip more efficient."}

Some people think car usage will increase, but I believe it will decrease. There are several reasons for this.\n\nFirst, we are running out of oil and gas because we are using them too quickly. This means we won't have enough oil to run our cars, even if we have many cars. So, we need to find alternative ways to move around or new sources of energy.\n\nSecond, cars pollute the air. They produce bad gases like CO2 and NOx, which make the earth's temperature rise. This causes the sea level to rise, and our lands might be underwater one day. Many people are working to find ways to move around without polluting the air.\n\nThird, cars are not very convenient. They break down often and can't travel across continents. In today's global world, we need to invent better ways to travel, like ships and planes, to trade easily.\n\nFor these reasons, I'm sure there will be fewer cars on the road in the future. They pollute the air and we're running out of oil."}

Many ads don't make products seem better than they really are.\n\nIt's clear that not all ads attract customers. One reason is that some ads actually discourage people from buying products. For example, in many countries, tobacco ads have warning messages. When I visited Australia, I saw that some ads even showed pictures of lung cancer. These ads warn us about the dangers of using these products. They don't make the products look good.\n\nSome ads use a different approach to attract customers. For instance, a Japanese food company called Yukiguni-maitake uses an unusual strategy. Their ad says, 'Don't buy our products.' This ad is unusual, so many customers are curious and end up buying the products. This shows that ads sometimes use unique strategies that don't focus on the product's good qualities.\n\nSome people think ads should make products look good. However, the examples I gave show that some ads try to do the opposite.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe ads use different strategies to attract customers. My examples make this clear."}

They can party and have fun most of the time. One main reason they enjoy life more is that they do not have many responsibilities or worries. Their parents help them financially and mentally, so they do not have to work or struggle. Another reason is that they have many new things to try and places to visit, which is more fun.\n\nOld people also have many reasons to enjoy life. If you have been a nice and fun person, you may have more friends than younger people because you have more experience with friendships.\n\nAs an adult, you have more freedom than younger people. You can do things they cannot do, like going on vacation without permission or making big decisions.\n\nIn my opinion, I agree with the statement because, even though young people have limitations, it is more fun and exciting.

As more cars are made, there will not be enough space on the roads. The growing population means more drivers, and highways will be very crowded. With limited land, the government will have to reduce the number of cars, which also cause pollution.\n\nIn Malaysia, the government is trying to reduce the number of cars. One way they are doing this is by adding high taxes to imported and local cars. This was meant to encourage people to find another way to travel. However, it has not been very effective. So, the government is now focusing on reducing the number of drivers. For example, they have raised the age limit for new drivers.\n\nThis delay in new drivers is also helped by improving public transportation. Public transportation is the best way to stop future traffic jams. A good example is the train. It is easy to use, affordable, and can carry many people. Many governments want to achieve this. The bullet train in Japan is a great example of good public transportation. I have also visited Australia, where I saw very few cars on the road. This shows me what Malaysia should aim for. If Australia can have quiet roads, I am sure that in twenty years, our roads will be empty too."}

People also have different opinions on the same topic, so it's impossible to explain something in just one way. Everyone can have different ideas.\n\nSome people can twist ideas to fit their own views. But a fact is a fact - it's the same for everyone, and the evidence proves it. Facts can also be interesting, funny, or scary, which makes them easier to remember than ideas.\n\nWhen students learn facts, they can connect them to ideas they already know. For example, when learning about history, it's essential to know the facts about Nazism and the Holocaust. Without these facts, it's impossible to understand what these words mean.\n\nThe same applies to other subjects like biology. We can only form concepts and ideas after observing facts.

This means the air will be cleaner, and the greenhouse effect will decrease. Environmental groups will support people driving cars.\n\nSecond, driving a car makes you feel calm, safe, and warm. You can go anywhere with your family, wherever they want to go. You have your own space, which you can't get on public transportation. You can also avoid annoying people on the way to your destination. This is important for people with families or kids.\n\nThird, you can show off your status with a car.

They can help each other in tough times and get more attention when they need help. In some places, tourists are warned not to go out alone because of high crime rates.\n\nSecond, group travel is cheaper. It costs less than traveling alone, especially in certain countries.

Traveling with many people makes for a real vacation. Group tourists can join competitions, watch matches, and enjoy other entertainment.\n\nTraveling is not just about seeing new places, but also about making friends. Group travel makes it easier to meet new people and build relationships.

People are taking better care of their health. Governments are encouraging smokers to quit, and the USA is helping other countries by providing food.\n\nAnother important point is that people have more freedom and opportunities. We no longer have slavery or other crimes that can lead to death, except for war. The USA and other countries are helping starving kids in Africa by providing food and medicine. They are also teaching them important skills, like how to use condoms to prevent HIV.\n\nRicher countries are sharing their technical knowledge with poorer countries, which helps their economies grow. As a result, people are living longer.\n\nIn my view, all these factors will lead to more people owning cars. Cars will become cheaper as technology improves, making production easier. So, people will buy more cars, and some might even own multiple cars.\n\nIn the short term, as the world's population grows, we will see more cars on the road in twenty years.

I have three main reasons for this.\n\nFirst, when students understand ideas and concepts, it helps them make sense of the facts. For example, if you're studying history, it's hard to remember all the facts unless you understand the bigger picture of what happened. If you understand the ideas behind the facts, you can learn them more easily.\n\nSecond, it's easier to learn facts one by one than to understand big ideas and concepts. Teachers can give students clues to help them understand the ideas, but the facts are usually straightforward. Teachers can also make the facts more interesting by sharing their own experiences.\n\nFinally, understanding ideas and concepts helps students develop their own thoughts and opinions. When students can identify the main points of an idea or concept, they can build on it and create their own ideas. For example, if a student really understands a philosophy concept, they can create their own theory about it.\n\nIn conclusion, I think understanding ideas and concepts is the most important part of learning, even though learning facts is also important.

{"file_id": "1170027.txt", "output_essay": "I believe success can be achieved in many ways, not just by taking risks. In the following paragraphs, I will discuss different points to analyze this idea.\n\nFirst, success means different things to different people. For some, it means having a lot of money and a private jet. For others, it means having a small business that supports their family and gives them a good life. Not everyone wants the same things. Some people just want a quiet, normal life. Taking risks is possible, but it's not a guarantee.\n\nAlso, achieving success is hard because it requires many skills. It takes hard work, dedication, preparation, and intelligence. People usually don't become successful by accident. It takes years of effort, and even that's no guarantee. Having all these skills doesn't mean someone will be rich and successful.\n\nAnother important point is that success can come from doing what you're already good at. Sometimes it's that simple. Working hard and making smart choices can lead to success. For example, if someone studies economics and gets a job at the NYSE, they can make a lot of money by using their knowledge and making smart choices. But they can also lose everything. It's not about taking risks, but about making smart choices.\n\nIn conclusion, while some people have taken risks and achieved success, many more have failed. Success is never guaranteed, and even if you achieve it, it might not last. Once you reach the top, the only way to go is down.

Some people think ads make products look better than they are, while others believe ads show the truth.

For example, some medical companies cheat customers by advertising their drugs too much. They make a lot of money, but customers may get sick from the bad medicine. This shows that some ads make products seem better than they are.\n\nOn the other hand, even though ads have some benefits, they can't compare to the harm they cause when they make products seem too good. For instance, some companies use ads to make their products look better, so customers spend a lot of money on worthless products. After a while, customers realize they've been cheated. This shows that ads have a big impact on our economy.\n\nIn conclusion, some people may think ads don't make products seem too good.

When kids are having fun, they don't think about money, homes, and problems that adults face. Young people think they're healthy, but as they get older, their health will start to decline. I agree that young people should have more fun than older people, and I have two reasons for this.\n\nFirst, responsibility makes people think about how to make their life better and not about how to enjoy life. For example, in a family, the father thinks about how to earn money for his kids, and the mother takes care of the kids and helps her husband with money. The kids just want to play and have fun without worrying about anything. This shows how young and old people are different.\n\nSecond, older people start to worry about their health, which gets worse as they age. Young people don't think about responsibilities or health problems, so why not enjoy life before things change? For example, a 60-year-old who's retired might have health problems that stop them from enjoying life. A 20-year-old who's just finished high school can play sports and hang out with friends without health problems.\n\nFinally, I think young people should enjoy life before they get older because they'll have more responsibilities then. Also, nobody knows how good their health will be in the future. I hope everyone enjoys their life, whether they're old or young."}
{"file_id": "1170582.txt", "output_essay": "To answer this question, I want to talk about the idea of 'community' and 'responsibility'. However, I think this will take a lot of time and words. \n\nThe statement on the left says something, but we can't make general rules based on personal experiences. \n\nMy main point is that I don't completely agree with the statement. \n\nSome young people spend a lot of time helping their community, while others don't want to get involved. \n\nThe importance of a job depends on the social, cultural, and political environment. \n\nYoung people have different goals, but they can still help their community even if they don't realize it. \n\nWe can't say for sure that one person is making a positive impact while another is not. \n\nWe need to look at each situation individually and not make general rules. \n\nFrom my personal experience, I think that years ago, young people were more willing to help others, like helping old people or those with diseases. \n\nNowadays, we prioritize convenience, which is a major problem. \n\nConvenience makes us do things just to benefit ourselves, but that's not always right. \n\nThis is true in many areas, like work, school, and sports. \n\nIn conclusion, I want to say that no matter what you do or what people think, just keep doing what you've been doing, and you'll help your community as much as you can."}
{"file_id": "1175412.txt", "output_essay": "In my opinion, young people don't spend enough time helping their communities when they need it. Our goals focus on ourselves, unlike past generations who focused on the community. There are many reasons for this change, but I think the main one is our modern lifestyle. It makes us worry about personal things instead of global issues. We care about our image, our achievements, and our skills. We have to, but we must also try to change and see what's happening outside. We should lend a helping hand.\n\nFirst, we have a comfortable life. Our parents provide us with everything we need. It seems like nobody needs our help as long as we live comfortably. Our community is wealthy, and everyone can succeed if they work hard. So, our goal is not to help our community, which seems perfect, but to focus on ourselves. We highlight our own problems and artificial needs. We want to be perfect, not just good. We worry about these things to survive in this ideal community.\n\nSince we're so worried about ourselves, we can't see the problems in our community. We're not aware of them.\n\nBecause of this lack of awareness, we can explain why we don't help. But we can't avoid trying to make people realize their selfishness. We need to look at our reality. We must do more for our community than we're doing now. It's a good chance for both the community and us to grow."}
{"file_id": "1175182.txt", "output_essay": "I don't agree that young people today don't spend enough time helping their communities. Many organizations and foundations have young people working to help their communities. Many schools also require students to do community service. Sometimes, doing community service is a way for us to unwind. We, young people, want to get involved in our communities.\n\nMost schools in the United States require community service. Students must do a certain number of hours, whether they like it or not. By doing community service, students help their communities and make time for them. They need to finish their community service to pass the grade. Some schools give honors to those who work more than required. We students work harder and give more hours to the community to get those honors. Even though some students don't want to do community service, they still give a lot of time to the community because of the requirement.\n\nMany young people give their time to the community to relax and get away from school work. Often, students, including me, are tired of school work and want to relax. I found that helping the community allows me to relax and not think about my work. At the same time, I'm using my relaxing time to help my community and the people who need my help. It's good for both my community and me.\n\nIn conclusion, young people today do give enough time to help their communities in many ways. Whether we do community service for the school requirement or to relax from school work, we're giving time and energy to our communities and getting involved."}
{"file_id": "1176184.txt", "output_essay": "Trying new things and taking risks have one thing in common: they can be scary. But I believe they are necessary to be successful.\n\nTaking risks can be frightening. If you don't take risks, you miss chances to improve your life. Every decision, big or small, involves some risk. If you can't take risks, you can't make tough decisions, and that has consequences.\n\nIn some cases, taking a risk can make a big difference. It's the difference between someone who settles for what they have and someone who is truly happy. For example, a new graduate gets a great job offer in another country. Should they stay home and look for an average job or take the offer? I think they should take it and move right away. Otherwise, they might regret it for the rest of their life.\n\nIn some fields, trying new things is almost required. Researchers, for instance, need to question what's already known and try new solutions to discover new things. Without new inventions, where would we be? I can't imagine a researcher who doesn't want to try new things.\n\nFor all these reasons, I believe successful people are those who aren't afraid to take risks. People who just stick to what they're good at miss out on opportunities - because that's what change is all about."}
{"file_id": "1175383.txt", "output_essay": "There is a lot of debate about whether young people enjoy life more than older people. Some people think young people have more fun because they have many friends and lots of energy. Others disagree, saying older people have more family to share happy and sad times with, and they can do many things. In my opinion, both young and old people enjoy life.\n\nYoung people in school have a lot of free time. They can play, talk, and study with their friends. School is a great place for young people to have fun. When they have problems, many people can help them, like their parents, teachers, and friends. With help, they can solve problems easily and enjoy life more. Young people also have a lot of energy to do what they want and try new things, like video games and social media.\n\nOn the other hand, older people also enjoy life. As science and technology improve, people's living conditions get better. Older people can live longer and healthier lives. They can spend quality time with their children and grandchildren, who bring joy and laughter. Older people can also join community activities, like singing and dancing with others.\n\nIt's hard to make general statements here. I think both young and old people are enjoying life more and more."}
{"file_id": "1172599.txt", "output_essay": "In this essay, I explore whether people who try new things and take more risks are more successful than those who stick to established practices.\n\nFirst, I define what success means, because it's a matter of perspective. Then, I present some arguments on the topic before sharing my own opinion.\n\nIn most societies, success is a well-established value. Every value has its own set of goals. Success itself is not a fixed goal, but rather something that each community defines for itself. In Western countries, success can mean earning a lot of money, having a family, or simply being happy. For this essay, I focus on the economic aspect of success, which means earning a lot of money.\n\nWhen we look at the economic side of success, we need to distinguish between new products and established ones. New products usually come with more risks and innovation than established ones. For example, buying a franchise like Burger King is relatively easy, but it limits one's freedom to create something new. Starting one's own business is riskier and more costly, but it allows for creativity and personality. New innovative products can also be sold at a higher price.\n\nIt's clear that both options can bring in money. Perhaps it's not about success, but about doing things differently.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that the hope of achieving success drives people to try new and innovative things, despite the risks. This hope leads to new inventions and progress for humanity. While using established practices can also lead to success, it's the combination of taking risks and trying new things, along with using established methods, that leads to overall success for individuals, businesses, and humanity."}

I think that most advertisements make people buy their products without sensible judgment by exaggerating the product qualities. There are two specific examples regarding the purposes of advertisements.\n\nFirst, various media can be a good method to assure that products are flawless. Many products are usually advertised by famous people having a good image. If those products are shown to people repetitively, nobody would be doubtful about their qualities.\n\nSecond, almost all of the companies don't mention the side effects of their products aside.

{"file_id": "10445.txt", "output_essay": "It is often said that young people's interest in their communities has decreased recently. Some people might agree with this opinion because of society becoming more and more individualistic. However, I disagree with the idea that young people do not spend enough time on their communities because of what schools and societies require of them.\n\nTo begin with, schools encourage students to participate more actively in community service. Many schools nowadays offer volunteering programs for additional credit or elective courses. To support this point, studies done by the Ministry of Education of Korea have shown that the number of official community service programs provided by educational organizations such as high schools and universities has increased by 67% compared to that of 10 years ago. Also, students' participation in these programs has increased by 87%. It seems clear that schools have a positive influence on young people's assistance to their communities.\n\nMoreover, societies put more stress on helping communities. Communities display a lot of advertisements to get help from young people, and their participation is highly praised by society. Young people considered virtuous are rewarded by the government, with their names published in local periodicals. For example, I happened to see a poster for the rebuilding of my community damaged by a hurricane earlier. I immediately made up my mind to be part of it as the team leader and was awarded by the representative of my village. This volunteer experience, written on my resume, greatly affected the employers of my current work. They said that the virtue of helping others is the very criterion they esteem.\n\nIn short, I disagree with the opinion that young people do not spend enough time on their communities to make them better. This is because of the encouragement of schools and societies."}
{"file_id": "100336.txt", "output_essay": "Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. There are several reasons why this statement holds true. First of all, people who take risks are usually more adaptable to new situations and feel more secure out of their comfort zone. For example, when a student from another country decides to move to a new city with a completely different culture, he is allowing himself to experiment with new experiences, such as the music, the food, and the architecture from that city. These factors do not only enrich his life but also broaden his horizons and allow him to think outside of the box. Additionally, when a person tries new things, they put themselves in a more vulnerable state, thus learning from their mistakes and helping them build a stronger, more powerful personality. For example, when a person knows that their options are limitless, and that even if they fail the first time, they are strong enough to try for a second time, their chances for success increase. Success can be described in many different ways. Many people associate success with monetary compensation, while others associate it with personal satisfaction. Regardless of how success is considered, I believe that taking risks will directly improve your chances of being a successful person."}

Since I also lead a supporting group for keeping our city park clean, I can confirm this tendency and I agree with the statement.\n\nI can't stop asking why young people don't want to be involved in activities that can improve the life quality in their community. Lack of time is the first and most popular answer. Nowadays, youngsters are very busy: if the school doesn't give them enough homework, parents will find some extracurricular activities. Friends are also important, and something done with them seems to have more worth to them than something done for the community.\n\nHelping the community brings not only benefits to the community itself but also to those who participate in the activity. Staying together is essential for a social animal like the human being.\n\nIn conclusion, more should be done to involve young people in helping the community. School and parents should be the first to promote such activities, showing the benefits that can be achieved, and not holding people back!"}

But I think nowadays only a few young people have experienced it. Many young people do not give enough time to helping their communities.\n\nLet us begin with an example in my own community. When I take a look at the group size of our local Red Cross facility, I could see a continually decreasing number of members. Sometimes we didn't know how to fill the schedules. One reason for this is maybe the little time many students and people have nowadays. If you want to compete for a good job or a high education, you have to work hard and so you have less time for other things.\n\nBut when we take a closer look, everybody should have more free time than it used to be. Many new inventions let us complete everyday routines much quicker, for example, computers and telecommunications.\n\nI think the real problem today is the change of lifestyle. It seems like every day we get a new possibility of how to use our free time, for instance, watching the latest movie or getting to the newly opened bar in the city. Young people do not help in their communities because they think they have to try all these possibilities.\n\nBut all these new things don't improve your feeling of confidence. When some people would get active in their community, they would experience how much fun it is to help. In conclusion, I agree with the statement, but I think helping in communities could be easily improved if people try it.\n\nYou are often more happy when you give more than you do to yourself."}

Generally, people work in cities where there are lots of public transports, but they prefer to park near the office or near the factory. It should be an idea to start going by buses or by trains, but there are other problems. If they want more people to catch trains, trains will have to be always on time and cleaner. On the other hand, I don't think that people will leave their cars at home. A car is a status symbol. With a big car, you can show others that you have a lot of money and a good job. In addition, technology is advancing, and this will permit the elimination of petroleum and the use of other materials. So, pollution will be eliminated.

A strong and sturdy base is mandatory for every building to stand tall. An understanding of things is like a base to a human being in the building of his life.\n\nIt is obviously more important to understand things than it is to learn facts about them. It is this understanding of a particular topic or a phenomenon that encourages an individual to analyze things occurring around him or her. This can be clarified better as we take a look at the following examples:\n\nFor instance, we consider the example of an electrical engineer. He has learned from the book facts about domestic power supply. But he has not understood how the process of delivering power is taking place. In case of an emergency, if he is required to tackle some power problem, he would not be able to repair it, or trying to troubleshoot it might even prove fatal to him, if he does not have an understanding of the fundamentals.\n\nConsidering the example of swimming would not be difficult. If a person has learned the Archimedes' principle of buoyancy, it obviously would not help him swim. But it would only be possible if a person understands how to swim under proper guidance.\n\nAll the research experts and scientists around the globe are responsible for new innovations not because they have mugged up facts and figures relating to their area, but because they have created their own facts and laws using their understanding of the subject.\n\nConsidering the above examples and illustrations, it can be very well said that - It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. For only this would bring them up as better individuals and better thinkers who would help in the development of their country."}
{"file_id": "102535.txt", "output_essay": "In my opinion, specializing in one specific subject is better than having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects because of the nature of knowledge, such as its plentiness and complexity.\n\nSince the 17th century, many inventions have been made. The information used to make these inventions and the information provided by these inventions are accumulating, such that no one alone can know all of this information. For example, in a typical university, there are principal departments such as the natural science faculty, literature faculty, social science faculty, etc. All of these departments also have subdepartments. In my university, for instance, business administration, economics, and international trade are subdepartments of the social sciences faculty. A person can only attend one of these subdepartments, such that it is impossible to finish all of these departments at the same time. So, having a broad knowledge in many academic subjects is not that much possible.\n\nAnother reason is the complexity of knowledge in any specific subject. When you want to cure an illness, for example, to cure AIDS, you should specialize in viruses, which are the cause of AIDS. Knowing many academic subjects such as optics, psychology, and literature will not make any use in curing AIDS. Since you can only learn by doing it, specializing is better.\n\nConsequently, specializing is better than broad knowledge."}
{"file_id": "100101.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with the idea that 'Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.'\n\nFor example, my mother often talks to me about when she was young. She talks about the relationship between the community she lived in and her. According to her story, the community provided a lot of festivals for local children and elderly people. For example, there was a cherry blossom festival in spring, fireworks in summer. They held a moon festival in fall and New Year's Day in winter at the shrine in the community, where they made rice cakes with the local people. In every case, the young local people went to help prepare and clean up afterwards. Those experiences helped the young people to know the local people and build good relationships between one another.\n\nSo, many young people wanted to help hold events again and help maintain the circulation of opportunities and good relationships within the community. This is a story from when my mother was young.\n\nThen, how about today? Think about when I was a little kid; I did not have such opportunities to join local events so many times. Because the place I live is kind of old, and there are not so many young people to help with those events. Also, actually, I do not have so many familiar people in my community, and the relationship within our community is not as good as it was many years ago.\n\nAlso, when I was a junior high school student, I joined many kinds of volunteer work, but I did not have many opportunities to help my own community. As long as I remember, every time I did volunteer work, I went to another community that offered to help them. I mean, nowadays, there are fewer opportunities for young people to serve their community. Also, another reason I think recent young people do not help the community is that there is no good relationship among the community."}
{"file_id": "11566.txt", "output_essay": "The issue at hand is whether it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects or to specialise in one subject. This is important because it makes us aware of what students are actually interested in. I prefer it is better to specialise in one subject rather than having broad knowledge of many academics.\n\nThe first reason to support my statement is that when we concentrate on many academic subjects, we cannot concentrate well on all of them. And we cannot do well in all the subjects. When you take one specific subject and specialise in it, you can concentrate well on the subject and do justice to it. For this reason, I think my choice is superior.\n\nSecondly, specialising in a specific subject makes you learn many new things without any difficulty. And you can focus more on a single point in a better way. By researching on the subject, you can discover many new things in that subject. For example, many great people, such as Einstein, devoted their entire life to a specific subject in which they were interested, and many discoveries were made in that field, such as the mass-energy equivalence theorem, etc. Therefore, from this reason, I support my choice as the best.\n\nFinally, not all people would be interested or capable of learning all the academic subjects. For example, if someone is forced to learn a subject in which they do not have interest, they cannot learn it in a proper way. So, it is better to specialise in one subject in which they have interest instead of learning all the subjects.\n\nSo, according to the above reasons mentioned, it is better for a student to specialise in one subject in which they are interested rather than learning all academic subjects."}

{"file_id": "102695.txt", "output_essay": "Many people would propose that students understand ideas and concepts more significantly than they learn facts. I can hardly agree with this. The students who learn facts are more beneficial for them.\n\nFirst of all, tests rarely measure a student's social ability, a student's ability to communicate, and a student's ability to successfully integrate into the world. In contrast, if students learn facts, they can have these qualities more easily.\n\nBesides, if the students are going to be successful in today's society, only understanding ideas and concepts is not enough. They learn facts that lead them to become a successful person. For example, it is rare that one finds stimulating employment that does not require at least a basic knowledge of computers. If a student learns the skill of computer, they will be more well-liked.\n\nLast but not least, learning the facts allows the students to become well-developed adults. If the students only understand the ideas and concepts, they will be a mean-spirited person.\n\nIn conclusion, from my perspective, learning facts is more momentous than understanding ideas and concepts."}
{"file_id": "11644.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with this statement. Basically, travel should be enjoyable and fun, allowing many people to interact during a tour group, not only with local civilians. On a group tour, there is a greater chance to talk to people than when traveling alone. First, a traveler will befriend the tour guide, which is a first opportunity. There are many advantages to traveling in a group led by a tour guide. First of all, travelers just need to follow the tour guide. It is not necessary to make any tour plan or sightseeing schedule. They can just listen and see what the tour guide explains and the sightseeing spots. Travelers can concentrate on whatever they want to see, learn, or listen to. Secondly, traveling with a group led by a tour guide is safer. The tour guide has a responsibility to ensure the safety of travelers, which means they do not go to any unsafe places. Even if travelers do not know whether a sightseeing place is safe or not, they will definitely be safe during the tour. In case of traveling alone or without a local friend, nobody knows if travelers are in an unsafe place or not, which is dangerous. Thirdly, traveling with a group led by a tour guide will be convenient. This means travelers do not waste time getting lost in a place or waste money by being cheated. As I mentioned above, the sightseeing places and time schedules are scheduled by the tour guide. So, travelers can go according to the schedule, which means there is no way to waste time and see anything they want, and they can go to safe places to buy things, such as in shopping malls or restaurants. There is no way for anyone to cheat them. These reasons are not only applicable to domestic travel. I can say it is also applicable to international travel. I recommend traveling with a group led by a tour guide, especially for international travel. Without saying, people in foreign countries speak different languages than travelers, and there are not peaceful places. These are the reasons why I agree with the statement."}

A youngster should always help his community because they are the ones who will help him if he has any problem. They safeguard the youngsters.\n\nFrom my point of view, the young people are not devoting sufficient time to the community. Instead of this, they like to party with their friends. Some utilize their time in studying and tuition. Some find playing games interesting rather than providing support to their community. They have no feeling in their heart, which the people in the past used to have for serving their community. They are unaware of the fact that the community is the one who is going to help them when in need. He should, therefore, work for it to take his community to great heights and create a level for it, i.e., a separate entity.\n\nFor example, Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi was not called the Father of India like that only. He had suffered a lot in freeing his country from the British, who were ruling it for many years. He did not do this all alone. Slowly and steadily, he gathered Indians to support him and carried out several movements to rule them out. At last, his country gained freedom on 15th August, 1947, after struggling for a few decades. The young ones should, therefore, wake up from their sleep and help in strengthening freedom. They should not leave it at stake. Thus, the youngsters' view should always be on helping their community, as Guru Nanak did for the Sikhs.\n\nTherefore, the primary function of every person belonging to a particular community is to have the potential to do whatever his community requires from him. He should serve his community as best as he can."}

For example, a century ago, we did not even have electricity. What scholars did was to develop theories and care about science. For instance, if we did not have Einstein, Edison, or other scholars, there would not have been electricity or new discoveries. We may have continued our lives with primary machines and in dark houses.\n\nMoreover, we have tremendous problems in our world. Even though we have computers, rockets, and flying cars, the end of the world may be too close. For example, global warming contains a big threat, and we need to save our world. How can we solve this problem? Most likely, by thinking more about science (theories), we will probably solve the problem. In fact, we need more scientists to pay attention to this area and encourage new generations to take science courses and think more about theories.\n\nWe do not have plenty of food and resources, and we need to improve them more. Without spending energy on the theories behind genetically modified foods, it would be impossible to grow healthier and more numerous foods.

{"file_id": "10535.txt", "output_essay": "In modern society, students always face the dilemma of which one is more important between understanding ideas and learning facts. This problem is a much-debated one, as it affects everyone in their daily life. Some people prefer the first one to the other, and others have differing opinions about it. Before rendering my opinion, I think it is necessary to take a glance at the arguments from both sides.\n\nIt is quite easy for average people to choose learning facts because of several obvious reasons, such as learning facts being more interesting and easier, and so on. Although learning facts has some advantages, it also has many drawbacks, such as not understanding it deeply. Therefore, we have no complete evidence to suggest that learning facts is always better than understanding ideas. What is more, the innate quality of understanding ideas, unfortunately, is often underestimated; in other words, if you notice the invisible benefits of understanding ideas, you can understand it more deeply. Here, I want to explain a few of the most important reasons.\n\nIt is the ability to think that is the first aspect of understanding ideas that people view profoundly. To illustrate this, there is an appropriate example that is very persuasive. My parents are professors, so they usually taught me systematically to understand ideas and put this on the first place since I was a kid. As time went on, I gradually became a person with the ability to think. And this is very useful to me because this ability makes me more creative.\n\nBesides, a further reason why I advocate this is that it is widely acknowledged that interest is an indispensable part of students' studying, and this issue is becoming a certain concern to many experts. To me, I think understanding ideas is more interesting than learning facts. They are more attractive and fascinating.\n\nFinally, I think understanding ideas is easier for students to understand. Because facts could be different in many conditions and they might be influenced or change due to other factors. In contrast, understanding ideas is more straightforward and is better for students who do not have good intelligence to learn.\n\nTaking all these factors into account, we may safely arrive at the conclusion that understanding ideas is more important for students, and it is more desirable for us to endeavor, and we could also desire a special fulfillment and pleasure."}
{"file_id": "10769.txt", "output_essay": "I find it productive and rewarding to specialize in one subject because one is likely to progress better by staying focused on one area of thought. Mathematicians like Andrew Wiles worked a huge amount of time to prove a single theorem, but he happened to solve one of the greatest enigmas of mathematics. So, devoting oneself completely to solve a problem or to structure a method may result in an effective, all-inclusive, and creative solution or understanding.\n\nHowever, specialization could also mean boredom or a waste of time. Staying up all night, pursuing the same goal over and over again, may cause someone to live an empty life, even to lose focus on what they were looking for in the first place, and thereby make many years' work obsolete. Many great thinkers got stuck in their own minds, thinking there was only one important thing in the world, like religion or fancy metaphysical entities, shutting themselves down from the rest of the world and, more importantly, from the opportunities of growth and understanding they had as human beings. The mind has to flow and explore, take new chances; it is not contained in a box. After all, there are many ideas and projects out there, endless possibilities of how to make a better world. A wide range of abilities and knowledge of various subjects enriches people's lives and opens their minds. The only problem is that it is difficult to coordinate oneself to grow in each discipline; one can get easily distracted, and it is hard to determine what requires one's attention at what time.\n\nStill, the statement could be wrongly put forward. Going back to Wiles's experience, he could not have proved the theorem without having a wider mathematical understanding; if he hadn't looked in archives, others (more specialized mathematicians) would have considered useless or out of the subject; if he hadn't dared to try new methods whenever it was needed. Nowadays, it is hard to think what it would be like to focus on only one discipline or science, since they are all related to each other, and with technology, in significant ways."}

There are several advantages and disadvantages on both sides.\n\nFirst, being a specialist is like a goal you can achieve, fulfilling the dream of being 'the best' that everyone has. It is like a motor for working harder. And, of course, it needs experts for innovation. You have to have the time and power to think about new ways and to be able to make experiments.\n\nSpecialization has always played a very important role in evolution, in general, and, moreover, in human evolution. People became experts and shared the work. So, they got faster and had the knowledge, understanding, and skills all together, which they weren't able to have. In fact, specialization is the key to our culture; without it, there would be no kind of art.\n\nOn the other hand, one might say that experts are very good in one single topic but quite stupid in everyday life. They are depending on others - so there could never be a world full of experts; it always needs people who work together with them and have to share their skills. Another important point is 'having an overview.' If you have knowledge in various areas, you can see the connections, how one thing influences the other. And you can draw your conclusions.\n\nThen, you have the possibility to find surprising answers for problems because you don't think in the 'ordinary' way. Last, not everyone is interested in all the different academic subjects and/or the skills, and therefore, isn't motivated.\n\nIn the context of education - as I understand this question - I would say the best way is a combination of both. You first have to know some basic information and gain skills that are fundamental in every field of academic subjects. But when you find out that one topic arouses your special interest and you have the gift to work in this field and be good, then you should have the possibility to specialize.\n\nIn my opinion, you should never stop learning. And in these times, you always have the chance to ask someone if you don't understand or don't know something. It is very important to be a 'good' expert - concentrate on what you can do best, but don't forget to look around from time to time."}

On the commercial, they say that this cleaner can make old things look new. You immediately think that this cleaner will help you make your old dress made by your mother look like a new Valentino. But instead, it shrinks your dress.\n\nOther commercials show what happened when other people - actors - used this product.

At first sight, we can state this because it is clear that it is easier to be young, in good health, with future perspectives, than to be old, to suffer, and to count the years before dying. Besides, parents often say to children that they are lucky. I can't deny that being old is not a very funny thing overall for the body and health, but on the other side, it implies that you have lived a lot of various things, you have found your way, you have children, and maybe little children. In a few words, at this age, people have done the more difficult and they can use their time for pleasure, for resting, for what they want.\n\nOn the other hand, being young is not such an easy thing and it is often a difficult part of life, overall the teenage period. Indeed, teenage is the time of self-construction, the time to discover love, problems, to take the first decisions... And that is not an easy thing because teenagers don't have a lot of experience yet, neither self-confidence. In addition, the youth is a tricky period concerning relationships: young people are not nice between each other, and a lot of them suffer a lot during this time. Youth, and more particularly teenage, are transition and change times, and for that, they're not always cool and easy. You lose some beautiful things like innocence, purity, unconsciousness, and so on; you enter the real world, and the deception can be high.\n\nAt the contrary, older people have already made their life, they have more experience about life, and thanks to that, they meet less difficulties to resolve a problem.\n\nAll in all, of course, I can't say that I prefer to be young or old, it is not the question, but I think that every age has its advantages and its setbacks. But I do believe that the most difficult is to be young because it implies a lot of problems and questions for which we are not always ready."}
{"file_id": "101765.txt", "output_essay": "Recently, there are a lot of cars in the world. In some countries, one person has several cars. Cars are very convenient, but they also create many problems. I agree with the statement that in twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today, and I have three reasons to support this claim.\n\nFirst, if people who use cars frequently decrease, it will be easier to solve environmental problems in the world. Cars use a lot of fuel and emit bad gas, which is a very serious problem. Bad gas damages people's health. If people are exposed to a lot of car gas, they might get sick. Especially, little children are very weak, and if they are exposed to a lot of gas on the road, they might become very sick. Today, fuel prices are very expensive, and many people worry about money. However, many people use cars frequently. People must think about the environment. The earth is ours.\n\nSecond, if people do not use cars frequently, there will be no areas of heavy traffic jams. In the world, there are many cities where traffic jams occur, especially in developed countries. For example, in Japan, there are heavy traffic jams every morning in the capital city of Tokyo. It is a very serious problem. The Japanese government has made many new highways and roads, but the number of cars has not decreased significantly. I think the biggest reason for this is that the price of cars has decreased, and many people can buy cars easily. The best way to decrease the number of cars, I think, is for the Japanese government to impose a tax on using cars. If the Japanese government does this, the number of cars will decrease.\n\nThird, if many people do not use cars, there will be less danger. A driver's license is easy to obtain. Of course, not all people have good driving skills, and sometimes, traffic accidents occur. If the test for a driver's license becomes more difficult, there will be fewer people who can drive, and traffic accidents will decrease.\n\nIn conclusion, if many people do not drive cars, we can solve many problems. So, I hope that many people will use trains or buses, and there will be fewer cars in use than there are today."}

Here, we have thirteen general years of knowledge, and I think it is not bad!\n\nI think that when we arrive at university, it is right to specialize in only one or two specific subjects because, actually, we live in a world where everyone thinks they can do everything, but this is not the truth!\n\nI think it's important to be a very good professional in one thing to be different from the masses.

There are many alternatives to using a car, and there will not be enough space on the routes for all those cars. In addition, I am sure that there will be certain laws in the future to keep the number of cars at a certain level.\n\nToday, one can use the train, a ship, a plane, or even the public transport system to reach different places. Those alternatives will become more attractive because of technological progress, which will finally make their use cheaper. Many people in Germany, for example, prefer to take the train because it is more convenient and is sure to arrive on time.\n\nFurthermore, the oil price has increased during the last years, and a change cannot be seen. The industry reacted to this problem by building engines that need less petrol, but because of the electronic equipment, the sum of needed petrol could not be reduced.\n\nAnother argument is that cities will become more overcrowded, and there will not be enough space for new cars. For example, in Japan, there is not enough space for new buildings, and the streets have reached a critical size that cannot be enlarged. One solution is that people just share cars to go to work.\n\nAnd finally, there will be certain laws to keep the number of cars at a certain level. The world has many problems with pollution, and governments have just started, for example, to introduce special laws in the faster-growing economies. By doing this, the states want the industry and common people to pay more attention to their use of energy. If this group changes its behavior, one consequence could be that fewer new cars will be bought.\n\nIn conclusion, these are my three main arguments why there will be fewer cars in 20 years."}

But I never dominated in any one subject. This continued when I was in intermediate, which used to worry me a bit, as after higher education, there was an entrance exam for which I had to score very good in academic subjects. But my maternal uncle, who was close to me, suggested making a slight alteration to my study pattern and concentrating on subjects that would be tested for the exam, but said to remember one important thing: that a jack of all trades is better than a master of none.\n\nWhile I was studying in 10th standard, I had a friend who was good in natural science. But he never used to concentrate on other subjects as he found them uninteresting and worthless. Because of his attitude, he got a lot lower marks in the final and could not qualify for the state government higher education college. He had to settle with a private college.\n\nThe main important reason for his downfall is that by gaining a lot of knowledge in one particular field, he might have thought that he had nothing to learn further and stopped learning all of a sudden, which is a dangerous pattern for any individual. Also, he might have gotten bored and stopped concentrating on other topics as a whole.\n\nThe above examples in my life convinced me that by gaining knowledge of many issues and topics, it will help you interact more expressively with your colleagues and make you more socially interactable.

First, it is quite difficult for a group to decide on the best destination that everyone feels satisfied with. Second, during a trip in a group, we cannot have a trip in the way we each like. I think such a trip is far from enjoyment and relaxation. We need to think well about the true purpose of a trip. Traveling definitely is not about getting stressed. In a group, we cannot help but feel certain stress. It is better for us not to have a trip if it applies to us. On the other hand, having a trip by myself, I think I can make my trip meaningful, free from stress, and of course, fun. There are some reasons for this. First, I can go to the destination that I think I want to visit. Second, I do not have to care about other people. In such a situation, I can enjoy seeing sights for as much time as I thought I would like to. That is why I think the best way to enjoy a trip is to do it by myself."}

So many people begin considering how to enjoy their lives. As a young person, however, I strongly disagree with the statement on the left screen, and there are too many instances to support my view.\n\nFirstly, as we know, our society is becoming aging, and our workload is becoming more and more lightweight. That gives rise to a new situation where many elders spend their leisure hours traveling. That is why the travel agency is one of the most lucrative industries in this era. For example, my parents usually spend four months in different cities.\n\nIn addition, many older people have less pressure from jobs than young people. Most of them have fixed pensions. They don't worry about their financial problems. That gives them a chance to enjoy life.\n\nMy uncle gets an incredible pension, and he doesn't save it. He usually spends so much on food and entertainment. Furthermore, our society needs youth to make progress. That can continue a great cycle. If we enjoy life, that means we don't want a comfortable life when we become old. Any developed country should have many ambitious youth to maintain its prosperity. From what has been discussed above, we can finally draw the conclusion that older people enjoy life more than young people."}

Actually, people used to live without cars, but since it was created, there have been more and more cars all around the world. Yet, I truly believe that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years.\n\nFirst of all, considering all the new technology and the constant evolution of the world, I'm convinced that the car will finally disappear. Actually, people change their minds very fast nowadays, and they will soon be bored with the car; they'll need something new. For instance, I hope we'll soon be able to move just by thinking about the place we want to go; it will be easier and will save energy and time. Besides, even if teleportation isn't created, it's obvious that the car will disappear as quickly as it came. Thus, a new means of transport will be created, more powerful and more useful.\n\nFurthermore, all countries are getting engaged in the reduction of toxic gases on earth, and the Kyoto agreement is the perfect example of the world we all want to fight for. Even if some countries don't really apply the rules at the moment, I'm sure they will finally realize what the emergency is and they won't have any other choice than making efforts. Moreover, people are more and more aware that we are acting for the future and for the next generations.

In the case that the person does not know the city or place being visited, I would recommend contracting a tour guide and doing it in a group because they are going to take you to the most important places quickly, safely, and with all the explanations needed to know the place you are visiting. Additionally, you can enjoy the company of other people, giving you the opportunity to meet and share experiences. One of the most important things when you are traveling is to see the culture of the place, for example, the food, dances, festivals, etc. I think that a tour guide can help you accomplish this goal, also providing historical information about the place, which is very important when trying to understand the way the residents of the region visited behave. \n\nOn the other hand, I think that if you have been to the region before, especially if you have been there a couple of times, hiring a tour guide is a waste of money and time, because these kinds of services are usually expensive, and you can use that money for something more productive during your trip. Also, the tour guide is going to take you to places where you have already been. Instead, you can use that time to visit new places in the region, doing something different than your last visit. \n\nSo, the conclusion is that it depends on your previous experience visiting the region.

{"file_id": "106724.txt", "output_essay": "As many other students, I face the decision of whether to have a general knowledge about many academic fields or to specialise in one field only in order to be considered an expert. The decision that will come out will reflect the characteristics of the person. A person with many interests will never renounce the pleasure of knowing more and more different things. On the other hand, people with a passion will tend to specialise in a field that will make them happier and happier.\n\nA general education has many positive aspects, such as a greater flexibility in changing preferences and visions for the future. This kind of preparation gives the possibility to students with no clear ideas about the future to postpone this important decision and take time to identify their main desire. Furthermore, a general education gives much more flexibility in adapting to different job conditions.\n\nA specific education focused only on a subject gives the advantage to the student to be an expert in a field. This is a great advantage on the job market. In the same time, these students usually are much more rigid, unable to change and handle changes. These characteristics are not always required by employers.\n\nPersonally, I think that the best choice for a person would be a solution that takes into account both their own personality and inner desires; for this reason, I do not think there is only one best education.

{"file_id": "105061.txt", "output_essay": "Do successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well? I don't agree with that. I think experience, time, and the higher possibility of success are the main points to support my opinion.\n\nFirstly, experience helps people to be successful in doing one job. If a person has a lot of experience in doing one job, he can usually make the best decision when a problem arises. Compared to a person who makes a decision when he does a new job, he is inexperienced and has no idea which way has more benefits for him. So, he can easily make a wrong or worse decision. Therefore, successful people would do what they already know how to do well because they have experience.\n\nSecondly, we need enough time to make our jobs successful. Working a job to be successful is a long process. A person who does a job which he already knows how to do well saves a lot of time on understanding the basic knowledge of the job. Then, he can spend more time to make the job perfect and make himself successful.\n\nFinally, a person who does a job which he already knows how to do well has a higher possibility of success than those who try new things and take risks. As we know, if we try a new job, we have no experience about that and have to spend plenty of time to understand the job. It is risky to do that because we might find out we are not able to make it successful after spending a long period of time. On the contrary, if we already know a job well, of course, we know what to do to make it successful directly and efficiently.\n\nI disagree that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well, because they don't have experience, enough time, and a higher possibility of success in doing the new job."}
{"file_id": "101568.txt", "output_essay": "It is age that makes our lives, and that is why it is so important to enjoy life. But it is not as easy as it sounds because there are different stages in our lives that come with different things we have to face. And that's why I think that young people enjoy life more than older people do.\n\nWhen people are young, there are three main aspects that make them enjoy life more than when people are old. The first one is the responsibilities they have in their lives. When life is beginning, people don't really have to worry about many things; they normally have their parents or someone who takes care of important aspects of life. And if they have to take responsibilities, they have the energy to do it. For example, paying the bills, being responsible for the house, and many other things that need responsibility and can cause stress.\n\nAnother very important aspect that shows that young people enjoy more is health. Young people normally have no big problems with their health and body in general; they can move by themselves and are able to do things without any physical help. This is very important for us as human beings.\n\nThe last point is the mentality, or also mental health. This psychological aspect also makes young people enjoy life more because they normally think positively, have dreams, and have things to accomplish in their future. And that is also something important - young people have expectations, and so they can do things to get what they want out of their lives, or at least try.\n\nFor old people, things are not just that easy. They have already been young and made a lot of things. They have had a lot of responsibilities, and now they are tired and need to rest, and this aspect makes them have a negative attitude towards life, and so they cannot see other things to enjoy. At this time of their lives, they do not really have much more energy to continue with all these responsibilities.\n\nThe second aspect, and more important, is physical health. Normally, when people reach the old stage of life, they have some kind of limitation that does not permit them to enjoy as they did when they were young. Things take more time to be done, and maybe they cannot even do them. Finally, mental health - as said before, a positive mentality is very difficult to find. Things have changed, and being old is not easy. That is why I say that young people enjoy more than old people, because everything is easier, and physically, mentally, and in terms of responsibilities, it is better being young - you have more things to enjoy life. Energy ends, and attitude is also a matter."}

Who knows, we may be able to do so much extraordinary things if only we were more courageous!\n\nOn the other side, I think that a person who is always doing the same things at work all his life is not happy. It is such a bore to repeat the same things more and more. Why can't we just blow all these annoying works away and realize our dreams?\n\nWe must not forget that we have just one life on this earth, so we must take the example of Bill Gates, who is very famous.\n\nBill Gates, when he was at the beginning of his career, took the risk to put a new conception of how to use computers on the PC market, a totally new project.

Technological advancements, leading to a more rapid pace of life, have indeed brought about a revolutionary change in young people nowadays. This has led to the fact that they do not give enough time to helping their communities.\n\nOne of the most important reasons is the lack of time available to young people for such activities. They are more involved in their careers, families, social, and sports activities. Hence, they seldom find it possible to take time out of their busy schedules.\n\nSecondly, people are much more competitive nowadays. There is competition in each and every field today. It is a time where only the fittest of people survive. Everyone wants to build a good career so that they can provide for their families as well as ensure a bright and prosperous future. In this rat race, they are left with no time to think about those outside their families. Hence, they choose to turn a blind eye to their responsibilities towards their communities.\n\nLastly, they are not aware of their responsibilities and duties as individuals towards others. It is sad that few of them choose to remain so still. There is a need for awakening the youth so that they become more aware.\n\nThere are a few young people who have still managed to contribute largely to their communities. There are many examples of television actors and other famous personalities who have made their mark by carrying out their responsibilities to the fullest. Such people are considered role models by the common public, and they inspire the youth of today to continue with their good work.\n\nThus, it is true that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.

Today, we are in the space era thanks to those risky ideas and doings. When we think about human beings' first space travel, the possibility of returning alive is not much.

When I was a university student, I visited Guam Island with five friends as a graduation memorial trip. After I reached a hotel in Guam Island, I wanted to swim as soon as possible. However, five friends except me did not want to swim and they wanted to go shopping. I could not reject them. I felt that my wants were limited so much. I was not free.\n\nSecond, I cannot meet some troubles if others or a tour guide are around me. I believe that some troubles that happen on the travel, such as getting lost, are interesting things. Three years ago, I traveled to New York in the United States of America. I wanted to go to Central Park after I arrived there. I tried to go there using the subway.

If other people or a tour guide were with me, I would not have lost the way. And I would not have talked to a foreigner. For instance, I would not have met the accident.\n\nTo sum up, by taking these matters into account, I absolutely disagree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide. I do not want to travel with other people, even if they are my friends. If I travel alone, I feel free and can go anywhere anytime."}

As the title suggests, young and old, we can say that young people will have more capability and ability than older people to enjoy life.\n\nThere are many factors for that, like improvement in technology, considering the age factor, stress factor, etc.\n\nAs there is improvement in technology day by day, there are new things for enjoyment, like going for drives, spending their leisure time with friends in pubs and restaurants, many amusement parks that give recreation from their daily workload, etc.Normally, older people cannot make their way to the above-mentioned places because it may be due to their age, health, and some may not know also, who stay in remote areas, about these kinds of places. What most older people want is to spend their life peacefully, free from all tensions, and most of them will spend at their home itself with their grandchildren and by some other means.\n\nMost of the young people will enjoy more compared to older people because of stress also. It is also one of the factors because they have to work all the time from morning to evening with full stress, and to overcome that stress, there should be some means of enjoyment, which were not available at the time of their older ones.Moreover, as they were young, they are energetic and have the ability to roam around the places with complete enthusiasm.\n\nConsider an example of a 20-year-old boy and his grandfather. The boy has many ways and opportunities to enjoy his life as he is energetic, firstly, and there are many ways for his enjoyment as there is improvement in technology, whereas his grandfather cannot enjoy as the boy does because he is older, and his age may not be cooperative with that. It may be also that he may not be familiar with new kinds of enjoyments brought by technology.\n\nAs there is more improvement in technology, there are many ways to enjoy, as mentioned in the above paragraphs, and surely our next generations will enjoy more than what we are enjoying now, as there will be improvement in technology in the coming years, and they will have better opportunities more than what we have.\n\nOf course, there are some ways for older people also to enjoy, but their health conditions may not support that.So, I strongly support the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do, by considering certain factors and examples, which were mentioned in the above paragraphs."}

I am going to give some reasons to support my opinion.\n\nFirst, in modern world society, people are busy, and there are many things going on. I think young people are much busier than in the old days. Study is getting harder and harder; young people may need to spend more time on that. Because they want to get better jobs and better lives in the future, which may give us a happy feeling. However, I believe they will forget about important things as they focus only on studying.\n\nFor instance, friendship, helping people, caring for parents, and brothers and sisters. Volunteering is one of the good ideas. They help people, and they learn something from it at the same time. Therefore, they should make time to help their communities.\n\nSecond, I personally think it is just an excuse. Because, actually, young people have time... even when they are studying very hard at that stage, they will have. If this kind of young people continue to exclude helping their communities, I would be concerned about the future. Because helping society is needed for our life. It is essential to be familiar with the people and community.\n\nWe could find important things from there, and it will be useful for our future.\n\nStill, some may say young people do not care about this; I think they believe because it is only a short time that young people enjoy their life. Nevertheless, I believe that helping something is essential for us to live in this world, whatever that is.\n\nThus, students should make time to help their communities.\n\nIn conclusion, I would argue that it is better to give young people enough time more often.

For this reason, I do not see why in twenty years there could be fewer cars than there are today.

In fact, a lot has already been done to reduce pollution, and I am sure there is still much that can be done. For example, Italian cities and other European cities are making Europeans buy Euro4 and Euro5 cars, which pollute way less than standard cars. This reduction has been possible thanks to improvements in car technology. Every month around the world, there are showrooms that present new kinds of cars, less and less polluting, more and more sophisticated in shapes, motors, and accessories. Some of these new kinds of cars are very expensive, depending also on the brand, while some are cheaper. Industries are doing a lot to make people buy these cars, from rich people to less fortunate people. Not only industries and the most famous brand companies are acting in favor of less pollution. In fact, governments are doing a lot as well. For instance, they organize many information campaigns; they define calendars of days during which people must not use cars in the cities where pollution is over the maximum level permitted, and they finance electric public transportation.\n\nI think these are good reasons to retain that cars will not decrease in number for the next twenty years; on the contrary, it is common to expect them to be numerous but less polluting than they are today."}

The unemployment is so high that it is possible to be well-educated but yet unemployed if you are not specialized enough. On the other hand, a broad knowledge of many academic subjects can be better if you have to manage, for example, your own firm and cannot rely on other specialists.\n\nIt is important to notice that a broad knowledge is the base for further knowledge in these areas. So, if you do not have any variety of knowledge, it is much harder to gain experiences in those unrevealed areas. Especially in the current situation, it is important to be flexible and to be willing to keep on learning during your whole lifetime. If you were a specialist in one certain subject, you probably would not be willing to listen to more actual information because of your status as a specialist.\n\nIt clearly depends on one's character, but my opinion is that specialization is minor in contrast to a broad knowledge of many subjects. As I stated above, the base is the most important thing. Afterwards, there is still time to specialize in certain subjects in which you are interested. If you do not know all the possibilities, you cannot be sure of having chosen the right way.\n\nI would prefer a broad knowledge because then I still have all possibilities. If I specialized and chose wrong, I would be disappointed. You do not know how the future will be; that is why specialization is such a dangerous thing. It is better to be eventually less qualified in a lot of subjects than to be specialized in one that no one needs.\n\nSo, in general, I would agree with the statement. Specialization comes after the broad base of many academic subjects."}
{"file_id": "104966.txt", "output_essay": "I agree that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject. Having more knowledge could broaden one's horizon; serve as a path to discover one's true passion; gain help with talking to other people; and be capable of understanding the world around us.\n\nFirstly, having more knowledge of many academic subject areas could broaden our horizons because we know different subjects in different fields. Each specific subject has its own uniqueness, therefore it would be better to know a bit about each area.\n\nSecondly, understanding more knowledge could serve as a path for people to discover their real passion. Sometimes, if we are always 'inside the box', it would be hard for us to find other hobbies and have the opportunity to think whether it was truly their passion or not. When I was in Grade 11, I studied courses in different areas, such as Chemistry, Accounting, Physical Education, Business, History, etc. I wasn't sure of what I wanted to study in university, and I didn't want to limit my area of study, therefore I decided to broaden my knowledge by taking many academic subjects. However, my friend, who desperately wanted to become a doctor, took all science courses, because she had discovered her passion. As a result, I think it would be better to have a broad knowledge of many subjects before specializing in one, unless you have found something that you really love doing.\n\nMoreover, by understanding more subjects, it would be easier for people to engage in conversations with new people. Everyone has different backgrounds, therefore if you have knowledge from different areas, it could be easier to socialize with people who have different fields than you do. A way of knowing more subjects is to read every section of the newspaper, such as Business, World, Entertainment, etc. This could help one to know more knowledge and therefore be more talkative when meeting new people.\n\nSince the world changes every day, every day something new will happen. If we don't have the basic background towards a certain subject, we will not be able to understand it. Moreover, a lot of subjects are inter-related, therefore you will need knowledge from other areas in order to fully understand the material. For example, business ties with politics, political changes could affect the business environment, therefore it is essential for us to have a simple background of politics in order to understand business changes around the world.\n\nIn conclusion, with all the reasons stated above, I believe that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject."}

By travelling to a certain country or island that I don't know anything about, I must come back with much information about it; otherwise, my trip is useless. The best way to get information about the area which I want to travel to is to go in a group led by a tour guide, who will explain everything about the place: history, values, landmarks, and all the important details.\n\nI found the tour guide very useful last summer when we (my wife and I) went to that Greek Island: Rhodes, which was like a museum in which we studied Greek history. The amount of information we gained about that area of the world is so tremendous, and all that was because of that distinguished guide.\n\nIn addition to the assistance for getting the important information obtained from the guide, he is a great help in every other aspect of travelling, like dealing with the people in the 'strange' place, directing us to the greatest places that we must visit, and all the other daily life matters that, without him, could form a big issue or problem.\n\nFinally, I consider the guide an essential element for a successful trip, and he is indispensable for all the services that he can provide before, during, and even after the trip."}
{"file_id": "105218.txt", "output_essay": "I believe that a strong conclusion stating that having a broad knowledge of academic subjects is better than specializing in one specific subject would be faulty. There are both advantages and disadvantages to the two approaches.\n\nFirst, being an expert in a specialized field is unquestionably necessary. The development of science is based on using the knowledge gained by our ancestors. So, in order to make use of previously conducted research on specific topics and to take them further, we need specialists. A person with a broad knowledge in many fields would not be effective in this kind of situation.\n\nSecond, in our daily life, we can clearly observe the necessity for specialists. For example, think of a situation where you are sick and go to the doctor. The first doctor you visit would probably be a representative of a person who has a broader knowledge of the human body. You would expect that doctor to direct you to a specialist for the specific health problem you have. Then, you would need a doctor specialized in your problem. This situation also illustrates the necessity for both.\n\nFinally, people who are specialized in a topic may sometimes become blinded by the long periods of same kind of work they are dealing with. In such cases, a person with a broader knowledge could see the big picture and would be more beneficial in solving the problems. To illustrate, industrial engineering, which is my major field, requires seeing the big picture in a company as we try to solve the problems in it. When we deal with the problems stated by a department in the company, we observe that the department does not consider the possible causes of the problem, which can actually be caused by any other department. So, my experience from a summer internship indicates the possible disadvantages of working on the same topic all the time.\n\nIn conclusion, we need both specialists and people with broad knowledge since they are both needed for solving the problems of human beings in real life. So, a clear conclusion that one of the positions is better than the other would be very misleading."}

People are influenced to a wide extent on watching these advertisements. Many products are marketed through this procedure.\n\nMost of the products are not as worthy as they are shown in the advertisements. Marketing personnel do not actually show the reality but try to convince the public that their product contains good quality and quantity, but they don't.\n\nFor instance, the advertisement of a beauty cream or a face pack is marketed with an attractive presentation, but that product actually doesn't show much effect on anyone, and the side effects will not be mentioned in that advertisement. Similarly, the products of food and snacks also do not show any growth regarding health but are shown in such a way that they can produce lots of energy and strength in a person. Of course, one can't find the clothes shining so brightly forever with a detergent or wash powder as it is shown in the advertisements. It's all about attracting people in a false manner towards their product. It would be fair enough if the real quality of the products were shown in the advertisements. Only a few products do affect people in the way they are displayed.\n\nIn conclusion, I do agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are."}

I prefer to travel in a group that is led by a tour guide because I might find things easier and more comfortable.\n\nWhile traveling to another country, the main thing that my family thinks about is how we will get to our apartment and who will take us to visit the places in the country. The tour guide is the one who will take us to our apartment or hotel, and he will explain things about the city or the country because he is familiar with his country.\n\nGoing with a tour guide made us learn many things. For example, when we visited England, we found many statues, parks, trees, trains, and rivers. Each one of these was explained clearly and accurately about its time and place, and when it was founded, and how long it will exist; all that was known by the tour guide. We learned many things and we had more experience about this country.\n\nWithout going with a tour guide, we may get lost. A tour guide is like a North Star that guides lost people. Before a few years, when we went to visit Australia, we thought that we might not need to use a tour guide, and because of that, we had a lot of problems and troubles. We were trying to find a park from evening until night, and when we reached there, everyone was lost.\n\nIn conclusion, a tour guide is better to use because he guides lost people."}
{"file_id": "105179.txt", "output_essay": "I completely agree with the statement. Success is attained by forcing yourself to the limits, out of your comfort zone, and conquering the challenge, whatever it may be. Through preparation and acumen, and utilizing what you have learned in your past experiences, stepping out of the comfort zone and facing a challenge directly is the best way to increase stamina and tolerance that will help make you become stronger.\n\nFor example, being a martial art student and observing the successful moves of my mentor and chief instructor, I can confidently state that he practices for success. I met my instructor when he was merely a senior student; once he became the chief instructor and owner of the school, he revolutionized the curriculum to do things that had not been done before - this is getting out of your comfort zone, knowing that you are doing well, but that you know you are capable of further success. The chief instructor decided to expand the curriculum and incorporate social activities that would benefit the people in the community. In order to do this, he was forced to expand his staff on contract - this means that he committed to employ this staff for at least a year -, regardless of the outcome from the changes in the curriculum. To make the story short, the exposure to community activity increased the popularity of our school, and the respect, reputation, and profits that came along with it. It would have been financially challenging for the school to have staff that would have not been needed, had the social activities addition to the curriculum not succeeded - he would have thought of something though. The chief instructor was looking to be more successful through innovation and thinking out of the box, and in my opinion, he attained his goal.\n\nAnother example, and a more common one, is the introduction of Microsoft Windows as an operating system in the 1990s. Before Windows came about, most operating systems were based on prompt and response, and people were used to it. Systems like DOS and Linux that were monotonous, but worked well. Mr. Gates took a tremendous risk in creating a whole new interface to use in the computer, an interface that was more expensive and complex, but turned out to be more effective and entertaining for most users. Nowadays, Windows is the most popular operating system. Taking risks means thinking out of the box; moreover, it takes courage and confidence to materialize the idea. Mr. Gates thought Windows would work, took steps to attain his goal, and succeeded.\n\nIn conclusion, trying new things, while risky, can improve the individual and the outcome through challenging our endurance and tolerance. No one says it will be easy, but if you are persistent enough, you will eventually succeed."}
{"file_id": "103545.txt", "output_essay": "We are living in a modern world filled with advertisements. All advertisements try to show the magic of their products. However, I have little belief in what the advertisements have told me. I think most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are!\n\nThe goal of advertisements determines their poor credit. All the advertisements are aiming to attract as many customers as they can. And how can they obtain this achievement? They give misleading and incredible information about their products. For example, some healthy food will claim its body-building function in the advertisement. But few give any convincing statistical state or trustworthy survey on how it makes an effort on people who have used it. We may see a set of comparisons between a fat girl and a thin girl. But how can we believe it's just the effect of the food? Since advertisements are used for commercial use, most of them will not provide scientific proof.\n\nAnother interesting phenomenon is that famous actresses and actors often appear on the screen to advertise a product. Of course, the actresses and actors are attractive and beautiful. By these kinds of advertisements, we attach the products to these beautiful images. But the truth is, how many celebrities really use the products they recommend? They are just invited to say a sentence, show a pose, and etc. It misguides the customer to some extent. Customers will connect the products to the good images in their minds. Actually, the products are not so perfect as the advertisements said or the customer thinks.\n\nThe reason why there exists such a huge gap between the products in the advertisements and in the facts is that there isn't an effective norm to regulate advertisements. No specific policy has been given to restrict the advertisements. In fact, exaggeration becomes one of the keywords in advertisements. I have already been disappointed to find a real product in any advertisement. Only when our government and media realize the importance of supplying the audience with unbiased and true facts instead of the beautiful lies in advertisements, can we choose the products without doubt, following the instruction of advertisements.\n\nSo, when you choose something to buy, do not trust what the advertisements tell you. Turn off the television when you see an unbelievable product in an advertisement again. A clever customer should try to evaluate and judge a product by him/herself."}
{"file_id": "108118.txt", "output_essay": "There are many reasons why the number of cars in use today will not stop increasing in the future. Just judging from the way cars have become more and more popular and common over the past twenty years, it is unlikely to expect a sudden change in that area.\n\nAnother point supporting that theory is certainly that cars have become more affordable for everyone and also very easily accessible to young people. Most people in the United States of America possess their first own car by the age of sixteen.\n\nAnother problem that, in my opinion, is directly linked to the number of cars and that we are facing today is the problem of obesity in society. In most developed countries, people are getting bigger and bigger, becoming more and more lazy, and therefore more likely to drive a car. Simply because it is more convenient.\n\nThen again, people are also starting to be aware of the direct link between cars and the effect they have on environmental changes. Some strongly object to the idea of having a car because they simply cannot live with the thought of destroying the planet out of egoistic purposes.\n\nIn a television transmission that I happened to watch a few days ago, I also heard a discussion about the earth running out of natural sources such as oil. If there is no more oil, we will have a huge problem supplying our cars. Although that is not expected to happen anytime soon, scientists are trying to find alternatives by developing more natural and environmentally friendly ways to make an engine work.\n\nBut I believe that this will take a huge amount of time and will not be presented to the public in the next few years. So, no, I do not believe that there will be fewer cars in 20 years."}
{"file_id": "105390.txt", "output_essay": "To try to give an answer to this important question, I would say that I don't really agree. In my mind, we have to keep facts in mind to improve and to understand concepts. For instance, when we make some mistakes, we always could and should learn from them. That's why I think that some facts are really important. Concerning Nazism, we can't ignore that it has existed, and this is because people made some great mistakes. They chose to put confidence in a leader who was a dictator, and it ended in a war that we could have avoided. \n\nNow that we know how that kind of ideology can be, we are aware that we better have to choose more carefully. But learning about some other facts is not always as important as it is in this case. Some facts are useless if we consider courses like philosophy. Some acts influence our lives and our behaviors, but some others are nothing interesting to develop conscience and awareness. But when we study this other point, it raises another issue, which is directly linked to my first opinion: we have to learn facts to learn in general. How? Because everything that seems to mean nothing to you means more than you believe. Nevertheless, we can understand lots of things without having learned everything about the subject. We can know about World War Two without being born and having lived during this war. You learn that there were millions of people who died for your freedom, but even if you didn't feel what it was to be afraid of bombs, you can understand what it is like. \n\nSo, to conclude, I would like to underline that it doesn't matter with the way we improve things. The most important is to be interesting when you try to learn something to someone and to be curious when it is you that is learning. We learn from everything, but not only from facts."}
{"file_id": "109774.txt", "output_essay": "It depends on the situation, but there are a lot of situations where people should learn facts, not just understand them.\n\nThere are two examples that support my opinion.\n\nOne situation is when you play soccer. How well you study soccer rules or techniques, you can't play it very well because you need experience from real games. Many professional soccer players, especially from Brazil, played soccer without reading textbooks in their childhood. They just played soccer for fun. Many of them didn't study physics around the ball.\n\nThe other is when you drive a car. In my case, I studied about car engineering for one month, and I thought I had enough knowledge of cars. However, when I drove a car for the first time, I couldn't drive it well. I think that to understand an idea is not enough.\n\nSo, the most important thing is to learn something by using your body, not only your brain. Indeed, there are some cases where you need to understand ideas and concepts, but you can get that kind of knowledge when you learn it."}
{"file_id": "105219.txt", "output_essay": "\"Jack of all trades, master of none.\" This is a saying that a lot of us grew up listening to. The question is whether you want to be a Jack of all trades or the \"King\" of one.\n\nPersonally, I believe that it is better to specialize in one specific subject rather than to have broad, abstract knowledge about many. When you specialize in one subject, you gain a lot of knowledge and authority on that subject. This can lead to a lot of advantages.\n\nFirstly, mastery in one subject can help you with your career. If you have complete command over your subject, you can effectively utilize it to further your career goals. For example, in a competitive industry like the Information Technology industry, if you have a good grip on your domain, it will benefit you much more than having incomplete knowledge about a lot of other domains. If you are knowledgeable about a subject, not only can you do your own work better, but you can also help your colleagues or peers with problems they may be facing.\n\nSpecialization in a subject makes you an authority on it. This can lead to other people looking at you for direction or help if they are stuck. So, not only do you become more popular, but you also gain a lot of respect by helping others out.\n\nLastly, I would say that if everyone just wanted to have broad knowledge on a variety of different subjects, then no scientific or other development would ever have been possible. Take Leonardo da Vinci, for example. Had he not developed his skill in painting to such a high degree, we would not today have been able to exclaim at the beauty of the Mona Lisa. Or Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, who with his skill in music, gave us so many beautiful compositions. Or Albert Einstein, whose immense study of scientific phenomena led to so many inventions.\n\nIn conclusion, I firmly believe that it is much better to specialize in a subject you feel passionately about than to have a lot of unimportant data on subjects you might be just mildly interested in."}

{"file_id": "106772.txt", "output_essay": "I certainly disagree with the statement that 'young people enjoy life more than older people do.' I will explain my point of view along with some examples.\n\nFirst of all, this statement cannot be generalized. There might be some young people who do enjoy their life more than some people who are older. Although I do not think this is connected with their age but more with a general attitude towards life. For example, an older person could be more pessimistic than a younger person. But this person might have been more pessimistic throughout their whole life, even when they still used to be young.\n\nI do believe that there are different ways of enjoyment and different areas that old and young people do get enjoyment from. In my opinion, this is connected to the different life spans people are in at different ages. Each life span, like the toddler's, the teenager's, or the adult one, brings along different tasks. Let's say a teenager does live more on the riskier side of life and does take drugs from time to time or have more liberal sex habits than an adult would practice, this might be due to their wish to experience independence or to define their own personality by testing their own and the society's limits. That is a normal behavior for their age and role in our Western society. In today's society, a more liberal way of life and expression is often taken as a symbol for a happier life. This does not necessarily hold true. Some of these teens, asked about their amount of joy in life, might not be happy with what they have at all. On the other hand, an older adult, living more quietly with their family and having a satisfying job, might not look as happy at first, but if asked, might show a quiet high level of life satisfaction. This so-called joy in life could maybe better be described by the word happiness or life satisfaction.\n\nAlso, another point is that there is a confusion between seeing the older people's lifestyle, which indeed might look a little boring and less enjoyable to a younger person, as connected to their age. Even when the really old people of today were young, their values were different from ours. They just continued living them until today. This is not boring for them, but to us, it looks boring."}
{"file_id": "108870.txt", "output_essay": "The big industries are famous because generally their products are better than those of small industries. I think that the trajectory and knowledge of the company permit us to identify if any product is better than others. For example, I went to a supermarket and bought an unknown oil because it was cheaper, and I did not see big differences between my normal oil and this one. However, when I used this product, I realized that I had wasted my money because this product had a lower quality than my habitual oil.\n\nTherefore, I think that there are famous companies, but this is not a guarantee for a good product. For example, currently, a famous toy company has had problems with its toys because they contain a dangerous chemical. This toy industry is famous worldwide, but this is not a complete guarantee for the quality of the products.\n\nI agree with the idea that 'Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are' because the market is a war for consumers. So, the quality of the products is determined by the people. I think that specialization in the production of products helps people know which product is better than others, because if the company only makes a special product, the products will be more technical and less expensive than before.\n\nThere are products that are better than others just in appearance, but people should say which product is better when they obtain it, because it is better for their options in the market and in their habitual consumption; they have a social function too."}

Those two different groups have different styles of living; and even in those groups, there are many different sub-groups. These differences are based on what you believe or think. Sometimes the differences between a young guy and an old person might be few.\n\nLet's just say that the life of a young person goes around his college, his friends, partying, and basically doing what they do; they wouldn't be able to do no longer when they grow up.\n\nAnd in my opinion, the old people's life goes around having peace, and most of the time, around family. We all know there are young and old people who do not enjoy their lives at all; they have a pretty much boring life.\n\nWe all know that young people are always getting into troubles, they are always having issues and complaining about everything.

{"file_id": "107269.txt", "output_essay": "It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. I agree with the statement for the following reasons: the importance of the capability to think logically, solve problems, and to create future visions. The stated reasons are described in more detail in the following paragraphs.\n\nFirst, a student needs to learn how to think logically in order to understand a problem that needs to be solved. Especially for study assignments as well as work assignments, it is important to determine what is the unknown factor that needs to be found. If the student is not able to do that, the result might not be the factor that was initially asked for.\n\nSecond, if a student just learns facts instead of strategies to solve a problem, the student will not be able to apply the already learned knowledge to a similar problem. For instance, the student knows how to calculate the revenue based on price per product times units sold, but as soon as the units sold are unknown and the given numbers are the price for each product and the total revenue, the student will not be able to solve for the units sold. In order to solve the outlined problem, it is important that the student learns the strategy to solve an equation for different unknowns.\n\nThird, only if a student understands the concept and idea of, for instance, a certain product like a car, only then will the student be able to create further developments of the already existing features. If the student only focuses on learning facts, the student will always limit their knowledge and learning to already existing ideas. Thus, the student will not be able to come up with future visions, which are vital in someone's academic and professional career.\n\nIn conclusion, the ability of a student to think logically, solve problems, and to create future visions or developments of existing knowledge or facts is more important to me than learning the facts. It will enable the student to be successful in their study as well as professional career."}
{"file_id": "109326.txt", "output_essay": "I think that it's much better for a person to have specialized knowledge of a specific subject than having a broad knowledge of many academics. Because being specialized in one subject gets you to know more about it and to be able to discuss it easily and thoroughly without any problems, unlike having a broad knowledge of many academics, because having broad knowledge leaves you on the surface of everything, not being able to dive into any subject. For example, if you were in a conversation session or on a debate about something, having broad knowledge would let you be able to talk for a little bit with everybody using the thin layer of knowledge you have to discuss stuff with people, but if you are specified in one subject, you may be able to get into a deep, interesting conversation.\n\nAlso, being specialized in one subject gives you better working opportunities than the opportunities given to broad-knowledge people. Because these days, institutions want specialized people who can handle complicated issues in business and life, people who can be put in hard situations which they can handle easily without panic and problems, and talking about money-wise, these institutions pay a lot more money for those specified people.\n\nAnother thing is that when we talk about the career issue, specialized people are always remembered and respected everywhere they go, and their names will not ever be forgotten; broad-knowledge people, they are not well-known, or at least the majority of them. For example, when we try to say who is the best in chemistry of all time, we have a name, or when we try to remember who is the best in math, we have names.\n\nThat does not mean that people who have broad knowledge are bad or have less experience, but I think that specialized people leave their memories on the minds of others or they leave their fingerprint on the book of history."}
{"file_id": "106895.txt", "output_essay": "I totally agree with the statement that young people recently do not have enough time to help their communities. There are several reasons why I think so: lack of time and busy life, and unfamiliarity with the community.\n\nFirst of all, I am also one of the young people who do not engage in helping their communities. In my opinion, the big reason is that they are just too busy to go to school. In my case, even if I want to give my time to help my community, I do not have enough time to spend on it because of school. Recently, many students go to private schools far from their houses, not public schools located close to their houses. I also go to a private school. The school is so far that it takes me one and a half hours to get there. Therefore, it is difficult to find and spare the time to contribute to my community because of a lack of time.\n\nSecond, most students, even elementary school students, go to juku school after school because many parents and students are not satisfied with the education of the school or they think they need support for school studies. Therefore, they do not have time even to have family time or to hang out with friends. Students of the age who are taking entrance examinations to the next school, such as high school or university, go to juku almost the whole week. Consequently, they would rather have time to spend with family or friends if they could find the time.\n\nThird, they and I feel that the community is not familiar with us. I am sure all people knew each other's faces and communicated with each other a lot a long time ago. To my disappointment, it does not happen now. I just moved to a new city, so I do not know about my community and my neighbors. As a result, even when there is a festival, I always do not participate in it because there is no one I know. I guess it occurs to people nowadays a lot.\n\nIn conclusion, I am in agreement that most young people do not spare enough time to support their communities. Even if they want to help them, it is not easy because recent children are having busy days. I think we need to find a way to make the community more active at first."}

Traveling in a group led by a tour guide, however, lacks flexibility in the plan.\n\nIn some cities, there are too many famous places, and travelers are forced to choose some from them. In London or New York, for instance, we would have to spend three or four days in a museum if we tried to see everything exhibited there. In such a case, travelers should obey the plans of the tour if they participate in a tour led by a tour guide. People who are especially interested in arts and want to stay longer at a museum should prefer traveling freely.\n\nSometimes I change my plan during a trip. When I visited Germany when I was an undergraduate student, I planned to visit five cities during the one-week trip. At the first place I visited, however, I was so impressed by the beautiful scenery of a river and castle that I changed my plan and stayed there for one week. Consequently, I visited only one city during the trip.\n\nWhen we travel, we often encounter impressive scenery or events at the place we visit during the trip. Traveling in a group led by a tour guide does not allow us to change the plan and stay there for a longer time than we planned before."}

A person can read a lot about a subject, but this will be their habit about a topic. This is the filling of spare time; a person can only do one thing or job well but has many habits. \n\nSpecification about medicine could be an example. The medical knowledge we have reached today is enormous. A medic cannot have all the subjects about medicine experienced. As it is so, it will be superficial and will have less benefit for their patients. That's why medics try to graduate in paediatrics, oncology, or cardiovascular surgery. As you uppergraduate in any subgroup, you should know that subject more deeply. \n\nBut as stated in the first passage, a person can only do one job well; the habits of that person also have supporting effects on their job. As a result, a person also needs habits that will support their job. As a result, for this century, specification is highly required for benefit."}
{"file_id": "108625.txt", "output_essay": "I agree that young people do not invest much time in helping their communities. There are many influences on all people, so also on the young ones, that are different nowadays and in the past. These influences change people's behaviour.\n\nIn the past, the personal contacts someone had were within a relatively small area, and the dependency on each other was greater than today. Therefore, there was more social community, and also young people did their part for the community. Nowadays, the range of people someone knows is spread over a much bigger area, so that there is no longer the close relationship to people in your nearby community.\n\nThere are other factors that encourage young people to focus more on themselves than on others. In the whole society, there is the pressure of being successful with everything that someone is doing. Because these people need the time for being successful, there is none or only little time left to spend it for the community. Also, the interest has moved from caring about the community to caring about oneself. Mainly, people follow just their own business and do not care about others, whether they belong to the same community or not.\n\nAnother reason may be that life is more anonymous than it was in the past. People do not know each other, even if they live in one house; they might not have even met. If people do not know their community, why and how should they care about them?\n\nFinally, I would like to consider the point of responsibility for relatives and the money included. In the past, families lived together much closer than nowadays. People have another opinion of being responsible. Today, they do not care that much anymore about their relatives themselves; they rather care by spending money that someone takes care of the family member.\n\nThere are many influences today that are different in comparison to the past, that have changed the willingness of young people to help their communities."}
{"file_id": "108565.txt", "output_essay": "In my opinion, enjoyment has very different meanings. It varies from one perspective to another. Some people think that singing, dancing, or other entertainment is enjoyment. And others think that reading books, helping others, or watching nature is their kind of enjoyment. So, if we think about age groups, mostly younger people want to enjoy life more than older people. Whatever may be the type of enjoyment, younger people want to do it completely without hesitation or restrictions.\n\nYoung age is the only stage in life where everyone is full of colors, ambitious. The people's feelings are just like beautiful butterflies. Even though nowadays the younger generation has become so competitive and career-oriented, they just don't want to suppress their joys. They are sharing their happiness, sadness. They are going to discos, concerts, cinemas. Here, exactly, the older generation is opposing the younger ones.\n\nOld people are usually more mature and behave like a stoic to situations. They take whatever comes in their life in the same way because their experiences have taught them a lot in their life.\n\nOne important reason for this variation in enjoyment is differences in hormonal levels. As the person becomes old, their hormonal influences become less evident. Their enjoyment levels and expressions directly correspond with it.\n\nEven though there are some exceptions to this, on the whole, younger people's enjoyment is higher than older people's. In my house also, I want to celebrate all the festivals in a grand way. But my parents are always restricting me to that. Though at that moment I feel bad, later in my life, who knows, I might do the same thing!\n\nSo, in my opinion, in general, youngsters enjoy more than old age groups. The reasons might be hormonal influences, attitude towards life, their experiences, or they know the value of money better."}
{"file_id": "107514.txt", "output_essay": "After World War II, one of the bloodiest battles in history, more pacifist communities emerged with the important and helpful assistance of international organizations. Since then, societies have naturally wanted to live in peace without any conflicts therein. Moreover, this perception was supported by economics, and particularly the 1980s was a significant corner for young people who were educated by their parents, who closely lived through the damages of wars around the world. Hence, young people started to feel themselves isolated from society, and their major purpose was occupation and making money as much as they could. Nowadays, young people do not give enough time to helping their communities. I completely agree with this statement because of several reasons. Young people want to enjoy their time in front of computer screens and video games, and they wish to realize their career goals without paying attention to society. No matter what the percentage is, it is obvious that young people love video games. An increasing number of video games are being experienced, and young people avoid being with their family members, friends, and even members of the community. Yet, the community handles various problems that are to be resolved without losing time. For instance, unemployment is a major event for today's societies. Young people appreciate playing video games instead of searching for solutions to unemployment. Since young people are more energetic and active, they can be involved in projects looking for solutions to unemployment. Besides, young people are much focused on making money instead of fundamental social problems of the community. It is doubtless that career goals are important for young people, but major community problems would eventually affect large numbers of individuals soon. In the last decade of the 20th century, foundations played a great role in society because of their supportive function and well-organized structure as well. Be that as it may, regard is to be had on the fact that a widely participated effort by young people led to this success at that time. In a nutshell, I strongly believe that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. Probably it originates from the misleading of youngsters both in school or family, but whatever the reason is, governments should definitely bring a detailed insight to this situation and produce solutions; otherwise, the whole of society will encounter different problems. This is because younger people are those on whom the society is being built."}

Advertisements are a very effective way to create convincing thoughts about something. Every research about advertisements or advertised products indicates that advertisements have the power to manipulate people's thoughts regarding products.\n\nIn our TV and show business times, many celebrities or popular people have been created by our media, and it should be accepted that we love these popular people and grant importance to their ideas. So, the company uses and benefits from this situation.\n\nYou can see many different actors, actresses, and singers as part of advertisements. I believe that if one loves Michael Jackson and saw Michael Jackson in Pepsi's advertisements, after this instance, Pepsi strongly takes its place in his or her mind.\n\nSecondly, advertisements introduce products without presenting their pejorative specialties. For instance, if you buy a microwave oven, you cannot nuke something near a baby or radiation-sensitive people. But it is impossible to see any warning regarding microwave radiation in the advertisements.\n\nIn sum, advertisements are very powerful tools for affecting people's thoughts about specific products. Researches and statistics indicate that advertised products are more popular than non-advertised products.

{"file_id": "108367.txt", "output_essay": "Depending on personal experience, personality type, and emotional concern, different people have different ideas about which people enjoy life most. \n\nSome people think that young people enjoy life more than older people do. While others do not agree. In my opinion, I think young people do enjoy life more than older people do. Yes, older people may have more money, more experiences, but they cannot make time back. But for the young, everything in the world is new and fresh, so they can have plenty of time to experience and enjoy life more than older people.\n\nFirst of all, young people have plenty of time and passion to study new knowledge and everything that just happens in the world. By this way, they can stay in fashion and enjoy life more. You see, according to the survey made by the China Daily, few people older than 50 use computers to work and communicate with others, which is a more money-saving and interesting way to do things. So we must say that it is the young who can enjoy life more. Secondly, I think young people have more time and energy to have fun. They are young and strong, they can have a lot of great activities that older people cannot have. In this way, we can see that young people can have more entertainment. I am a young girl now, and I think I can do everything if I like; I am planning to travel around the world someday in the future. See, I think few older people can have such a dream. And in this way, I would say, young people do enjoy life more than older people.\n\nAdditionally, young people are usually healthier than older people. There is a famous old saying in China, 'Health is the basis of everything you want to do.' And because young people have strong bodies, they can enjoy life more than older people.\n\nFrom the statements above, you can obviously see that young people have more chances, more time, more energy, and more passion to lead a better life. In summary, I strongly agree with the opinion that young people enjoy life more than older people."}

Thus, they may not pay enough attention to their own communities. However, on the other hand, young people nowadays have more opportunities to help others, because we lead a richer and more knowledgeable life than before.\n\nWe can say that young people born after 1985 are the generation of information technology. They have been familiar with using computers since they were very little, even at the age of 3 or 4. Growing up in this kind of background, they seem rather to pay more and more attention to 'machines' such as personal computers, MP3 players, and game players than to people. In other words, they may spend much more time interacting with these devices of high technology instead of with other people, including their communities.\n\nYet, young people who have grown up in such conditions have more opportunities to help their communities. Why? By using their outstanding computer skills, they can help their communities do a variety of things. For example, they can teach elderly people how to use computers and surf the Internet. Things like that are very simple for young people, yet they are quite meaningful for older people who cannot use such technology devices. Connecting with the world through computers, and these older people's lives will change a lot.\n\nIn my neighborhood, there is a young person who likes to teach older people in my community. He said, 'By doing so, it makes his life more meaningful, and he is very happy to use his computer skills to help people.' It's easier for him to do so."}
{"file_id": "104080.txt", "output_essay": "In today's world, cars are the main kind of transportation used for transportation on land. As cities grow and distances get longer, people need ways of transportation more and more in everyday life. Therefore, nowadays almost every person who can afford it, over 18 and has a license, owns a car. If you consider the number of people living on this planet, that would make quite a number. However, on the other hand, ways of public transportation are developing, which reduces the necessity for cars. So what will happen in twenty years?\n\nFirst of all, there is the fact that to get from one place to another, you need to have a way of transportation. For most people, in the large cities they live in today, it is impossible to get to work or to go shopping or anywhere within walking distance. So, they need to have a car or a way of public transportation. Most people prefer having their own cars, and it's easy to see why: methods of public transportation are slow and unreliable. You never know when the bus is going to come, and it's almost certain that you will be late to wherever you're going. Also, buses go slow and stop many times for passengers to get on and off. Metros are usually very crowded, and it is very uncomfortable to travel squeezed against people that you don't even know. Taxis are usually very expensive. Plus, if you go grocery shopping, there is no way you can carry all your bags unless you have a trunk to put them into. Picture yourself in a crowded bus or metro with ten bags full of heavy fruits and vegetables, gallons of milk and juice, meat that is about to get spoiled, and ice cream that is melting all over the floor. Not very convenient, nor is it going to work. This is an example of why at least one car is needed for every family.\n\nHowever, there is the growing problem of pollution and traffic. There are so many cars that it takes you an hour to get home during rush hour when it usually takes fifteen minutes. Plus, when you get to work, or the mall, there is always the problem of parking. Wouldn't it just be great to go and catch a movie or get a bite to eat in the time you use looking for parking spaces? That is why shopping malls and working places have started to schedule service buses which will take you directly from home to work or wherever you are going. Also, there is the problem of the oil resources running out, and put that aside, cars heavily pollute the air. So, instead of twenty people going to a place in separate cars, imagine how much it would reduce pollution and traffic if all twenty people used a bus to go there.\n\nMy opinion is that the number of cars will reduce in the next twenty years. Governments that are aware of the pollution and traffic problem are developing methods of public transportation to encourage their people to use those methods instead of cars. For example, in the United States, carpool lanes have been arranged in big cities like Los Angeles, which you can use only if you have more than one passenger in your car. So, in my opinion, the rising public awareness of pollution, the rise in the cost of fuel for cars, and the development in public transportation will reduce the number of cars in the future."}

In a group, they can take good care of each other if someone is not well.\n\nSecond, having a tour guide is the best way to travel.

I believe that in the current times, communities themselves do not require much help or much time in helping.\n\nIn the past, people of a small town or a village identified themselves as a community and worked towards mutual and communal benefit. There were weekly meetings, and the problems of the community were discussed. Young people, who form the most energetic part of the group, volunteered in solving the problems and in arranging festivals and local gatherings.\n\nPeople were more physically involved in the community. They worked as a team, and one's problem was everybody's problem. It was natural for young people to be the most active component of the community.\n\nIn many modernized parts of the world, the situation is in stark contrast to what it was in the past. The revolutions in communication technology and the advent of the internet have largely deviated people from each other to the computer.\n\nSystems and services have become more efficient and computerized. There is much less need for people, not only young, to be involved in any help, mainly because there is not much help required. People can discuss problems in e-communities and via email and chat.\n\nThe town administration has its public website, and any problem can be posted on it. Responsible people can then take necessary action.

{"file_id": "109910.txt", "output_essay": "In this era of immense competition, modern youngsters spend less and less time towards giving back to the society. There is a downward trend in the number of hours spent doing community service these days. The sense of belonging has decreased over the years, and we tend to take most things for granted. Community service is considered to be someone else's job.\n\nFirstly, students are faced with a heavier workload from schools and colleges, so they have less leisure time. They feel so exhausted after classes that there is little or no motivation to take up some community work. Also, there is high competition, so students tend to spend after-school hours doing extra research or preparing for tests. Say a student is not doing as well as she expects. In such a case, she will obviously concentrate on making an extra effort and studying harder. Thus, community service takes a backseat.\n\nSecondly, when a student does have some time to spare, he or she may have the option to take up a paid job. For example, when one has the option to make money by working in the local cafeteria and earn a good chunk of money, the community service option does not seem lucrative. This is due to the tendency of seeking personal benefits before caring for others. In other cases, leisure time is spent 'hanging out' with friends, watching movies, going to concerts, chatting on the internet, etc. For instance, after a full day at college, two friends prefer to meet up at the mall rather than tire themselves out doing more work.\n\nUsually, the motivation to do community service arises from a desire to present a more attractive resume or for college admissions. However, it would be incorrect to generalize this statement because there are a few individuals who genuinely like to do community service out of personal satisfaction. Some people enjoy interacting with elders at old age homes and get happiness when the old express their excitement over having someone to talk to! Sadly, such youngsters are fewer in number.\n\nHence, community service is declining these days."}
{"file_id": "108264.txt", "output_essay": "In our era, the value of everything is evaluated by its image created in the minds of humankind. The most popular technique of creating the desired image is using marketing methodologies. One of the most valid and prevailing marketing tactics is advertising. Some factions think that advertisements have the power to make products seem better than they really are, while others assert that it is impossible to make a product seem better by deceiving customers, thanks to numerous legal legislations and institutional controls. However, to me, both sides can be correct in different conditions.\n\nFirst, not all countries have laws and legislations for broadcasting fair advertisements that reflect the product as it is. In that case, a producer can make their product seem more qualified in the advertisements. To illustrate, the cream used for decoration on top of cakes. In the advertisements, the manufacturer can use shaving cream instead of cake cream in order to benefit from shaving cream's durability and viscosity, as there are no regulations about the ethics that should be conducted in the advertisements. Because they have the same color, nobody can distinguish the shaving cream displayed in the advertisement from normal cake cream, and all advertisement viewers would probably think that it is a marvelous brand to buy, comparing to others, as no normal cake cream can seem to be of such good shape and durability. As a result, if there is no legal stimulus for advertisements, with the help of spurious counterparts, the product may be demonstrated as more qualified.\n\nHowever, if there is enough legislation for advertising procedures in a country, it is impossible to guile customers by giving false information about a product or using a counterfeit product, as the manufacturer is aware of the fact that they will be punished by the laws if they even attempt to do so. For instance, in the USA, if a producer wants an actor to give a testimony for their product, it is a must that the actor should use the product for six months before the advertisement.\n\nIn summary, in advertisements, it is quite possible to make the product seem more qualified than it is if there are no laws about that. So, more laws should be accepted in that issue."}
{"file_id": "111532.txt", "output_essay": "I disagree because the population is increasing day by day in the world. It is connected with cars as well. Car companies are producing a new car every year. When I analyze the traffic, I see that every car has only one person transporting. Every family has at least two cars. This is because car prices are also decreasing, and people are earning much more money than before. The government must solve this problem, but nobody is doing anything. The government should investigate underground and bus systems.\n\nFor example, Istanbul is a huge city. There are 15 million people living in Istanbul. Additionally, there are 5 million cars in our city. However, Istanbul does not have a comprehensive underground metro network. Moreover, the buses are very old and not suitable for transportation. Taxis are also not cheap. Due to all of these points, people prefer to buy a car and use it for daily work. I think this is a general problem all over the world.\n\nAnother point is the old cars in the traffic. There are many old cars in the traffic that are more than 20 years old. These cars try to work successfully and transport people. In this case, it is necessary to establish new laws for traffic in the countries. For using a car, it must be prohibited for cars more than 20 years old, I think.\n\nAlso, scientists are researching ways to power cars with electricity or water. If it becomes possible, I think the car population will also grow. In the world, oil prices are very high right now. However, electricity or water is relatively free."}

Therefore, to make the argument clear, I will assume that young people are those in their teens, and older people are fifty years old and above.\n\nIn order to establish the argument of whether young people enjoy life more than older people, first of all, I would like to compare the advantages and disadvantages of both young and old. One advantage of a young person is the lifetime they have left, which leaves them more options for the future. On the other hand, older people have death coming faster than those of young people, therefore, they have limited choices they can make. There is a difference in potential between young and old. Although it is arguable that old people have the same potential as young people, there is more time for young people to develop their potential.\n\nAnother advantage for young people is their physical ability. Although there are exceptions, young people tend to be more physically fit than older people. Also, young people have the physical potential, which they can build up, whereas it is harder for older people to develop physical strength.\n\nOlder people definitely do hold an advantage that younger ones don't. From the experience and knowledge they have accumulated from past years, they are able to understand and take appropriate actions, whereas young people are inexperienced, which may cause difficulties in life.\n\nA point where younger people experience a great disadvantage is the restrictions set by law on certain people under age. An example will be alcohol, driving, and other entertainment that youth are prohibited from. Older people have the right to reach all that is possible, whereas youth are not.\n\nWhether old people or young people enjoy life is completely up to the individual. Both have advantages and disadvantages. If I were to make an opinion, it would be that young people enjoy life more, because I only have a view or taste of what it is to be young. Also, people have always been chasing a way to stay alive and young for a longer period of time. This idea supports my idea that young people enjoy life more."}

In this short essay, I will discuss with reasons and examples why traveling is the best way within a group.\n\nFirst of all, we can make lots of friends during the trip. When we are on an airplane, a train, a boat, or a bus, we can all communicate with each other and have fun. One of my best friends, named Kim, I met him for the first time on a bus on a trip with a group to Hangzhou; he just sat next to me, and we started talking to each other, and eventually, we became the best friends. So, traveling in a group can make friends.\n\nSecondly, it is well-organized by traveling with a tour guide. He/She could lead you to the most popular and interesting places that tourists always like to go to. For example, if I go to a place by myself that I have never been to before, I will totally get lost and not know where to stay, where to go, and where to eat, and so on. But if I go there with a group and with a tour guide, things will totally be changed.\n\nLast but not least, we can get more fun by traveling in a group. For example, if I go to a place individually, I will get bored on the airplane or train. On the other hand, it will be more interesting and funny by traveling in a group, because sometimes we can talk about some funny stories or interesting personal experiences on the trip, so we would not get bored.\n\nIn conclusion, I discussed the reasons and examples of why traveling is the best way in a group and by a tour guide.

A person must first secure their position, both financially and mentally, by doing what they are skilled in. Then, there is no point in doing the same thing again and again and producing the same results. For a person to grow in life, they must try innovative means to do the same work or try new things and take risks.\n\nAs we know, doing the same work repeatedly will add nothing but boredom to one's life. To add spice to life, one must try something new. But this should be done carefully and responsibly so that it does not affect one's existing reputation and profession. Let us consider one of the giants in the global economy, Mr. Dhirubhai Ambani, who was the founder and Director of Reliance Industrial group in India. He initially entered the market in the final quarter of the 20th century by starting a textile firm, which he struggled very hard to develop into a very big company. He was very successful and was financially very secure at that time. Yet, he was a true entrepreneur and tried out innovative things and took many risks by entering the petroleum industry. Now, Reliance petroleum is a very big name in the Indian economy.\n\nIn addition to the above-mentioned industries, he also started Reliance telecommunications, which is the first CDMA mobile service in India. He reaped huge profits through this. In fact, Reliance Group has entered the Energy and Retail sectors also. Today, Reliance Group stands among the top 50 companies globally. All this would not have been possible if he had not taken the risks and entered into these businesses instead of holding on to the textile business.\n\nSo, I think it is always better to secure your position first, both financially and mentally, and then try out innovative things and take risks to develop your business. A successful man doesn't rest at any point of time but strives hard to be more successful. Successful people try new things and take risks rather than doing what they already know how to do well.\""}

However, it is too much going on. As much as you know, as much as you are worried.\n\nChildren keep their lives simple, and there is the secret of their success. They can watch cartoons for hours without worrying about what they are going to eat tonight because mom is there to take care of that. Or, they can play with their neighbors all afternoon until they are so tired that it is time to take a nap.\n\nIn the adult world, the situation is so much different. Old people still have fun. They can have nice conversations with friends, go to the movies, or have dinner with their family. But there is not the same energy and enthusiasm that young people have.

At first, you are not dependent on a timetable offered by the guide. I'd like to plan my traveling on my own. If you stay at a beautiful place, you can keep staying and not move forward with the group. Within a group, there are always different points of view, some would move faster, and some like to stay.

You never know whether you like a particular place or not, and to spend money to stay at a place I don't like only because of a group's decision, this sounds not really like a holiday.\n\nPlanning the journey is also a very beautiful experience."}

{"file_id": "115374.txt", "output_essay": "I disagree with the statement. For me, being successful has very little to do with the amount of material things one has accumulated. To be successful, one has to be happy. The two things go together. One might say it is possible to achieve both things, but I think that for that, one would have to dedicate most of their time for that purpose. To try new things and take risks rather than doing what one already knows how to do well, time will pass one by. There will be no time to enjoy the success. Success is doing what one loves, doing it well, making a good living out of it while enjoying the rest of the time with the people you love. What is the point of being loaded with material things if you don't have time to supervise your children's school progress? Definitely, I would rather be very good at what I do, do it well, make a good living from it, and enjoy life afterward with family, friends, and loved ones instead of trying new things over and over again."}
{"file_id": "113036.txt", "output_essay": "In our society, students are confronted with new knowledge in school, but the question of whether or not it is more important for them to understand ideas and concepts instead of learning the facts is another matter.\n\nFrom my point of view, it is very difficult to take sides over the other in this argumentation because it seems to me that there are both advantages and disadvantages.\n\nIn the following passage, I will make my point of view clear.\n\nOn the one hand, I think that it is in some subjects important to understand the idea and the concepts.In this context, I can mention my own experience in my school time.I realized and understood math just because I really learned the different ways in which I could choose to come to a solution.It was sometimes definitely hard to understand.However, it leads to a deeper understanding in this area.Another argument I can mention in this context is the history class I attended.History contributes so many facts of the past which are not essential to become an educated student.\n\nWhile there are positive aspects for becoming aware of a good understanding of ideas, I feel that it is in some subjects not necessary to understand the whole background of the subject.Sport, for instance, is a very theoretical lesson, and the history is not important.\n\nConsequently, my argumentation makes clear that it depends on the topic if a teacher really should confront their students with all the information available or if they better focus just on the important and significant ones."}

If we start having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects instead of concentrating on what our career exactly needs, we will lose the race in the job hunt.\n\nWe all know the famous quote, 'Jack of all, King of none'; that's what would happen if we start gaining knowledge of many subjects rather than one. We would no doubt increase our knowledge, but unless we specialize in all of them, it's of no use.\n\nI would cite an example of myself. I always wanted to be a software engineer, and there is heavy competition out in the market for software jobs. If I had not taken up software as my major in university, I would not have gotten a job. No software industry wants a person who knows 10 subjects but is not specialized in software.\n\nBut at the same time, I insist that we should know a bit about other subjects too, for the sake of our general knowledge and to live in this world. In our school, we read about everything like math, science, geography, history, etc., and that's enough for us to know about many academic subjects. Once we come out of school and join a university, we should start focusing on one particular area of interest, which would ultimately give us satisfaction and better career prospects.\n\nI would like to conclude by saying that specializing in one subject is always more fruitful than learning about a lot of subjects."}

Both opinions are good ideas, but I agree that it's better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects because that's helpful to meet a variety of people in my life and every major is relative to each other.\n\nFirst of all, broad knowledge is helpful in society. I've been in New York City for three years now, and I've met a lot of different people during my New York life. I've met people from other countries, tried different foods, saw different customs, and saw a lot of different religions. That was the very first English class in New York; I had ten classmates in my classroom. Everybody was from a different country, and they introduced each other on the first day of class. I thought I had enough knowledge about other countries, but some of my classmates, I had never heard of where their country was. That was very shameful for me, and I felt sorry for them. Our country is also very small, so some of our classmates didn't know where Korea is; still, some people ask me which part of Korea I am from. When they asked me, I got shocked because North Koreans can't move to other countries. Koreans who live in other countries are all South Koreans. For me, that's very basic knowledge, but other people don't know. At that time, I realized I should learn about other cultures because I felt bad when they didn't know about my country.\n\nAlso, every major is relative to each other. My major is interior design. Before I started studying interior design, I thought I would learn only drawing and measuring. But when I started studying, I had to learn mathematics, history, and art - everything. I wondered why I had to take all these classes. But after I started studying, I realized why I had to study. I had to learn history - how interior design became and who started designing rooms and why. After learning history, I could understand easily and faster. Also, I took mathematics classes that helped me to calculate all my measurements when I draw.\n\nIn conclusion, I agree that it's better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects because that's helpful to meet people in my life and every major is relative to each other."}
{"file_id": "111601.txt", "output_essay": "During the last few years, we have seen a significant difference in the way of life of all people. A lot of events have occurred during the 19th century, like the world wars, the development of capitalism, and religious conflicts, etc. All of these have modified our society in France, or in other countries. I will take the situation in France as my example. What happened in May 1968 has contributed to changing people's minds. Before this period, young people were more obedient and structured, in my opinion. Moreover, I think that they were generally less individualistic than today. Capitalism has developed that feeling, and the consequences of all that are the fact that young people are obsessed with their individual success because times are more and more difficult, and people know that it will be certainly more difficult in the future. So, young people are pressured, and they are conscious that they have to succeed. They work harder at school or have two jobs, like I can see around me, and they have less time to do anything. To summarize, I think there are two principal causes: one, because young people are nowadays more individualistic and do not think in terms of helping other people; two, because they have less time due to the new social model. However, we can see in a few situations that young people are able to help everyone who is in a difficult situation. For example, during the Tsunami, we have seen a lot of young people giving gifts to La Croix Rouge or other associations. Many of them have expressed the desire to go there to help people who were affected. In fact, we can see that these young people can help their communities when there is an accident. So, we can say that it's punctual, and they can give the best of themselves at certain moments. But I think too that this type of population does not make enough efforts to help other people who need their help."}

There have been many accidents concerned with over-advertising recently. Because of the development of the internet, people can buy goods at any time they want. This convenience causes many troubles. People depend on information provided by others whom they do not know at all. But they have confidence in the information, including advertisements on not only the internet but also magazines and commercials, because people have no other information. So, not only I but also many people feel that it is not as well as the advertisement said.\n\nIn fact, I have had an experience. I like to read books, and I found an article on the internet about a book that was supposed to be great. The book was written about history, which I am interested in. I found, bought, and read it. However, all I found was that this book was boring. The reason I wanted to read this was because of the words: 'this book will make a big change in your life,' because the stories in this book were written interestingly. I do not like studying history, but I read about history. I was excited, thinking it must be written like novels, but the book was like a textbook I used in class. So, since then, I do not buy any books that I cannot see the surface of.\n\nBecause of these reasons, I agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. Additionally, companies try to make products seem much better. This is also a reason to make people feel that this is a good product."}

However, others may hold a negative opinion about it.\n\nAs far as I am concerned, I do not agree that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.\n\nFirst of all, people will not study very well if they learn many academic subjects. Because they need to spare their time on so many subjects. We all know that the more you spend on doing one thing, the better the result will be than if you spend less time on doing one thing. The result of spending one hour on study is different from the result of spending eight hours on study. If you spend more time on one subject, you will know more about it. But if you spend time on so many subjects, you cannot deeply learn about them.\n\nSecondly, if you have one special skill, it is easier for you to find a future job. Because you have specialized knowledge in one specific subject. Many companies need people who have special skills. For instance, in Canada, there is a lack of people who know how to build cables. If a person has that skill, he can easily find a job and get higher pay.\n\nHowever, people who have broad knowledge of many academic subjects can easily find jobs, such as in foreign companies, which require people to speak two or three languages. They may be able to speak two or three languages, but they may not know how to write them.\n\nIt is better to specialize in one specific subject than to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects. People can learn very well in one subject rather than in many subjects."}
{"file_id": "109364.txt", "output_essay": "When I read about successful people writing about their lives, their success is always based on their very special new methods or inventions. Moreover, nowadays, a new challenge is to develop brand new ideas. Every human being always seeks new ideas and new products to make them successful. The present world has already been developed too much for regular ideas or inventions. Moreover, people who succeeded always had hard times with them. In my opinion, because they faced their problems and overcame them, they can be called successful people.\n\nFirst of all, the common stereotype of successful people is not being satisfied with the present situation and always challenging themselves to new ones. Walt Disney was not satisfied with his current society's broadcasting. He invented various Disney characters, such as 'Mickey Mouse' or 'Minnie Mouse'. These new characters contributed to obtaining children's attention, and it became the fuel for Walt Disney's success. In addition, he never stopped creating new characters; his unstoppable trying also made his success more shiny.\n\nSecondly, the people who reached their success took lots of risks than ordinary people. It is not true that a person can make their fortune in one try, except in the lottery. Successful people always took higher risks to obtain more new and valuable results from their tries. When Bill Gates was a young man, he attended Harvard University and was respected by others just for attending Harvard. However, when he tried to make Microsoft programs, there were some episodes about him failing at his classes in university. Bill Gates gave up his reputation at Harvard. Normal people usually do not do it.\n\nThirdly, successful people did not stop developing themselves. They always try new things with risk but never give up about it. They try and try until they get satisfied data or results about it. Then they start a new try based on their collected information. Picasso is the famous artist of modern ages, and his one painting values like more than a million dollars. His work at that time was not that noticeable because his painting was too creative. However, he did not give up drawing. He just kept drawing and drawing in his way. After he died, until now, we thought his painting is very creative, and we gave him credit for it.\n\nIn short, successful people try new things although they could take serious risks, and they never give up until they reach their goal. Therefore, I strongly agree with the statement that is given."}
{"file_id": "112269.txt", "output_essay": "According to my opinion, the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know is the one open for debate.\n\nCuriosity has become a driving force that has led to new inventions and discoveries for centuries. From the time when man hunted for food to today, when all the latest technologies are available, curiosity has played a significant role.\n\nIn this essay, I will first analyze the ideology of a successful person and whether optimism and audacity are the only criteria for becoming successful, and base my suggestion in favor of being optimistic.\n\nIf we turn the pages of history, one thing we find common in all the greatest leaders is the quality of being optimistic. They do not hesitate to take any audacious decision and explore new things. Take, for example, George Washington, America's first president, who always showed enthusiasm in trying out new things. The other example is Abraham Lincoln, a person who reached great heights in his career by taking risks and experimenting with new things.\n\nI also support the point that if we do things we already know, we can do those tasks more accurately and with less effort. However, this does not increase our efficiency. Think of the primitive world, where our ancestors were very good at hunting, and if they had never tried to break the old rituals of hunting and started living like civilized people, we could not have reached the apex on which we are today.\n\nObstacles are the milestones that show us the path of success. While overcoming obstacles and taking new kinds of risks, people become stronger and discover new limits of success.\n\nI would like to conclude by stating that if you want to reach the apex of success, then make yourself accustomed to different kinds of risks and obstacles, and in all conscience, you will become successful."}
{"file_id": "109415.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with the statement that says young people enjoy life more than older people do. It is because young people tend to be optimistic towards life, whereas older people tend to be realistic. I am 21 years old now, and I consider myself young, and I think I can do anything I want in my life. It sounds more enjoyable and exciting when people think that they can do everything. However, the older you become, the tougher life becomes, so older people tend to forget how to dream and enjoy life itself. It is probably because of these things: money, family, and health.\n\nFirst, when you get older, you think about money a lot. The money that comes from a job can't easily break your savings. To be an adult is to be independent somehow, so you should make a living by yourself. But when you are young, you can live with your parents and still have a part-time job and spend it on your own. I was the richest when I was in high school, living in a house and doing whatever. When you have money, you can enjoy your life more because you can do a lot of things, especially the money you can spend on your own.\n\nNext, I want to point out is the family. Like I said in the second paragraph, when you are young and don't have your kids yet, you can almost do anything. However, things will be different if you have kids. Your free time will be limited, and you always have to think about your family and also the bills!! Jobs may not be the preferable ones, but you still have to work for your family. Occupation is the number one factor for an adult to be stressed, and stress can make people not enjoy their life. It will be just a pain in the neck.\n\nLast but not least, as you get older, your body will not listen to you as it used to. I don't have any disabilities or bad health or anything right now, but if I look at my mother, she is always complaining about her health. She says she has bad legs and waist, and she doesn't like to go out often. Just sitting at home won't be the best thing to do, but what if there is no choice? So I think I should do what I can do when I'm still young and take advantage of being young.\n\nIn the meantime, there will be a time when I can enjoy my life as older people do, however, being young is just one factor of life that older people cannot beat."}
{"file_id": "112298.txt", "output_essay": "We all pass by difficult moments in our lives that help us gain experience. I agree with the quote that says, 'Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well,' for many different reasons. A person who tries new things in his life will gain experience and knowledge. Taking risks and learning new things will develop a person emotionally and physically. It is a good thing for a person to be adventurous and go through different kinds of situations, because it helps him learn new things and lessons in life. By learning these new lessons and by being more experienced, a person will suddenly see himself as optimistic and happy. His reason for living will increase, because he will love life more and would like to do new things that will entertain and teach him. I think that a risk taker is a very confident person who knows what he wants in life, and he is lucky to have this characteristic. It is a positive action that each person must choose to succeed in life, unlike people who only do what they know. These people who are not risk takers will eventually find themselves not capable of doing anything in life. They will regret not being risky and not doing and trying everything new in life, and will hope and wish for time to go back and do whatever they did not do. The difference between these two kinds of people is that one is ready and willing to learn new things and lessons in life, while the other is being self-reliant, scared, and lazy, and he will not succeed in life as much as the confident, risk taker. In conclusion, taking risks will never affect a person in a negative way. It will help a person to have a great self-esteem, will make his confidence grow, and will make him successful in any situation he is going to face in life."}
{"file_id": "114219.txt", "output_essay": "I agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do. There are several reasons for supporting this position.\n\nThe first reason is that young people have more ability than older people. They can do anything they want to do. Their physical power is stronger than that of older people. They hardly get tired. If they don't do the things they want to do while they are young, they can do nothing after getting old. Especially sports like surfing, running, soccer, scuba diving, and so on. My hobby is traveling abroad. Taking planes is so tiring that I can't endure it for a long time. Last winter, I went to Orlando, Florida alone. I had to change planes twice. Totally, it took thirty hours to get there! I think older people can't endure it no longer.\n\nThe second reason is that young people can recover soon. When they make a mistake, young people can take another way. But once older people make a mistake, even though it's a small mistake, they can't do it again. They can't have another chance. For example, if young people make a mistake and they quit their job, they are able to get hired by another company soon. Because they are young. But older people can't do so. Maybe they are not able to get hired by a company. Because of their age. 'Too old' is a major obstacle.\n\nFor these reasons, I agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do."}
{"file_id": "113518.txt", "output_essay": "Helping a community is a noble act. And I also agree that youngsters today do not give enough time to help their own community. But it cannot be completely attributed to a lack of concern from young people. There are several reasons for this.\n\nThe primary reason is that with so many activities going on simultaneously in young people's lives - studies, projects, assignments, and other more important commitments - they are left with very little time for themselves. And so they prefer to concentrate that little time left on their hobbies or some other personal activities rather than helping their communities.\n\nWith the advent of television and other media, which has revolutionized our lives, we are concerned so much more with what is happening around the world that we actually forget the problems immediately surrounding us. One of my neighbors is addicted to a sitcom, which is played every night, and he actually leaves all his pending work and religiously watches the show. Such is the impact of television on today's generation.\n\nAlso, there is a growing trend among youngsters, especially among college-goers, that such activities are uncool and out of vogue. So some students deliberately avoid helping a community, even if it is against their conscience, just to show that they are cool. To be frank, I myself have witnessed this during my junior college years.\n\nThis kind of thinking, which is actually much more prevalent among youngsters in urban areas, needs a radical change. It is really a shame that youngsters today consider such noble acts as cheap and uncool.\n\nBut there are some people in each community who, after all this, dedicate some time to such work."}
{"file_id": "112005.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. If students learn only facts, then they don't have conceptual knowledge or an idea of where and how to use them in practical situations. For example, a math teacher taught one problem and solved it without giving the concept of that problem, like the formula, method, or steps to perform to solve the problem. This will be difficult for the students if the problem is twisted or another problem is given in the textbook or may be in the examination. They cannot solve the problem as they don't know the concept of the problem given. So, a math teacher should teach the concept of a particular problem initially, and based on that idea, a problem should be solved by the teacher, and then the students will keep the concept remembered, so that they can easily solve any problems based on that concept.\n\nFor every problem, there will be a concept behind it to solve it. Another example is, if we see the physics book, there will be lots of concepts for each and every chapter. In that, there is a chapter called 'Gravitation.' In this, the idea is about the Earth's gravitation. Due to gravity, whatever things are thrown in the air from the Earth's surface will fall on the Earth again because of the gravitational pull of the Earth. If we say to the students that the things which were thrown in the air from the Earth will fall back to the Earth's surface, then they just learn the fact. They don't know the reason. Due to this type of learning, none of the students will become good engineers or any other professionals. Because of the lack of concepts and practical knowledge.\n\nEven if we take a civil engineer student who doesn't know how to build a building and where to build, then definitely the building will collapse.\n\nThat is why it is important for the students to learn concepts and understand the ideas rather than to learn facts."}
{"file_id": "114142.txt", "output_essay": "I agree that students should understand the ideas and concepts rather than spending time in learning facts. I believe that human civilization has come to the zenith of technology not because of learning the facts, but by understanding the ideas and concepts.\n\nThere have been advancements in many areas. If humans spent all their time on facts, our lives could have ended in understanding the history of our earlier generation. And we could not have seen the progress. There could have been no progress of science. So, applying the concepts of the facts will move the world to the next levels.\n\nI have always liked science, which makes me a scientist not because I know the facts, but because of the way I understand ideas and concepts. I am taking a mathematics course, and I will use the concepts and ideas to generate a solution to the problem. If we use facts, there will be times when they will not help get the solution.\n\nIn our daily life, we live with ideas and concepts. A very basic example: if my parents want me to go buy vegetables from the vegetable market, I will decide which way will be the easier road. I will analyze by asking myself using my concepts and not go with the facts.\n\nOur human mind can take in only some facts, and then we have to use the concepts to work towards success. There are many facts in this world, and it will not be within our human abilities to know all the facts. So, it is more important to know how to apply the concepts and ideas to deal with the problem.\n\nOn the whole, I think that facts can only help to a certain level, but most importantly, it is the ideas and concepts that will help us in dealing with daily lives, in our career, and also in work."}
{"file_id": "112184.txt", "output_essay": "It is often thought that young people enjoy life more than older people do, but is it really true? A young person and an old person differ completely in terms of social status, experiences, physical abilities, and other factors that can explain that statement. Let's analyze them.\n\nFirst of all, old people can sometimes be limited physically because of their age, and it can prevent them from doing all they would like to do. Simple things in life can be difficult, such as going shopping, driving, or maybe going out with friends. All these difficulties added together can make their life more difficult to enjoy.\n\nMoreover, older people often have more responsibilities in terms of family or professional goals. This can create a lot of stress and psychological tensions that prevent people from enjoying life to its maximum. However, I have to say that having a family (children...) is not only a source of stress and can therefore be a great cause of happiness!\n\nOn the contrary, young people are often more 'free' psychologically as they are more carefree than older people and want to experience life in a fun way and to enjoy it. They often do not have the preoccupations linked to a family or a professional situation. Consequently, they can be more selfish and have fun in life.\n\nWe also have to notice that young people often do not have the same problem of money as when they get older. Most of the time, the parents supply their children with money and all their material requirements. It is thus an important worry that disappears and allows, in one sense, young people to enjoy life.\n\nFinally, we arrive at the conclusion that young people enjoy life more than older people do because, in a way, they are sometimes unconscious about some worries or problems that can exist in an older person's life. However, some people prefer to make sacrifices during their youth and then enjoy life when they are older, whereas other people make the opposite. But which is the best solution to enjoy life as much as you can?"}
{"file_id": "112333.txt", "output_essay": "It is difficult for me to answer this question because we must define some concepts to answer it. First of all, what is really meant by using the word 'nowadays'? Comparing young people from now to those who have lived fifty years ago is not the same as comparing them to those who have lived a century ago. Let me suppose we are comparing nowadays young people to those who were young just at the end of the Second World War. For that example, it is difficult to answer again for a particular reason: that the society was not the same at that time. The cities were not so crowded, except for a few of them, and then several people used to live in small cities. In that kind of town, people are more likely to know each other than in the big city centers. When you live in a small town, you can, for example, help your neighbor with his garden when he is not at home, and you are more likely to do that kind of thing just because you know him very well. In the cities, almost nobody knows their neighbor. \n\nA second thing that has to be clarified is the meaning of 'helping their communities'. Must there be a benefit for everybody or just for a single person? The actions that benefit all the community are so easy to do for young people, just because they do not care about that at their age. \n\nTo finish, I would like to give a part of my opinion on this subject. I would say that young people nowadays give less time than their parents used to do in the past, but to my mind, this is not due to their selfishness but to today's society's selfishness."}

While he was doing this, he took a risk because, at the time, there were many MP3 players, and generally, people do not want to change their habits in my country. But he did not care about it, and he entered almost every shop, and people started to buy this new kind of MP3 player, and it became common.\n\nHowever, people who take risks do not hesitate because they have a challenging personality. If a person hesitates while making a decision, they cannot be successful. A successful person can make their decisions in every circumstance.\n\nFor example, my friend has a shop that is almost 25 years old. There was a problem with the economy in my country, and many shop owners closed their shops because they could not withstand it. Even though my friend suffered from it, he did not close because he made some important decisions in this circumstance, and he did not hesitate. Now, he is working in the same place.\n\nAlso, successful people are not afraid of anything, such as trying to do new things. Some owners are afraid of doing new things, thinking that if they cannot sell it, they will lose their company. Even those who are company owners think like this; if they did it, they would earn more money and become bigger.\n\nIn conclusion, one who takes risks and does unprecedented things will be successful."}
{"file_id": "111649.txt", "output_essay": "In the fast-growing world, job opportunities are growing. All subjects have sub-subjects to work on or new working areas. Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well, because of earning money and reputation, people's attention, and being imaginative.\n\nFirst, earning money and reputation is the base of all kinds of work and success. People always want money and reputation, at least one of them. Trying something new will always bring you money or reputation. For example, if we think about a good car mechanic, known by his own neighborhood, who starts working on luxury boat engines. A while later, his customers will start to want his help in boat subjects or something else about mechanics because they will think that he is gifted about mechanical things. So, trying new things brings you both money and reputation, and these two encourage you to try more new things again.\n\nSecondly, people's attention makes you happy because everybody asks you something about the thing you have done or invented, wants something about it, or comes near to you and says 'congratulations.' The point is that you are the center of the world at that moment; you think that everything happening is about you, everyone loves you, everyone needs you. This is the food of the human soul and the key to success, so people's attention is one of the most important points of trying or doing new things.\n\nLast, only imaginative people may try new things because they are the ones who try the untried things before. Their brains are successful until their birth; maybe they are really gifted or the 'one.' They can assemble a world only for themselves and live in it. When they imagine something, they can also imagine the result. What does that change? If they do not see success at the end, they do not go into the new things; their brain is working in a different way, they are smart.\n\nIn conclusion, trying new things and the success related to it is about money, attention, and being imaginative. People trying new things can be successful, but sometimes only successful people can try new things because they already have enough courage and brain for that. This is a two-directed road; someone on this road will always be successful or always try new things, and it will end with the other one."}
{"file_id": "117512.txt", "output_essay": "Advertisement is invading our lives. Wherever people drive, their eyes are either on the TV or in the streets, and the advertising campaigns are overwhelming our landscape, making them full of expectations for the products they admire on the screen or in the newspaper. But, unfortunately, most advertisements promise more than they can really deliver to the final customers. The strength of the marketing system of multinational companies' brands makes people dream too much, and the final customers are not very aware of the image technology companies use to make their products more beautiful.\n\nThe message an advertisement wants to convey to the final consumer is delicately composed by the marketing system of multinational brands. The marketing allows companies to sell dreams through their product campaigns. For example, the consumer does not feel guilty about buying and drinking too much Diet Coke because it is said to be produced with less sugar than the original one. Similarly, those who buy electronic machines to do sports at home in order to get slimmer dream of being fit by using the machine promoted by the ad.\n\nMoreover, people neglect too much the capacity of computerizing images. This occurs especially in the cosmetics industry, where brands show off the merits of their products. They build beautiful advertisement campaigns with top models who display beautiful skin quality, which is the result of computer work."}
{"file_id": "115435.txt", "output_essay": "Undoubtedly, I would say that I agree with the statement given here that 'The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.'\n\nMy first reason is that, as we go to a new place, we may not know how the place is, how the behavior of the people looks, what their culture is, what their customs are, what their tradition is, etc. If we go to some Latin American countries, we may find some difficulty in understanding their language, and also, we can't understand their accent even though they speak English. For example, suppose that you planned to go to France; the language the people speak there is French, and you may not understand French, where you need a guide.\n\nSecondly, if the place you planned to tour is a historic place without a guide, you finally end up with the rocky structures you see there. As each historic place has a history behind it, the main purpose of visiting is to know its history, and a guide is the right person to explain it for you. For example, when you go on a tour to the Egyptian pyramids, you may not know who built them, how they were built, but if you have a guide with you, he can help you explain all these details. After all, you derive a lot of thrill and, in turn, great happiness by knowing all these details.\n\nOn the contrary, when you tour alone or with your kith and kin who don't know anything about either the place or the history, you cannot enjoy the place just because you don't know the details, and there will be every possibility of getting detoured. When you encounter mysterious inscriptions scribbled on stone, you alone on your own cannot decode them in order to enjoy the trip to the fullest extent.\n\nHaving considered all the reasons given above, I would say that I strongly agree with the given statement."}
{"file_id": "112115.txt", "output_essay": "I completely agree with the fact that in twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. To support my stance, there are three valid points. Firstly, with the advancing technologies, newer and faster modes of transportation are coming up, such as metros, bullet trains, and intra-city express, which makes it very convenient for people to travel from one place to another and actually consumes less amount of time compared to cars, which generally take more time because of traffic jams and all. People rather commute to far-off places in metros and trains and have already started using their cars as a mode of transportation to the nearest station if they have such an option.\n\nSecondly, with the arrival of the Internet and video telecommunication, most offices find it convenient for their staff to work from their homes, e.g., software firms, business offices, and corporations related to trading of shares, etc. With this trend on, it will take very few years when most people will be working from their homes. This will automatically reduce the usage of cars as most people use their cars to go to their respective offices.\n\nFinally, the most important factor that will determine the reduction in the usage of cars is the scarcity of fuel. In today's world, the consumption of fuel is growing exponentially, and it seems there are no means to replenish it, even though various efforts are being made worldwide. With a limited amount of fuel supply, the world won't be able to sustain the demands of the market, and finally, to come up with a solution so as to reduce fuel consumption, people will be motivated not to use cars and other such vehicles. This will automatically determine less usage of cars in the future years.\n\nIt might be hard to digest, but the way things are turning out to be, it seems we will soon stop the usage of one of the most important inventions of human history. And it can be very well assumed that this time duration will not be more than twenty years."}
{"file_id": "114803.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with the statement 'Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.' \n\nI agree with this statement because if a person only does what they know how to do best, they are not challenging themselves and become just like others who do not try their best around you. To challenge and explore, and to take risks, will lead to success.\n\nTo me, the meaning of success is to do more than you can do. To do more than what you are, you need to try new things or even new ways of trying and take risks in doing it. Eventually, your effort will pay you back in many areas. The success could be different from how rich you are. The money does not define success.\n\nI believe that success is not just about making money but about how to be different from other people, like how much you know and have experienced. You may not be successful even after you try new things and take risks. But the experience you have and more knowledge you have than others makes you successful.\n\nSuccess is in you. How much you have improved from before shows how much successful you are. When you succeed on something that you thought was hard but you tried and took the risk of failing, that makes you successful and better than others, not because you have more money and power than others. Everybody has different situations and different levels of success. And if you succeed in you, the power and money will follow.\n\nThose people who try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well will succeed, no matter how much they have improved or how much richer you are. You are still better than you used to be and did not stay in your comfort zone. That is why I strongly agree with this statement."}
{"file_id": "115952.txt", "output_essay": "I do agree with the statement that advertisements make products seem better than they are. This should come as no surprise, as an advertisement, by definition, responds to an aim. The aim is not to give information to the consumer (for which there is the press), but rather to make the particular product more appealing. An advertisement is supposed to increase the sales of a particular product, which is sold for a profit, of course. So, the manipulation of the human individual is the purpose of the advertisement.\n\nAdvertisements are sponsored and financed by the producer, who essentially dictates what they should say. This fact is known to everybody, so it is even fair to do some overstating within limits. Of course, there are consumer protection laws in all Western countries. These laws discourage an advertiser from making outright false claims. So, realistically, outright lies are probably uncommon in advertisements.\n\nHowever, within this limitation, it is rather easy to make non-verifiable statements or suggestions, which are neither true nor a lie. Anti-aging cosmetic products are typical examples. Of course, nobody suggests that you can stop aging. But most advertisements for such products do implicitly suggest it as an underlying, implicit message, without explicitly saying it, by the layout and setting of the advertisement, etc. Cosmetic products' advertisements always show fresh, young characters who have no issue with aging.\n\nAlso, advertisers usually try to convey a dream, a feeling, and not a rationally verifiable message. For instance, advertisements for expensive cars, watches, and generally luxury goods always advertise the quality and substance of the product, which is greatly overstated, but in the end, the customer buys it for intangible reasons, such as prestige and exclusivity associated with owning a luxury product. It is unrealistic that an expensive Swiss manual watch is more reliable, precise than a cheap Chinese copy. But that is not the point."}

Someone who is successful will want to try anything to see if they can still succeed; if that person only tries things they know how to do well, they are not a really successful person.\n\nFor example, I was good at playing the piano, so I was pretty successful at it at first, but now I've never played the guitar and I tried, and I wasn't really good at it at the beginning. However, I took some lessons and really quickly I got really good at playing the guitar, which means I am a successful person.\n\nNow, I am a good dancer, I know how to dance, but I don't try anything else except dance, so I am a good dancer, but I am not a successful person because the only thing I succeed at is the thing I already know.\n\nSomeone who is successful is someone who tries new things, but they don't know if they will be good or bad, and finally, because they are successful, they are going to be good at those new things.\n\nTo be really successful, you of course have to try lots of things so that you can know how successful you are, because being successful at only a couple of things doesn't mean you are really successful.\n\nFor example, after trying to play the guitar, I can now try another instrument and another one. If I still succeed at every one, I am a really successful person.\n\nSo, if you really want to be a successful person, you need to try new things and take risks rather than just doing what you already know how to do well.

{"file_id": "115743.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with this statement. Successful people try new things because they want to gain new experiences. There are several reasons for this.\n\nAll people who have achieved a lot do not settle for trying new things. As their ambition forces them to strive for new achievements, they want to learn new things, even if it is risky. They consider taking a risk about one different thing they did not know before about it because this kind of people do not like a monotonous life. In my opinion, this life is better than the other. Trying new things adds numerous new concepts to our lives.\n\nFor example, I like playing soccer. When I was in my country, I played soccer every weekend. After a while, I got bored with playing soccer. I wanted to change something in my lifestyle. Before I came to the US, I did not know about American football. Now I am learning about it. I also like it, and I have learned several new rules about the sport, so it encourages me to play it.\n\nThe other example is about taking risks. I had taken PhD education for two years in my country. I wanted to change my education place, even if it had many risks. These included spending a lot of money, passing the TOEFL exam, and completing a new PhD education in the US. They did not know how much money I would spend before. I also did not know whether or not I would pass the TOEFL and complete a new education. I took it.\n\nPeople who are successful develop themselves by trying new things. They create new methods to do something, so they help themselves to try new things. Now, let's assume that a student who prepares for the TOEFL develops new studying methods, so he finds better solutions for studying. Then, he can use the methods for other exams, such as the GRE.\n\nEvery person who has a lot of successes tries new things because of their lifestyle. They do not like doing something they already know. There is a kind of sense that pushes them to learn new things."}
{"file_id": "1000528.txt", "output_essay": "I disagree with the statement about how advertisements are. There are several reasons.\n\nFirstly, excessive advertisement confuses the consumer. Usually, the consumer buys goods based on the information that the company advertises. When the goods are not what they thought about, they must be confused. For me, I wanted to lose weight, so I bought an exercise machine. The advertisement said I could lose weight without suffering, and that was very attractive to me. I immediately decided to buy the machine. Once I used it, I found that it was very difficult to use and demanding. I gave up using the machine.\n\nSecondly, I think that companies that prevail with excessive advertisement lose their reputation. As I suffered the problem mentioned above, I do not have any confidence towards the company. The company still sells the same machine and the progress method of losing weight, I perfectly doubt the advertisement, if they were actually good for me.\n\nThirdly, that is not good for my country's society. Although excessive advertisement is needed for gaining more money, it is not permitted by the nation. That is telling a lie to the customer. Once permitting that advertisement, it would be widespread all over my country. That situation is not good for my country's society. For example, foods are to be sold with the deadline of consumption, because that food is safe to eat. But recently, the deadline of consumption date is intentionally changed by the company. This is very discouraging towards my country's nation.\n\nSo, for those reasons, I disagree with the statement."}
{"file_id": "116293.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. The phenomenon appears in a lot of different categories, but one of the most important ones is business. Success is often related to money, which means that a well-known company would take more risks than a small family business. That is not completely true, since one has to remember that the opportunities of a big company are much higher because they have the financial resources. But if one compares a successful company with an unsuccessful company, one will see that the company with a high profit is risking more than the other one.\n\nFor example, Coca Cola is nowadays one of the most successful companies in the world. But it did not start from the beginning as a big company. It started with only one product called Cola. When Coca Cola was established on the world market, the Coca Cola company raised its profit each year. After that, the Coca Cola company took a huge leap of faith and invested in new products called Fanta and Sprite. That was very risky because the people might not like the new drinks and would not buy them, so that the Coca Cola company would not get back their production cost. But even if they would have lost all the money they invested into the new product, the Coca Cola company would have remained as a successful company.\n\nIn general, successful businesses take more risks to gain even more profit rather than unsuccessful businesses, because it does not matter to them if they lose."}

Because if students are able to understand them, maybe they cannot forget them. But learning is not.\n\nSecondly, to learn facts is difficult. For example, if students try to remember facts, they might spend more time than understanding the ideas and concepts. We should save our life's time.\n\nIf students learn facts, they might forget them. This is a poor activity. \n\nThirdly, learning facts is not cheaper than understanding ideas and concepts.

Reading books is useful in understanding ideas and concepts.\n\nLearning facts is an unuseful way to gain knowledge. We should gain knowledge. So, we can get a job. Getting jobs is very difficult.

{"file_id": "1004000.txt", "output_essay": "It is better to specialize in one specific subject. I have some reasons for my opinion. First, to specialize in one specific subject is very useful to get a job. For example, when you want to be a carpenter, if you learn about carpentry specifically, you can be a carpenter more easily than if you learn broad knowledge, because you learn deeply about carpentry, and also a carpenter does not need too much broad knowledge. Second, having broad knowledge lets you take more time to learn than to specialize in one specific subject. So, it is a very serious problem for people, because their graduation will be late, and the time to get a job becomes even later. Third, to specialize in one specific subject saves cost to learn. For example, if you have broad knowledge, you have to take much money for many textbooks to learn all of them. In contrast, if you want to specialize in one subject, you can get a few textbooks about just the subject. So, you do not have to spend much money to get staff for learning. In conclusion, it is good to specialize in one specific subject because of getting jobs and saving time and cost. It is very important reasons."}

Today, in this competitive era, the time has come when we should rephrase this popular saying to 'Jack of all trades becomes the master.' I feel that a person having wider knowledge succeeds in life. Although specialization is needed to excel in certain fields, but in the developing society where everyone is busy in the rat race, one has to excel in every field.\n\nWe can take the example of so many scientific experiments that have led to new discoveries. Even a simple biological experiment requires the effort of people from different fields, such as chemists and physicists. Had there been no chemist to provide chemicals and reagents for purifying DNA, and had there not been any physicist to develop machinery for us, we would not have sequenced the genetic material in us, and the use of these requires knowledge of these areas.\n\nThe various exams, such as the one I am giving, also make us realize that it is better to have broader knowledge of many academic subjects. Also, I feel that having a broader knowledge increases the learning and application power. We can think bigger and put in our vast knowledge to do great innovations. We should have general studies about culture and history, even if we study science. In various interviews and examinations, the questionnaires are not from what we have learned specifically but about our knowledge, and I feel it's good too because this can only tell how we know about things happening around us.\n\nBroader knowledge not only helps us lead a successful life but also makes us an improved human being. It helps us in better understanding and thus leading a better life."}
{"file_id": "1001309.txt", "output_essay": "In spite of the benefits of learning facts, I believe that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts.\n\nThere are three main reasons why I hold this opinion.\n\nFirstly, I support the idea that understanding ideas and concepts in a field (for instance, economy) gives an overall comprehension of this field and the processes that can occur in that field. Thus, it allows graduate students who enter the labor market to meet the requirements of numerous jobs, even if they did not study certain characteristics of some tasks.\n\nThen, I have the belief that when a student has well understood ideas and concepts in a field, he is then able not only to understand new events that can take place in this area but also to learn from them.\n\nFinally, from my perspective, facts are widely dependent on the time and the conditions in which they occur. Consequently, an event that took place in a certain situation or a certain country, for example, a major workers' strike in France before a change in political majority, cannot be interpreted in the same way as one in Bangladesh during a very harsh time. Furthermore, facts may be linked to a fashion in the way of thinking or the way of producing goods. An illustration of this idea could be the fact that an American citizen sold a lot of French foie gras because he liked it at a certain period, but no longer does so because of a change in both the relationship between the American government and the French one, and the way to consider the treatment of ducks.\n\nHowever, I admit that learning facts may help to understand concepts that are either not concrete at all or a little difficult. As a conclusion, I think that it is both more important and useful for future life for students to understand ideas and concepts. Nevertheless, learning facts can sometimes be necessary."}
{"file_id": "115179.txt", "output_essay": "I do agree that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are, and with good purpose. The main focus of advertisements is to make it seem that the product is the best thing in the world, that it is completely necessary and the most important of all, to sell the product and make profits, which equals money. A good example of these reasons are diet pill campaigns and ads on television. They make ordinarily difficult goals to obtain seem obtainable, making it seem easy, fast, and without breaking a sweat. First of all, they target the one thing humans are concerned about: their physical beauty, specifically losing, gaining weight, or being healthy. Today's men and women understand the importance of having a healthy body and being in shape for different reasons, these being: health-related issues such as heart disease, diabetes, morbid obesity, etc., and other more psychological reasons are: the stereotypes of being pretty and skinny in a judgmental society that thrives on superficial beauty. Healthy bodies and weight loss come from: healthy eating habits, exercise, and well-organized planning. Diet pills advertisements make it seem as if you could skip all of these steps and still achieve your goal of a healthy shape and body, which, in irony, is not healthy or recommended by doctors because the risks are endless. Still, people buy these products because they want to be the lovely young lady with the tight body or men want to be that guy with the washboard abs to feel good physically and mentally. To understand how this operates, we must look for the obvious reasons of why the product would seem much better. First of all, the image of expressing the easily unobtainable as obtainable is key in selling the product and therefore making more money, and secondly, when watching a television ad, look for the little black paragraphs in which the truth about the product is stated, and they don't want you to know quickly. This isn't a new practice; every product will seem the best to make a profit out of it, but it is up to us to be educated and informed about the product we hear or read about to make a wise decision when purchasing it."}
{"file_id": "116669.txt", "output_essay": "I think that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts rather than to merely learn facts, henceforth agreeing to the statement.\n\nOne of the best examples to support this statement goes back in time to before the Renaissance period in Europe. The Roman Catholic Church at that time was the ruling authority. They proposed false facts, stating that the Earth was the center of the solar system and that all the other planets revolved around it. This was taught to the masses, and at that time, preference was given to the facts, even if they were untrue, regardless of the underlying concepts on how a solar system worked. So, even if the fact didn't have any underlying idea or concept, it was given importance, thus resulting in people living under a lie.\n\nNow, if the idea that understanding and conceptualizing was more important than just learning mere facts was presented at that time, there would have been a great advancement in the knowledge of the universe even before the Renaissance period.\n\nThe statement also supports one of the idioms that 'necessity is the mother of invention.' If students are exposed to only facts, which are a kind of invention by others who understood ideas before, there would not be any room for free thinking, and the resultant, which in this case is the future (students are the future), would be stagnated!\n\nAlso, I believe that some facts can be altered and/or proved wrong by understanding ideas and concepts. Again, the example stated above serves for this statement. At the Renaissance period, the false facts were proved wrong by free thinkers like Galileo with the help of their ability to understand ideas and concepts. Great discoveries and inventions were made at that period, and many new facts were made.\n\nThus, all and all, we can consider that one needs to develop ideas and concepts in order to make facts in the first place, and that facts are just a resultant part of it."}

The same things can be done by older persons if their health is good.\n\nMaybe, in my opinion, young people can enjoy life with more sports than older persons. Young people have a young body with many energies to spend. They have resistance and a young heart full of energy.\n\nBut older people have, however, many other valid ways to enjoy life. They can spend time in the parks of the cities, they can feed animals in the zoo, they can play cards together, they can play some instrument, like the guitar or piano. All those opportunities, however, produce smiles, and older people feel relaxed.\n\nAnother important thing to sustain my opinion is that older people have the power of the experience of their past life. This is an important force for their soul. Memories of the past bring them to feel strong emotions, maybe romantic emotions.\n\nAt this point, it is very hard for me to come to a conclusion. I'm a young boy with many wishes, and those wishes are also a strange way to enjoy life. I spend a little of my free time imagining, imagining, and dreaming of the future.

Publicity is one of the trends man uses to increase the popularity of his products. So, I'm kind of disagreeing with the statement that 'most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.'\n\nNowadays, we get to see big celebrities like TV and film actors and actresses, and even sports persons, flashing every now and then on television, endorsing a product or in newspapers. People may fall for these traps and can end up having a product that is actually not worth those huge amounts if not inspected properly. I can't deny the fact that, sometimes, in competing with similar brands, these advertisements do show some false statements, and just because people trust these brand ambassadors blindly, they end up buying that product. So, that's why I don't completely disagree with the above statement.\n\nBut, at the same time, in my opinion, viewers should see these advertisements vigilantly and, before buying them, they should examine the product and check out the validity of the statements and claims made in those commercials. It is the duty of the customer to keep in mind that there are some agencies who overrate their own products to improve sales.\n\nAlso, in a country like India, there is a governing body called 'ISO' which checks the authenticity of products and, after a series of close inspections, gives them the authority to be sold in the market. So, with such authorities like 'ISO', overrating a product and advertising is not easily possible.\n\nAdvertisements help the viewer to discriminate between the good and bad qualities of the product by comparing it with other similar brands. It also creates awareness in the minds of customers about newer and technologically advanced products.\n\nSo, in conclusion, keeping in mind the advantages of advertising, we can't make a generalized statement that products are made to seem better than they really are. It is as a 'customer' our job to check the authenticity of such products."}

However, it can be sometimes harmful for the consumers who do not pay attention.\n\nFirstly, there are too many ways to attract consumers to a product. We can use the internet, TV, radios, and advertisements. All of them are effective. By using a famous footballer or model, you can increase the popularity of the product. On the other hand, companies use cameras and light illusions to show the product as more attractive. Additionally, this method can be used to show a big one as a little and a slow one as a huge one. In addition to these mechanisms, the advertisements given on TVs or the internet are repeated so many times in order to persuade and convince the consumers. This puts pressure on the consumers to try the product. The last factor for me to attract consumers to a product is its price. As we know, if a product is cheap, we always think that it is the best suitable one for us. It is a quite wrong statement, in fact. Thus, companies know this situation and use it as a most well-known weapon.\n\nIn spite of the stated facts below, there are also some advertisements that reflect the obvious and fair appearance and usage of a product. In such a kind of situation, we can try to trust companies that mark on it. For example, some marks like BMW, General Electrics, and LCW are most well-known producers, so we can trust their products and advertisements.\n\nConsequently, in our global and technologic world, all companies try to take a role in world trade and make much more money. Furthermore, we can say that the world's management is related to some big companies. So the smaller ones try to be in this huge budget.

For example, people in those days organized events for the whole community; they were together in a social community and helped each other wherever they could. But this statement can be made for all people in my grandmother's village, not only for young people. On the other hand, my grandmother and also the other children in her age had to work a lot at home and on the field. So they did not have a lot of time to spend together or to do things for their community.\n\nFurthermore, I think nowadays young people are also socially active. It depends more on where they are living. In rural societies, in a small village, for example, the connection between the inhabitants is much closer than in urban areas. In a big city, in Zurich, for example, people do not spend a lot of time helping others. As bigger a city is, the more individual and isolated people are. They do not have enough time and also not enough connection with others. And the consequence of this individualism and this isolation is that people, especially young people, are not integrated into the whole society; they have only their peers, but they are not much connected with, or related to, people from different ages or different social and educational backgrounds. These people do not even think about helping their communities. But that is not their problem; that is the problem of the whole society and the difference between urban and rural life."}
{"file_id": "1004376.txt", "output_essay": "I disagree with the statement 'the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide' because I think that when you travel and want to see new things, it is better to have your own time and to manage your time according to your preferences and needs. Sometimes, when you are traveling and have to be with a guide and a group of people, you don't have enough time to look at the things you like, to analyze the things you see, or the time to enjoy the things you like best. For example, for me, it is very important not only to see the monuments and learn about the history of a place but to taste the food of the place I'm visiting and to have time to talk with the people who live there. In conclusion, I believe that not everybody has the same interests when they are traveling, and that many times a good book can replace a guide; it is only a matter of reading about the place you're visiting. So, I would recommend buying a good book, looking for information on the internet, and then taking all your time to do the things you really like, to enjoy your trip."}

But as long as selling cars provides remuneration to the car industry, one can presume that the number of cars in circulation in the future will mostly depend on whether it will be interesting to buy a car in, let's say, twenty years.\n\nQuite a number of statements are in favor of a reduction of the world's car population in the next years. First, the fact that a good part of the estimations we have tells us that the Earth's oil supplies won't last forever. In fact, with the technologies we are disposing of, we can allege that fuel won't be at our disposal anymore by the year 2050. It will anyway have become pretty expensive.\n\nSecondly, global warming being an issue that has to be faced, the world's population will have to decrease its use of fuel, and thus of cars. Stricter laws will imply less pollution in the future.\n\nEventually, the evolution of customs worldwide may occur with the decrease of the number of cars in the next years. Since people are gathering in bigger and bigger cities, the use of subways and buses will grow.\n\nBut the major point is: if the fact that there will be fewer cars in twenty years is not even certain, what is for sure is that cars will be different.\n\nWhy could the world's population demand for cars grow? The first answer is mere: the human population will grow over twenty years for sure. The car demand being correlated to the world's population, the global demand could be more important in the future. Cars can also use less fuel for the same distance, and new petroleum fields can be discovered.\n\nBut since it will soon be more economical, new supplies of power will be used in the car industry. For example, oil provided by vegetables can be used with success, like in Brazil, not to talk of hydrogen energy.\n\nEventually, the question of the global evolution of the car population worldwide is open. I personally allege that there will be more cars in the future, but that they will be more respectful of the environment."}

But having this kind of strategy might prevent us from completing our necessary improvement.\n\nFirstly, all kinds of sciences have complex structures that no specific subject can be thought to be completely independent from other academic subjects. Having no knowledge about other academic subjects is something that will always limit us during our studies. For instance, a computer scientist like me may never need information about sciences like physics or chemistry during university studies. But if one day, I need to create a software for a company that produces chemical products, I will need assistance from other people for everything that is related to chemistry. From the projects I have made for the industry, I realized that having some knowledge about every topic really helps. In fact, a computer engineer cannot be seen as a real engineer if he does not even have basic concepts of general engineering principles. He will always be incomplete and in need of help from other people.\n\nIn addition, as far as I have learned from the software industry, having broad knowledge of many subjects is something that separates you from other people in the same area and makes you chosen instead of others. If we really want to be good in our jobs, this cannot be succeeded by just concentrating on one subject.\n\nAnother fact is that there are so many interesting academic subjects in science. We may be happy if we can spend some time on some other subject and improve ourselves. It is not a good thing to limit ourselves to just one subject all the time as there might be lots of topics that might be interesting for us.\n\nIn conclusion, I agree with the statement that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects. As we have time and resources to get knowledge about many academic subjects during our university studies, we should try to get familiar with the highest number of academic subjects and we should not limit ourselves to just one top."}

Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities since they have no connection with them. There are some reasons why they have no connection.\n\nYoung people have some new interests and habits. They are addicted to entertainment devices, such as TV and computer. They watch what happens in the world on TV and connect with people from all countries through the internet. This makes them not communicate with their communities.\n\nOn the other hand, parents do not give enough information about their customs, such as what manner to speak or behave towards their communities. This makes young people less familiar with their customs, so they find other things to be familiar with.\n\nFurthermore, nowadays young people have to study harder than they had to before. The university exams and high school entrance exams make them concentrate on their lessons and do not let them take an interest in any other things. So, young people cannot communicate with their communities.\n\nThe young people are supposed to be helping the community.

The fact, to some measure, is how the situation has been developed. The facts help students to understand more efficiently and quickly because the facts can explain details about the situation, and they can obtain a better idea about what they are studying.\n\nThere are many ideas and concepts about topics that depend on the way a person understands the facts. To explain this opinion, I'm going to give you an example: The fact that one child has to study is a general idea, but there are many concepts around this fact. However, the fact always has to be known, and as a result of it, many ideas and concepts begin to be developed. For example, some people can say that they don't agree with this fact, but many people agree with the fact that it is so important for children to study, and they should do it. Only in this fact do we have two different ideas, and if we continue analyzing the fact, we are going to obtain many reasons to agree or disagree with it, but the fact doesn't change; it is like the root of the situation or topic.\n\nIn conclusion, I think that it is more important for students to understand the facts, and then they can understand the ideas of others and make their own ideas about the situation and prove it."}

As an example, I would like to talk about my grandfather: until the age of almost eighty years, he enjoyed his life. During his lifetime, he had a lot of terrible experiences; in fact, he went to the Second World War and he lost his first son. All those experiences gave him additional strength.\n\nI also think that being an adolescent can be very hard because, in this sort of twilight, you still don't know what to do when an important choice has to be made. On the other end, elderly people have gained the necessary experience to make pondered and rational choices. As another factor that makes me state that you can still enjoy life even if you are old is that, in modern days, there have been many improvements in the medical field that, as a consequence, brought about an average better condition of elderly people. All those factors - a broader vision of things given by experience, a deep knowledge of oneself, and the recent improvements in the health condition of elderly people - make me see my future years in an optimistic way and make me look at the future with no fear."}

With this invention, a lot of developments occurred in people's lives. It provides a lot of opportunities in transportation, especially shortening the time spent on the way. However, the invention causes many problems in terms of the environment and daily city life. Thus, I do agree with the statement claiming that in twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today, since people are becoming more aware of utilizing a car and the new regulations of governments in terms of the protection of the environment and measures to decline problems about daily city life.\n\nThe main environmental problem arising from the use of cars is air pollution. According to statistics, more car use causes more pollution due to gases produced by a car motor. Thus, nowadays, people are more aware of this danger. Therefore, they may tend to use their cars less to prevent air pollution.\n\nThe use of cars also leads to problems about daily city life, such as traffic jams. Because most people living in the city have cars, traffic is generally overcrowded, so people waste a lot of time to arrive where they want to go. Due to this problem, they start to use public transportation instead of using their own cars.\n\nIn short, because of environmental problems and daily city life problems, people tend to use fewer cars."}
{"file_id": "1003553.txt", "output_essay": "I do not think that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than today. It is unlikely to happen because automobiles represent a huge engine for today's economy, and some people won't let their gold mine be closed.\n\nFor example, let's think about the tire industry and the position of Goodyear or Pirelli regarding the decrease in the number of cars in the near future. I have no doubts they would use as many resources as they have to undermine every idea or project that could result in a contraction of their market.\n\nAnother example is the fuel industry, better said the business of Mobil, BP, Texaco, and a few more brands. They have been investing billions of dollars trying to avoid the development of alternative sources of energy for automobiles. Their biggest business is to produce car fuel, and they won't let it go so easily. If they are contrary to car transformations, logically they will fight fiercely against automobile diminishing.\n\nAnother example of how economic issues won't let the number of cars go smaller is the fact that public investment in Western countries consists mainly of road building. About 50% of the public budgets all around Western countries are used to allow car circulation. If the number of that kind of vehicles radically goes down, it will produce a huge administrative collapse since the traditional political economy would be menaced.\n\nIn conclusion, neither the tire industry, nor the fuel producers, or the public planners and administrators of Western countries will allow the number of cars in use to decrease. In fact, I think in twenty years the economic pressure around the car-related industries and economic fields will not only impede the decrease but will boost automobile use."}

Although some people may argue that cars cause certain problems, such as crowdedness or air pollution, I do not foresee any change in the number of cars in use in the coming twenty years.\n\nIt is debated that cities are so full of cars that in the near future, people cannot use cars due to the crowd. Besides, the traffic jam that cars create is proposed as a solution by decreasing the number of cars. But one should also take the vital importance of cars to human life into account. Cars are integrated into the lifestyle of people. They are used ubiquitously in public life. People go to work, or urgent patients are delivered to the hospital by cars. In fact, a car is a symbol of civilization.\n\nA second point is that cars lead to problems is the air pollution. Exhaust gases are thought to cause air pollution, and the greenhouse effect is triggered. It is true, but this does not mean that the number of cars in use should decrease. This problem can be solved by changing the energy source that cars utilize. For example, solar energy or hydrogen energy can be considered as alternatives.\n\nIn conclusion, in my opinion, the number of cars in use is not expected to decrease.

At this game, people with a broad knowledge of many academic subjects and a sense of conversation will have the upper hand. However, once the dinner has ended, such proficiency in so many areas might result in being little more than an annoying flaw of character.\n\nKnowledge is a vital tool to understand ourselves and the world we live in. So, what is wrong with trying to know as much as possible in as many academic subjects as possible? One answer to that question could be that the pursuit is self-defeating; indeed, the more we learn, the more we realize we know little. Given this state of things, pursuing knowledge for its own sake might seem absurd. The acquisition of knowledge should be motivated by something other than intellectual pleasure.\n\nEach person has their own personal interests, career objectives, ambitions, dreams, or big unresolved questions. These could drive people to want to know more. Moreover, these forces will often lead someone to look deeper into one specific subject than in others.\n\nOn the other hand, valuing knowledge for its own sake will lead people to waste their efforts in an incoherent way in a vain attempt to know more. Finally, a motivated approach to one or a few subjects might lead someone to understand things better, to find answers, or even to achieve something.\n\nTo conclude, it might be better to specialize in one specific subject than to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects.

My point is that fun could mean a lot of things to a lot of different people.\n\nFor older people, fun could mean just watching television or going for a long walk. For example, my grandfather, who is about 75 years old, has a lot of fun having food of his kind. Yes, this is true when a person has reached a particular age; they start pleasing themselves or having fun with venial things like these. This does not mean that they are not enjoying their life. They have their own ways to enjoy it.\n\nYounger people might enjoy life as they are presently, but this does not mean older people have not done what the younger people have. Moreover, the older people have done everything the younger people have. What this means is that enjoying life and fun go hand in hand and also change as the needs of the people change when they grow older. It all depends upon what the individual pleases themselves with to have fun at that particular age, like in my grandfather's case, it was the kind of food he liked to eat. In my case, it's enjoying life sitting on my rooftop with a guitar.\n\nHence, commenting on the statement, I would like to assert that fun could mean different things for different people. Therefore, older people have as much fun as younger people do; the only difference is the means of having fun or satisfying themselves."}

Although organized tours are usually cheaper and more convenient, I think traveling on your own is a richer experience for several reasons.\n\nThe first reason for my belief is that organized tours bring you to the most touristy sites. These places are overcrowded by other tourists, and, as a matter of fact, attract many local merchants who sell small commodities at expensive prices along the way. For example, on my trip to China, the tour guide showed us a part of the Great Wall called 'Badaling.' The place was full of people; I could hardly walk up the wall, and it was very unpleasant! On a second trip, I went myself to another point of the Great Wall, which was further from the city than Badaling, but there were many fewer people. Also, the scenery was much more spectacular.\n\nThe second reason why I dislike organized trips is that you don't have the choice of the timetable. Every visit is precisely scheduled, and we should not stay overtime; otherwise, the bus or tour guide would leave you at the point where it dropped you. A visit to the Louvre museum in Paris is not worth it if you can only appreciate the 'Mona Lisa' painting and not contemplate the other, less famous, paintings.\n\nLast but not least, I strongly believe that the most interesting part of traveling is when you make contact with the local people. In my trips to foreign countries, I learned a lot through the visit of the country, but I also learned many things about the culture through conversations with locals. It may be disgusting to see Chinese people spitting in the street. But once you understand that they do that to reject bad elements (such as those coming from pollution) instead of keeping them in their body, you may find it smart or at least understandable. Communicating with people is how you begin to respect their culture.\n\nTo conclude, based on my experience, I always recommend people to make a trip on their own and not with a guide. This is the best way to discover, understand, and respect a culture."}

We have learned to respect our elders and people in our society. Therefore, I would not like to agree with the statement that young people are not giving enough time to their communities.\n\nYoung people attend colleges, studying different disciplines - science, commerce, humanities, etc. But they participate in a lot of other activities outside their curricula. There are numerous clubs and organizations formed by youngsters that involve themselves in various kinds of community activities, like protecting the environment by spreading awareness among the people, fighting for social evils like corruption, etc. In my university itself, there are several student societies like these. For example, the Nature club, whose members spend their time making people conscious about issues like noise pollution, the harms of plastic, etc. They express themselves by various means, like banners, conducting quizzes, and so on. Similarly, there is another club that raises its voice against many social problems prevalent in my country, for example, dowry, female foeticide, etc. I myself am a member of this organization, and we organize various activities like trips to local neighborhoods, staging street plays to spread our message.\n\nAnother aspect that shows the commitment of young people to their communities is their increasing interest in political issues. In my country, right from college, students compete for different positions in university politics, and they have an important role in bringing important national issues to discussion forums where students can discuss possible solutions to them.\n\nYoung people also contribute towards the economic and technological development of their communities by implementing new ideas.

In this context, I would like to add that many alumni of my college who have now gained important positions in society contribute by giving donations to various social organizations.\n\nI do agree that there are some youngsters who forget their people in order to earn money, who leave their countries for a better life, but a large majority of them, including me, are determined to serve their communities from where we started our lives."}

As they are young and healthy, they can do things that older people could only imagine for their days of youth, which have already passed. \n\nFor instance, an older person cannot participate in an adventure sport. They can only sit back and relax while watching younger people do it. With their back pain and long list of medicine to take, it's even hard to imagine it. Even if they have the heart to do it and the brains to work for it, even then they are unable to do it as their body does not respond to these lofty thoughts. \n\nIt's easier for younger people to adopt new things, but it is quite difficult for old people to do the same. As a person matures in life, even their thought processes change. They get more into the guiding thing than doing it actually, and in that also, generally, people don't like guidance; they want to learn it on their own by experimenting with it. This further leads to the cut-off of elder people from the younger ones. When you don't have much people around, life cannot be enjoyable. \n\nEver wondered why all the players, workers, etc. retire after a certain age? It's because of their reducing ability and diminishing spirit. An old person has to give way to a younger one, no matter whether he likes it or not. Imagine life as a coach of a team shouting orders at the team players and thinking of the days when he himself ruled the field. He is there not because he wasn't good but because he cannot do it anymore. \n\nTo some extent, this can be explained biologically as well. At an older age, your senses begin to diminish, and these are the only source of communication with the outer world. In such a condition, how can you expect a person to enjoy more? With age, the body begins to wear down, and the healing process starts taking longer time. Older people cannot enjoy anything to its limit. \n\nEveryone must have heard their parents or grandparents saying, 'Those were the best days of my life.' A broad grin comes on their face when you talk to them about the days when they were young. You cannot expect a bigger proof than this when they are themselves admitting it. \n\nSo, it can be concluded without doubt that younger people enjoy life more than older people do."}

I would agree with the statement.\n\nThe main reason to support the statement is that trying new things and taking risks sometimes gives innovative ideas and better insights to solve a problem at hand. For example, Einstein, a famous scientist, continuously tried new things and figured out innovative methods to reach a conclusion. As a result, he has given the world new theories and explanations that the world was unaware of. Einstein is one of the world's greatest scientists ever known.\n\nSecondly, doing what we already know how to do well is just blindly ignoring the changing factors surrounding us. For example, my father knew how to make a spear very well. I learned the art of spear making from my father. But with all the technological advancements and innovative methods around, I cannot say that the method known to me is the best method. Today, spears can be prepared with machines that are faster and more accurate. So, in order to do things well, we need to have a clear understanding of the changing environmental conditions.\n\nThirdly, if people do not try new things and do not take more risks, then the world economy would not grow and would come to a halt. For example, Bill Gates, the founder of Microsoft, took a risk of venturing into the computer industry when critics predicted that he would fail miserably. He continued to work hard and was able to succeed in the end. Microsoft generated huge employment opportunities and created products that helped ease certain tasks significantly. Microsoft helped the world economy grow at a faster pace by introducing technological advancements and generating employment. Bill Gates today is one of the richest persons in the world. Had he not taken the risk of starting a new company, he would not have been successful.\n\nIn conclusion, people who try new things, taking calculated risks, succeed. People who only do what they already know may become successful, but not to the same extent achieved by people who take risks."}
{"file_id": "1003689.txt", "output_essay": "I do not believe that in twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. Many factors contribute to my belief. These factors include the current state of driving, current drivers, and development in the area of driving. Through this investigation, it will be shown why I disagree with the statement.\n\nThe current state of driving today is one that has morphed several times to reach where it is at. Before cars ever existed, people found other ways of transport, such as boats and horses. The general aim was to be transported or transport items from place to place. The first car that was produced revolutionized the transportation system. People became more time-efficient in reaching where they wanted to arrive at. Technological advances are made every day, so as cars started to become faster, people started to lose sight of the purpose of a car. Now, faster cars constitute faster drivers. People now place more importance on the pleasure of speeding and performing stunts rather than getting to where they need to be. This state of driving has an effect on the drivers.\n\nToday, we find that more adolescents are interested in cars than before. As young adults, they enjoy extremes and risks, and the young age at which they are granted a license does not help. Most accidents in my country, Bahrain, are attributed to the speeding of young people, and the fact that the mortality rate increases each year seems to have no effect whatsoever. Now, for a driver seeking an adrenaline rush and a living-on-the-edge attitude, the right technology has to be developed.\n\nAs I mentioned before, cars today are faster and technologically better than before. We should acknowledge that advancements will not cease, and if we take other life factors into consideration, we see that cars are demanded and are needed even more. As job requirements relating to cars change, so do car expectations. New roads are always being built, and so faster, more reliable cars need to be engineered according to the newly built roads.\n\nNo matter what is done to reduce car usage, such as increasing the age requirement or investment in other modes of transportation, I believe that people cannot give up on cars due to the privacy and efficiency it provides. Logically speaking, if the world progresses, we go forward, not backward, and so in conclusion, forward to me means more cars and not less."}

And someone, of course, has many more opportunities to be distinguished in a challenging and difficult environment than in a simple one. Actually, in that last kind of environment, a lot of people may fulfill their duties in a cogent way, and we generally expect them to do so; consequently, it is a normal situation that does not lead to any particular kind of success.\n\nOn the opposite, by having a challenging career, someone may face many quandaries and diverse kinds of problems. The exposure is bigger. By being in risky positions, people are not expected to succeed every time; they may fail, but when they manage to solve a problem or develop a difficult or new business, then they are distinguished and become successful people.\n\nAnother important point is that being in a challenging environment and taking risks allow people to break the everyday life routine. Actually, by facing new and difficult situations, people do not have time to get bored. Their motivation can be very huge, considering the stakes. By following that idea, we can assume that people may fulfill their duties with more enthusiasm than in less risky positions. Actually, we can easily get bored by doing something we know well, so we could give less importance to our job and replace it with other things, which is not at all to be underestimated.\n\nPeople may have different priorities or qualities in life that are not suited to a complex environment.\n\nFor these reasons, I do agree with the statement, and my opinion can be easily verified with successful people, such as politicians or businessmen, who have faced difficult positions."}

For instance, traffic jams are becoming more and more usual not only in big cities, such as New York or London, but also in small ones, such as Lyon or Bilbao. It is known that the car is the most used way of transport, and all of us use it to go everywhere, although the gas price is getting higher and despite the pollution that it creates. That's the reason why I believe that the amount of cars in twenty years won't decrease, and, actually, I think it will increase for several reasons.\n\nFirstly, the number of people who belong to the labor force is increasing, and unemployment, on the contrary, is going down. So, more people working means an increase in funds for those people, and more people who need to go to work. Maybe not all of them will buy a new car, but many of them definitely will do so.\n\nSecondly, living standards are becoming higher as time goes by in developed countries. Then, although some years ago there was just one car for each family, nowadays there are usually two at least. And as living standards are going up, the number of cars will go up too, as parents will start buying cars for each of their sons and daughters.\n\nLast but not least, we are living through the economic explosion of some developing countries, such as China, for instance. The economic growth in China is huge, and the increase in car sales is huge too. All the international companies are going to China for both selling and producing cars, as their past production is not enough to cover the actual demand. According to the opinion of the most famous economists, they think that this economic period is expected to last many years more. Moreover, this phenomenon does not affect only China but also other developing countries, such as South America, and so on.\n\nIn conclusion, I sincerely believe that all of these factors clearly explain that the number of cars is going to increase, and it will be bigger in twenty years than it is now."}
{"file_id": "1006666.txt", "output_essay": "I completely agree with the point that it is always best to travel in a group led by a guide. A guide is a person who is especially appointed by the government for the benefits of the visitors. He is capable of providing explicit information about the tourist places. So, why not take the benefits of the service provided when one is in a group?\n\nSuppose you are traveling down in India with a group of friends. Here, the inscriptions giving tourist places' technical details are very limited. So, a guide will thoroughly relish one with the dates, history, and all its related matters. Moreover, if the guide is not hired, it might happen that some of your friends may go to other directions as per their interest, lose the fun of being together, and acknowledge less information.\n\nIt's always greater fun to be together while visiting places. Else, one may get bored. So, if a group has hired a guide, it will be rather involuntary that the group will stay bonded. So, there's no risk of losing someone behind on the trip.\n\nThe process of seeing new things will be extremely sequential and meaningful because the guide will proceed step by step, giving out intriguing information. The group members might have some doubts regarding the monuments. So, it might happen that one might be able to understand the history better based on others' doubts. They could even discuss more things if they have come on a school assignment trip for the history class. Also, the guide will not dare to skip things in order to save time and get more money, as he fears the number of people. It usually happens in India, though. But more people, greater the interest, and this directly affects the enthusiasm of the guide.\n\nA group could even share the tour guide's expense, so they could hire a better guide than an individual. It's more a harmless option, giving all the group members equal benefits with all the fun combined with traveling."}

In my opinion, young people enjoy life more than older people do, and particularly very young people, like children. I do not mean that being old is boring, but I think it is more exciting to be young. It recalls a French proverb that says, 'We are not every day twenty years old.' \n\nFirst of all, it is a fact that children and teenagers are more carefree than adults and elderly people. They do not worry about any problems that adults often have. Their only priority is to go to school, which leaves plenty of time to enjoy life. \n\nBy the way, young people have a lot of things to discover. Specifically, children who do not have any experience of life. Going to the cinema, to the zoo, to the circus enables children to apprehend the world they are living in. A few years later, young adults will discover new aspects of life, such as sexuality and human relationships. \n\nFurthermore, young adults meet fewer problems than their parents. They are not yet confronted with renting a house, paying insurance, managing to get a job, and so on."}

With technology and its effects on daily life, everybody has started to encounter new things that make their lives easier than before. For example, the washing machine, dish machine, refrigerator, television, and, as a last step, today there are cellphones, computers, and the internet, etc. All of these, which I mentioned, are making our lives easier, and I am sure there will be more inventions later. \n\nBefore these inventions, there was cooperation in every area; women would do the washing duty together near the river; they would bake bread together too, or farmers would be helped by others to clean the farm. From the time technology interfered with their lives, people started to do these activities at home. This led people to be a little bit alone. Maybe this can be defined as good, but I personally define it as 'bad'.\n\nOn the other hand, what I can define as 'good' is that helping people is now easier. For example, if you want to make a donation, you do not need to go to the charity or the bank; you just open the internet, type the address, and give your credit card number. It is so easy.\n\nFinally, because of these reasons, I strongly believe that young people are giving enough time to helping the community."}

They are less bothered about their community. Every youth has to play a certain role in the community. He has to serve for the benefit of the community and future generations.\n\nOften, youth benefit from a community, and when they achieve their goal or reach a better situation with the aid of the community, they forget the help rendered to them. For example, in developing countries, many students are provided reservations because they belong to a certain downtrodden community. The students, after achieving success, are not indebted to the community and don't try to help it.\n\nBut there are some instances where this is not always true. Consider the case of an Indian student going to the United States to pursue higher education. He checks out the members of the Indian community in that college and contacts them beforehand. The members of the community then arrange for his transport from the airport to the university campus and then take care of him for two to three days. Since the basic idea of this community is to help other students, and in this aspect, young people are succeeding.\n\nThere are also several youth who try to help their communities. When a person leaves their country and achieves success, they do not forget their motherland; they try to help their native community. Take the case of many Non-Resident Indians. These young people try to help and fund various charity organizations in India.\n\nSo, though I agree that young people nowadays are not giving enough time to help their communities, I feel that this is not always true because there are some instances where young people spend their time and money for the benefit of the community."}

First of all, I like to enjoy the journey in my own way. I always like the pleasure of freedom. Arranging the travel is hard work, but it is quite interesting. However, to be led by a tour guide, I have to obey the instructions he makes. I have to follow the whole group to go to somewhere I don't want to, I have to go to the places ordered by the tour guide, eat the food ordered by the tour guide, even go to the toilet at the time fixed by the tour guide. So, do we hire a tour guide or a commander? Furthermore, the tour guide always says the same thing, just like the travel book. I can see it in the hotel or through the Internet; why should I hire a tour guide for this? \n\nSecond, which is even worse, is that tour guides only have the most profitable routes, so there are many places I can't find a tour guide. Especially for some very exciting undeveloped districts, it's very hard to get a tour guide. Last time, some friends and I wanted to go to a mountain in our province; after we explored all the websites of the tour companies, none of them had this route. We had to go by ourselves.\n\nThird, someone claims that traveling in a group led by a tour guide will save money. It makes sense sometimes. But business is business; you have to pay extra money for the guide, not the journey itself. Moreover, some tour guides will bring tourists to shops, malls, but not the places we want to. Just because these shops, malls will pay the tour guide for bringing business. I even heard that some tour guides cheated and blackmailed the tourists about eating, transportation, etc. It's quite difficult to find a good tour guide.\n\nTo sum up, I do not like to travel in a group led by a tour guide."}

So, I bought that bag with my credit card. When I received the bag, I was disappointed to find that it was not as big as the photo. Then, I swore not to buy any bags through the Internet anymore. My parents had bought a massage machine through television. They said it seemed to be very comfortable and would make them feel relaxed. So, they determined to buy it. But they felt that the machine was not as comfortable as they thought. They said the person who used it to massage seemed really satisfied. How come they did not have the same feeling as that person?

{"file_id": "1009747.txt", "output_essay": "Whether most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are is a good question. The advertisement is made to increase the selling of the product. So, the major qualities of the product that people know, the more they sell. Then it can be that some advertising makes products seem much better.\n\nAn example is the figure of food products; in the image on the box, they seem very beautiful and also very good to eat. But when you open the box and see the product inside, you understand that the product on the box is very different.\n\nWhen I was a child and I saw the advertisement of a toy, I would have wanted that toy because in the advertisement it moved a lot, spoke a lot, and had beautiful colors. But when I took the toy, it was static, spoke only four or five words, and had bad colors.\n\nIn this case, the advertising is used to increase selling by using little children who, when they see something that looks beautiful, want it. There are also some rules that say that advertisements must respect the quality of the product, but these rules are not always used. To tell the truth, there are also some advertisements that make products seem as they really are.

{"file_id": "1006416.txt", "output_essay": "Travel is an activity that could be traced as far back as the beginnings of humanity. Thanks to travel, remote lands were populated, empires were built, and civilizations were conquered. Over the centuries, travel has had a social connotation: an activity that is usually done in a group. However, that does not mean that it is a uniquely social activity. Many individuals often travel by themselves and enjoy individual travel.\n\nTravel is either a leisure or a business activity. For the purpose of this essay, and due to the nature of the question, leisure travel will be addressed. Tourism is a multibillion-dollar business that responds to a wide range of market demands. Over the years, it has become more and more refined. A person, or a family, can find everything from vacation packages to the Caribbean to tours to space.\n\nTraveling in groups led by a tour guide are often well-organized trips: the number of people is set, the destinations are well-assessed, the timing for each activity is carefully structured, and the tour guide is usually a tourist professional. People bond together when traveling in a group. In addition, and because of economies of scale, another potential benefit of group travel is the lower and more affordable costs for the tourist. Group travel is often cheaper than individual travel.\n\nHowever, group travels led by a tour guide may also have disadvantages. People in tour groups are tied to the destinations, schedules, and timing of the tour. If someone wants to visit a different place or stay longer in a stop, it is likely that such options are not available. Also, they are often tied to the meals and hotels offered by the tour. So, if a person does not like any of these, it would be very hard \u2013 or more costly \u2013 to change it. In summary, people who travel in groups led by a tour guide are more restricted than when traveling by themselves.\n\nThere is no right or wrong answer for advocating or rejecting group travel led by a tour guide. It depends on the individual or family's preferences, as well as on the available budget, and ultimately the degree of privacy and restrictions that a person is comfortable with when traveling."}

However, my guide could still provide lots of information that I had never heard of. Therefore, I can say that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.\n\nFirst, tour guides can provide lots of information. When we travel alone or in groups without guides, we have to depend on guidebooks to gather information about what we are looking at. This gives us a limited amount of information. However, guides have studied for a long time. For example, to get a tour guide license in Japan, a tour guide needs to major in Japanese culture. So, they know many things that we cannot learn from books. For example, at the Guell Park constructed by Antoni Gaudi, there is a famous bench that is really comfortable because the design considered human biological structure. Our group thought that this bench showed another genius aspect of Gaudi. However, our guide told us that this bench was not made by Gaudi, but by another architect who worked with him. No book included that fact.\n\nSecond, guides know a lot about the region, so we experience special things. Guides know where to have great meals, where to buy the best gifts, and they know about local culture. For instance, my guide suggested one restaurant, and we had a meal together. My guide told me that if I showed the chef that I was enjoying the meal by making a certain gesture, then they would get appreciated. I did it, and I got extra chicken soup for free.\n\nTour guides are experts. They can offer information that is not mentioned in books. Since they know a lot about the area, we can experience many things that other tourists cannot. The best way to travel is following the lead of a wise and smart tour guide."}
{"file_id": "1006488.txt", "output_essay": "In order to compare the lives of young people and older ones, it seems necessary to start off with a brief description of the average young person and the average older person.\n\nYoung people enjoy themselves in activities such as meeting friends, going out, doing sports, or listening to music. On one hand, these activities are fun and help a young person to relax after an exhausting day at school or work. But, on the other hand, all these activities cannot be enjoyed without a certain amount of money. Because of that, young people can easily get into a rush of working really hard, maybe even having a job while studying at high school or university, and spending the money in the evenings and on their weekends. They keep switching directly from the status of making money into spending it and forget to just settle down for a moment and simply sit down and read a book or something like that.\n\nSometimes, young people even start working almost nonstop so that they can just stop most of their work and have fun later in life, which is the worst of all cases.\n\nOlder people are usually the opposite. Most retired people enjoy a slow day without getting into rushes or being stressed. They have no fear of sticking to everyday habits, which provides a basis for a settled and enjoyable life. They don't feel like they miss out on things when they go to bed early every once in a while, which is a problem a lot of young people share.\n\nIf people try to compare these two different types of enjoying life, a basic problem shows up immediately. If someone put an older person into a young person's position, he or she would think it's unbelievably stressful. On the other hand, the young person would probably call the older person's life entirely boring. The only difference is that most young people enjoy their lives at a way higher risk of becoming stressed and getting in a rush with things.\n\nSo, after all, a young person doesn't enjoy life more than an older person does; both enjoy life just in totally different ways. Still, one should not forget the fact that we are discussing stereotypes here; there might still be a lot of people at all ages that don't enjoy their lives."}

All of them are part of students' society services.\n\nUsually, those serving clubs are very popular among students in my university. Their common main concern is to help the whole society become better, but because they focus on different groups of people, they divide into various kinds of clubs. These clubs will recruit new members at the beginning of the semester and then arrange all the members into different groups to design helping projects. Sometimes, it takes a whole semester to prepare for a big project, which may conclude several universities and carry out together during summer or winter vacation.\n\nThese students really do some miracles to the communities, even the society, by donating their ideas and efforts to go on some activities such as picking up every piece of paper on one specific community, giving a bath to the old who live alone, or offering free after-school tutoring for children in remote regions.How could one say that there are no young people willing to spend time participating in those works simply because there are many students who spend their time right before the computer or in KTV?\n\nHowever, there are still shortages of human resources when it comes to helping the communities or society.

Down the lane, about twenty years from now, the number of cars being used will decrease considerably due to many factors.\n\nA car can effectively work for a maximum of fifteen years. After fifteen years, most of the parts in the car would be worn out, and the efficiency of the car decreases. Even if the car is used beyond fifteen years, it may release hydrocarbons, which may increase pollution.\n\nMost importantly, our native government is taking measures to implement the idea of using a car for only fifteen years. After fifteen years, the car has to be sent back to the showroom or thoroughly checked to use it, so that the car used will not increase pollution.\n\nThe demand for petroleum products has increased significantly. To run any vehicle, we require petrol. Unfortunately, we are running short of petroleum products. Due to the scarcity of petrol, the number of cars will be reduced, as middle-class people may not be able to afford to pay such huge prices for petrol and maintain a car.\n\nNowadays, the roads we use are congested due to traffic. The number of vehicles is increasing daily, adding to the traffic problems. The traffic nowadays is so congested that we can reach our destination more quickly on foot rather than using a car. To have a smooth ride on our car, we wish to have a spacious room to drive our car, but unfortunately, there is little chance to expand these roads. So, people are finding different alternatives for their daily work.\n\nOne of the most interesting aspects is the problem of obesity in many people. The food habits and nutrient contents in the food have changed a lot, and they have no time to do exercise to keep themselves fit and healthy. Cycling provides a good chance of exercise to the body, and there is hope that many people may switch to cycling in the nearby future for a short drive where they used cars before.\n\nI can conclude that the number of cars in the next twenty years will be fewer than the cars in use today because of the problems mentioned above. The main important problem for the reduction in the number of cars is the availability of petroleum products and health problems. In order to overcome these problems, people may switch to various means of transportation, reducing the number of cars used."}

They would rather spend their time enjoying in some playground or a film theater rather than doing some social work for their community. The younger generations nowadays would prefer to stay out of helping their communities to develop because they are interested in other aspects. They would be less concentrated on helping their community because of some ego feelings, which their fellow colleagues would never do. They are very busy with their academic career, and they do not have much time left for helping communities.\n\nIt would not be the problem of the educational institutions for having such a tight schedule of academics. But it would be the sheer interest of the younger people to have the community. It would be their personal interest for helping the community. Likewise, there are very few younger people who would rather show some interest in helping the community. It would be the older people who would like to help more rather than the younger people because they have no work tensions. It would be rather correct to say they have much less work tension rather than the younger people. So they would surely have some advantage over the younger people in helping their community.\n\nIn conclusion, I would like to say that younger people have very much less time for helping the community when compared to older people. It would help the community grow faster if younger people show some interest in their community because they are much more energetic and enthusiastic than older people."}
{"file_id": "1000434.txt", "output_essay": "It is undeniable that if one wants to be successful, one must seek out new things to differentiate oneself from the usual and common people.\n\nWhen one first opens a business, it can be hardly successful if one only tries to use systems that already exist in the world. It might be safe to operate a business with common systems and produce famous products for profits and money; however, that business will not grow beyond any other companies or businesses.\n\nTo be successful, it is important to try new things, even though it seems risky. This contention is lucidly manifested in the history of McDonald's and the book 'Le Papillon'.\n\nThe owner of McDonald's, Mr. Kroc, once started his business with just a restaurant, as usual as any other common restaurants. However, the owner thought that it did not bring him lots of profits. He wanted to use a new system of selling his food to people. McDonald's came up with the idea of fast food. It began to produce hamburgers rapidly to follow the trend of the time period of his days. People were starting to open up new businesses, and they did not have much time to spend in the restaurant eating. McDonald's made food faster so that busy business people could pick up their ordered food, pay, and leave for their places. It was once very successful.\n\nKroc still did not satisfy with this policy. As the usage of cars increased, he once more thought of a faster way to pick up and move, 'Drive-Thru.' People liked it, and nowadays, McDonald's is one of the famous restaurants that is world-renowned. It was a pretty risky policy to develop during that time. Other members of the company rejected this idea because people might not come to his restaurant with great pleasure. However, Kroc had the insight to see further into the future and to try new things. He was one of the successful people who tried new things with risks.\n\nIn the book 'Le Papillon', written by Bernard Werber, it lucidly clarifies that trying new things gets you a new world. The protagonists of this book are sick of their world because of the corrupted media and selfishness of people. There are several protagonists, but one of the protagonists, a scientist, first comes up with the idea of an escaping earth project. Not many people in the world would fund his project, who illustrates people that did not like risks. However, another protagonist, a rich businessman, steps up and gives the funds for the project. Any other businessman or scientist thinks that the plan is too risky and impossible to become real life. The project requires a budget that is spiked high, making it very risky for a businessman to fund all the money for the project. However, the project is very successfully done as a result. When the protagonists get to leave the earth with the spaceship, people who opposed his idea and risks do not get to leave the earth. It is a great success for those who try new things and take risks for their future.\n\nThe game that I currently play even shows that it is good to have risky quests for greater rewards. An important fact is that trying the risky way for more experience and greater success rather than just keeping things that one already knows how to do well is clearly appealed in the history of McDonald's and in the book 'Le Papillon'."}

For instance, I had a friend who had a very good job as a banker. He had a good position and earned enough money, but he wanted to make more out of his life.\n\nHe started studying again in another field and had to give up all the little luxuries he was used to (like his car, old apartment, etc.). Unfortunately, that was five years ago, and his 'risk' didn't work out that well. The normal study time would have been four years, but during that time, he figured out that this field seemed not to be the right thing. He developed bad grades and had to retake classes, plus when he finally finishes his studies, it might be very hard for him to get a good job because the demand in his field went drastically down.\n\nIf he had stayed in his old job, he could have been the director by now. Another reason for disagreeing with this statement is that I think you should treat all people equal and not judge their success based on the way they got to a certain point.\n\nFor example, if it comes to a job offer and there are two people who applied for it, I think that the person who worked for years at the same place and has a lot of experience in that specific area might be more successful than any other person. But I found it very surprising that people overlook those people and are more interested in hiring somebody who has a way more interesting past and took some risks to get there.\n\nOn the other side, taking a risk might open you up to new doors that you couldn't have imagined before.\n\nGiven those reasons and the choice between trying new things and taking risks or sticking to familiar behavior, I personally think that you can be very successful either way."}
{"file_id": "1010664.txt", "output_essay": "I do agree with the statement 'successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well', for the reasons that being adventurous can expand one's vision and help one catch new opportunities. Firstly, trying new things and taking risks can expand one's vision. The course from good to great of the world-famous company Wells Fargo is one of the best examples to support this idea. Wells Fargo was indeed an American company, for the reason that it paid only 1 percent of its entire attention to its international department. One day, the top leader of Wells Fargo took a big risk: he placed the company's chief CEO, who had been in charge of over 60 percent of the entire business of the company, in the international department. Everyone was confused by the leader's decision to try new things. However, Wells Fargo succeeded. After several years of the replacement of their chief CEO, Wells Fargo became not only a big American company but also a huge international business as well. The expansion of vision enabled Wells Fargo to reach out and become a great company, and make its leader a successful manager as well.\n\nSecondly, trying new things and taking risks can help one catch new opportunities. Living in a fast-paced world like this, we face new challenges every single day. If we only stick to the daily routine without getting to know this world better by trying new things and taking risks, we will surely be left behind by those who are more adventurous. With closed eyes, we may never reach the destined opportunities even when they are just knocking on our doors.\n\nReady and willing to try new things and take risks, one will finally become successful from mediocrity. Starting from today, our new lives with open minds will bring us something amazing sooner or later."}

Broad knowledge helps in knowing different things that we need to learn in our daily life. \n\nOne should not get accustomed to one subject because if we are like that, we can't survive in this competitive world. A human should have knowledge about each and every thing that is essential in his life. By learning every subject and obtaining knowledge from various fields, a man can survive in any part of this world, particularly in any field.\n\nAfter having a very good knowledge in every field, we can come to know the importance of various fields in our daily life, which can be useful at least once in our life.\n\nWe should have knowledge about various academic subjects like literature, arts, science and technology, pharmacy, etc. - just a few important subjects that have a vital role in our human life.Anyway, after having a broad knowledge about the various subjects, we can achieve a very good knowledge that can improve the creativity and individuality of the human.We should learn various subjects to get a grip on all the subjects that are necessary for a man to survive and cope up with this competitive world.By learning and experiencing various things in our life, we can understand any kind of situation that leads across our life. By this learning, at least we can develop humanity towards other people and be kind to them.\n\nBy knowing various things and having knowledge at the same time, man should not misuse this scientific knowledge by destroying the country by discovering some nuclear bombs, etc. We should use our great knowledge for developing the welfare of our country, but not by destroying with a criminal mentality.Therefore, I agree to the above statement given, why because by having a broad knowledge about various subjects, at least we can know the minimum necessities that are useful in our human life. By learning about various subjects, later on, we can do specialization only in one subject that we are interested in, and it helps in developing our career in this busy life.\n\nNowadays, many of the engineering and IT people are settling in the software field for having an exposure to various fields."}
{"file_id": "1011436.txt", "output_essay": "Advertisement is the most important item and vehicle of marketing. Therefore, the producers desire to have the most attractive one for their products. However, this can cause some misunderstandings for the consumers since most of the advertisements show products better than they actually are. This essay will state the deceptive way of advertisement and try to find a solution against it.\n\nIt is obvious that most people have faced a problem with one of the products they purchased, since the advertisements only focus on the positive ways of the product. None of the advertisements states the negative approaches of the products that they try to market. Moreover, owing to the competition, the producers try not to announce all the instructions of the product through the advertisements, since a well-informed consumer may change her mind and buy another one. In addition, due to the improvements in computer technology, consumers are being attracted by the visual effects by the sector, hence they assume that the product is suitable for them or the product is as good as the advertisement.\n\nIn conclusion, most advertisements take an unfair position in favor of the product. Although the advertisement sector should be improved, this does not mean they have the right to breach the rights of the consumers and the other producers that try to compete in the market. Because of this situation, the competition and consumer boards of the countries have to control the advertisements, and the consumers must be informed about their legal rights against the producers."}
{"file_id": "1009929.txt", "output_essay": "First of all, I would like to make it clear that the objectives of marketing and publicity are to highlight the good side of the products they are presenting, so the most natural thing is to find that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. However, this is something related to a consumer's impression, not to an advertisement creator's issue.\n\nIt could be a problem if an advertisement tells lies during its presentation or presents inexact information that could guide consumers to make an invalid choice. For example, if a detergent advertisement presents a cleaning proof, comparing two types of detergents, it has to present the true result because there are laws that protect consumers against abuse and misinformation.\n\nBecause of these laws, the advertisement world has to be very careful in the presentation of facts and images. Over the years, they have developed many tactics for saying the maximum great things about their products without telling a lie, but making consumers think that their products are the best when sometimes it's not the case.\n\nFor example, talking about beauty spots on TV, every day we can see that on the screen, supermodels use creams and beauty products that they say put the skin or hair in excellent condition. However, we are fooling ourselves if we think that using those products will make us become as beautiful as those supermodels. That is not the fault of the advertisement guys, because it is their job to try to make their products the most desirable for us.\n\nFinally, consumers need to be realistic and critical with the actual advertisement world, putting in the balance all the concepts and knowledge they have to determine if a product is as good as it is presented."}
{"file_id": "1005231.txt", "output_essay": "I completely agree that students should pay more emphasis on understanding ideas and concepts rather than superficially mugging up facts. A mugged-up fact with no basic understanding of the idea behind it may seem less time-consuming initially and may enable you to score quite well, but in the long run, it does no good to you. For example, in a math test in primary school, if you merely cram all word problem solutions, then please be ready to cram another set of word problems in primary 6, 7, and so on. But if you have understood the concept, you just need to apply the same, and score A in all the classes. This is my personal experience. In primary 6, 7, 8, and 9, I only studied word problems in primary 6 and never thereafter. Merely cramming not only hinders your clear vision towards the matter but also blocks your mental ability to think deeper and, in a way, blocks your mental growth. If we don't ask ourselves questions about the subject and don't try to find out answers, we are blocking our own vision. For example, if Newton didn't ask himself or make himself think about why the apple fell, he would not have gone to find out answers and give his theory. Deeper understanding of a matter not only enables you to clearly understand but, on its own, or in other words, automatically generates your interest in a subject. And what's better than this if you are really enjoying what you are doing? Every art comes with practice, demands time, devotion, and, of course, interest. Learning, not only painting, but indeed doing science is an art as well. For example, if in your secondary school you learn and understand what titration is conceptually, you will definitely enjoy the moments spent in the chemistry lab when you are performing it with your own hands and then seeing the pH becoming neutral. Another interesting example is that of understanding cancer. If you really understand what is the cellular mechanism of cancer and what genes or proteins are increased or decreased during the process, it will be so fascinating to study the response or development of cancer merely by studying the levels of genes and then see the results and then understand them also and then make others look at what results you have got in your laboratory with appropriate explanations and relate them to cancer, rather than merely acting as a foolish worker in your own lab. Learning a technique makes you merely a worker, as good as a blue-collar guy; learning a subject makes you a scientist. So, in-depth knowledge is not important but mandatory. Mugging or learning facts makes you a worker, but to really enjoy and rule a subject, one should understand the concepts, which is something that is going to take one a long way."}
{"file_id": "1011317.txt", "output_essay": "I think that almost every advertisement makes the product it supports better than it actually is. There are three main reasons for this opinion. Firstly, the main use of an advertisement is to sell the product. The second reason is that if, for example, contracts are advertised, there are mostly printed or shown on screen little paragraphs with the flaws of the contract. The last reason is that everything has not only merits but also flaws, which are typically not displayed.\n\nIn order to sell products, the producer has to display it in a good light, because otherwise similar products from other companies will be bought. This situation makes a better exposure of a product than it actually is very likely. An example might be creams that should improve the look of human skin. Studies proved that they show no effect, but in contrary, even sometimes harm the skin. If this would be told in an advertisement, nobody would buy the cream.\n\nA good example for the second reason are contracts of phone companies. They often announce some but not all of the costs a special contract may produce. Because of legal statements, they have to write these flaws on the advertisement, but they do this in very small letters. So if you don't look carefully, you might get the impression of a much cheaper product.\n\nIn advertisements, flaws of products are never told, except there are special rights as with the phone contracts. But everything has sides that are better or worse, especially if compared to other similar products. Advertisements do not speak about these things where other comparable products can prove better results. So they always hide some sides of the product. To show this hidden characteristic, almost every product is tested by independent magazines or something alike. For example, computer magazines that test hardware and software.\n\nSo you cannot rely on advertisements."}

And gas comes from oil, whose quantities on our planet are definitely not endless. As it is getting harder and harder, and so more and more expensive to extract oil, the prices of all its associated products will increase so much that we won't be able to afford them in the near future. Therefore, unless we find other sources of energy as efficient as gas, we should enjoy driving as long as we still can fuel our cars and before it turns into a luxury!\n\nOn the other hand, using gasoline as a fuel for our cars contributes to polluting the environment. We are likely to get into trouble very soon if we do not stop polluting so much, and each of us has to take his responsibilities in this major issue. As a matter of fact, we are talking here of Mankind's survival! We need to be more sensible, at least for our children! Thus, I hope we will be wise enough to reduce our pollution and prevent our children from dying from asthma!\n\nTherefore, the trend is clear: we will have to find alternative solutions to our current reliance on cars."}
{"file_id": "1011026.txt", "output_essay": "I do agree with the following statement. I think it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject. All the subjects are important in my life, and I'm sure they can help my future plans, such as passing the test for university and finding a good job. I have two more reasons for this.\n\nFirst, I think it is a nice way to study many academic subjects. I will write about my experience as an example. Now, I am studying many subjects in high school, and I like studying all of them. It is very fun to study many subjects and increase my knowledge. The English class helps me express my speaking, the History class helps me develop my listening skills, and I am enjoying communicating with my friends during other classes. All the subjects have different advantages. Therefore, I want to study all the subjects, and I think it is boring to focus on only one subject.\n\nSecond, it is not vain to have knowledge of many academic subjects. We can use our knowledge everywhere. When we take the test for university and when we find a job after graduating, all of the subjects are useful. Recently, some people have been thinking that it is not important for children to study extra subjects like physical education, music, and art. However, it is all important, as we can know how fun it is and enjoy doing these activities. I think it is important to enjoy the subject, not just study demanded subjects like English, Math, and Science. The extra subjects also express our knowledge, and it will be useful in our communication.\n\nFor these reasons, which I mentioned above, I support the passage that it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject. It will expand our thought, and it will surely be useful in our life. Studying many subjects is very fun."}
{"file_id": "1008698.txt", "output_essay": "Someone has very rightly said, 'It is not the destination that matters, but it is the journey that's the real adventure.' It is not only the destination that you should enjoy, but you should also enjoy the fun of reaching there, which can only be done in a group.\n\nTravelling in a group led by a tour guide is the best possible way to travel. When you travel in a group, you have more fun and you end up doing a lot of activities that you would not do if you were travelling alone.\n\nMan is a social animal, and we always like it if we have someone to talk to and someone with whom we can share our emotions. When travelling in a group, you have this chance. For instance, if you go to an old church and you are in awe at its beauty and architectural design, having someone there with whom you can share these feelings always feels nice.\n\nSecondly, having a tour guide is a major advantage when it comes to travelling around in a new city. As the guide is familiar with the city and the tourist spots in that city, he is the right person who can show you around the city and take you to the right places. If you were to do it alone, it would take you hours just to figure out how to go from one place to the other.\n\nThirdly, travelling in a group is a lot of fun, as you are never alone and are always with someone, playing, chatting, or doing something fun. Also, travelling with people makes you try new things which you would never do on your own. For example, if someone in your group likes adventure sports, seeing him, the other people in the group would also get motivated to try their hand at it. You might never know; someone might actually turn out to be very good at it.\n\nThus, we see that traveling in a group led by a tour guide is much more fun and adventurous. Even though the tour guide might charge you some extra money, but he covers it up with the fact that he saves a lot of your time and helps you relax on your holiday as he is taking care of everything. Travelling in a group helps you have a holiday in the true sense of the word and lets you enjoy to the fullest."}
{"file_id": "1011805.txt", "output_essay": "I definitely agree with the idea that it is more important to learn facts than to understand ideas and concepts for students. There are three reasons as follows to support my idea.\n\nFor most human beings, the ability to learn facts is much stronger than that of understanding ideas and concepts. Facts equal specification, and a concept stands for abstraction. For example, we may distinguish a high-value picture from a low-value one mainly by whether it looks like the real thing or not. On the contrary, experts define the value of the painting by their colors or some painting skills. We may not understand the essential things in Van Gogh's painting because we do not even know what he drew on the paper.\n\nFor another thing, it is easier for students to learn things from a teacher than to learn by themselves. That is the reason that a teacher can make some specific examples and facts to describe the new concept, which makes students make sense easily.\n\nWhen it comes to learning facts, we cannot take into account the part-time job. Why do so many students like to take it when they are in school? Because it provides some interpersonal abilities with them, which are not learned from books or classes. Additionally, they learn things with the joy of earning money.\n\nIn spite of this, understanding ideas and concepts are basic for students. Such as some academic subjects - math, calculation, science, history, and social science - they are essential for students to learn something new. Suppose a person cannot read or write or has a simple calculating ability; he will learn nothing, even if he knows quite a few facts.\n\nAt last, in my opinion, I think understanding ideas and concepts are as important as learning facts. We may build up two sides of ability at the same time."}

Oil resources are decreasing remarkably over the next twenty years, and the price of oil will increase strictly. So, many car owners won't be able to afford the higher cost of gas, because their income will stay the same.\n\nFor the car industries and the jobs connected to it, it's a dramatic thing, because many people will lose their workplaces.\n\nWhen I think about all this, it would be best to make plans now about what we should do with the problem. First, we could build new possibilities in transporting people and find new ways of exploring other resources we have on earth, instead of oil.\n\nMaybe it could be a possibility in twenty years for us to drive cars with energy from water or sunlight.

{"file_id": "1011110.txt", "output_essay": "In this society, most people will spend 6 to 12 years in different schools to study. The main purpose is to gain knowledge. While some students think that understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning facts, so they just learn to understand. I don't agree with that. I think the facts of knowledge are important as well as the ideas and concepts. The two cannot be without in the process of studying.\n\nFirst of all, we should know the purpose of studying really. Everyone knows that the purpose is to gain knowledge. But what will we do with the knowledge? We should use the knowledge to develop our skills and abilities, which can be used in work and real life. For example, if a student thinks understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning facts, he will easily ignore the significance of the facts. And then, he won't like to learn them. After the student graduates, he may master many different concepts, but he is difficult to find a good job. Because he cannot use his knowledge in work. So, learning facts is very important for the students' future.\n\nOn the other hand, learning facts is also a good way to help students understand the ideas and concepts. As we all know, most of the ideas and concepts consist of words and formulas. They are very boring for students. While when the student learns the ideas and concepts, the teacher tells them some facts about the concepts. The student will become more interested and understand the boring concepts more quickly. So, the facts are good for the student to learn.\n\nThe last but not least, students can learn some experiences and lessons from the facts. The facts are some events, something that happened in the past, or some examples of unsuccessful attempts. These are very important. If the students don't learn some experiences from the facts, they will learn in the future by themselves, maybe from failure.\n\nFrom all above, I can draw the conclusion that learning facts is very important for students. Everyone cannot ignore them."}

Also, when you give as much of your time as you can, you will be very successful. It is better to stick with one subject than being confused with many subjects, which you will forget in the future.\n\nSecondly, it is quite challenging when you specialize in one subject. For example, when you pick one academic subject and study it for your whole life and get an advanced degree, your life is going to be better, and your children will get better education. Talking about myself, now I am thirty-three years old, and I am still studying and trying to get my master's degree in engineering. I picked that subject when I was in high school, and it is still in my mind, and I do whatever it takes to finish what I started, and it is like challenging myself.\n\nFinally, I would like to say that picking one subject is much better than having more subjects, which are very complicated for me. Specializing in one subject is even challenging yourself or others, and also, you should put your mind into the thing to be successful in life and be better educated."}

I will then conclude by summarizing the different points made.\n\nFirst of all, let's ask ourselves why people use tour guides to travel. A possible answer to that question might be that people do not necessarily have a lot of time to visit a certain place, and therefore intend to make the most out of their time. In that case, people are shown the most popular monuments and locations for sightseeing by their tour guides, and visit as much as possible in a short amount of time. So I personally think that in the case of a short trip, it is a good solution in order to see the main things to see.\n\nHowever, the major drawback of this alternative appears to me to be that as you intend to make the most out of your limited time, every visit is carefully timed and scheduled. Therefore, in the event that you would like to learn more about a certain monument or place, it turns out to be quite difficult as the group might be already leaving for the next visit, or you just might not have enough time ahead of you to do so. Consequently, if a deep understanding of a certain place or monument is the major concern of the trip, tours appear to me not to be the best alternative, making such a wish difficult to come true.\n\nTo conclude, I believe that groups led by a tour guide can be both a good or less good alternative depending on the major aim of the journey. In my opinion, if the thorough understanding of a certain monument or place is the objective, then a different alternative should be taken. However, if the objective of a short journey is to go around the main sightseeing spots, then I believe it is the alternative to adopt."}

To be young is beautiful. If you were a child, you could do what you preferred without problems. A child thinks nothing about serious events or facts. Old people are under stress or serious.

But is it the best way to travel?\n\nI personally disagree with this statement; I think it deprives us of the spontaneous and adventurous aspect of a trip.\n\nWhen I travel, usually to unknown countries with my friends and family, it is, of course, to have a good time and see odd sights that I may not have the chance to see again. But mostly, I like the feeling of freedom that I get: I can go anywhere, anytime. But being led by a travel guide kind of takes that aspect away: following an exact map and program of the visit. And many times, the guide is not a personal guide; for that, you have to follow others to see things that you did not even want to see in the first place.\n\nA personal experience: during a guided tour of Paris a few years back, I was stuck (so to speak) in an art exhibition that I did not plan to attend. But since I had no car and no money for a cab, I was obligated to stay with the group, being bored out of my mind.\n\nMore than that, of course, staying in a nice hotel with a minibar full of drinks is nice, but I also love backpacking: going from place to place without a perfectly planned trip, staying at hostels, without the feeling that I have to follow the map exactly as planned. In that case, being led by a tour guide would be denying the whole definition of adventurous, exciting backpacking.\n\nTo conclude, I would like to say that following a group led by a tour guide is a great way to explore the city; you get to see all the important sights, but it might not be fit for some people, such as me, who enjoy adrenaline boosts."}

Of course, they need to find out new medicines, and it takes risks because they test animals. Another example is students who are successful in their studies. Why are they successful? The reason is that they already try new things, such as reading a lot of different books and communicating with teachers. The risky thing is taking extra exams that are not required. If students do not read a lot of books and evaluate themselves, how can they be successful students? They will stay the same without studying new things. They cannot only study what they know well. Otherwise, they cannot be open-minded. For me, I have a personal story about this topic. I am trying new things and also taking risks. I came to America to study. I am trying to study new cultures and languages. I am not successful yet, but I am trying to be successful. Also, this is a risk for me because my parents cannot afford for me to study at a university in America. The tuition is too high. My parents have to take care of me and my brother. International students cannot work off-campus. I could not find any job on-campus. This is a really big challenge for me to study abroad. Therefore, I agree with the statement."}

People seldom challenge new things since they are afraid that they are going to fail at that task, in other words, they are unwilling to challenge new things because they are uncertain and don't think that they would succeed. However, in my opinion, I think what is significant is that you actually attempt to do something even if you fail. I even think that failing is more important than not attempting to try. \n\nOnly doing what they already know is not going to make you improve more. It would make you confident in only one thing. For instance, if a person is trying and trying to do something as much as he can but he is unsuccessful, he would be successful sooner because he would realize the reason why he failed at this task. In fact, if you attempt to do something, however you fail at it a few times, it's the leading road to success. \n\nFor the person who only does what he already knows, he will not improve at all but gain confidence. Even if this person really knows what he has to do and how to do a thing well, he won't be as good as the person who fails and has failed many times. The chance will only come to you if you would start doing and try doing new things. The more doors you open, the more chance to have more opportunities. If you keep the door closed, nothing would come to you. Chance would come only if you open the door. \n\nPeople want to succeed, and they want to have more chances. However, in order to do that, you need to make opportunities by yourself. It seems difficult, and it is; however, you just have to open the door, and you will see a road where failure leads to success."}

It is true that learning facts is important, but not more important than ideas and concepts.\n\nAs per my experience, most professors give tests based on the ideas and concepts of what we learned. The purpose of testing is to assess how much students grasp ideas and concepts of the content and how to apply them.None of my professors wanted students to pass the class without understanding ideas and concepts.\n\nAccording to a Korean newspaper, most successful students grasp ideas and concepts of the subject, not just the facts.Researchers conducted an experiment in one high school.They had fifty people who studied only concepts and ideas, and fifty students who studied only facts.The result of the experiment was that forty out of fifty students who were in the ideas and concepts group got A's, and ten out of fifty students who were in the facts group got A's in the test.\n\nAfter reading this researcher's paper, I focused on understanding ideas and concepts of the content.As a result, my grades were higher than when I was studying facts.I think understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning facts.Just getting a good grade is not the only goal for students.Students have to understand ideas and concepts and take one step forward to the future."}

So, if your job has a lot of competition, it will be hard to be successful in that section. You should change your job to something that nobody can think of, something with a unique idea.\n\nSecondly, people who are successful in their business have unusual ideas, such as inventing the light bulb or connecting the internet. I think that if you know how to do something well, many people can do it. Let's say, you are good at math; if you go on to make a job with math, you are supposed to be a teacher - there is no other choice.\n\nTherefore, if you think someone might like your idea, you should try new things and take the risk."}

I believe this, speaking from a personal experience. Once I bought a set of roller pens. The specifications were that those pens wrote in a 0.7, but when I used them, they were not even 0.3. I think that the problem behind such an issue is the production company. Those companies try to make their products as attractive as they can in order to attract the most consumers. \n\nThose companies forget that once someone buys anything that does much less than it says, it will be returned to the retail selling agent, and the retail selling agent will, in return, return it to the company, where many other items have been returned. The result of this is that the name of the company will not be much in the market, and will have no future product under the same name. It could be that what they were after is temporary profits. If this is the case, they succeeded. So, exaggerating the product's description and the exaggeration in claiming that a certain product does certain things, while in reality it does not, leads the consumers to think about and try the product before they buy it."}

I think we can discover new things more by traveling alone or with a few friends or family.\n\nFirstly, we can be flexible with our schedule when we travel ourselves. This means we can pick places we want to go and arrange the most effective route. When I went to Spain with my son last month, we picked where we wanted to go first and organized our route carefully. We moved around using the subway and visited historical sites and museums. Whenever we felt like changing our plan, we had a cup of coffee and made another plan. For example, after we saw Gaud\u00ed's famous Cathedral in Barcelona, my son wanted to visit other architectures of his, so we decided to see other buildings rather than go to the Picasso museum.\n\nSecondly, we can go where our interests are. In Granada, we visited an old historical town called Albaic\u00edn. This town is located on the hill and it seemed to be very difficult for tour groups to go, as these roads are too narrow for large buses to drive and there are many passes to get out of the town. If I were a tour guide, I might lose my customers as these roads are like a huge maze. But when I think back on our trip, this town was the most exciting and attractive place for us. If we had gone to Spain in a group tour, we could not have visited this marvelous historical town.\n\nFor these reasons, I prefer traveling on my own or with a few people. We can go where we really want to go and enjoy what we really want to see. The Spain trip with my son became one of the most memorable trips for me."}

However, the problem is that there are a lot of people who prefer to have a beautiful car rather than a sweet home. The famous sentence 'home sweet home' is in danger because it is no longer at the top of people's desires. A car was the symbol of a generation; our parents remember their first car like a realized dream. Today, young people want a car because their best friend has one, not because they understand the real meaning it can have. I think that in twenty years, this object of desire will be even more wanted, more desired, and more dangerous... There are already a lot of cars that ride too fast; in the twenties, it will certainly be worse. Today, young people die because they can drive cars that run very fast; tomorrow, they will be able to fly. I hope it will be different. At my grandfather's time, the car was a luxury good because he couldn't have one. A car is a lot of money, and when there was a war, money was scarce. In the sixties, some people, like Corradino d'Ascanio, created a way to help these people discover the world: Vespa. This has been a real status symbol thanks to the great meanings it had. 'With Vespa, you can fly' and with this beginning, motors became the most important thing for people. In the sixties, it was possible to fly away; tomorrow, it will be possible too? It's important to be free, and with a car, I can be free because I can go wherever I want. For this reason, there are fewer restrictions. A freedom that will never pass."}

It's a problem because reserves of petroleum are going to be smaller and smaller, and because of this, the price of petroleum is growing and growing.\n\nNowadays, the environmental question is very popular in European countries, and cars are considered a very bad element for the environment's health. So, in my opinion, in twenty years, the number of cars in Europe, Japan, and the United States will be lower. But, in my opinion, cars will be fewer in twenty years than today in developing countries (in poorer countries) like African countries or South American countries because, for them, cars are still a very important element for economic growth.\n\nPeople in those countries use their cars a lot in order to go to their jobs, whereas, in countries that are already developed and rich, people are used to taking the subway, buses, and the tramway. But, because poorer pollution represents a big part of the worldwide population, if all those people are going to have a car, the worldwide number of cars will dramatically grow.\n\nThere is also the problem of lobbying. The car lobbying is very important in the United States of America, so they will not allow the American government to make a law about the number of cars per family. So, if some people would like to make the number of cars smaller, they will be in conflict with politicians and the lobbying.\n\nIn my opinion, in twenty years, there will be a terrible struggle between environmental protectors and car constructors (General Motors, Ford, VW...). I'm very sure that Greenpeace will be a more and more important organization because who doesn't want to take care of our environment?\n\nIn my opinion, the number of cars can also be smaller in twenty years because circulation problems are terrible in big cities such as Paris or NYC. That's why, nowadays, cars are forbidden in the center of London. Because of this prohibition, I'm very sure that a big part of Londoners will sell their cars and didn't buy a new one. Cars have become useless in London. I heard also that Paris would like to make the same. Isn't that evidence of the fact that the number of cars in Europe is going to be smaller?\n\nAs a conclusion, we can say that in some parts of the world, in twenty years, cars will be fewer, but in another part, their number is going to be less important."}

They are never afraid of failure. Taking big risks brings huge success. To be successful people, I think two more things are required in addition to trying new things and taking risks.\n\nAmbition is vital for success. I would like to mention Ichiro Suzuki, the Japanese Major League Baseball player at Seattle Mariners in the United States. He is one of the most successful Japanese. As everyone knows, he has an incredible talent as a baseball player. He, however, has had the ambition to be the best baseball player all over the world since he was in primary school. He hoped to be a baseball player and trained very hard. Without ambition, Ichiro Suzuki might have been only a good player in Japan.\n\nEffort is crucial as well. Even though having fantastic dreams, people cannot get success without hard training. For instance, I have a dream. I have been thinking of studying abroad to expand my value and acquire language skills since I was a high school student. Not only the dream 'I want to study in the US' but also the effort deserved for it. I have to do what is needed. I have to study TOEFL very hard. TOEFL is not easy. The ambition is going to help my motivation for study. But finally, the effort brings a result of success.\n\nAs is clear from the above, I am on the side of the statement.

Twenty years down the line, they will continue to do so.\n\nThe population is increasing day by day, and there seems to be no sign of the population growth slowing down. Higher population figures imply more people needing personal transportation, and with existing technology, cars are the best answer to that.\n\nThere is a need for transportation, and there is a proven technology that is not only currently popular but also developing day by day - 'Cars' would thus continue to grow, even twenty years down the line.\n\nFossil fuels, the primary source of energy for cars, are more than abundant over the next twenty years, and with the abundant energy source, the demand for cars would not reduce.\n\nHybrid technology to drive cars with more fuel-efficient and less polluting fuels would give a boost to the car industry, and people would have one more reason to buy a car.\n\nOther advancements in technology, especially in safety and drive quality, would also fuel the demand for transportation. This would only help put more cars on the road now and twenty years down the line.\n\nUnless some alternative transportation is developed, tested, and proven within the next twenty years - say anti-gravity saucers or teleportation \u00e0 la 'Star Trek' - cars and ground vehicles would continue to be preferred.\n\nFact is that the human population is growing and will continue to grow twenty years down the line.

But one can really ask oneself if there will be more or fewer automobiles in twenty years. Despite the fact that we can truly believe, for several reasons, there will be fewer cars, I personally think there will exist more cars in use in twenty years than there are today. The main reasons for this theory are, first, that people have, had, and will always love cars. Second, an automobile is too useful to disappear from the surface of the planet. Third, the laws against pollution are not very effective.\n\nFirst of all, people have deeply loved cars since the beginning, and there is no real reason why it will suddenly stop. Cars carry an image of wealth and happiness. It could also be part of certain dreams and fantasies since they were often used in movies, for example.\n\nMoreover, a car is fundamentally very helpful. It is a convenient way of transportation, a very flexible one. In my opinion, there is not any other invention, to date, that allows people to decide to leave a spot for another one and go off immediately. I bet there will not be one either in the next decades. Another example of the usefulness of automobiles is that you can put more personal stuff in it than when you travel by plane or by train, for instance.\n\nFinally, the political battles led against car pollution did not permit the number of cars to decrease. Thus, I think this ineffectiveness will continue in the future. For example, if it is true that people driving cars in Mexico have to pay more taxes, it is still the most polluted city in the world, because the number of cars in use in this town is still the same. I think this will also continue in twenty years.\n\nTo sum up, there will probably not be fewer cars in use in twenty years because of the three major reasons I expressed. But, of course, it is only a guess, since nobody can really predict the future."}

The neurosurgeon who has a flood in his house will not be able to handle emergency scenarios like this because of his total ignorance about plumbing. I would not say that all neurosurgeons are urged to take a plumbing course or something similar, but the point is that knowing some basics about how to use these tools or being aware of the water or sewing system around the house will enable this person to perform first-hand measures to save their house until getting specialized help.\n\nIn general, this approach to learning will allow individuals to be more versatile and better equipped to handle various situations in life."}

The marketing department of every company tries to create a successful advertisement so that they can sell more of these products. Their aim is to influence consumers to buy the articles or products. \n\nBecause of this, they use different tactics for different products to catch the potential user's attention: The marketing department uses kids and a happy family to make an advertisement for a family car, so that the husband of the family hopefully thinks, 'That's the perfect car for our family. I will buy this one next week.' \n\nYou can see advertisements like this everywhere: during the breaks in a movie or between TV shows, there are always spots with the aim of buying the product. \n\nAnother example of this could be an advertisement for washing machines: 'It's the cheapest washing machine in the world; you will save a lot of money buying this one!' However, on the other side, it is probably not an economical product, so the consumer has to pay a lot for water and electricity because of the bad technology. \n\nThe managers try with this strategy to make the article look like the best.

The reason is that they use people who are famous, perfect results, incredible situations, and many more to make their product look better than it really is.\n\nIn advertisements, they always make claims of excellent results. For example, in an ad for a fairness cream, it might claim that it will make you fair in six weeks, but when you actually try it out, the results are not as spectacular as the ad claims. Thus, the ad makes the product seem better than it actually is.\n\nAnother way by which advertisements make their product look better is that they use star power. That is, they hire either a big movie star or a sports celebrity to endorse their product. This attracts the public to the product without really paying all that attention to the product itself. Thus, the product will seem better to you just because a particular star is using the product. It will not matter to you if the product is not really all that good. What does matter is that your favorite star is using it. Thus, star power helps enhance the product and make it seem better than it actually is.\n\nAlso, in advertisements, many times the model is able to do incredible things after using the product. For example, the ad might show that after drinking their product, the model is able to do incredible stunts. These stunts will make the product and the people who use it look cool, and it will very much appeal to the young male population. They would only want to use the product, as it is associated with cool people, and they would also want to become cool people. Thus, the product is made to look better than it actually is.\n\nLast but not least, the ads barely mention the disadvantages of using their product. For example, in an ad for mutual funds, the disadvantage is mentioned so quickly that the viewer barely pays attention to it. Thus, drawing attention only to its good points.\n\nThus, advertisements make their products look better by using star power, claiming exaggerated results, and many psychological tricks."}
{"file_id": "1013452.txt", "output_essay": "The demand for mobility and access is not likely to cease in modern life; however, the supply that will enable people to mobilize will certainly shift from conventional methods established today.\n\nWith this fact, one can go further and argue that twenty years from now, there will be fewer cars than there are now. Such an argument can be coherent in itself if one is to see changing trends in mobility regarding alternatives and environmental issues.\n\nWhen it comes to comparing cars with their alternatives, such as planes, trains, and ferries, they all seem to be better than cars in some certain aspects stated below. For instance, it is a known fact that the average use of cars is around 1.5 people per car worldwide, which proves how inefficient cars are compared to massive transportation ways such as trains, ships, and planes. In addition to this, cars also create a traffic problem that is uncomparable to its alternatives.\n\nDespite cars seeming to provide more accessibility than their alternatives since one can drive wherever he wants and whenever, this fact also seems to be changing. It may be the case that, twenty years from now, planes and trains will develop to an extent that they will be cheaper to use and more frequent in destination. At this point, it should also be remembered that cars have considerable upkeep costs due to repairs and taxes, which will eventually become a luxury compared to their alternatives.\n\nApart from losing its chance among its alternatives, cars will most likely be forced to reduce in number due to their harmful effects on the environment. The fundamental need of a car to run is oil, and this fact is unlikely to change in the coming twenty years. Regarding increasing concerns on global warming, this need of cars will make it likely to be replaced. In addition to harmful gases released, cars also damage the environment by creating sound pollution and indirectly by drivers demanding more roads. The more cars there will be, the more roads and sound pollution there will be as well. Subsequently, these will make people take a decision between altering their mobility styles or facing the results of environmental disorder.\n\nIn conclusion, it seems that because of the drives mentioned here and many possible others that extend the limit of this essay, cars are going to be replaced relatively by their alternatives. Maybe these drives will let car industries develop new, cheap, and environmentally friendly solutions, but even this isn't likely to stop a change in choices. It is because maybe other industries will take advantage of their increasing usage and will develop further technologies that will make them uncomparable to cars."}

It has been important almost for the past century, but it seems like it's becoming even more important today. The reason for this development is that developing countries, or newly developed ones, are developing their industries. And it's well known that one of the major sectors of the industry is the car industry.\n\nTherefore, more and more cars are getting built every day in the world, and they will be in use in our streets sooner or later. For example, Asian countries are becoming very powerful in this area. We all know brands like Toyota, Honda... And if we pay attention to the cars around us, we'll notice how usual it becomes to see people with those cars.\n\nBesides, this development doesn't mean that the other developed countries stopped making cars. They actually try to catch up with those countries and are making new cars too. For example, we have Volkswagen and BMW in Germany, Chevrolet, General Motors in the United States... And much more.\n\nThey are all trying to be more competitive, so they are all developing new cars and selling more cars too.\n\nThe car industry is an important economic area for every country today, that's why I personally think that a huge amount of cars is coming, and in twenty years, it won't be solved at all.\n\nBut today, we can also see the development of environmental concerns. More and more organizations are opening in order to protect our planet: Greenpeace was the first one, but definitely not the last one created.\n\nAnd in my opinion, it's also becoming a political strategy, so we may have a \"solution\" to this environmental damage: a new kind of cars that won't pollute as much. For example, cars using electricity.\n\nTo conclude, I would say that economic strategies won't let the car industry disappear, but they might find new techniques in order to combine strong economy and protection of our environment."}
{"file_id": "1016671.txt", "output_essay": "Some people like individual travels, others like to travel in a group led by a tour guide. In my opinion, I prefer to travel in a group led by a tour guide. I would like to show three points referring to rationales and examples.\n\nFirst of all, a group trip makes it easy to go to unfamiliar spots in famous sightseeing places. Since a tour guide has professional knowledge of the place, they can advise us to see unknown but good spots. In my experience, when I went to China on a school trip, I could find beautiful scenes of forests and rivers from unknown spots. If I had not traveled in a group, it must have been impossible since I was unfamiliar with China.\n\nAlso, a tour guide can help us to communicate efficiently with foreigners in a foreign travel. In general, a tour guide, especially one who often goes to foreign countries, has a good command of the indigenous languages. Therefore, we can communicate with indigenous people through their language help. If we do not have tour guides, especially in foreign countries where we have not learned the languages, we cannot directly communicate with them. Since one of the big advantages of going abroad is to communicate with native people and to learn the life and culture, no language support does not bring beneficial time.\n\nLastly, referring to an advantage of traveling in the form of a group, it ensures communication with other people who are in the same tour. It is a good opportunity to meet other people, because, in my case, I do not have much opportunity to meet other unfamiliar Japanese. Since I am a university student, I always meet the same people, such as classmates or friends who belong to the same club activity. If I could meet someone who has the same tastes, I would be able to have an eternal relationship with them.\n\nThus, due to three points: going to unfamiliar spots, communication with indigenous people, and having relationships with people in the same travel, I prefer to travel in a group led by a tour guide."}

For example, I started working at Goldman Sachs, which is one of the most famous investment banks, in the Tokyo branch in Japan from 1996. At that time, the Japanese economy was at its worst, so it was very difficult for young people to find and hold even a working place in Japan. Fortunately, I found a good company to work for, and since then, I have worked for a long time every day without long sleep and a lot of rest. Considering this situation, we, young people, cannot have enough time to support our communities.\n\nSecond, communities have been decaying themselves. For example, I live in Roppongi, Tokyo, Japan, which is one of the central districts of Japan. A lot of young people, who have to work for a long time for themselves, live in this area. At this area, each person does not have any idea that a community exists itself. In this circumstance, young people do not think to help the community. So they do not give any time to helping their communities.\n\nConsidering the situations in rural areas, there might be an opposite opinion mentioned above. But a lot of young people think for the opinion mentioned above. Thus, I strongly believe that young people do not give enough time to supporting their communities."}

In order to resist, economic operators try to sell as much as possible, making products seem much better than they really are.\n\nSecond, it is important to underline how today advertisements sell dreams behind the products, trying to convince us, for example, that it is enough to buy a particular model of a car to find happiness!\n\nIn conclusion, I am totally in agreement with the statement, and more, I consider this behavior terrible and unethical as it would be!"}

I do agree with this, but should we travel with a group by a tour guide or just go there by ourselves? I believe that the attitudes people maintain towards this question will differ. I would rather say that I'd like to go to a new place on my own.\n\nFirst of all, it is hard to deny that the goal of our travel is to feel and enjoy different cultures, in most part. I would say that I am a boy who likes adventure, because that is more exciting than going with a group. The cultures could be seen as a representation of a place, and also should be respected. If I get a great amount of knowledge about those cultures from the tour guide, that will make me feel disappointed, and those knowledge will become tedious and boring to me; the only way I get to know a kind of new culture is to feel it by myself.\n\nIn addition, joining a group led by a tour guide seems freedomless, because our journey is already projected by the guide, and the guide can even try to convince us to buy some expensive local crafts, which can benefit the guide. That will make our trips unacceptable.\n\nFurthermore, it is impossible that traveling with a group is cheap. If I go somewhere on my own, I will make a precise plan to control my cost, and I can even live in my friend's home, which is beside the place I want to visit, which can not only cut down numerous expenses, but also let my trip have more wonderful feelings and more significant meanings.\n\nAs I have mentioned above, I would rather say that I do like to travel to a place on my own."}
{"file_id": "1017877.txt", "output_essay": "I am in accordance with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.\n\nThe reason I am in accord is that I suppose that successful people are motivated to improve in any way they operate, and they want to set a new target, much more difficult than the past, to obtain.\n\nFor this reason, they try new things and sometimes take risks, but this gives them the sensation of the power and potential they have.\n\nNormal people see them and consider that, in the same situation or position, they did not take risks fairly like successful people do.\n\nIn fact, normal people many times consider successful people too much out of this world for the reason I mentioned last.\n\nContrary to normal people's thinking, I consider it ordinary that successful people go in another way from normal people because, if it is not true, they cannot be successful people.\n\nThe success of a person is given first of all by nature because a successful person, before they had success, was born with a particular ability in speaking, playing, and making better what they had to do, respecting other people.\n\nWith the growth of the person, success comes to those who had this particular ability since they were young, and for this reason, they became 'effective' successful people.\n\nThe society in general considers that taking risks is the better way to fail or die.\n\nI support a different position, and this is that if a man did not take many risks in his life, he will continue to be the little ordinary man that he is.\n\nBut if a man takes many risks (not every time, but sometimes), it is a sign that he could be a successful person.\n\nSuccessful people have luck on their part; in fact, sometimes they make an activity with much more success than a normal person could obtain.\n\nThis is a particularity, but it is not wanted by people: it is a supernatural want."}

{"file_id": "1016245.txt", "output_essay": "In today's world, it is highly debated whether a person should have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects or specialize in one subject. That is, 'specialization and all in one' concepts are argued to determine which is better. In this essay, I will try to explain my opinions about the issue I wrote above. Before writing details of my opinion, I would like to say that I believe in the power of specialization and disagree with the statement given in the question.\n\nThe need and requirements of the academic environment are changing. And I think the trend is going towards specialization. Specialization means knowing every side and aspect of any subject, covering all the details. There is a word in my country, Turkey, which underlines the importance of specialization: 'Instead of knowing something about every subject, knowing everything about one subject is better.' As soon as I had read the statement in the question, I remembered this sentence, and I believe in the message of this sentence.\n\nSpecialization in one subject brings a lot of advantages to the person who is related to it. I would like to explain one of the advantages by giving an example from university life. In Turkey's universities, there are Business Administration Faculties, and under these faculties, there is an 'International Trade Department' which I would like to specialize in. And when I got the University Entrance Exam, there were two choices in front of me. One is studying business administration, and the second one is studying international trade. In Turkey, international traders are 100% graduated from business and are not international trade specialists. So, when I had realized this situation, I decided to study international trade and try to get specialized in international trade. And nowadays, I see the advantages of this; the majority of the Foreign Trade Departments of Companies are looking for International Trade Specialists.\n\nAnother point that I am considering as an advantage of specialization is that if someone asks you what is your job, or what is your main interested point, you will be able to give accurate responses. That is, the people and yourself will easily be able to know what you are doing and what you are specialized for. For example, if doctors are not specialized in any type of specialization, they will not have any specialized topic, and again, a Turkish sentence 'they will say I can do any job that you want me to do.'\n\nIn conclusion, specialization is the trend."}
{"file_id": "1019727.txt", "output_essay": "One of the main problems of the scholastic system in Italy is the huge program we have for all the subjects we have to learn. I can say from my own experience that most of the information they give us at school is forgotten immediately after we study it. I completely agree with the statement: it is more important for students to understand ideas. A famous Italian writer once said that what we call culture is not what we remember to have studied at school, but the mix of all the experiences and all the ideas we have, and it doesn't matter if we don't remember some stupid details about something we studied years and years ago.\n\nIn my opinion, a good teacher should try to guide a student through history (for example), not by filling their head with dates or names of ancient emperors and facts, but by trying to passion that student by talking about the differences between our life and life in that time, trying to bring the student into a fantastic world with the wand of fantasy. Of course, we can say the same for most of the subjects, but with some exceptions, like mathematics or physics.\n\nMoreover, we can forget learned facts, even because they could not match with our everyday life, so that we could never have the opportunity to recall that fact to our mind. But we can be sure that if we have learned the idea of something, we'll never let it out. It is more important for students to have a taste of things, and this allows them to have passions and interests.\n\nIn conclusion, Italian schools (but I'm pretty convinced it is a problem felt in other countries) should give values to their students, just the sense of how many things we don't know, and open the door to infinite worlds that students should explore by themselves, depending on their interests."}
{"file_id": "1014998.txt", "output_essay": "Some people argue as if it were a general truth that understanding ideas and concepts is much more important than learning facts. But to be frank, I cannot agree with them. There are numerous reasons why I hold no confidence in them, and I would explore a few primary ones here.\n\nTo begin with, we can learn ideas and concepts during studying facts. Teachers will be able to teach students the ideas and concepts by teaching a specific fact. Let's take a look at a physics class. At the very beginning, the teacher gives the class a specific problem and asks them to solve it. The students might not be able to solve it, so the teacher could offer some conceptual suggestions that could help to solve this problem and encourage them to think again. And this time, the students might know how to solve the actual problem and also learn the basic concept.\n\nFurthermore, why do we learn ideas and concepts? For practical work, of course. So, why don't we learn something that is more practical? Learning facts will lead us to work directly, and it would not waste a lot of time studying boring theories or concepts, and this would save much more time.\n\nLast but not least, studying facts will sometimes be more useful than studying concepts. For example, imagine we are learning how to repair a bike. From the books, we may just know how to solve general problems. But when we face a special problem, an integrating problem that noises from all over the bike, for example, what could we do? We might feel complicated trying to solve this kind of problem.\n\nTo sum up, learning facts can help us save a lot of time, and because the purpose of learning is for work, studying facts might sometimes be more useful when we work than studying ideas and concepts. Taking into account all these factors, we may reach the conclusion that it is advisable to learn facts rather than to understand ideas and concepts."}
{"file_id": "1020837.txt", "output_essay": "Let me introduce myself first. I am from Japan and have grown up there. I totally agree that young people recently do not give enough time to helping their communities. Some reasons why young people do not are that in Japanese society, there are more interests, such as playing video games and interruptions like being busy for studying. Or, young people tend not to have any interest in others.\n\nMost elderly people say, 'A long time ago, young people had sufficient time for helping their communities.' However, time is always changing, and therefore, youth do not want to help or do not like their communities at all. Even if their parents may not care about those communities, they might not push their sons or daughters to go to communities.\n\nOn the other hand, because Japanese students study so much harder than they play, and some of the youth have to focus on studying instead of helping the communities, they do not have time to go to communities. Not only do Japanese students study so hard, but also do Asian students study very hard if we compare between Asia and North America.\n\nAmericans may have enough time to help their communities because I saw young Americans with my own eyes. Also, I heard from my friends who are Americans that Japanese students study harder than Americans. It means that Japanese students do not have time to help their communities.\n\nIn Japan, there is one of the worst phenomena for young people. We call it the 'Hikikimori Phenomenon.' Young Japanese (young adults too!) tend to stay at their houses, especially in their rooms, and spend time there all day. It means that they do not have any interests outside of their world. They never work, go to school, and never go out.\n\nIn conclusion, the reasons why in recent years young people do not have time to spend are due to the changing period, being busy for studying, and this bad phenomenon."}

We can take the example of the riots in France in November; we saw indeed that some young people did not care about the goods of people and communities. So, I agree with the fact that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.\n\nFirstly, young people have an obsession with their looks; they want to wear only expensive clothes. They do not have any respect for their parents. They always demand the best, the most expensive jeans, the latest mobile, without thinking about their poor parents who work hard in order to spoil their children.\n\nSecondly, I find that children are not polite anymore. They do not have any respect for old people. Some young delinquents do not hesitate to attack an old woman in order to steal her bag. I think it is sad.\n\nThen, young people do not care about cleanliness in public transports; they do not preserve the infrastructure.

{"file_id": "1021667.txt", "output_essay": "It has been an argument regarding the issue of whether the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide. Some people prefer to travel alone. Because they don't need to adjust their time for other people and they can decide everything by themselves. However, from my perspective, I think it is better to travel by a group led by a tour guide rather than traveling alone.\n\nFirst, if we travel to a place that we are not familiar with, everything is so strange. So, in this case, we need someone who is well-known about the place, like a tour guide. It is certain that a tour guide is an expert of the travel place; he or she will make a great schedule and adjust the time. The only thing that we have to do is follow the schedule. I think it is convenient, and we don't need to waste time.\n\nSecond, we can have more great experiences with a group of people. People can exchange their own opinions and also take remarkable pictures together. They can also enjoy more pleasure time rather than feeling alone. As people are living in a social society, traveling by a group could help develop their relationships.\n\nFinally, because of these two reasons, I think the better and more efficient way to travel is traveling in a group of people together led by a tour guide."}
{"file_id": "1012615.txt", "output_essay": "The best way to travel will depend on the particular character, personality, and needs of each person. However, when you are traveling in a group led by a tour guide, you can miss the most really important things from the places you are visiting.\n\nHaving a tour guide will definitely take you to the most common areas, and you will be able to have a picture of yourself in front of the most well-known places in the world. Nevertheless, you can also have this by doing a photomontage and placing yourself wherever you want to.\n\nWhat really gives value to a travel and what makes it worth visiting a new place is the people and the new cultural differences they can show and share with you. The people are what build a specific society, and the people are the ones who give a specific place its own personality, either shown by a building or even also shown by their particular dishes.\n\nThere are many examples of the new wonders you can find if you are really willing to talk with the locals. However, there is not enough time to have several examples to share; therefore, let's take one specific country, like Germany. This example can be narrowed even more by taking one of the areas, like Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. This area is known more for having the very famous castle known to almost everybody, the Cinderella Castle. Disney took this castle as its most important logo and practically immortalized it, and now it is being visited by people all around the world. However, once you are there, even though the sight is beautiful and the walk to the inside of the castle shows a very nice passage, there is almost nothing else to see there, and almost no time to enjoy it since there are too many people in a queue in front of you and behind you. In the meantime, you are losing the great opportunity of visiting other castles, even nicer ones, in a more calm way.\n\nThe food is another very good argument for why it is better to travel by yourself and give yourself the chance to relate with the local people. It is amazing, but no matter where you go, you will find a McDonald's. If you are with a tour guide and there is time, maybe he/she will take you to a very expensive restaurant, and most probably will not have the typical meals of the area. On the other hand, if there is no time, and the tourist guide considers that there is not enough time, and let's emphasize on the fact that this tourist guide is the one making the decisions for you, there will be a high probability of having the famous hamburgers mentioned before. If you take the time, the locals will really appreciate it, and you may even be lucky enough to have a meal at grandma's place. There is nothing more delicious than that.\n\nThere are many reasons to say why it is better to travel by yourself, which does not mean to travel alone, than to travel in a group led by a tour guide, but self-experience will determine it at the end and will give you the true reasons to choose between them. If I have to choose, I will definitely always try to have my own trip with my own itinerary."}
{"file_id": "1021281.txt", "output_essay": "Nowadays, there is a hot topic about whether young people enjoy life more than older people do. Some people think that old people have more time to enjoy life. Others may disagree and contend that young people are more energetic and more likely to enjoy life. If I were faced with this issue, I would definitely support the latter point. There are numerous reasons to support this point, and I would only explore some of them and describe as follows: The first and foremost reason to support my point is just as someone said, young people are more energetic than older people. This is easily seen in the entertainment fields. For example, young people are more concerned about entertainment events like movies, music, and entertaining stars. They will spend a lot of their leisure time talking and watching them. Their physical conditions also allow them to do so for a long time. You seldom see old people in a disco bar. In a word, since young people have more power, they are more likely to enjoy life.\n\nThe second and significant reason for my view is that young people are more creative than older people. It is obvious in teenagers. A scientific research shows that since young people's brains are in the formative period, they could accept new things easily. For instance, the Internet is widely used in recent decades. The users of them are mostly young people. No wonder someone represents young people as the rising sun at about eight or nine o'clock. Their creativity enables them to enjoy life most.\n\nIn conclusion, it is not hard to find that young people can enjoy life more than any other age group because of their energy and creativity. But we also encourage older people to learn from the young and never give up on life."}

We have been using them for more than 50 years, but it's hard to tell what their approximate numbers will be in twenty years' time, as this subject needs a large analysis. But some predictions, comparing their advantages and disadvantages, can be made.\n\nThe number of cars in use can increase or stay nearly the same in twenty years. First of all, they are not new technologies, so they have become crucial elements of our lives. For instance, we have built large roads, bridges, or traffic rules to use them effectively, and even some of us regard their cars as their friends. What is more, although they pollute the environment, it couldn't prevent people from using them. Secondly, they still provide easy access to everywhere, comparing to planes or trains. For instance, we will still be using our cars to go short distances. In addition, there can be new materials in twenty years' time, which will be alternative to petrol and which will enhance car usage.\n\nOn the other hand, it's also possible to say that the number of cars in use will lessen in following years. New transport opportunities can be mentioned to support this argument. For instance, much more accessible and efficient vehicles can be preferred in the future. Moreover, cars use petrol, which is a natural resource that will be finished soon, and for which people are being killed for years. So, it's logical to think that people are already fed up with the problems that petrol causes. Not only its political and social problems, but also petrol and cars have an economical aspect due to the fact that petrol prices have been on the increase and have become very expensive.\n\nIn conclusion, it's possible for cars to be popular in following years as they are up to now.

In this regard, it is worth noting that prior to the start of the new academic year, AUCians usually gather in organized groups that tend to make orientation for the new freshmen.Usually, there are groups that cover a wide spectrum of services that include orientation to the AUC campus, including classes, labs, library, and departments.Also, these groups introduce the new students to the university catalogue and related matters such as advising, course registration, and requirements for joining any specific major.Moreover, the same groups make the new students familiar with the various extracurricular activities that are available on campus.Another aspect of devotion of young AUCians to their small community is that they join certain groups that target alumni and other sponsors in order to provide adequate funding for many of the activities that are arranged at AUC.In this way, it is evident how the young AUCians prove to be effective in serving their small community.\n\nOn the other hand, and as far as AUCians' services for their large community are concerned, it will be essential to highlight the role of the different clubs at AUC.AUC hosts many clubs that are fully operated through young students and aim at making life better in Egypt.There are many clubs that include, inter alia, the Help Club, Cancer Club, and Hand in Hand Club.The Help Club is a club that aims at providing the poor people in Egypt with better living conditions.This is attained via gathering donations from AUC young students and using the same to buy food, clothes, homes, and shelter for the poor people.Furthermore, the Cancer Club concentrates its efforts on collecting donations to support patients of cancer in their tough struggle with this severe disease.Along the same line, the Hand in Hand Club aims at visiting elderly people who are hosted in various elderly houses.During these visits, members of the Hand in Hand Club tend to provide the said elderly with their needs and try to draw a smile on their faces as a simple reciprocation for the sincere efforts in their youth.Accordingly, it goes beyond doubt that the young students at AUC play a vital role in serving their large community.\n\nIn light of the above, and based on life examples of the young students at AUC, it can be concluded that young students have a feeling of belonging to their societies.Thus, they have enthusiasm and dedication to help and serve their communities."}
{"file_id": "1021461.txt", "output_essay": "I really agree with the statement. In Italy, where I live, there are a lot of advertisements that make products seem much better than they really are. I hope these advertisements will disappear because I think that the way people spend money is no joke.\n\nI could write a lot of examples about these things. I have a friend, Kate, who bought a shower gel that ensured her body skin would become smooth, just like silk, but it isn't the truth! Another example could be the LCD televisions that clerks encourage you to buy with the promise of a great view and a lot of light, but then you discover that you need to submit a new pay-per-view frequency to see it.\n\nIn the past, I had a lot of arguments with people who sold these kinds of things. I don't want to say that it's always the same, sometimes there are a lot of things that seem to be great through advertisement, and after you buy them, you discover they are really pretty good.\n\nIn my life, I don't like lies, and I don't like liar people, and I really hate those who promise you something and then you discover it was just a bad lie. I think that these people deserve legal judgment and should go to jail, especially when they handle other people's money.\n\nI think that in the time we live, with a lot of diffusion, it's important for economies to be clear, because having a clear economy is the first step for people to trust in their own governments and make the world work in the right direction.\n\nIn my opinion, it's important to have laws that allow people to trust in advertising and make advertisements clear and sure for people who buy something without bad surprises."}

For example, we can play in many ways, like playing an X-box in our houses and going to the movie theater. On the other side, older people might not have had a chance to play or watch a movie at the theater with their friends. Not only do we play to enjoy life, but we can also find new jobs easily and discover our habits easily through the internet.\n\nFirst of all, many young people these days play X-box in their houses. Probably in the old days, they just played outside sports like basketball or soccer. However, in these days, we can play soccer or basketball in our houses using X-box. The new technology systems affect us in many ways. For example, we are allowed to talk to someone anywhere and at any time we want. By calling or emailing each other, we can find an enjoyable life.\n\nIn addition, many young people these days also go to the movie theater to watch movies. In the movie theater, we can choose the movie we want to watch. For instance, scary movies and sad movies. By watching them, we can have fun times in our spare time. Also, while we watch the movie, we can eat any food we want. In the old days, they didn't have any movies, so probably they all watched the news all the time.\n\nFinally, we can find our habits and new jobs easily by searching on the internet. For example, if we are interested in skiing in the winter break, then we can search for the place where we can go for the best and even learn how to ski. By searching and finding from the internet, we can find out what our habit is. For instance, when I started to chat with my neighbor and I enjoyed it, then it could become my habit.\n\nIn conclusion, many technology systems affect our ability to live an enjoyable life more than older people did before their time. Therefore, in my opinion, I agree that young people enjoy life more than older people did before."}
{"file_id": "1024129.txt", "output_essay": "I agree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. Because you can make use of ideas, and you will remember them for a long time.\n\nFirst of all, when we understand ideas and concepts, we can apply them to every aspect of daily life. For example, when we learn about Plato, we do not just have to learn what age he lived or what the titles of his books are. However, if you understand his philosophy, you have a different perspective, and old ideas and concepts are related to our present life, so it might make your life better.\n\nSecond, when we understand ideas and concepts, we will remember them easily. For example, please think about Chinese characters. We learned them in elementary school. When we learn how to write them, we also learn how they came to be. That is why we can remember them easily when we understand the ideas behind them.\n\nIn conclusion, understanding ideas is more important than learning facts. Understanding ideas and concepts provides us with new ideas and makes our life better."}
{"file_id": "1021767.txt", "output_essay": "I'm not so sure that it's more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. I think that this statement is quite generic and incomplete. If it is referred to historical studies, it could be acceptable. For example, it is more important for a student to understand why the world wars occurred than the specific facts and dates linked to the war's history. And this example could be extended to the general comprehension of the actual world's political situation. But without knowing facts, it's difficult to make a personal idea on an argument. \n\nIf we take, for example, scientific fields, we have to refuse this statement; it's impossible to discuss a scientific idea without knowing the specific facts (rules, laws, properties) connected to this idea. \n\nSo, my personal opinion is that there isn't a division between facts and concepts; they are strongly connected. (Here, we could open a philosophical discussion about facts and judgments in Kant's theory.) I suggest to the other students to make sure to know very well a fact before giving an opinion, and to investigate a fact before accepting others' opinions. \n\nThis problem involves the eternal problem of historical sources: scholars have to believe in historical narrations without the real possibility to control themselves the truth of a fact. On the contrary, the figure of the critic should be an example of a person who can see and study a fact and then give his opinion about that fact. \n\nSo, in order to give a correct and credible opinion about something, it is very, very important to study the facts themselves."}
{"file_id": "1017400.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with having broad knowledge of many academic subjects rather than specializing in one specific subject.\n\nThere are some reasons why I think that way.\n\nFirst of all, it is crucial to choose one's future wisely. Because it is too early to decide what to study, the more we experience, the more we can choose. We don't know what we really want to do yet, because we couldn't have had enough time to think. Most university students are not sure about their future.\n\nIn my case, I chose French as my major. And I have worked with French. After two years, I was confused if my choice was right or not. I decided to take some English classes and talked to a professor about my situation. I could think of my problem thoroughly after it. Lastly, I decided to double major in English and French. If I didn't take English classes, I wouldn't know what I exactly wanted to study in the university because I wouldn't even know I liked to study English.\n\nSecondly, sometimes people don't have much knowledge outside of their major. And this can make a person seem boring. Nowadays, society wants people who have many interests and talents. And we can learn that information from other activities such as other academic subjects. From those studies, we can explore other majors.\n\nFor instance, there is a leisure sports department in my university. Many of my friends were interested in jazz dances and physical exercises like bodybuilding. Even though their major was not leisure sports, they took those classes and had a lot of fun.\n\nFrom those subjects, not only could they enjoy their campus lives, but they could also make great memories and experiences.\n\nUntil graduating from high school, we couldn't choose what we wanted to study, and we have the right to choose many subjects and to get interesting information from outside of our major.\n\nThis can be very helpful in our campus lives."}
{"file_id": "1020574.txt", "output_essay": "A community can be defined as a society where people can relate themselves to it. I do not agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. In fact, I believe that young people nowadays spend more time helping their communities than young people before.\n\nDoing volunteer work is one way for young people to help out with their communities. Although young people before also did community services, now the urge and the need to do community services have increased. There are many factors that have caused young people to do volunteer work.\n\nFirst of all, nowadays young people have more opportunities to do community services. In school, nowadays, teachers encourage students to sign up for community services such as Flag Day or teaching English at local schools.\n\nNowadays, it can probably be said that doing community services is not optional but is now becoming compulsory. Before, students were not required to do community services, but nowadays it is compulsory for students to do volunteer work to participate in various activities. For example, HKAYP is a program where students work on their outdoor experience. In order for students to join the HKAYP program, they have to do a specific amount of service hours to enter different levels (bronze, silver, and gold level) and receive certificates after they complete each level.\n\nAlso, the importance of community services is recognized. All students want to be accepted by good universities. It is now known to students that doing volunteer work can give universities a good impression of them, as the volunteer work they have done can be reflected on their university application. So, for example, now young people in Hong Kong spend a lot of time doing volunteer work during their spare time (especially on holidays) since they receive a certificate provided by the government when they fill up a certain amount of service hours.\n\nOverall, I disapprove of the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to help out their community. I believe that young people nowadays, as a matter of fact, help out more due to the fact that they are more exposed to community services (schools encourage students by introducing community services), some activities require students to do volunteer work in order to join, and that students can write their services on their university application."}
{"file_id": "1020691.txt", "output_essay": "The issue of specialization is difficult to deal with, since plenty of different views have been expressed on this subject. On the one hand, one can be tempted to think that a great variety of knowledge allows somebody to enlarge their view of certain matters. However, we cannot deny that a deeper knowledge in a specific subject can sometimes be required to solve some technical problems. Taking all aspects into account, I am strongly convinced that specialization does have more advantages than broad knowledge.\n\nTo begin with, specialization surely allows for better efficiency in problem-solving. Who would ask a mathematician to read Moli\u00e8re while they can ask an actor? As far as I am concerned, I am firmly convinced that each of us has one or several special skills that make them different from others: one plays the piano, their brother cooks well, and I see no reason why the pianist should learn to cook! On the contrary, they should continue learning piano to improve this particular skill.\n\nAnother way to justify my point of view is to consider it under the professional aspect. In relationship marketing, one makes a distinction between the 'waiting time', which is the time the client waits before their problem is taken into account by a firm, and the 'solving time', which is the time needed to solve this particular problem. By choosing specialists, the firm considerably reduces its 'solving time'. Furthermore, the more different these specialists are, the shorter the 'waiting time' will become, since a great variety of problems will thus be quickly taken into account.\n\nLastly, specialization may require a firm to have a good internal organization. Indeed, without such an efficient organization, the special skills of each employee may not be used as well as they should be. However, if a firm does settle down such an organization and does prefer hiring specialized workers, its efficiency will surely improve.\n\nTo conclude, my strong belief is that specialization is a key answer to some persistent economic and political problems. A major stake will thus be to accept the fact that one could not do everything perfectly. After all, Billy Wilder was probably right when he wrote that 'Nobody is perfect!'"}
{"file_id": "1017038.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with the statement that there will be fewer cars in the next twenty years. There will be three points to support my idea. Then, I will list these three points as follows:\n\nFirst of all, the governments of today are putting more investment into improving the public transportation system, and there will be less need to purchase a private car. Most people in our city buy cars because there are so few public buses and subways, and it always makes them late to work or school. So, if the government allocates its budget more to build the public transportation system, fewer citizens will buy cars. And since the Traffic Mass Action began progressing in our city, the number of cars has already declined.\n\nAnother thing that will contribute to the reduction of the number of cars is the limited amount and high expense of crude oil resources. Nowadays, fewer oil fields can extract enough crude oil for people to use. In order to explore new oil resources, we are looking to the sea floor. You know, drilling an oil well on the sea floor requires much more expense and modern techniques. In addition, the war in the Middle East has caused the price of oil to rise far more than we could have expected. If we want to run a car, we should spend more money on fuel expenses than ever before. And I think this situation will not change in the next twenty years. As a result, it will make us reduce our use of cars compared to nowadays.\n\nLast but not least is that people's conception of protecting the environment and reducing pollution. By using cars, it will cause a lot of environmental problems, such as air pollution and noise pollution. All these will harm human health. However, people now concern themselves more with health problems than ever before. So, they will reduce their use of cars to decline the pollution it causes. For this reason, the number of cars will, of course, decline in the next 20 years.\n\nAll in all, the governments' actions, the limited natural resources, and people's mindset to decline pollution all contribute to the reduced number of cars. And I also think that fewer cars will make our life better and will also benefit the whole society."}

However, I agree with the statement for the following reasons.\n\nFirst of all, a famous person who advertises products may make us misunderstand the products. For example, I bought a new car three years ago. Because a new car was very high for me, I searched a lot of cars by using the internet and talking with salespeople. This searching process continued for about five months. However, the most important factor to buy my car was the TV commercial that Ichiro, who was the most famous baseball player in Japan, advertised the car. I loved him very much, and if I bought the car, I would feel close to him. However, this decision resulted in failure since this car had a lot of problems. If Ichiro had not advertised this car, I would not have bought it. This experience definitely demonstrates that a famous person who advertises products may make us misunderstand the products.\n\nAdditionally, advertisements often emphasize only the merits of products. For example, I bought a new computer last year. Because it was advertised as the cheapest and latest machine, I decided to buy it very quickly. However, I found that most of the software, such as 'Word' and 'Excel', were not incorporated in it. Generally speaking, familiar software is incorporated in a computer in Japan. However, this advertisement did not express this weak point. If I had had all of the information about the computer, I would not have bought it. This example clearly explains that advertisements often emphasize only the good points of products.\n\nIn conclusion, I definitely agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are."}

Strength in this specific case is associated with youth. Indeed, when you are 80 years old, chances are you will not have the strength anymore to hold yourself up on a horse.

On the other hand, when I will be older, I will be able to contemplate all the things I will have done physically and experienced over my lifetime. In my opinion, that is something only older people can do. Which, in my opinion, is a good thing, because it shows that nature is well-made. Younger people have different ways to enjoy life, in what they are able to do, for example. And then there are other ways they are not able to enjoy their life, because they are young. The same goes for older people. They have their way of enjoying life, like, for instance, contemplating their experiences over a lifetime. Why? Because they are older and they have lived for a long time, and they also have the time to think about it.

So, we can strongly say that these hotels trying in a new way was helping them.\n\nIn the case of automobiles, these companies are trying to follow new ways and are also investing a lot of amount on research and development, and were providing their customers with better facilities to satisfy their customers who will be wishing to go for a better one.\n\nFrom these examples, we can get that trying new was always better, but it was also having some drawbacks, and if they go in a wrong way, it may lead to their destruction, so they should be conscious while going for the new way.\n\nRisk was a must in this competitive world, and without that, we cannot be that successful in our life, so a successful person cannot stand on the same thing because he was successful only because of the risks they had taken in their lives.\n\nFinally, it was clear that not only those successful men, but everybody should go for risks to enjoy a great life of achievements.

{"file_id": "1022384.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. From my point of view, it is very important to have people within a society who try to do new things. This is especially important when it comes to innovation. Up to now, there would not be any automobiles or planes if people did not try to do new things, although these things were connected to high risks. On the one hand, society needs inventions, but on the other hand, you need to have a look at the risks as well. Regarding Albert Einstein and his inventions, everybody would agree that he created huge value for our society. On the other hand, the question must be raised: if nuclear weapons existed today, would it be the case if he were not that innovative? As most people are part or members of a community or a company, I would like to focus my answer on the strategic management of a company within a highly competitive market. From my point of view, the only possibility to be successful and to create sustainability is to be innovative and to have innovative employees. Of course, there are a few companies staying in the market by focusing on their key competencies and by 'doing what they already know how to do well,' but to become 'successful' as mentioned in the question, you have to be innovative. Of course, one could say that a company focusing on only one well-known activity does not have any risk, but from my point of view, the risk is to get kicked out of the market by another very innovative company. There is a famous statement referring to the strategic management of a company and its employees, which can be used for all other people as well: 'Often it is more important to do the right things than to do things right.'

{"file_id": "1024274.txt", "output_essay": "In my opinion, in order to have a better understanding of ideas, concepts must be supported by facts.\n\nFirst of all, it is impossible to understand an idea without a complete evaluation of the facts that are the base structure of the concept. If you understand an idea without knowing the facts behind it, then you are only learning a \"dogma\". An example of dogmatic understanding is the religious one, which ignores facts because it is not looking for a deep understanding of things but only a solution that will bring it to its answer.\n\nThis is why, in religious learning, facts are generally avoided: they prefer interpretations.\n\nSecondly, to understand something, you need to start learning the facts in order to start a critical analysis. The only way to start this process of understanding is by starting from the knowledge of facts.\n\nIn order to understand an idea, you must know what the historical situation was in which this idea was created. I'll make an example to make my opinion clearer: you can't understand the basic ideas of communism or Nazism without knowing the historical situation and dynamics that brought about these different political, social, and economic totalitarianisms.\n\nLastly, I would say that you don't really understand anything if you can't prove it and explain it with facts. It is with an empirical analysis of facts that you can prove what you have understood and why you believe so. Every scientist needs an experiment to clarify their point; otherwise, they will seem not credible, and their idea not effective.\n\nThese are the three reasons why I believe that there is a strong link and connection between understanding an idea and learning the facts related to the concept."}
{"file_id": "1021923.txt", "output_essay": "The argument that successful people are characterized by continuously taking risks and entering new ventures, and avoiding tasks that they are familiar with, is a controversial one.\n\nOn the one hand, more risk means more return, and greater chances of reaching and building creative ideas and results.\n\nOn the other hand, working on a task that you know well will promise sure success, as compared to risky avenues that have a tendency to result in huge failures as much as resulting in successes.\n\nPersonally, I believe that successful people are those who stick to tasks that they can master, and I support my argument with the following three reasons.\n\nFirst, entering risky avenues without the knowledge and experience in the chosen risky task is similar to a gamble; the chances of winning are equal to the chances of losing.\n\nIt may also be that the chances of losing are higher, as any task requires the performer to learn and educate themselves, and also familiarize themselves with the task.\n\nTake snowboarding, for example; you can't successfully snowboard without practicing for long hours and taking lessons, or you will end up injured.\n\nSecond, working on things that you are familiar with is the beginning of any process of innovation.\n\nA number of human resource books state that any process of innovation within any field first requires that you have the knowledge and experience within this field.\n\nThird, a number of losses faced by risk-takers who enter fields they have no knowledge about lead to very severe losses that may very likely impair the person's ability to undergo other tasks in the future.\n\nAs an example, the market crash in the late 1990s led to substantial losses for the naive investors who devoted their time and a significant amount of their savings to a venture that they had no knowledge about.\n\nMany really went bankrupt, lost their families, and their health.\n\nAll in all, I believe that success can be reached if people undertake tasks they are familiar with.\n\nThe choice of a familiar task leads to a much more positive outcome, compared to an outcome of entering risky avenues that you have no knowledge about."}

Some people emphasize the great importance of students understanding ideas and concepts in their school settings, while others argue that the significance of learning facts should not be neglected. As far as I see it, it would be more reasonable for the school to teach their students more about how to understand ideas and concepts. Some of my reasons are given below.\n\nThe main reason for my propensity is that the school provides the best environment for students to understand ideas and concepts, while facts can be learned by students themselves through other ways, such as the internet and documentary films. In the classroom, students can be guided by the teacher, and they can discuss matters with their classmates, which are both of utmost importance for them to understand ideas and concepts. If teachers just keep telling students facts, the advantage of the school would be wasted. Furthermore, other methods enable students to learn facts that are far more valuable and up-to-date. The internet contains much more information than the textbooks used in the classroom, and the information is likely to be the latest.\n\nBesides, understanding ideas and concepts helps students to solve more complex problems. As we have noticed, exams nowadays are more flexible, which not only require students to list facts printed in the book but also require students to make use of their learned ideas and concepts to achieve a higher score. If a high school student can grasp the ideas and concepts in class, they will probably get a higher score in the College Entrance Examination, which can have an extremely important impact on this student's future career.\n\nAdditionally, were students eager to understand ideas and concepts, they are more likely to discuss or share their opinions with their classmates and teachers. That would undoubtedly help students' interpersonal communication ability. Moreover, communication can result in friendship. When students are discussing with each other, they may find something in common between them, or even become friends due to it. As the time for them to discuss problems goes by, their friendship is likely to solidify.\n\nThough learning facts is also very important in education, judging from what has been mentioned above, I believe it is understanding ideas and concepts that far outweighs the opposite aspect."}
{"file_id": "1023952.txt", "output_essay": "I think it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts to help them learn facts. Without understanding the required concepts and ideas, it will be difficult to grasp the core of the passage or theory. Of course, the fact will be useless when the main idea is not conveyed to the students. All of us have heard about the 'funny stories.' These pieces of information we heard from other people are meaningless in most moments, but why do we laugh to tears and catch the meaning of the words instead of just understanding the fact, which means nothing to us? This is because the fact is like a lower-division course, which just teaches the listener or student to understand the surface of the words, yet more important information the 'funny story' would like to send to the listener is the idea and concept, that is, an upper-division course, including what lies beneath the surface of the story. I believe this is the key, and most of us should be concerned about it.\n\nWhile facts sometimes really improve our knowledge of news we are not familiar with, the fact is that its usefulness is just a small part of the mean benefit we transport from the information. We should deduce sometimes, to crop the inside idea and concept to learn the fact much more clearly. Without understanding the core of the delivered information, we will even misinterpret the meaning of the fact and never get rid of the darkness of misunderstanding.\n\nBewildering amounts of students just read about Time News to catch up with the world and current events. They hardly have the enthusiasm to dig deeper to summarize the main idea of the situation they are facing. It is indeed the pollution of the information surrounding them. As a result of this, with an incomplete understanding, they make comments to others, and they always indulge in these mistakes. This is just like a 'hoax' or deception. They think they will never plead ignorance to anything without knowing that they are making countless mistakes. And these mistakes will overtake and ruin them someday. Only because these students could not see what is behind the fact, ideas, and concepts."}
{"file_id": "1024522.txt", "output_essay": "Learning mechanisms work in different ways from person to person. Some people choose to memorize the facts, while others choose to learn how the facts can be produced. Learning concepts and ideas is important because you can remember the facts by brainstorming about the concepts and ideas, and you can become familiar with learning new facts about a different topic.\n\nFirst of all, it must be accepted that memorizing the facts can be a fast way to learn. It can work in a short period of time. You can pass the next examination, for instance. On the other hand, when you forget the fact, it will be very hard to remember if you don't know the ideas behind them and the concepts. If you learn the ideas and concepts, you can guess how the fact is provided. So, learning the ideas and concepts can work on keeping the data in mind for a long time.\n\nFurthermore, once you get used to learning how a fact can be provided from an idea, you can easily learn an unfamiliar topic. Every lecture has facts and ideas, and the relationship between facts and ideas is the same. Firstly, you will try to understand the ideas. According to the ideas in the concept, you can learn the facts as stably as you provided these facts. You can use exactly the same method on learning new lectures.\n\nAs a result, learning the ideas is better than memorizing the facts, even though it needs a larger time to understand. The data will be more stable, and it will be easy to remember, and learning new topics will be easier than memorizing every fact of every lecture."}

People's opinions diverge from each other, not to mention on such a statement: 'Travel by ourselves and travel in a group led by a tour guide, which one is better?' Some people prefer the former, but I disagree. I prefer to travel in a group led by a guide because it really has a number of benefits that we cannot deny.\n\nThe first reason for my inclination is that traveling in a group led by a tour guide can give me a more profound knowledge of my travel. No one could detail the history of a new spot only by using a touring guidebook. No one could speak out where a more valuable spot is located only by using a telephone. No one could know more scenarios by only confining themselves to the maps. However, the tour guide can!\n\nThe second reason for my propensity is that traveling in a group led by a tour guide can make a connection to different kinds of people. I just took part in a travel in a group led by a tour guide, and I made friends who were involved in it, and what's more, until now I still keep in touch with one of them who is also a university student like me. And she is in the same major as me, so it is a luck for me to have this kind of tour and get such a good friend who has the same personal experience and emotional concern as me!\n\nLast but not least, traveling in a group led by a tour guide can make you safer and happier. If you visit by yourself, who will help you when you get hurt? If you visit by yourself, who will help you to go on your tour when you lose your way? If you visit by yourself, who will talk with you when you feel faint during your bus ride? Nobody. And this is quite different from traveling in a group where you can ask your tour guide and talk with other travelers.\n\nAll in all, traveling in a group led by a tour guide is an advisable choice with conspicuous benefits. I prefer it fully. Now, what I want to do is to make sure that everyone around me who likes traveling as much as me can reach all these benefits."}
{"file_id": "1023946.txt", "output_essay": "These days, a large number of people say that learning facts is the most important and substantial way to improve themselves. However, I agree with the idea that it is more important for students to understand ideas than to learn facts because students with ideas or concepts can enable people to explain things more efficiently, and students have more time to spend studying than do adults.\n\nThe main reasons are as follows.\n\nOne reason that students should put a higher priority on ideas or concepts than on facts is that ideas and concepts can help people to explain things logically. To be more specific, students can classify, confirm, and assure things with fixed ideas. For example, my brother always tells me the reason why things go on as they do because he studied a lot of ideas and concepts in his university. However, I did not study ideas. So, my knowledge is just from experience or facts. To be honest, it is quite difficult for me to explain something to other people because I do not understand the real ideas or concepts. Many people told me that they do not understand my explanation at all. That is why I think learning ideas is the most important.\n\nThe other reason that students can have better benefits from ideas than facts is that students have more time to study ideas than do adults. That is to say, even if adults want to study ideas, it takes a long time to learn concepts of things. For example, as I mentioned above, my brother studied ideas and concepts in his university. I actually envy him because he can explain things better than I. So, I decided to learn concepts by myself. However, since I am working for a company six days a week, I did not have enough time to learn ideas enough. Hence, I regret not studying ideas in my university.\n\nIn conclusion, I agree with the idea that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts, for the above reasons. When I have children, I will encourage them to learn ideas and concepts in their universities in order not to have trouble explaining things to people."}
{"file_id": "1023918.txt", "output_essay": "I don't agree with the statement 'Young people enjoy life more than older people do'!\n\nI think one reason is that there are significant differences between young people and older people because older people have different experiences than younger people. You cannot put them on the same basis.\n\nIn my opinion, older people enjoy their life in a different way than they did in their past. In the past, parents were much stricter with their children than they are today. Older people enjoy their life by doing other activities than younger people do. They don't have to go to a club or a disco to enjoy their free time. They do things like traveling, walking around, reading interesting books, or something else.\n\nWhen you are older, you also have more possibilities to enjoy your life because you may have more money than younger people.\n\nFor me, it is really terrible that young people often enjoy life in a very strange way. Often, they have to drink alcohol or take drugs to have fun! For me, it is not a way of enjoying life.\n\nFor example, there are my parents. In their younger life, they didn't enjoy life like they do today. That is because they became parents in their younger days and so they weren't able to have fun like teenagers or young people do nowadays. But today, their children are adults and don't live at home, so they are able to make holidays or go to the cinema or something like that whenever they want to. I think that is a good way of enjoying life and free time.\n\nTo give a short conclusion, it is important to enjoy life when you are young and when you are old."}
{"file_id": "1025558.txt", "output_essay": "While a large number of students realize that understanding the ideas and concepts is the basis of a learning process, I tend to believe that learning facts is more important.\n\nFirst, the facts let students know the implementation and design based on the abstract ideas and concepts in the textbook. A student who conducts and manages a software development team may have a deeper understanding of the area of software design and human resource management than one who only learns from books.\n\nFor example, a designer may have more detailed and deepened comprehension of the internal core thinking, which is the most valuable part of their job, after they finish a design by researching and reviewing a lot of books and articles, including concepts proposed before.\n\nIn addition, it makes more sense for a student to learn the facts brought by their own hands-on experiment. When I was a member of the web development team of our university website, I learned a lot from the practice of installing and configuring the web server and writing code for a web application, which is not fully stated in any book in the bookstore. This makes my way broader and easier to achieve expertise in the field of computer science.\n\nLastly, learning facts is a higher level than just understanding the original ideas and concepts. The students who know how to put the principles into daily work may show a stronger ability to master not only what to learn but also how to learn, that is to say, they are more likely to become quick learners, an ability which is called for by many international business companies such as Microsoft, Google, and IBM.\n\nFrom all the discussion I mentioned above, we could safely draw a conclusion that learning facts takes a more significant position than just understanding the ideas and concepts in the learning process."}

I think it was not at all difficult; we could arrive in Japan well and went on a shopping spree, took pictures with native people, and so on. In this travel, we got along with my friends.\n\nSecondly, we can learn about the travel place's history. By traveling without a tour guide, we can study about the travel place's history. Nowadays, according to international social development, we can access many sources of Japan's information and history, such as reading a tour guide book and surfing the Internet.\n\nIn these reasons, I think I like the best way to travel is in a group without a tour guide leader."}
{"file_id": "1023612.txt", "output_essay": "Advertisements are seen all over. They catch the public's attention in newspapers, televisions, and billboards. Nowadays, advertisements are also seen in cinemas. But I personally feel that these advertisements are often exaggerating. Advertisements usually don't mention hidden costs, don't mention the efficiency of the product, and hence deceive people.\n\nFirst, the advertisements projected nowadays do not mention the hidden details they have for a particular product. For example, in the MasterCard advertisement, the advertisement mainly portrays the advantages, such as a lower interest rate and surprise gifts. However, they do not mention detailed information about the product. My friend received a bill for $500 just because he crossed the due date, which was not mentioned to him when he bought the card. Moreover, for the gifts they give to customers, they actually demand money from the customers. Another example of such hidden costs is in the mobile phone industry. Last month, I got a call from my service provider, and they launched a new offer, which they mentioned was free of cost. However, when I activated and started using this facility, my bill started to shoot up. The service provider did not mention the usage cost.\n\nSecond, the advertisements do not mention the efficiency of the product. For example, I started using a calculator from a local market. However, the calculator did not work for more than two days. It did not respond to several buttons. The advertisement that I referred to did not mention the life of the calculator. Another example is when I bought a BlackBerry; the advertisement said, 'Free Bluetooth Headsets for every BlackBerry.' However, it failed to work after one month.\n\nFinally, advertisements primarily deceive people. They project the product in a bigger size on televisions, but actually, it seems to look so small. Moreover, they mention that the entire product is free, and once we go and buy, they would say that the scheme is under exchange. Several such ways are followed by companies to fool the public.\n\nFor the above-mentioned reasons, advertisements are depicting an entirely wrong picture of the products and tend to exaggerate the product. I personally believe that companies must project correct facts about products."}
{"file_id": "1026798.txt", "output_essay": "Although facts provide a clear and better opinion for a particular subject, personally, I think that to understand the basic concepts and the main idea behind the subject is much better compared to simply knowing the facts.\n\nSo, I agree with the statement that it is more important to understand ideas and concepts than merely learning the facts.\n\nAs we see, students in their schools or colleges perform much better when they understand the concepts well and have a clear idea of the subject that is being taught. They never have to cram when the basic concept is clear in their mind. Also, they never forget that thing for their entire life. Knowing the facts may fetch them good marks, but they forget the subject within a short span of time.\n\nSecondly, the workers in an office show much better performance when they understand the basic concept and the main idea behind the project they are working on. Simply knowing the facts would not generate an effective result. So, in order to get a better promotion, they have to learn the concepts well so that they perform well. Like in today's world, one must have the idea and concept of a computer to perform well in office or in their job.\n\nThirdly, it is very important for a player of any game to know the basic concept of the game rather than the facts. When I learned to play football, my coach told me the main concept behind the game, and hence I play the game well. Simply knowing the facts about football cannot make me a good player.\n\nThus, we saw how knowing the concepts and the basic ideas behind a subject is much better than by simply knowing the facts."}
{"file_id": "1025673.txt", "output_essay": "Recently, you may realize that there are more and more advertisements, not just on TV programs, but also in some newspapers and magazines. That makes us think deeply about whether advertisements make products seem better than they really are. In my opinion, I agree with that statement. To begin with, a product of good quality costs much on advertisements. Most companies spend a lot of money on advertising their products, overshadowing their function and use. That is harmful and not responsible to the customers. Actually, many products of good quality cannot afford expensive advertisements, so they cannot attract many customers.\n\nWhat's more, most customers like to find their preferred product according to TV. As you know, most people spend about 1-2 hours in front of the TV. They think advertisements are very faithful, especially those announced by a famous person. If they like the person, they will trust the function of the product. So they waste a lot of money on that. In fact, the product is not really what they think of.\n\nFinally, many beautiful words and descriptions of the products really make them seem to be useful. Many people add some uses that do not really exist in the products and also overstate their function. Many words sound very reasonable and trustworthy, making it hard for you to analyze the fake and true. So people will easily spend money on pursuing one to have a try. For instance, a medicine cannot cure headaches, but in the advertisement, it firmly says it can cure your headache and make you sleep easily.\n\nIn a word, most advertisements can make products seem better than they really are, in different ways. You must be careful in your life."}

If in the past centuries, technological progress was often linked to negative consequences like deep industrialization and exploitation of natural resources, in the more recent years, the idea of a technological progress that can get along with nature or even help nature has spread both in the scientific world and public opinion.\n\nThat is why modern scientists are looking for a kind of car that does not pollute the air, working on a project about a car engine that does not use petrol but something alternative.\n\nThis alternative power could be hydrogen, and rumor has it that scientists have already invented it, but it cannot be sold because of market reasons.Moreover, public transportation is getting cheaper and cheaper, so that in the future, most people will use it.People in the future will be much more interested in environmental problems, just like we are more respectful towards nature than our ancestors.It is said, in fact, that in the past, cities were more noisy and polluted than nowadays, and some ancient authors wrote that when Rome was the capital of the Roman Empire, it was almost impossible to fall asleep in the city even at night, and that the noise was unbearable.\n\nGovernments, especially in the Western world, started to feel the problems connected to the uncontrolled use of cars, and they will probably vote on some policies to make people prefer non-polluting engines or other kinds of transport.\n\nAlso, since they learned the lesson from their own past, Western governments will teach the countries that are now getting industrialized new ways to produce and get richer without deeply exploiting the land, which may cause natural disasters like it happened in recent years in some areas of the world."}
{"file_id": "1027345.txt", "output_essay": "I think we should improve our life right now, so I agree with this statement. I have several reasons. First, I think successful people can improve things that are not good, so they should take risks. For example, if they know how to make computers well, and they don't take risks to change computers to make them more convenient and more useful. Now we might not have notebooks in our life. Therefore, I think we need to take risks to improve our life. On the other hand, some people only make computers because they already do well, but they can't make improvements in that computer. Their business might go down. In addition, this is a competitive world, so we need to improve. Second, we should make new things that successful people need to take risks from those new things. For instance, many people have CD players, and they have improved them to be lighter and more useful, but other companies made MP3 players, which are more useful and lighter. It means this is a risk if people don't like MP3 players, their company might die out. It is a big risk. However, if it succeeds, the business can get richer than before and more famous. In conclusion, I think successful people should try new things, not only do what they already know how to do well, because if they take risks, they can get richer, and it's also good for people who live in this world. It means they can improve things and also make useful new things for people."}

Last year, I had really long black hair, but my hair condition was not good, so I decided to make my hair healthier. At that time, I ran into some advertisements with a very attractive woman, and her hair looked like silk. What I felt at that time was, if I use that product, I would have fascinating hair like that woman's! I used it for a long time, but I couldn't have had silky hair like that woman's. First, I was depressed, but then I began to think, that's what advertisers do - 'over-advertising.'\n\nMoreover, in my opinion, there is a reasonable reason why the company has to over-advertise. From my experience, which I mentioned above, I was wondering why they are doing it. Why couldn't they just be honest, so that no one would expect what would never happen? Then, I got the idea.

Now, I'm studying mechanical engineering at the university, and when I finish, I'm going to work in an industrial factory. So, this is one reason why I don't agree with that opinion. In fact, I have to learn always and always acquire knowledge about mechanical problems because this is a condition that will let me enter easily into the world of work. So, I still have to study more to reach that goal. In spite of this consideration, having broad knowledge of many subjects is a condition that can also give important results for the future. To know other arguments, such as economics, literature, or foreign languages, is another opportunity, and with this culture, you can have interesting results to improve your career. But I think that it's better to know only a sector of your own job. Maybe one explanation can be given. Until I was a young boy, and I was ten years old, I just had a clear idea about what I wanted to do when I became an adult. So, I always wanted to be an engineer. My father is an engineer, and also my grandfather was an engineer, and maybe this can be one factor of my choice and of my opinion about this statement.

Although my family paid a great deal of money, we enjoyed the travel since it was convenient and helpful for increasing our knowledge. Like my case, people should notice that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.\n\nFirst of all, since the tour guide provides enough knowledge and information to people, it is the best way to travel in a group led by the tour guide. There are two purposes of travel. One is to have a rest, and the other is to earn information related to countries or places that people travel. When people travel to acquire knowledge, they need a professional guide, as it is hard to get information about certain places by their own power. In contrast, when people travel without a tour guide, they will sightsee without getting information, and this will not be beneficial for increasing their knowledge.\n\nSafety is another advantage of traveling with a tour guide. Foreign countries or places that people have not visited can be dangerous to people since they cannot know the factors that can be harmful. Therefore, people who travel alone sometimes get into trouble. For example, I heard news that one traveler who visited foreign countries alone was kidnapped. Thus, to decrease the risk of travel, people should travel in a group led by a tour guide who has been guiding people for a long time and has bountiful knowledge about the dangerous factors, so the tour guide can make the travelers travel safely.\n\nFinally, the travelers do not need to concern themselves about their travel plans if they travel in a group led by a tour guide. When people plan to travel alone, they have to consider various factors. They have to arrange hotels where they will stay and purchase airplane tickets. Also, they have to plan their schedule and choose where to visit to see. However, people who travel in a group by a tour guide do not need to worry about these factors because tour guide companies plan everything. What the travelers have to do is just to pay money.\n\nTo sum up, the best way to travel is to travel in a group led by a tour guide because people can earn knowledge properly and travel safely. In addition, people do not have to endeavor to make plans."}

I become more pleased after I go traveling in a group than traveling freely. I strongly believe that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide, because I can gain knowledge and spend my travel money more effectively.\n\nTo begin with, I can gain knowledge. One of a tour guide's jobs is to help people understand the culture of other countries. They also need to ensure that they show the culture and provide tourists with opportunities to experience it. To illustrate, I went to Hong Kong last week, and it was very nice. The tour guide showed us the culture of Hong Kong, and not only that, we could also eat Hong Kong food and visit places where Hong Kong people usually go in their daily lives. He also talked about the history of Hong Kong, which helped us understand the culture easily, and I became interested. Therefore, with a tour guide, travelers can learn about countries more deeply.\n\nMoreover, I can use the money spent on traveling more effectively. Some people travel to get out of their daily work and to get rid of their stress. They think they need to relax during travel, but they need money to travel, so I think it is not cost-effective. For instance, when I went to Cambodia, I did not go with a tour guide, so I did not know where to go. So I just spent my time resting in my hotel room, which was a waste of time and money. Even though I could have rested at home, I chose to spend money and had a rest in another country, which was not a good choice to make. Thus, I can save money.\n\nTo wrap up, I think the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide. First of all, I can gain knowledge and learn deeply about other countries.

In the subject of biology, it is very hard to learn facts without knowing what the facts are necessary for in a biological system or process. In history class, it is also important to know about the dates of events. But if you understand the ideas and the development of an event, you can more easily put the event in chronological order.\n\nLearning facts is very important for students who are educating themselves in a language, for example. They have to learn vocabulary to improve their new language. Law students have to learn facts, too, and they have no chance to let that out. Students who study medicine also have to learn a lot of vocabulary for anatomy.\n\nLearning facts about a theme costs a lot of time and is not really helpful in your later work for an enterprise. Understanding ideas and concepts is more likely. It is easier to learn and to understand than facts. Facts are just fictional, and you often do not know how to use facts properly in an important situation.\n\nFor example: If there is a machine that does not work anymore, it is very difficult to check every single fact of the machine. It is easier to think about the whole concept of the machine: How does it work, and what does it produce? In this way, it is much easier to find the problem of the defective machine.\n\nSo, I think, students who want to take a job in an enterprise that is in the trade business or in businesses with processes have to know more about ideas and concepts. It is very important to know about the whole work of a process than to know about facts you can easily look up in a book. Understanding ideas and concepts supports the ability to think about a problem. And the skill to be able to find a solution for a problem is a skill that makes you desirable for a lot of employers.\n\nIn my opinion, it is supportable to declare that understanding ideas and concepts is the most important skill for business.

In our days, there is more pollution than in the past, which is caused by industrialization. For this reason, the ozone hole grows up day by day, and with it, the ultraviolet lights that are noxious to our health. To resolve this issue, we must decrease air pollution and use cars and other means of transport, for example, trains, which are the main cause. If we want clean air, we must use other means of travel that respect the environment, such as bicycles. Another way to reduce pollution is the minor use of trains and especially cars, which can be used by fewer people than trains and are therefore less efficient than other means and more numerous. For this reason, I think that this great number of cars must be decreased if we want to resolve the problem of pollution. In many cities, cars can be used only for a few days a week, which is an important thing that leads me to believe that in the future, I will be able to use only trains or other means, like trains, that can transport more than one person at a time. Only in this way will we be able to have clean air, a clean environment, a clean sea, but not only because only in this way will we be healthier and therefore less ill, as many sicknesses are caused by pollution from cars, trains, and so on."}

If we, as friends, can make our own way by ourselves.\n\nSecondly, without a guide, you can travel at your own convenience.

Over there, we had hired a guide to take us to different places. That guide rounded all the places within one and a half hours. Many places were there that he showed us from a long distance. I and my friends requested him to spend a fraction of time at every place, but unfortunately, he did not allow us. Our bad luck.\n\nBut for another example, last year, I went on a tour with my relatives without a guide. The place was definitely unknown to us. But by our own efforts, we reached that place. So, I do not prefer to have a guide on a tour."}
{"file_id": "1028542.txt", "output_essay": "I completely disagree, mainly for three reasons.\n\nFirst, although youth typically implies health and a will to do things in life, the truth as I see it is that the act of enjoying life is something that is defined as well as happens in our minds within ourselves and is not something completely dependent on how many years one has. As an example of this, there are lots of young people who live in deep depression, sometimes clinical, sometimes not, that clearly do not enjoy life.\n\nIt is clear that the example given in the paragraph above can be reversed. But that brings me precisely to my second point. For me, it is not accurate nor completely correct to make generalizations about a so subjective thing as people enjoying life more than other people.\n\nHow do we compare the enjoying of one group versus the enjoying of another? And what is the meaning of enjoying life? All of this makes me more suspicious about the given statement.\n\nNow, my third objection is foreshadowed in the last paragraph. What do we mean by the phrase \"enjoying life\"? It is obvious that although there may be a certain consensus between some people about the meaning of that phrase, enjoying life does not mean the same for everyone. Less probable it is that it will mean the same thing for older and younger people. So it may be possible that older and younger people enjoy life the same, but within their own definitions of what is enjoying life."}

One of these is the technology facilities like cellular phones, TV, and internet access.\n\nI am not saying that they should keep away, but rather not spend a lot of time on unnecessary things. To start teaching people how to be effective members in their community, they are supposed to receive lectures or classes that shift them from personal interaction to community interaction, such as volunteering or participating in social activities without any refund.\n\nOnce nowadays' young people get the meaning of life, they will be beneficial in their community. Nowadays, young people sometimes have enough opportunity to help their community with good output. But they need help from the community just to guide such people to the safe coast.\n\nNowadays, people are more oriented than former people because of the technology facilities' availability."}
{"file_id": "1027505.txt", "output_essay": "When asked whether there would be fewer cars in use in twenty years than today, my answer would be a strong 'no'.\n\nFirstly, a rise in population and wealth can be seen all over the planet. More and more people from Asian countries are able to buy a car, and they do so. And this is just today. Probably, in twenty years, people from Africa will also be able to buy cars, so a greater need will be there on the market.\n\nSecondly, the automotive industry develops new cars each year. This tendency to create nicer and fancier models from year to year will probably continue. The public responds excitedly to it. Just have a look at the crowded exhibitions like IAA or Geneva Salon. People from all classes come there to watch the cars, and they are fascinated. So, in spite of not having enough money to buy a certain car, people tend to do so anyway. This is shown in statistics of car dealers, which show that more and more cars are not paid for when bought, but on a monthly basis afterwards.\n\nThere might be some critical voices stating that there will be laws in the future to cut the use of cars extremely in order to protect the environment. As an engineer in the automotive industry, I do not believe that might occur. Teams of experts spend hours day by day to improve the cars, to make them more effective, and to reduce the amount of pollution that comes out of the exhaust. For being prepared for the days when oil will become a rare good, the engineers already today think about methods of building new engines that work without oil.\n\nSo, to summarize my statements, it cannot be said that there will be fewer cars in twenty years than today. For reasons such as general wealth development, no political restrictions due to better technology, and mainly because people will be just as fascinated as today by the new cars developed by the automotive industry."}
{"file_id": "1025599.txt", "output_essay": "Have you ever tried to figure out those hard and complicated math questions? Some people suggest that it is important for students to learn the facts. On the other hand, I think that understanding the concepts is much more important than just learning the facts. I suggest my opinion with two reasons: people will remember longer when they understand the ideas, and they will also figure out all the questions, even though they are hard and complicated.\n\nFirst of all, people tend to remember longer when they understand the concepts or the ideas. However, when they just learn and memorize the facts, they will forget about it quickly. For instance, in biology, I learned about the 'Feedback system' in the human body, and I was able to understand how this system works because my mother knew about biology very well. However, my friend, who didn't get help from anyone, just memorized and learned the whole process of the 'Feedback system', and a week ago, we had a pop quiz in the biology class. I was able to figure out all the questions about the 'Feedback system', but my friend couldn't solve any of the questions. In this case, I was able to answer all these questions because I understood how the 'Feedback system' worked, then my friend couldn't answer them because he forgot what he memorized and learned before.\n\nSecondly, students can figure out any hard questions if they fully understand the facts or the ideas. This happens a lot in math classes. Math teachers don't just ask students easy and simple questions; they make the questions complicated and hard for students to solve. Students who understand the ideas would be able to solve these questions. However, students who just memorized or learned the facts will be confused or hesitant to figure out the questions because they have basic knowledge about the concepts and ideas.\n\nSince students don't forget or mis-use the knowledge when they understand the concepts, and students who understand the ideas and the concepts will manage to figure out all the hard and high-leveled questions. Above all, I state that understanding the facts and the ideas is much more important than just learning the facts."}
{"file_id": "1030588.txt", "output_essay": "If 'success' means economical or scientific success (big money or new development), I agree with the statement. Recently, people's lives have become more convenient because of the development of industry, and more homogeneous in terms of information because of the progress of communication technology, like the internet. So, a relatively comfortable life can be achieved by routine tasks or work. It means that new challenges are not necessary for common life, so many people seem not to like trying new matters. The challenges are more important now! In the field of science, new results only derive from new challenges or ideas. Already known works only make already known results. In the economic sense, also, new challenges sometimes make big successes. But economic challenges always bring some risks and easily become a gamble, so we should manage our total risk. \n\nBut I think it is also important to keep traditional matters, theories, and cultures. They can be the basis of new ones. And we can avoid some failures and accidents from previous ones. So, in terms of 'importance', or 'important people', I cannot choose one from these two."}
{"file_id": "1027891.txt", "output_essay": "The issue of whether people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities is a controversial one. On the one hand, there are some people who spend most of their time thinking about how they can help their community. On the other hand, there are some people who really do not care about helping their society. They just think about their own problems and do not have enough time for other people. However, in the final analysis, I agree with the statement that people do not give enough time to help their society.\n\nOne reason for my belief is that in the current business world, people do not have time to help their communities. The current business world demands a lot of time, and at the end of the day, people are very tired.\n\nFor example, five years ago, I worked for an advertising company. Advertising is very difficult work, and at that time in my life, I usually spent more than 12 hours in my office. When I returned home at 9 o'clock, I was really tired. It was impossible for me to help my community. The only thing I wanted to do was to go and rest. It was impossible for me to try to help society; I was always tired when I was not at work.\n\nAnother reason for my belief is that people have become more selfish. People just focus on what is important for them. They do not care about what happens to other people; they just think about their own problems. Recent research shows that less than 15% of the people from my hometown had helped the community in the last two years.\n\nFor the reasons stated above, I agree with the statement that nowadays people do not give enough time to helping their communities. I support my point of view by two main points: first, that the current business world demands a lot of people's time, and second, that people have become more selfish."}
{"file_id": "1028226.txt", "output_essay": "Yes, I do agree with the topic that young people enjoy life more than older people. This topic is a very interesting one because many people may not agree with my view. Life is not as it was some years ago; it has become very fast-paced. Due to this, even the stress levels have increased, so it is difficult for the older ones to survive. The older people are not able to compete with their younger rivals. This means they are not able to enjoy their work or the success it brings. So, it would be fair to say that the young are able to enjoy life more. Sometime back, I read in a novel that Alexander could pursue his plans vigorously only due to his youth. From history, we do know that the great emperor Trajan lamented that he could do no more conquests due to his old age. So, this shows that in order to do most of the things in life, we need youth. So, to even enjoy life and its pleasures, we need youth. We have read in numerous stories that men have been searching for the elixir of youth to stay young forever. Even many modern-day research projects are going on to slow the aging process and its effects; billions of dollars are being spent on it. To do many adventures in life, we also need youth. Youth is a divine gift that must not be wasted because you can't get it back. So, we must finish important things in life when we have youth; otherwise, we are too late. So, this is my personal opinion. I am not saying that old age is a curse or anything; rather, that youth is a blessing, so we have to use it to the maximum, i.e., enjoy life when we have youth, so we won't regret it in our old age."}
{"file_id": "1029138.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with the statement because, after all, the purpose of advertisements is to point out the advantages of a product, and this is usually achieved by exaggerating them.\n\nOne common scenario on TV advertisements is to show happy situations that are not necessarily related to the product being promoted. For example, you can see a sad person on a gray, rainy day whose mood changes to absolute happiness as the sun rises automatically when they drink a Coke. Even though the weather has nothing to do with people drinking Cokes, they try to sell the idea that a refreshing drink can make you happy no matter what.\n\nOn the other hand, magazine and photograph-based advertisements usually tend to use very simple tricks such as showing products bigger than they are, or accompanied by a lot of accessories which are not included, and sometimes not even sold at all, but make the real product look a lot more attractive.\n\nFurthermore, some advertisements show results that cannot be completely achieved by the product itself, to convince people to use them. This is very common in diet products, where a very thin model wakes up in the morning to do some exercise but she just goes to the refrigerator and drinks a diet yogurt. Despite the fact that the yogurt could only prevent you from gaining extra weight, the propaganda makes it look like it actually can make you lose weight.\n\nFinally, another issue is that the advertisements don't show the disadvantages of the products or, if they do, because of some regulation, they do it as fast and illegible as possible. This is the case of alcoholic beverages' advertisements, which show a very small and really fast-read phrase where they advertise that drinking in excess is not good for your health.\n\nAs a conclusion, it can be foreseen that advertisements don't usually say the whole truth about a product, and one has to be very careful in examining the real characteristics of it before buying or using it."}

As a specialized teacher, I managed to add new ideas for teaching, new methods, new tools, and very great things to my students.\n\nI believe that by learning a specific subject, we will be able to find creative doctors, like my brother, for example. He became one of the most famous doctors in my country, one of the most creative and successful doctors everywhere in my country, and I think this is because of his choice to study one specific subject, which is medicine.\n\nIn conclusion, I think everyone should choose one specific subject to learn and be good in it and creative in it, instead of learning too much stuff.

{"file_id": "1024659.txt", "output_essay": "I do not agree with the statement that advertisements make products seem much better than they are. I really feel it because a product owner knows how the product is made and how it works, so all the other matters he will be thinking about the quality of the product and how it will be reached to people in the correct way and thought. To make this possible, the only thing he has in his hand is how to advertise it. So, he feels a better way to advertise the product so that the product reaches the people and people come to know how worthy it is. Without advertising, nowadays it takes a long time for a product to get settled in the market and make its own stamp on that field to go into people. \n\nAdvertising may not be thought of as a thing that makes people totally believe it, but in the advertisement, and also on the product, the producer clearly says what it does and how it does, so based on requirements, only the consumer buys the product, but not the way it is advertised. Here, we have to be careful about how it is advertised, to make an advertisement, only the product must pass many tests that the product is introduced to the market, so by certifying, only the product is released to the market. So, based on the requirements fulfilled by the product, only the advertisements are done. Not all producers follow the same method, but based on how much the product costs, the advertisements are done. The advertisements are done according to the taste of the owner, that is, how it could be advertised. Some use media as the advertising agent, some use marketers, some use paper pamphlets - there are many ways to advertise. Based on their taste and their capacity, the producer advertises their product. \n\nThe ways that the advertisements are very interesting, in such a way that, by seeing them, people would get the thought of buying them. Some producers, to get hold of the market and sales, would use celebrities, well-known persons as their suit for advertisement by paying them a large amount of money. As advertisement is the only chance of making people know, it's a very important one. For example, now governments are also depending on advertisement to make people know about things, projects are done. Here, in my state, a celebrity is the one for advertising about the polio program done by the government. So that people will know about it very quickly and correctly. So, governments also rely on the advertising, which shows us how important the advertisements are. \n\nTo make the conclusion of the thing, that advertisement is the best instrument, and as fake advertisements are not done, they make the product seem to be as it is, but they do not make them feel better than they really are."}
{"file_id": "1027152.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with the following statement because, as the number of cars is too high nowadays, people are looking for new ways to decrease the negative consequences of the car industry and, as a result, reduce the number of cars.\n\nFirst, let's talk about the negative consequences of the car industry. As the number of cars increases day by day, this increase leads to traffic problems. One has to spend at least one hour to reach their destination. This creates stress in the person and eventually makes them more aggressive towards everything. As a result, the person becomes unhappy, and their efficiency for working decreases by half each day. Try to imagine this situation happening to most members of society! The second problem is car accidents; each day, we hear about car accidents just because people do not obey the traffic rules and kill each other. Imagine also the psychological effects of all these accidents on society. The third problem is air pollution. Because there are too many cars all around, this creates a pollution problem. Especially in big cities, it is a very usual thing to smell the gas coming out of cars, which is very unhealthy, of course.\n\nSo, as a result of all these problems mentioned in the previous paragraph, people are looking for new ways to increase the efficiency of transportation and reduce the negative effects of the car industry. In each country, people are trying to develop their railroads. With the help of this, traffic can be avoided, and people can reach the places they want to in a shorter time. This will avoid stress in people, and they can travel peacefully. Also, in some countries, people are encouraged to use bicycles, which, in my opinion, is a very efficient way. Because it helps relieve stress and is also healthier for one's body.\n\nAs a result, as the number of cars and their effects are becoming more and more disturbing for people, they are looking for new ways to solve this problem. With the help of railroads and bicycle roads, people will eventually stop using cars, and as a result, in twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today."}
{"file_id": "1030800.txt", "output_essay": "I believe that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. There are two reasons for this. First of all, most people would agree that the products in the advertisement are presented under the best circumstances, since the purpose of advertisement is to sell the products. For example, clothing manufacturers and designers put their clothes on good-looking models, which makes the clothes more attractive. Another example can be food advertisements. Food is presented in the best dishes with picture-perfect lighting and everything. I remember that I had to return some of the products I bought because they were different from what I had seen on the ads.\n\nSecondly, advertisement is one of the most powerful ways for producers to communicate and convince people that their products are beneficial to customers. Therefore, people tend to emphasize the strengths of the products rather than showing their shortcomings, unless they are legally asked to do so. For example, when we listen to TV or radio commercials, such as cosmetic items, we feel like the items can be a solution to all of our skin problems. The ad does not say how time- or money-consuming the products can be. That is, I think, one of the reasons that certain products, such as cigarettes or sleeping pills, are required to state the possible side effects. Unless the law requires it, companies would not want to show their shortcomings.\n\nAs I stated above, advertisements are used to promote sales and communicate with customers and viewers in favor of the products. Consequently, I am truly convinced that products are better projected in advertisements than they are in reality in most cases."}

However, it is also important to learn facts because with the knowledge of the process of the facts, people can do what was right in the past and avoid what was dangerous or wrong.\n\nFor example, I think that the concept of peace can be better understood if you know history. In fact, with that matter, you understand that war gives people only poverty, difficulties, and not good things. I think that it is easy to understand concepts if you have a real environment in some facts.\n\nThe ideas and concepts, with the study and learning of facts, give us a strong base for our education, and it is important for a good future improvement.Finally, I think that both of these aspects are important for a good development of young people, so students have to understand ideas and concepts."}

The teacher's job is to provide as much general information as possible. This information has to be general. A teacher is not an amateur (as they have already learned the subject before) and thus already has their own point of view. The teacher is just there to provide general information and, in any case, could influence the students' minds. So, learning facts is too focused on theory and not on practice.\n\nThen, once the student knows the basics, the general facts, they have to go further from the given information by themselves, in order to understand all the specifics of the subject. I think that understanding ideas and concepts is something personal. It is something made by oneself. Nobody would ever have the same interpretation of ideas. It depends on the experiences of the student and their possible story or link to a subject.\n\nFor example, in a theoretical course of law, the teacher can teach students the evolution of something in particular, like the stance of society with regard to homosexual marriages. But I think it is far more important for the students to understand how this stance has emerged and learn all the discourse of both people for and against it. Thus, the student can make their own opinion, even if it is not the same as the majority of the population."}

For some authors, it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. For others, learning facts is more important. Here, in my opinion, it is a question of showing that learning facts will be better. In other words, I will show why I disagree with the statement using two examples.\n\nFirst, this example is related to the field of Mathematics. It is obvious that students involved in memorizing theories, assumptions, propositions, and theorems related to Mathematics will have much difficulty remembering most of the theories. For that reason, software applications are, in some way, a means for students to remember easily what they have studied. This example can be applied to many other fields, such as economics, agriculture, etc. For students in agriculture to really have a deep understanding and clear knowledge of what they have learned, they need to be in the field or in a greenhouse in order to apply the basic theories on chemistry, agronomy, and so on.\n\nThe second example is related to the first steps of education. During my primary school, I visited some historical places in the framework of our History and Geography class. A historical place like Goree (with its Slavery House) is still etched in my memory, and the explanation of the guide also, as if I was in that place during the Slavery Trade.

To a large extent, our modern age is made by these people. I will classify these activities into mainly two ways.\n\nFirst, where people just change the way in which we do things. For example, take the music industry. A few years back, the music industry was dominated by the Walkman from Sony. If you wanted to hear music, then you needed to buy a Walkman and cassettes. Sony thought that this was the best way, but Steve Jobs from Apple had different ideas. He created the iPod, where you can download your music into flash memory. This was more efficient, and one could download a large amount of music that was not possible with Walkmans. This made Steve Jobs famous, but Sony lost a market because Sony executives were just making more efficient Walkmans. They never tried to try a new thing.\n\nSecond, where people leapfrog the current way of doing things and create a totally different solution to the problem. For example, take the postal services. Earlier, if you wanted to send a letter to your loved ones, then you had to write that on paper and send it by mail. It used to take time, and the process was inefficient. A few people thought about the electronic transmission of information, and the internet was born. Now, sending a letter to someone is just a click away by email. Email is much more efficient and much faster.\n\nSome people will not agree with the statement and they will say that trying new things is risky, so we should not try new things. I would like to tell them that if our ancestors would have thought in the same way, then we would have been living in a stone age world today. I agree that once you try new things, then you might fail, but learning lessons from failures and trying again makes someone successful."}

Some reasons why I don't like the usual work I already know is that it limits my thinking. Innovation is a very important skill in my career, and our company is spending around $10,000 a year as an award for the best innovations. Examples are many, which I will address some of them next.\n\nThe richest man in this world, Bill Gates. If this man had remained doing the same job his colleagues used to do every day, he would not have gained all this money over the last 20 years. Bill Gates was working in one of the software companies. He tried to develop a small program into a small operating system. He succeeded, and this was a big jump in the world of information technology. The operating system was developed into a further smarter one that could manage many tasks the computer operator used to do, consuming a lot of time. Recently, he has released all those versions of Windows and profited billions of dollars. I believe that he was a very successful man, and this was because he tried to invent.\n\nAnother example from my own life is when I stopped by my supervisor's door and said, 'Look, we have to discontinue doing the same paperwork every day and get ready for the new challenge!' I explained to him my idea, which implies automating the payment authorization form in our company. This form was processed manually and got around 10,000 forms every month from the same type. I supervised the project of automating the form to be an electronic one. I was able to complete it with all the appreciation and support from our higher management, and I have saved around $40,000 to my company.

Joining a group and being led by a tour guide makes it impossible to go to the place where I want to go. A tour is a thing that only goes to the places someone selected before starting.\n\nSecond, I think that a travel should be flexible. You may want to go to many places, like the place you see from a train window, or you find a place that isn't printed on your guidebook. To change the route from what you thought before your trip is one of the pleasures of travel.\n\nIn the end, I think a travel gives a chance to meet new friends.

{"file_id": "1029769.txt", "output_essay": "For many decades, professors, politicians, employers, intellectuals, and students in Germany have been discussing the question of what an academic education should be like: Is it better to educate students to be generalists or specialists?\n\nSome people say that it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects. Although this idea is supported by good arguments, I prefer to specialize in one specific subject.\n\nFirst, it is better to take a study course in which you are really interested instead of taking courses in many different academic subjects, because the student can focus on one single topic. If he concentrates on one specific subject, he will finish his study course right on time and will pass his exam with good marks. Taking too many subject courses is very confusing, and a student does not have the time to deal with each single subject in the way he is supposed to. For example, it is very complicated to combine a literary, cultural, or media study course with mathematics or engineering.\n\nSecond, companies nowadays are not interested in generalists, because they need specialists. There are only a few branches where generalists can get a job. Advertisements for jobs in newspapers always give a detailed description of the skills an employee should have. And mostly, only a specialist satisfies the companies' needs.\n\nTherefore, specializing in one subject is the best way to get a good job. Finally, being specialized in one specific subject does not prevent you from getting in touch with other academic topics and study courses. If you are good in one topic, you might also deal with other academic subjects that are interesting. But it is vital that you still focus on 'your' study course.\n\nTaking all this into consideration, I arrive at the conclusion that it is very important to specialize in one specific subject instead of having knowledge of many academic aspects. In some way, we are all generalists. But being a specialist is a unique characteristic that improves your chances of getting a good job."}

For example, when I was a student at Kyoto University, which is one of the most famous colleges in Japan, I took a brand strategy class, in which we thought about how to make the brand image of the company through case studies. When Professor Okada, who was my teacher at the class, discussed an advertisement of a car. In the class discussion, Okaie, who was the best student in my class, stated that in the TV commercial, such as Toyota and Nissan, the car runs along a very beautiful road that we had never seen. He mentioned that this situation was only a brand strategy, and everyone knew that there was not such a beautiful road in Japan. Every student agreed with his opinion. At that time, I understood that advertisements made products seem much better than they really were.\n\nTherefore, I definitely agree with the opinion that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are."}

The progress of medicine, which makes our lives longer, and the multiplication of the population lead me to think that there will be more humans in 2026 than in 2006. And due to this multiplication, the number of cars sold out each year makes me feel that cars will develop in the same way as the population. Moreover, no governments have, for the moment, taken a position in order to discover a new means of transport. They are elaborating composite fuel (with ethanol) or other kinds of fuel, in order to reduce gas emissions in the atmosphere, but not in a way to reduce the number of cars.\n\nBut on the other hand, many things make me think the contrary. Firstly, I have talked about the progress made by medicine, in the first section, but it's also all the progress made in science in general. Something lets me think that some utopists had the right key. I'm inclined to wait for a replacement of cars by planes. It's in my logic. And why can't teletransportation be created in the nearest future? Teletransportation can replace cars.\n\nSecondly, I'm sure that the lack of petroleum, which must happen in further years, will be the key to substitution. Even if we find solutions... but today, it is not going in that way. We can also try to limit the number of cars by instating mass means of transport, like buses or trains.\n\nFinally, the lack of petroleum is not the only reason for a whispered decline in the number of cars. Even if we are still to discover new materials, added to the number of cars made by year, we can suggest a lack in metals, plastic, as far as the consumption of all inhabitants of this Earth is so fast.\n\nTo me, it is difficult to forecast such a statement, even if I hope there will be fewer and fewer cars, and what I hope the most is that a genius must create teletransportation, it will be very efficient for all people in all the World.

{"file_id": "1029696.txt", "output_essay": "I believe that marketing and advertisement have started to play an interesting role in our lives. The number of products available in the market today is increasing very fast, and therefore, manufacturers are racing with each other to make their brand names and products known to people. The question is, why does a possible customer remember one product, on the other hand, forget the other? The answer to this question is trivial: somehow, the possible customer is convinced that (this can also be on a subconscious level) one of the products is better than the other, and therefore, remembered only the better one. This gives advertisers all around the world motivation to show the products better than they are, because they need to show that that particular product is the best.\n\nThe first proof of this can be found in advertisements that present a setting that is not or cannot be real. This could be a beach so amazing that it can only be a painting, or a photograph modified using software. I think that the setting is the key to making people believe that what you are offering is something better than they have, because it is being displayed in an environment that is better than yours. Another example of this might be the people in the advertisements; most of the women in them are very beautiful, and most of the men in them are very handsome. What an advertiser is trying to achieve by using nearly flawless characters is to convince us that we can be like them, all we need to do is to buy that new cellular phone.\n\nThe worst case is, of course, when an advertiser claims that a product can do something that it cannot in the average. Most of the advertisements only give information about the best cases; an extreme example could be how a toothpaste made someone's teeth as white as pearls from the ocean, in a clinical experiment. During the time interval, this information is being transmitted to our brains; a fast subtitle written in a tiny font size indicates that, in this experiment, some kind of chemical was also used to amplify the effects of the mentioned toothpaste.\n\nThis situation will continue to become a bigger problem as long as new products are introduced to the global and local markets every day, because this will increase the motivation for advertisers to do so."}
{"file_id": "1030265.txt", "output_essay": "The word \"fact\" literally means \"a true statement.\" Facts are indeed facts that cannot be challenged or changed. I believe that learning facts is important, but more importantly, it's the ideas and concepts generated in a student's mind that are helpful for successful learning. When a student grasps a concept clearly, he is able to apply his own brain and produce more important concepts, which are absolutely non-replaceable by anything else. I understand that knowing and learning facts is important, but without a good understanding, a student's knowledge is crippled, and he cannot shape his own opinion and originate ideas on his own. His knowledge will be fact-based rather than based on good reasoning.\n\nIt's important that a student should devote time alone for himself to build and construct his own ideas, as when he/she steps into the practical world, there one needs to face a lot of practical hurdles where facts might not be of any use. Take, for example, when a student grows to become a doctor and is challenged professionally to deal with some medical issues urgently. I don't think in that situation he can use his/her factual knowledge, because facts will only satisfy his query about the ailment, maybe, but the treatment would be according to the patient's behavior, which he has to judge and analyze on his own. Maybe the process is not the same as it was in the textbook.\n\nAlso, conceptual knowledge always helps a student to progress and build and provide this world with new ideas. It might be possible that the possible source of information has any kind of discrepancies, which can only be resolved when the concept is clear. Then only can a student question and probably will be able to look for an answer on his own rather than waiting for someone else to provide him/her with a new set of facts and figures."}
{"file_id": "1032028.txt", "output_essay": "Humanity has never found out the response to this question: 'Is it more important to see the ideas and concepts or to learn facts for new brains?' \n\nBoth of these two poles have their proper advantages, but is one of them more essential than the other? For students, which one is more efficient?\n\nIdeas are always needed and, as a result, they are important because they are the starting points of all developments, of all achievements. Students have to understand these ideas and concepts because they are in a great thirst for knowledge, which is led by these abstract forms. More precisely, a student must see the meaning of the ideas and concepts to go forward, to have new visions, and to develop their creativity. Thus, understanding ideas and concepts are really important for students who are this world's future.\n\nOn the other hand, students cannot do without facts because these show the results of ideas, and they clear the reality for us. Students cannot continue just by using ideas and concepts without knowing facts; they won't be able to corporatize their abstract views. Moreover, facts are the light of the past, of the present, and with them, of the future because, as in history, we cannot go on without knowledge of the realities in this world, and for students' education, reality passes by facts. Also, students will encounter facts to test their ideas and concepts; if not, they can't know if they are correct or not.\n\nIn conclusion, with these advantages shown, it's impossible to say that either learning facts or understanding ideas and concepts is more important for students. In my opinion, we don't have to compare these two sides because they are always going together by completing each other, and both of them are really essential for students."}

They look for something that makes them happy and try to find out what the enjoyable things in life are, and they will do it. For example, when they have a brand new car, you find them spending a long time driving it and going on trips with friends, and they will be satisfied with the compliments about having such a car.\n\nOn the other hand, when you look at older people, you will find them busy with life concerns and family issues if they have a family. Also, they do not have a lot of time to spend on fun, mainly you find them concerned about different issues like politics or building a good future for their kids. But some older people who think that vacation is important as much as work and money are important, so they always have the time to enjoy their lives and invest some time for entertainment and recreation.\n\nAs a conclusion, I think young people are more able to enjoy their lives because they are still young and they are looking forward to the coming days with a bright future. But as I said before, older people can enjoy life as much as the young do because they have experience and can organize their lives obviously better than young people."}

The rationale behind this is that they struggle to prove whether their theory is right. In this situation, exact knowledge is needed for them. It makes them study more hard about that.\n\nFor example, my brother's major is science, but he didn't interest in that. Last semester, his professor gave him homework to make a new product.

I think one can enjoy life at any age; it depends on the age and how one enjoys it.\n\nBeing young as well as being old have both negative and positive aspects. Of course, younger people have the great advantage of being physically more able than older people, which gives them more possibilities to enjoy life by playing sports. But usually, they do not have much time to realize that, since they are busy with school or a job.\n\nOlder people, when they are already retired, have a lot of time to do all those things they have not had time for yet, for example, reading literature or even beginning to study, as, for example, an old teacher of mine who started studying philosophy after he left school.\n\nBecause of their many experiences, it is also easier for old people to deal with problems, while young people are often discouraged and feel insecure about the future. Old people have already lived through many things and do not have to worry about finding a job or a partner anymore.\n\nWhile young people often have problems with their families, old people already have their own and can spend nice times with them. The greatest problem of being old is certainly the many illnesses. It is much more dangerous for old people to walk outside if it is cold, as they might get pneumonia, while young people remain healthy and could slip on the ice and break a leg, while their grandchildren are able to fall without hurting themselves.\n\nIn addition, it is very sad to be old when one's friends, or one's partner, become older too, and die one by one. My grandfather became 93 years old and had not had friends for the last ten years of his life, which seems incredible to me.\n\nFinally, a young person still has all his life before him; an old one expects death to come soon. Both can be positive or negative, it depends on the specific person's situation.\n\nOn the whole, I think it is possible to enjoy one's life at any age; it just matters what one makes out of it."}

I think that a person should travel in a group, by which a person can have more security. If a person is traveling in a group of his friends or family members and they are visiting some new place, they will need a guide. A guide can tell us the historical importance of the places we are visiting. As the guide knows all the areas and places of interest, so he can guide us well. Also, if we are visiting a place where there is a different type of language used, a guide can act as an interpreter. So, I am fully agree with the idea of traveling in a group led by a guide.\n\nThe first reason why I am in favor of a tour guide is that the guide can tell us the importance of that place in detail, which otherwise we can't get enough through other sources like books, etc. For instance, last year, my friends and I visited some historical places in India, like Agra, Delhi, and Jaipur, but we didn't think like hiring a guide, so we faced many problems over there.\n\nThe second reason in favor of hiring a tourist guide is that the guide is well-known to the area where we are visiting, and he knows very well about the other places which we had not heard earlier. So, he can make our travel experience more interesting by introducing us to new places.\n\nAnother important reason that I am in favor of a tour guide is that we can easily overcome the language problem if we are visiting a place with a different language. For example, if we are visiting European countries, then we might encounter a language problem over there. And we can come across the difficulty of interacting with people. A tour guide can act as an interpreter between us and the people of the other region we are visiting.\n\nTo summarize, the best way to travel is in a group led by a tourist guide, so that we can come to know in detail about the places we are visiting, we can enhance our experience by the introduction of new places, and we can handle the situation of language problem, and last but not least, by traveling in a group, we can have a sense of security."}

This essay will discuss the issue that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.\n\nFirstly, the product is always in perfect light when we see it in an advertisement. Obviously, the producing firm does not want to show the product under worse circumstances. They want to sell the product in order to gain some profits. Therefore, it seems reasonable to me to show it in a rather perfect light. For instance, if someone drives a car in an advertisement, he drives the car through a picturesque landscape. But we often face noisy traffic jams in dirty cities. Obviously, the actor in the ad seems to have more fun driving the car. Furthermore, the ads are often supported by music to stimulate the consumer's desire to obtain the product. The sound of beautiful music also supports the idea that the product looks better than it does in noisy real life.\n\nMoreover, the actors in the advertisements are always happy and they really know how to use the product. Sometimes we experience some difficulties by using a product simply because we do not know how to use it properly. Imagine a new cellphone. There are so many functions; we simply do not know how to handle it with all its possible features.\n\nTo conclude, I agree that the products seem better than they really are because in our daily life we are not using them under perfect circumstances. But as far as I am concerned, this is no problem as long as the basic statement of an advertisement is true and if we are aware of the fact that our daily life differs from the one we see on TV."}

And what will make people not agree with the statement is maybe because they think that taking risks is not what a successful person is based on. It's a matter of different opinion.\n\nThe causes why people believe in this statement is that, in business studies, they study about successful people and about how you can be a successful businessman when you grow up.

{"file_id": "1028744.txt", "output_essay": "Personally, I do not think that fewer cars will be used in twenty years than today.\n\nProbably, the author of the statement bases his view on the fact that the increase in the number of cars has been decreasing for the last 25 years. Furthermore, another thesis supporting his view might be that public transport will become not only more accessible but also less expensive. The invention of a new form of transportation might as well contribute to a reducing number of cars. Another very important point is that the streets are overwhelmed by the number of cars and simply cannot provide space for even more vehicles.\n\nThe last point seems to be pretty evident, especially in a country like Germany. However, in countries like China or in other third-world countries, space is not a restricting factor. On the contrary, the development of those countries will even increase the demand for high-priced technologies, such as the car. Development happens rapidly, and the chance that countries like India or South Africa join the club of the developed countries within the next twenty years is more than realistic.\n\nAlso, the invention of a new form of transportation might not be absolutely out of sight, but it is nowhere in sight, and it would take much longer to gain general acceptance than the given 20 years to have any impact on the number of cars in use.\n\nWhat I definitely hope and also believe is the fall of prices for public transport and its spread over the world - even in countries where it is not established yet. However, I am afraid that the car, as a much more comfortable choice, will always attract humans enough to convince people to take it. I myself used the car for my way to this TOEFL center instead of taking the bus or train. Germany again serves as a good example. While the public transport system is surely one of the best in the world, streets are filled with cars. This demonstrates that even the existence of a public transport system does not have great effects on the number of cars used. Furthermore, outside Europe, countries are much more rural than here. The establishment of a public transport system is by far more expensive than the building of roads.\n\nThe statement that the increase in the number of cars decreases is definitely true, but this does not necessarily mean that the end of an increasing number of cars is close. As stated before, though Europe reached a peak that can hardly be increased, in other countries the demand will rise during the following years and outnumber potential decreases in Europe.\n\nThis effect is even promoted by a rising population on the world. Though in Germany and in other highly developed countries, the number of inhabitants decreases slightly, the total number of people still increases fast. This will not change during the following 20 years.\n\nConclusively, I cannot see any convenient reason why the number of cars might decrease during the next two decades - maybe an atomic war or a meteor - but nothing realistic to happen. Though I do not appreciate the trend of more cars, I am absolutely sure that it will hold on."}

A lot of us misconstrue the real meaning of these words. True enjoyment means something done to bring joy and happiness to oneself or loved ones, not as a public demonstration effect. This is especially true for older people. After having experienced life and gone through different stages during their lifetime, older people are much more experienced and mature in their outlook. Therefore, they would seldom indulge in activities that are popularly seen as being part of enjoying life.\n\nYoung people, on the other hand, due to a variety of reasons, which can include peer pressure, the need to experiment, energy, enthusiasm, etc., are often seen indulging in the more demonstrable form of activities that can classify under the broad term 'enjoying life.' So while older people might not go out as often for traveling or adventure trips, movies, or partying, they have their own set of activities like book reading, gardening, religious activities, community events, etc. to complete a happy and enjoyable day.\n\nI also believe that while at a young age, people often enjoy themselves by indulging in self-driven activities, at an older age, human beings get more happiness, satisfaction, and enjoyment by doing things for their close and loved ones. For example, a father who invests days and nights to build a house so that he and his family can have a secure shelter for a lifetime gets an equal amount of satisfaction and happiness as does a young adventure trekker. This gesture should not be misconstrued as evidence of not enjoying life.\n\nTherefore, in conclusion, I would like to state that enjoyment is not dependent on one's age. It is a state of mind that all human beings strive to achieve through various methods and activities during the different stages in their life cycle."}

In my experience, the best time I had was with a group of teenagers my age in the USA, because we were all the same age and from different backgrounds. However, it wasn't entirely like a vacation where you had your peace of mind and complete freedom to enjoy your time as you wanted.\n\nRather than waking up at 6 in the morning and going according to set guidelines made by the tour guide, I would choose to roam the place alone, discovering numerous places on my own and taking the vacation as an adventure.\n\nAlthough moving in a group can be fun, I believe going with a small group of maybe two or three friends who think alike is a better option. Even though going with a huge group is amazing fun, the tour guide is what spoils all the fun. Tour guides usually have the whole vacation planned out with set timings, making the holiday seem like another school day where you have a worked-up schedule to follow.\n\nTherefore, in my opinion, the best way to travel would definitely be in a group, but without a tour guide, because then you get the freedom to do what you want and the liberty to make your own decisions rather than following a tour guide. But if the tour guide is another person similar to the group you're traveling with and knows the place well, the tour could definitely be one of the best ones.\n\nHowever, going to the Himalayas for adventure with a tour guide would definitely kill the adventurous feeling that could be achieved by going alone.\n\nTherefore, the statement has its pros and cons, depending on your tour guide, the group, and the situation.

But if there is no fuel left for the cars, there is either none for the bus, for a taxi, for the lawn mower, and for airplanes. Nobody will go anywhere. I personally could take my bike and go to the grocery store, but what for? There will be no possibility to do my groceries because the shelves will be empty. If there is no fuel for cars, then there is no fuel for trucks that take the groceries to the supermarket. And this is only the peak of the iceberg. There will be no production, no traffic, and even today's high-tech might break down.\n\nI do not want to paint this vision of the future too black. There is another possibility. Since we know that the whole traffic and one could even say the world is too dependent on fossil resources such as oil, we could change that. There are so many sophisticated scientists who work on solutions on how to gain energy. And they have results, like wind and sun as renewable energy resources. We could already reduce the need for oil if we, for example, buy our vegetables from a farmer in our town. Then fewer trucks would be needed. Whatever we do, we need to start changing our energy-wasting habits now. Then in twenty years, there might be as many cars as today, but they will run on non-fossil energy. But I do definitely think that there will be fewer cars that run on fuel in twenty years."}

Often, old people say that young people are changing and are very different from people of their time. These changes can be found in all aspects of our life.\n\nNowadays, young people always have a lot of things to do, so I agree with the statement. Nowadays, young people often have a very busy life. Almost all people between 19-25 years old go to university, and sometimes they work too. In fact, working during the week is often a possible solution to resolve economic problems, but at the same time, it allows them to attend school. Then, they play different kinds of sports, they want to go out with their friends, and they also want to have time to relax at home. So, they do not have any time to help their community or to do some social and useful activities. If I look among all my friends, I think that only a small part of them reserve part of their time to help communities. I do not think that it's a right behavior, but I think it depends on our society also. The most important values of our society seem to be our career, to enjoy, and to have a relaxed life. Most people do not consider the importance of helping people who live worse.\n\nEven if I recognize the importance of these aspects, I can also say that it is very difficult, also for me, to manage to concentrate on these kinds of people. I do not have enough free time: I have to study, I have to go to university, I have to go to work on the weekend, or I have to clean my house (I have been living alone for 3 years), and so if I have free time, I prefer going shopping or to the cinema.

{"file_id": "1034558.txt", "output_essay": "The statement that it is more important for students to understand the ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn the facts has to be viewed carefully and from both contrasting sides.\n\nOn the one hand, it is of course crucial for students to learn the facts of the class they are taking part in. This is especially important in classes that contain a lot of information and facts, like history or medicine. Most classes also end with a test or an exam, and in order to pass it successfully, you definitely need to learn the facts by heart.\n\nOn the other hand, it is so much easier to learn the facts if you really understand their ideas and concepts first. In this way, you are not simply learning the facts to reproduce them later in your exam, but you are able to explain their meaning and purpose. This makes it much easier to keep them in mind, especially if you really think about the concepts and discuss them with others.\n\nIn addition to that, you should be aware of the point that you are not only learning for school or university but also for your whole life. Especially at university, you are able to get to know a variety of things that won't only help you to achieve high grades in your exams but also prepare you for your later professional life and expand your general knowledge. You definitely won't learn that fast and easily anymore if you grow older, and you'll never get the possibility to get to know so many different facts for free and with so much pleasure than you can get during your studies.\n\nAs I already said, to my mind, it is not possible to simply decide for one of the opportunities. By expressing this, I mean that it is helpful to find a way in between them, a combination of both, which means to first understand the facts and concepts and then later on learn them as a preparation for your exam. That's the way I do it at my university studies, and until now, this has been a very successful concept!"}

Old people have no life quality, and numerous people are saying that old people are only waiting for death. The contrary shows young people who have a variety of possibilities to create their lives and what to do in their leisure time. This implication suggests that young people have a better life quality than older people. To prove this statement and conclude an opinion, existent facts have to be taken into consideration and evaluated.\n\nMany experts say that old people are not interested in taking part in society at a specific age. Furthermore, they enjoy living isolated and don't want to be members of big communities; they prefer their privacy. However, more and more possibilities for old people to create their lifetime are integrated into society. In addition, numerous old people over 60 are still sporty and modern, and not like many years ago, isolated and frustrated. The interest of old people and their activity in several communities underlines the fact that there is interest, but old people have to be supported and motivated to join different clubs or activities.\n\nSecondly, some people are convinced that mostly all old people are ill and have problems with habits they used to do when they were young. They believe that older persons live with pain and are unable to create their life without help. To a certain extent, there is some truth in it, but because of the constantly innovation and the development of researches concerning cancer and other illnesses old people had to deal with many years ago, specialists found many ways how to enhance the life quality of old people, which can be seen as a reason for the increased living expectations of humans.\n\nTo sum up, numerous ways are created to make life more enjoyable for old people, and the positive reaction of old people to different communities and sporty activities show that they are enjoying their lives, although they are not able to do whatever they want. It cannot be said that young people enjoy their lives more because it is always depending on your thinking."}
{"file_id": "1033252.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with the statement based on my experiences and observations of the past, present, and predicted future through my reasoning.\n\nThe fact that cars bring major pollution, are inefficient, and require oil to function are instrumental in my agreement with the proposed statement.\n\nMost importantly, cars have significant detrimental effects on the natural environment around us, which suggests that there will be a decrease in the number of cars in the future. First of all, the exhaust created by cars has polluted the air we breathe, sometimes stimulating diseases in infants, children, adults, and many other people. Given that the natural environment is a resource that people value and desire to protect, it is clear that cars will be used less when people see or will see the dramatic and harmful effects they have on the Earth's atmosphere and overall human health.\n\nOn the other hand, cars, in the first place, need oil to be accessed by consumers, making them inefficient in the future. Oil, currently a very delicate and priceless resource in the 21st millennium, is being depleted at an alarming rate. Since oil prices are increasing rapidly, people may not have access to oil or petroleum in the near future. Therefore, it is obvious that oil is not a natural resource that can be renewed fast enough to sustain its amount when humans are over-exploiting its resources. As a result, it can be confirmed that at this rate of natural gas or oil consumption, how can we be sure that there will be enough resources for cars to run in the next 20 years?\n\nLastly, from my experiences, I have seen that governments are truly trying to decrease the number of cars for critical reasons. Cars may be convenient to the individual who uses them, but they have numerous detrimental effects that governments and the public have to deal with and clean up. Therefore, every year, governments use a large percentage of their budget to pay for car-related expenses, such as pollution, car management, car accidents, and many more. Because of such expenses, governments are reinforcing public transportation, such as railways, buses, and subways, as substitutes for cars, which are more cost-efficient and convenient for users at the same time.\n\nFrom my beliefs and opinions, I agree with the specified statement, given that cars create major pollution, are inefficient, and costly."}
{"file_id": "1037397.txt", "output_essay": "I think it is very much essential for a student to understand the ideas and concepts rather than just learning facts. These days, technology has developed, and new things are being invented, which is only because of the main reason that is logical thinking about something. The invention of the telephone did not make Graham Bell, who invented the telephone, refer to facts. Instead, he thought it logically and implemented physical experiments by using concepts. As we look at many of the scientists of the early ages, they did not think much about the facts; rather, they understood the ideas about how to implement them.\n\nSo, it is better for a student to study different concepts and implement their ideas. Let us consider another example. If students only think about the facts, they only bother about a few things, like oil, petrol, kerosene, and white petrol being the combustion fuels, and automobiles cannot run without petrol or diesel. If that were the case, Sastry, who was a student, would not have discovered the fuel for automobiles. He extracted a solution by using a plant's leaf and mixed it with some chemicals and finally used it as a fuel for automobiles. This mainly depends on a lot of understanding about the concept and keeping a hard effort to implement their ideas. This idea would be greatly beneficial for society.\n\nAnd coming to the secondary aspect of the topic, which deals with the learning of facts, it is useful to some extent for students. This is because when we deal with the solar system, and a student is asked about what the shape of the earth is, or how many planets are there in the solar system, then the student may refer to facts rather than experimenting on that."}

It has something to do with life experience, money or income, and knowledge. That shouldn't mean that young people do not enjoy their life. But I think they enjoy it in a different way! And that's the fun part about being young. When you are young, you normally don't know that much about life, so you have to explore it. Normally with little or no money, as you will earn when you're getting older. And that means that you can concentrate more on the real things you are interested in in life. For example, when you are young and you want to go on vacation, you're looking for a cheap way of doing it. Maybe a very cheap flight to Mallorca, Spain, a youth hostel for $10 per day. No breakfast, because you still have enough alcohol in your stomach from the night before. I am 30 now, and this kind of vacation would be way too hard for me now. But when I think back, 5-10 years ago I would have loved it. Now I would rather fly somewhere very nice, with a nice hotel, maybe a rental car. Some sightseeing. And in the evening, I would go out for dinner. To a nice restaurant, with some delicious food and a nice wine! So for me, I enjoy my life more when I'm getting older!"}

Young people are in a process of growing old. We should save money for our old age. There are a lot of young people who study in college, university, or career institutes. They are trying to improve their abilities because they want to get higher careers and pay. Young people are healthier than old people and more flexible to get new information. So they can get more chances to get a job and earn money. Imagine if you had to work and earn money when you are old. It is very hard for old people. I know two people who would be good examples for this topic. One man worked very hard and saved money when he was young. So several years later, he got married and bought a beautiful house, and he could spend enough money to educate his children. However, another man did not save money and did not work hard. He enjoyed his youth. He drank beer with his friends, bought expensive clothes, and bought an expensive gift to give to his girlfriend. So several years later, although he got married, he still lived in a rented house. Of course, we can enjoy our life during our youth. I'm not talking about that enjoying life during youth is bad. A lot of new experiences and traveling are important to young people. However, we need to improve ourselves more during our youth. There are some cartoons about two kinds of insects. An ant worked very hard for summer, so he could enjoy his life and rest for the cold winter. In contrast, another insect just enjoyed and sang a song in the tree for summer. Consequently, he could not eat anything during the cold winter. Think about it. Isn't it easier that young people try to study and earn money? Young people are healthier and more enthusiastic than old people. \n\nWhen we get old, we should take a rest and enjoy our remaining life. To enjoy our old life, we should save money."}

There are two important points to learn something and keep it in our cultural baggage: to understand the concept of the main idea and to practice the concept in some situations of real life.\n\nMost of the time, when a student has an exam, the student wants to memorize all the dates, places, names, and rules that could help to answer correctly. But frequently, we forget that this is not the most important part of the learning process.\n\nThe first thing a teacher has to do is to make the student understand the concept, because when the concept is understood, it is easy to apply it to problems and, most importantly, in real life.\n\nWhen an elementary school student understands why the citizens of some country had to make a civil war against their government, the student has understood the importance of a government that takes care of its people and does not take advantage of them.\n\nWhen a student understands the main idea of some problem, they will never forget it and will be able to apply it in real life. Then, after understanding, it is very important to reinforce the idea by practicing with examples and possible situations where the student can apply their judgment and make a personal opinion about it.\n\nTo practice is to face the problem in many other situations, each one with different characteristics, and that will form the student, making them think of some solution or creating a personal opinion.\n\nThat is why I said that if you make a student learn the date when human rights were signed, they will learn just a date, but if you make them understand the importance of human rights, you will form an excellent human being."}

{"file_id": "1036331.txt", "output_essay": "I strongly agree with this statement. Let me explain why. We live in the era of information and technology. Our everyday life is surrounded by this fact: computers and the Internet, television, cinema... Enterprises take benefit from this new way of obtaining information and settle their advertisements everywhere. We can see publicity on the streets (for example, bus stops), on the Internet (while we surf the net, many different advertisements will show up), in the cinema (films usually contain hidden references to products)... But the main way enterprises expose their products is television. Most of the population has a TV at home, or at least has access to it in the neighborhood or at school. Who doesn't watch television? A person who might admit not watching it would be treated as an alien or something similar. Publicity in television is the main support of a TV channel: enterprises pay large amounts of money to have a space after a program, so they can show their products. And what about the products shown on television? Well, as we can daily see, all types of items are announced: cars, perfumes, films, drinks, food... But are these products exposed from an objective point of view? No, I don't think so. Publicity experts design the advertisements in a way that will call the spectator's attention, but not because of the product's nature, instead of that, they will talk about its effects, about the feelings or impressions you will experience if you buy it or use it. Have you ever seen a 'high-quality' perfume advertisement? This publicity will not refer to the way the essence is made, no, this advertisement will talk about the effect it might have on the person and all the people that surround that person. For instance: the perfume will make you feel fresh; or make all the men fall in love with you; or make you the sexiest girl in the city; or even compare the perfume's effect with the great pleasures in life! The thing is that we don't realize this isn't true until we buy the product, and then it's already too late. So finally, we conclude, as the statement says, that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are."}

I think they should make a special place to check if the advertising is exactly like what it is shown in the bottle or whatever it is.\n\nIf I were in charge of this country, I would create a special place to gather all the statements of all the companies that our country buys from, so I could know what's right and what's wrong.

This leads to an increase in the entertainment sector, hotel sector, employment sector, the foreign currency they receive, and the infrastructure of that country gradually improves.\n\nYes, I do agree with the following statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide. First of all, the tour guide would probably know about the place where the group is traveling. He would have taken the essential measures that are required to be taken for that particular place. Such as, if a group is traveling to a hostile area where the roads are not properly constructed, the climate is too cold, and there are possible chances to be injured. Hence, the tour guide would have taken the medical aid equipment, he would have taken care of where to sleep, and he would have made a list of places that are worth visiting.\n\nPeople who travel in a group led by a tour guide are relaxed as the guide would have given the list of the equipment that is required, the places to see would already be known, and the number of days they are going to visit would be known. Whereas, if an individual travels, they would take precautions, but they would carry extra things that they would not require. They would have no idea what places are to be seen, or what time they are open. They would be worried about various things, unlike people who travel in a group. Also, people who travel in a group are not tensed about the initial problems that a traveler faces, such as food, where to stay, and how much the trip would cost them in the end, as all group members would have to pay a fixed price.

I think that understanding concepts, as well as learning facts, are equally important.\n\nOn the one hand, it is very important to understand an underlying idea. It is the base to apply it to new contexts and to connect it with other concepts. It is an essential ability to succeed in exams, and it even enables the further development of new hypotheses or even whole theories. In my opinion, real understanding proves if someone is an intelligent, independent-thinking person. And these are necessary attributes for a successful researcher and a satisfying academic career.\n\nFor example, the principles of many basic learning theories, investigated by Skinner, were cited by numerous other researchers. The researchers conducted many interesting experiments, resulting in highly useful applications.\n\nOn the other hand, you cannot deny the importance of knowledge of facts. Surely, the sole learning of facts was exaggerated for a long time. Whole generations of students only had to repeat information without having to prove their understanding. I totally agree that this does not make any sense. I also permit that it is hard work to learn them, and it seems senseless from time to time.\n\nNevertheless, facts are important. It is not sufficient if researchers have understood a main principle. They have to know all the included variables of a theory, how the experiment was conducted, why, and in which context. They should be aware of the time period in which a theory was invented and a fact was discovered, and by whom. This is all fruitful background information.\n\nThe first things to learn are facts. Then, understanding of the underlying idea is the next important step. And finally, the further connection and application follow. The last step could not be achieved if one of the earlier steps were missing.\n\nTherefore, I draw the conclusion that you cannot say which of the two learning strategies is more important for a student."}

Every economist today knows that it is more important to sell the product than its quality.\n\nIt is well known that many enterprises invest huge amounts of money in advertisements. There are many statistical studies about publicity and its effects. For example, they discovered that the effect of advertisements takes some months to produce an effect. That is the reason why we can see advertisements about a film that won't be in cinemas until three months after.\n\nOne important thing to consider is that we don't buy the product, we buy the concept of the product. Sometimes we have tried many products, and we know the quality of each one, therefore we can choose the better one. But many times we have a lot of products to choose from, and we don't know which is better. Then, if we remember the advertisement of that product, which explains its advantages, we probably will choose it, although it really is worse than others.\n\nSome years ago, a child asked for a pirate ship toy for Christmas. When he opened the box and found his present, he started to cry under the surprised look of his parents. Then the child asked his father where the sea was on which the ship sailed in the advertisement. The child had never seen the sea and really wanted it from the toy. This is only an example of the effect of advertisements.\n\nIn fact, many times we are not buying the product only. We can be buying the image of the product. For example, several brands of clothes are a social distinction.\n\nIn conclusion, advertisements are a key factor for selling products, not related to their quality."}

In the first part, we will examine arguments in favour of this statement. Then, we will interest ourselves in older people in order to conclude on that statement.\n\nWhy is it thought that young people enjoy life more than older people do? The first reason is that young people are more active. They are more dynamic. They have no fear because they are young. They feel invincible. They are in a period of their life where they have dreams and are ready to do anything to realise those dreams. It can be travelling around the world or doing a special career. Another characteristic of young people is that they have more free time, which they can spend with their friends or doing their hobbies. Because they are young, they have fewer restrictions. It is the reason why they can do what they like. They always find time to do it because they are dynamic. Another reason why they enjoy life is that they discover life since they are young. A lot of things are totally new for them. Finally, people meet their best friends when they are young.\n\nNow, why is it thought that older people enjoy life less than younger people? The first reason is that older people have a lot of obligations, such as a job, a family, children...

So we can think that traveling in a group with no guide and getting lost is an entertaining part of the trip.\n\nAnother reason why people don't need a guide anymore is because of the internet and the easy way to know the places where we want to go. When my family organizes a trip to a country or anywhere, they take and do everything on the internet, including the addresses.

This question will give you an idea of which one is better.\n\nNightlife, responsibilities, and money are the differences between them.\n\nWe have to begin with nightlife. Some young people between 15 and 20 do not even know what nightlife is, so if you are an adult, you can enjoy a night club without any restrictions. Another important point is that you do not have to tell anyone where you are or what you are doing because you are old and you do not depend on your parents.\n\nAlso, another important point in the life of a young or old person is responsibility. If you are young, you will always have school, and that is a big responsibility, but if you are old, you can just do whatever you want and you only have to worry about yourself.\n\nThe last and most important point is money. When you are young, you have your parents, and they are the only ones who worry about the economy. However, you will not have everything you want only because it is not your money; it is their money, so if you want to buy something they do not want, you just cannot buy it.\n\nIn conclusion, the life for old people was, is, and will always be better, and if you are young, you can enjoy, but not as much as you want. But you can also wait until you grow up and become an old man."}
{"file_id": "1035814.txt", "output_essay": "Last year, my girlfriend and I went to the Disneyland of Hong Kong led by a group. After the whole trip, we found that we did not have many memories about the Disneyland because the group gave us such a hurried travel that we even did not have enough time to take a few more pictures. As a result, I decided to have my tourism with my tour guide forever.\n\nThere are several reasons that helped me make the decision. Firstly, some people stand on the ground that group travel is much more economical than being led by a tour guide. As far as I am concerned, it is questionable. The tour guide you employ is not very expensive, and the guy will give you much more than your imagination. It is a dream place that does not appear on your tourism book. At the same time, you will have enough time to take photos and breathe the air of freedom from your city. We spend our money to enjoy our life, but in the tour group, we just keep moving to another place when we do not recognize what we have seen here. It is a real waste of our money and our life in my eyes.\n\nSecondly, we can find ourselves by the tour guide. In the group, we are the workers; we must listen to this, listen to that. We spend our money to enjoy our life; we do not need a leader to have a tourism. It is no longer our office. There is no boss! The nature and we are here! That is the true life; we are the leaders of our life, we are the leaders of the tourism. Where I want to go, I make the decision.\n\nThirdly, perhaps traveling in a group is more safe; we can face the problem together, which happens in our tourism. But we should know that everyone of us should be brave to face any challenge in our life. To solve the problem is one part of the tourism that we really appreciate. And you have a tour guide who will help anytime, because we are the boss. We spend our money and time to enjoy our life, to enjoy the problems.\n\nFrom what we discussed above, we can safely draw the conclusion that although the advantages of traveling in a group will bring safety and relatively economical benefits, they cannot compete with the true life of tourism led by a tour guide when its responsibility is taken into deliberation. So pack yourself up. Now, enjoy our life!"}
{"file_id": "1036284.txt", "output_essay": "The success of people is strictly related to the level of risk taken. The real success is the materialization of people's ability to differentiate themselves from others. A good example of a success story could be Steve Jobs' adventure in the technological world. Steve Jobs, the father and creator of Apple company, knew very well that to be a successful man, you must take some risks and try to do things differently from your competitors.\n\nAs Professor Porter says, the real and most valuable competitive advantage for a company, but at the same time for a person, is the ability to be different. Being different does not mean only doing new things; being different could be doing old things but in a different way.\n\nEvery time we try to do new things, we take more risks at the same time, but to be successful, we must be able to evaluate the different risks and figure out what could be our return, and what or to what measure the failure could affect our life.\n\nThen, from my point of view, success is related to a multiple series of different factors: the ability to create, to imagine, or to perform something differently from other people; a predisposition to risk, in other words, it could be very difficult to reach success if the subject is risk-averse; but at the same time, it is very important to have the ability to measure this risk and create different scenarios to be able to predict what could happen if everything takes the wrong path.\n\nReturning to the Steve Jobs example, what signed the success of Apple company was the visionary ability of Jobs in figuring out what would distinguish a product like the iPod from a different MP3 device. He chose an innovative path, calculated and evaluated the risks correlated with his ideas, and, reaching some failures, taking some losses, he finally succeeded with his device.\n\nThen, when someone has success, it is at last because they were able to understand and learn from their failures and errors, which could derive from trying to be different and taking some risks.\n\nSuccess, in my opinion, is the prize reserved for those who have the courage to be like no others."}

They both became well-known people, however, they are known for different reasons and talents. This shows that people are good at different things, and focusing on their best talent is the key to success. I disagree with the statement that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject. Specializing in one specific subject is a more definite way to succeed, it lets you focus better, and it is less stressful.\n\nOne reason to support my opinion is that specializing in one specific subject is a more definite way to succeed in the future. I feel that having a more broad knowledge of many academic subjects only helps you in your childhood. Trying to earn good grades in all of the classes you are taking may be the pressure for thinking that it is better to have a broad knowledge. Having a broad knowledge may also set you off to find what you are good at. However, I believe that what is most important is what you become as, and working hard on what you are good at would actually get you somewhere in life.\n\nAnother reason why I feel that specializing in one subject is better than to have a broad knowledge of various subjects is so you could focus better. Trying hard on one subject when you know you have to focus on another one could be distracting. I feel that working hard for one subject would let you concentrate better.\n\nFinally, I feel that it is less stressful to specialize in one subject. For example, I believe that it is difficult for someone to be good in both writing and mathematics. I believe that people usually do not like what they are not good at. If there are subjects that you would prefer not to take, because you know that you are not good at, you should rather work hard in a subject you know you like to do. My friend who is very talented in arts is unfortunately not very talented in mathematics. So, what she does is that she does not take any mathematics classes. In conclusion, I feel that specializing in one specific subject rather than having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects would lead you to a happier life."}
{"file_id": "1038976.txt", "output_essay": "I do agree with the statement that 'successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.' Successful people usually come from many failures and risks, and after overcoming all these situations, they gain success. So, those people have a clear idea about how to tackle or overcome risks and problems. The person who is usually successful prefers gaining more success from more new things or the things with which they are unfamiliar.\n\nAnd in order to try new things, they never hesitate, whereas the person who is usually at a non-success stage fears trying new things. There are many examples that support this answer. For instance, in the construction field, people usually succeed in the field of constructing huge buildings, dams, towers, and flyovers, which is usually a risky factor at those times. Because they have succeeded in their field, they are trying for more new things, like going for more huge or enormous works, which is also a bit kind of risky. Because the construction field people know a lot about their work and the failures they will meet in achieving things, they try to solve them in a more logical manner or, say, in a planned order.\n\nNot only in the construction field, but we can also look at other fields, like the most happening scientists' field, where they try only for new things rather than going for the known ones. Scientists always think of inventing new things. If they had thought that they can't take risks in inventing anything, which we have now, then we couldn't get many luxuries and also disease-preventing medicines for many hazardous diseases, which are usually harmful to humans.\n\nWhen we go for new things, then only we get new things in our day-to-day life, which are becoming part of our daily life now-a-days and also daily routines. Hence, in this fast-moving world, successful people should try for new things and should take the risks to become more successful, rather than sticking to only doing what they already know how to do well."}

But I don't agree that ideas and concepts are more important than learning facts. The following reasons support my idea: first of all, it is useless if we understand a lot of concepts and ideas and we don't use them to learn facts. I want to say that learning concepts is a very important thing if we are able to use those concepts to do useful things. Therefore, learning new concepts is very important, but also we must learn from facts to see how those concepts are used.\n\nFor example, I am a university student, and every day, during the lessons, I learn a lot of concepts. But I study in a technical university, therefore, for me, it is very important to gain a lot of experience to improve my preparation in a particular subject. Furthermore, it's very important to learn facts, because they can always come in useful in the future. The second reason that pushes me to think in this way is that if we only understand ideas and concepts, we will not understand completely how those concepts work. I want to say that there are a lot of things that we can learn only from facts and experience. I think that a student has a good preparation about a particular subject if he learns both concepts and experience. In fact, in a lot of companies, if a person wants to gain an advancement, he must have a lot of experience and a lot of knowledge."}

One reason is that young people are more active than older people. Also, the other one is that young people have new ideas for life.\n\nFirst of all, young people are more active than older people. It's because young people can engage in more activities than older people. However, older people can't engage in as many activities as young people. It's because older people don't have enough energy to sustain activities for a long time.\n\nSecondly, young people have new ideas for enjoying life. For example, there are festivals in life. Young people can open up their ideas for festivals. It's because young people can think of interesting ideas.\n\nIn conclusion, young people can enjoy life."}
{"file_id": "1041085.txt", "output_essay": "Many people have the problem of not knowing what to do regarding the subjects they can choose from in a university. Should they take their time to study many academic subjects or should they specialize in one specific subject?\n\nThe first positive point of choosing many academic subjects is that you have a broad knowledge of many different things. That makes you more flexible when you look for a new job and also gives you more flexibility in many other situations. The second positive fact is that you are able to talk about many different topics, which can help you to increase your relationships with others. If a person talks about various topics, you are able to enter the conversation because of the fact that you have more knowledge about different things. You are able to talk about many different things than a person who just studies one specific subject.\n\nTo specialize in one specific subject has many positive benefits. First of all, people who take many courses do not have specific knowledge about a certain subject. People who specialize in one subject are more professional and therefore able to answer more specific questions because they have more knowledge. They are also able to use their knowledge to solve higher-level problems. Another positive fact is that companies always need professional people who have a lot of knowledge in a specific area. Therefore, people are better paid than people who are not so professional.\n\nI strongly believe that it is better to have more knowledge about a specific subject. You are more able to solve complex problems and you are also able to answer more specific questions. In addition, people with more knowledge about a topic are more likely to get more money from companies because they need professional people."}

For example, learning to drive can make you focus more and see more. \n\nIn addition, you can be more experienced when you take the risk and try new things. The more you try, the more you get the feeling that you have no limitations in what you can do, and the more experienced you get. \n\nLet's take the CEOs of big companies, for example. If they did not try new things and did not take risks, they definitely would not be where they are now. \n\nThird, trying new things and taking risks makes you more ready to solve problems. \n\nOn the other hand, not having the guts to try new things and take risks could result in being in the same position for a long time, if not forever. You will do your thing right, but you will do it forever. \n\nIn conclusion, don't limit yourself, don't underestimate yourself, go out there and try new things and take the risk."}
{"file_id": "1039861.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. There are two reasons to support my opinion. The first reason why most advertisements make products seem better is that the most important thing is to sell more products in terms of the producers. In selling products, advertisements are very important because there are many products of the same kind in the world today. In this situation, attractive advertisements are indispensable to compete with products from other companies. Let's take cell phones, for example. There are many companies producing cell phones all over the world, and each company also provides many different types. Last year, I lost a cell phone and decided to buy a new one. I was at a loss as to what to buy, and I finally bought one with the most attractive advertisements in a store. After I used it for a while, I easily found that it was difficult for me to use it because of many unnecessary accessory functions. I usually use cell phones only as a mobile telephone, and so I do not need a function of taking a picture. Therefore, I really found that it is important to discern the advertisements more carefully. The second reason is that the producers partly believe that the real quality of the products is first known after many people use them. In this regard, producers are eager to sell the products in the first place. They consider the problems of the products after the consumers claim to them. It is not really a good attitude, but this idea is also rampant and is derived from the idea that selling products is the most important thing for producers, as I mentioned in the first reason. However, society has changed its regard of a recall movement, so this attitude becomes riskier and riskier in the developed countries. In summary, I agree with the opinion that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are."}

I agree with this statement because by trying new things, we can learn a lot and become famous in what we are doing.\n\nBy trying new things, we can know something new and discover new things. For some people, after taking a lot of risks, they may not get success and so they go on with their same work. I don't agree with this statement because without trying new things, we cannot move forward.\n\nFor example, if a country is a developing country, it will remain a developing country forever if they don't try new things and make their country a developed country.\n\nAnother example, if a person wants to become a top ranker or become an engineer, he needs to take a lot of risks to reach his destiny by trying different things, thinking differently, and working on it. I think it will definitely give success to the person.\n\nAn example for which I disagree with the statement is if a person is not working hard or not trying anything different, then definitely he will not reach his goal and he cannot be a successful person.\n\nSimilarly, take Sachin Tendulkar, he was very poor in studies and was very much interested in cricket. His father took a lot of risks and started practicing cricket with him rather than giving coaching in regular studies. So, because of taking a lot of risks and trying new things, now we have a world-class cricketer, and India is very proud to have such a player.\n\nSo, all this happened just because of taking risks and trying new things rather than continuing with the known work.\n\nSo, finally, I say, ``The people who try different and like to take risks rather than doing the same work will definitely get success and stand on top of all.''"}
{"file_id": "1041462.txt", "output_essay": "Advertisements, many factories and companies make advertisements to let people know about their new products. Sometimes they say true things about their products, and sometimes they say wrong things, so how can we know the truth?\n\nFirst of all, we can know if a product is good or not by asking people who have tried it. For example, if your cousin sees on TV an advertisement about a machine that is useful, let's say it's a sports machine. As we know, on TV, they will say a lot of things about it that will make people like it and buy it without wondering how much it costs. So, your cousin buys it. Then, you hear about this machine and you are wondering if it's good, because if it's good, you will buy it. So, you make up your mind to ask your cousin about it. Unfortunately, he/she tells you that it's not good and it broke on the first day.\n\nSo, when you hear this, surely you will decide not to buy it. So, it's a way to know if the product you hear about in an advertisement is worth buying or not.\n\nSecond, if you really like a product that you saw in an advertisement, why don't you buy it? You won't lose anything; try it. Perhaps it will be better than you thought. Everything is possible, but be sure of what you are doing, and try not to lose so much money on things you don't need. Just buy the things you really need.\n\nTo sum up, advertisements will be useful in many times because they will let you know about new products that you have been searching for a long time, and then you will find them in an easy way.

{"file_id": "1039141.txt", "output_essay": "The issue that will be discussed here is whether young people nowadays give enough time to helping their communities or not. Some might say that young people are more educated today to be ever aware of the problems in their community and more enthusiastic to help. While, on the other hand, some might say that young people today are too busy in their own life setup to look beyond it and help their communities. Well, I would agree with the first set of people who think that young people nowadays take out enough time to help their communities.\n\nFirstly, the reason I think that the young crowd nowadays gives enough time to help their communities is that they are more educated and are aware of the problems that lie in their community, in which they have grown, more than the young people of the generation before this. Let's take an example of a young man who has faced difficulties in his childhood because of a lack of good schools in his village. Now that he has somehow managed to get an education and get a good job in a multinational company, he knows the benefits of good educational facilities. He knows, with his experience and exposure to the world, that his village can grow and develop if the children can get good education. So, he would take out time to put conscious efforts into the development of his village.\n\nSecondly, taking the same example of this young man who is employed in a good company, he also earns well compared to the young people before. He has enough money to help the people in his community and the will to change the infrastructure to facilitate the younger generation in their development.\n\nFinally, I believe that the younger generation today is more enthusiastic and filled with more zest to take out extra time to change the conditions existing in their community and help the people who need it. The education system today has changed, teaching more moral values and inculcating a sense of responsibility in the younger generation to help their community and their country. The young people today have learned to prioritize their work and have become more effective in managing their time.\n\nSo, I think that today's generation is more effective in helping their community."}

I agree with the opinion that advertisements make products look much better than what they actually are.\n\nThe widespread growth of communication media, such as television, newspapers, the internet, and various other choices, has led to an outright growth in the propaganda of any item. People come to know about any new product in the market through any of these media.\n\nThe mindset of people has changed variably in the sense that they have shifted their focus from buying required products to those advertised by celebrities. Gone are the days when people used to go outdoor shopping to get the required products. The new era has just begun through internet shopping, which reduces the burden of going out and shopping. People can sit in their homes, and if they find something interesting in the advertisements, they opt to buy it through the internet.\n\nThe previous notion of buying a product based on its requirement and merit has totally changed. People have changed their mindset to buy products that seem appealing and interesting in the advertisements.\n\nAs an example, consider the good old days when there were not many advertisements for a product. People used to get a clear understanding of the product they were buying and then opt for it. Nowadays, the scenario has changed, where people buy a product only because their favorite celebrity has advertised that product.\n\nFurthermore, people are more interested in buying an item their neighbor has just bought. They consider themselves one step higher than them and buy that product, even if it is irrelevant to them. In this way, mouth-to-mouth media creates problems.\n\nThese advertisements nowadays make products look much more valuable than what they really are. Going through various advertisements provided through the communication media and opting to buy a product is not a wise decision. These advertisements generally hype the product. One comes to know the seriousness of the mistake they have committed in opting for the product with the only impression of the advertisements when they receive the original product. Next time, they might be careful enough in selecting the products to buy.\n\nSo, in my opinion, it is always better to select a product based on its merit rather than following the advertisements and selecting the product."}

I will explain why around three main points.\n\nFirst of all, in my opinion, I truly think that trip preparation is a complete part of the travel experience. If you follow a group led by a tour guide, you will not be able to discover the country or city you will visit in advance. Reading the Lonely Planet, spending hours on Google, watching for some advice on the best places to go is a great time.\n\nSecondly, in a group led by a tour guide, you have to follow. For me, it means that you are not free to do what you want, when you want. The worst thing is that they tell you when you have free time! In a trip, I go through a lot of different moods. Sometimes I like moving quickly from one place to another, but sometimes, and it happens quite often, it is real pleasure to relax, take time, and enjoy the moment. From my point of view, it's essential to follow our rhythm.\n\nLast but not least, the departure and return flights are most of the time scheduled in the middle of the night and in unknown airports. We all know that tour guides want to reduce costs and get better rentability. That is the reason why they prefer to choose big airplane charters with small seats to put more people in them. In addition, they use small airports, which are clearly cheaper. The travel becomes painful, and it affects your trip appreciation.\n\nThat is why I disagree with the idea that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.

As I am a listener, I would have a very boring time.\n\nOn the other hand, if you have broad knowledge of many academic subjects, people who talk with you think that you are very smart. You don't have to talk that much, but a little bit of information about many things is all you need. Usually, listeners don't try to argue with you, unless they are professionals in what you are talking about.\n\nOf course, it is also good to specialize in one specific subject, especially if you are a teacher or doctor, anyone who teaches or gives advice. Then, the one specific subject would be very valuable.\n\nActually, both personalities are valuable and better than knowing nothing, because you know something at least. I had one friend who was usually quiet. But when I let him talk about cars, he didn't stop talking until I changed the topic. He was so interested in cars and he liked to spend his time on cars."}

If you want to make it possible, I think you'd better try new things than old things that are too common and outdated.

There are two reasons to express my opinion.\n\nFirstly, it is true that normal people do normal things, live normal lives, and love normal things. According to what successful people say, however, they were willing to take risks to succeed. People should not copy and repeat something because sometimes that something needs to be changed. We should create new things that will make us live new lives and better lives.Secondly, maybe all of us know the sentence 'life is a venture.' It is so famous a sentence that we could have heard before. But the case that it comes true is very rare because people are afraid that they could make a mistake in trying new ventures. But I think avoiding ventures to keep them from failing is the worst thing in your whole life. You don't have to be frustrated even though you fail to try something new. It will give you an experience. This invaluable experience will help you to succeed in other things. It is so invaluable that you may not want to change to other things.\n\nIn conclusion, there are a number of opportunities in the world.

On one hand, some people think that in twenty years, they will use fewer cars than there are today. Indeed, having a car is becoming more and more expensive. On earth, there is less and less oil, so the price increases a lot, and not all people can afford it. Moreover, in the biggest cities, common transportation will be very developed, like in Paris, where the government is creating new bus routes. They want Paris to become a city with no cars. Indeed, some people think we need to stop using cars because of the increase in pollution.\n\nOn the other hand, cars are the best way to move. Indeed, with cars, you can go everywhere and whenever you want. You do not have to wait like with buses and subways. Maybe the price of oil will increase, however, all governments are trying to find a solution. For example, in France, the government wants to introduce a new oil product made from cereals. This oil is already used in some countries like Brazil, where many cars use this oil, and where the oil is less expensive than in France. Moreover, this vegetable oil can stop pollution in the biggest cities. And finally, with a car, people can do what they want, just like at home. They can choose the radio station they want to listen to, they can smoke, they can make phone calls.\n\nAccording to me, common transportation can develop a lot again.

{"file_id": "1045034.txt", "output_essay": "Yes, I agree with this statement: 'In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.' At present, technology has improved. At the same time, car models have increased. In the past, there were only two or three models of cars available. But currently, there are numerous models of cars, and with technology, cars are being manufactured with safety features. These features will keep people safe even if an accident occurs.\n\nFor example, in olden days, there was no facility to watch television or listen to music in a car; it was used only for traveling purposes. But currently, by reading a newspaper, we can drive a car; that's how much technology has improved. If a car has an accident, there is no harm to human beings because all safety features have been arranged in the car. The old cars polluted the climate significantly by emitting smoke. However, present cars use gas instead of petrol or diesel, which will reduce climate pollution. In the past, this facility was not available. Different cars have different technologies. At present, the population has also increased, and at the same time, the usage of cars has also increased.\n\nFinally, I conclude that in twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.

However, we should not ignore the benefits of advertisements for this reason.\n\nTo begin with, I admit that most advertisements do some exaggerations on the products. It is also the reason why manufacturers are so fascinated in making advertisements. The ads arouse our interests by demonstrating how excellent the products are. For example, we can always see the ads for hair cleaning products on TV. Some models or famous stars come out to show their extremely shiny and smooth hair, and they tell us that the special product is the reason for their beautiful hair. It is really attractive. But when we buy the product from the market and use it, we will find that the result is not as good as they claim in the ad. From this aspect, we are cheated by the ads.\n\nHowever, various advertisements play significant roles in our life. On the one hand, we can receive some introductions and suggestions from them. Imagine when we are shopping in the supermarket, we must face thousands of brands. There would even be hundreds of kinds of soft drinks. If we know nothing about the products, we must spend a lot of time on selection. With different ads, the situation changes. We must be aware of several brands of the soft drinks, then we can choose from this small range. On the other hand, advertisement has become a big industry. Both customers and manufacturers need the ads firms. And these firms supply a large number of job opportunities for our society every year. Therefore, the advertisements are necessary for us.\n\nLast but not least, the qualities and services determine the products' fates ultimately, not the ads. We customers may be cheated once, but not always. Besides, not every product is bad. The famous and lasting brands in most fields are good enough for the customers, in fact. As this reason, I think it is acceptable when some advertisements exaggerate the benefits of the products.\n\nBased on the above reasons, I believe that advertisements would serve good functions to our society, although they sometimes make the products seem better than they really are."}

On the other hand, in the past, they had a lot of time to help their communities.\n\nFinally, year after year, the young people will be more busy than now because of the technology, which develops year after year, and life will be more difficult.

Firstly, young people get the energy and spirit of taking risks to have fun or any kind of adventure, but they do not have enough time to do that because they have to work to earn money to survive and to achieve their goals.\n\nBut young people are very lucky because they have a lot of means to enjoy their life, for example, the computer, clubs, sports, and so on.\n\nOn the other hand, old people do not have enough power to practice any activity that needs effort or energy. Also, they have a numerous kind of diseases. One of the most serious problems they have is that they cannot deal with the new and modern equipment of entertainment. Secondly, money is the most great factor to enjoy your life as a tool to use to fulfill your satisfaction.\n\nIn spite of the fact that old people had enough money from their previous working life, young people can be more happy and enjoy their life with a very little amount of money.\n\nYoung people mean energy, hope, happiness, success, and life without deformation. To put it in a nutshell, I agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do. Young people are very lucky and get a very good chance to do everything they like to feel happy. The young people get everything in the new civilization to serve them and offer different ways to enjoy their life."}
{"file_id": "1046927.txt", "output_essay": "I totally agree with the statement that most advertisements make products more attractive to consumers than they actually are. Nowadays, it is very difficult to get a product that works exactly as it is promised to.\n\nIn a globalized, market-oriented world, it is difficult for manufacturers, companies, or retailers to launch a new product and compete successfully against other products. Therefore, marketers have to think of decent market strategies to get customers' awareness and interest. To be able to achieve this, promotion is needed, including advertisement.\n\nAdvertising enables the company to present its product and put an emphasis on its advantages. I certainly have the impression that it is almost presented in a propagandistic way. The most effective channels used for advertising are, on the one hand, wallpapers in the streets, which make use of visual effects, whereas TV advertisements are even more convincing as they additionally make use of sound effects.\n\nSo, if you are the target person and watch the advertising on TV, you go into the shop and buy the product. So, the marketer has partly achieved his aim by then. It is probably not his goal to see you unsatisfied, but most of the time, the consumer is. I often think about such a fake when I see an advertisement for McDonald's. Does the food not look so fresh and tasty? But what you eventually get looks and tastes different."}

It seems like young people may enjoy their lives more than the older generation. Every one has his own value about life, and different values lead to a completely different way of life, so we cannot say who enjoys himself better.\n\nBeing full of experience, old people have a different thinking about life from the young people. Some old people who survived the Second World War can understand how important food or money is, so instead of wasting wealth on enjoying life, they choose to lead a quite simple life. But they never feel their lives are boring.\n\nSecond, young people have a strong willingness to show themselves to attract a boyfriend or a girlfriend. In order to be popular, young people may like to stay in pubs and bars, they drink, dance, and joke with each other. However, almost all older people have already found a companion, and fashion, cars are less important for them, even they do not want to live as the younger people. If it is not necessary, it doesn't make sense to the judgment that young people enjoy life better.\n\nIn addition, age may be very important in some cultures. For example, older people can control the younger one in China or Korea. In these countries, age can influence many things, especially when people are having fun. In these cultures, the society will provide more benefits to the old people. If Chinese people have a lot of food, the old one can obtain more. So it is not true that young people can enjoy their life better within a less supply.\n\nIn conclusion, old people are equal with the young people, that is why nobody argues about that at all."}

Broad knowledge affects our analysis of events and determines how we think in certain situations. It is difficult to think about topics you have not heard before. You cannot even express your feelings without having knowledge about that topic. It is better to have broader knowledge of many academic subjects rather than to specialize in one subject. Specialization would restrict your worldview and also make it difficult to decide which subject to specialize in, thereby losing other opportunities.\n\nSpecialization should occur after acquiring broad knowledge of many academic subjects. For instance, I am studying International Relations, and my department underlines the importance of having broader knowledge. I could not just focus on the Cold War without having knowledge of the results of the First World War. Also, broad knowledge of many academic subjects will help you analyze events in different dimensions. With the broad knowledge I have, I can analyze the actions of states in different aspects.\n\nIn addition, if you specialize in one specific subject, you would not even know many things about other subjects. It seems dangerous. It is difficult to face a subject you do not have an opinion about. Also, examples can be given from daily life. For instance, you can be an excellent cook, but it would have no worth if you did not know how to wash the dishes. They complement each other. This is a simple example, but it reflects the importance of having broad knowledge.\n\nFinally, with broad knowledge of many academic subjects, people will have the chance to see events in different perspectives, even when reading the newspaper; they can create strong relations with other events. Also, it is difficult to choose one important subject for specialization. Specialization can only be achieved after acquiring broad knowledge of many academic subjects, but broad knowledge cannot be achieved after specializing in one subject."}

So, it is very important to have a broad knowledge.\n\nFor example, if you are only able to write with your hands and are not used to writing on a PC, you will get into trouble in many situations in daily business life.\n\nAnother problem can be that if you are specialized and somebody wants to discuss a problem with you, which is also important for you to get aware of, but you cannot say anything because you do not understand what the problem means to others.\n\nThat is a big problem in our society, because everyone is kind of specialized in one's own life, and you often see only your problems, whether others have much more problems.\n\nThe next problem for specialized people is that they normally can only do one job in their whole life. I think that if you get rid of the job you do, it is much better to have the ability to change it, and that will be much easier with a broad knowledge.\n\nBut if you are specialized in one specific subject, it will be very hard to get another job without losing time by taking courses to improve one's knowledge. Not to forget the money you cannot earn in this period of time.\n\nAs a result, I would say that a broad knowledge gives you much more quality of life and a higher variety of jobs."}

It is better to have broad knowledge to get a good job, a big salary, and a high position in any company. \n\nIf you have different majors in your education or several areas of knowledge, you'll have a big chance to get a good job. For example, if you have an engineering major with some courses in computer science, you'll get a job faster than if you have just an engineering degree. Also, you'll work in a different department, and that will make your job more exciting. \n\nIt's not hard to get a job, but to have a good salary is the hard thing. To improve your skills and to get a nice salary, you should be different from the other employees. A lot of people try to get one major in their education and then want to work; if you want to be different from the others, you have to get a broad range of knowledge. \n\nNot everyone can be a manager or an important one in his company. The manager has special properties than the others, more education, and strong behavior. We can get different education by having a broad range of knowledge.

The statement, 'young people enjoy life more than older people,' is not always true; it depends on the style of life and personal habits.\n\nFor example, young people could be always enthusiastic, happy, friendly, and also serious and quiet. By the way, some young people cannot enjoy their lives, maybe because their lives could not be the best experience. In other words, maybe they do not have the opportunity to enjoy their parents, school, or wherever. In contrast, many old people enjoy their lives; most of them thought that their old age is the most beautiful form to accumulate experience. In this way, they have a lot of memories and experience.\n\nIn my opinion, my grandfather is an example that old people can enjoy life, same or more than young people.My grandfather is 86 years old and he decided to start living again when he was 75 years old, after my grandmother's death. Some people thought that he got sad, but in contrast, he has decided to write a book, and all weekend he has been dancing in a club. He already opened his own cantina, and recently he has a girlfriend, and maybe he will get married again in a few months.However, he has diabetes and systemic hypertension; he decided to enjoy his life and start again like a second chance.I think that he is a great example for young people who sometimes decide to quit their dreams, hopes, and sometimes their own lives.He is also a good example and a model for me, and I hope to enjoy my life same or more than him.\n\nFor this reason, I disagree with the statement 'young people enjoy life more than older people do.'"}
{"file_id": "1040073.txt", "output_essay": "Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. Yes, of course, I agree with this.\n\nThe way advertisements are used nowadays has lost the meaning of their purpose. In the early days, their purpose was to bring products to the people, making them aware that a certain product was available in the market, which benefited customers in different ways. In those advertisements, they clearly gave the description of the product and the way it could be used in real life.\n\nThe very purpose of those advertisements is lost nowadays. They are just showcasing the product, then originally exhibiting its characteristics, comparing it with other products, and fooling the public about the worthiness of the product, which it really does not have.\n\nThey use some girls for advertising face creams. Before they use this product, they look not beautiful, but using the product for a few times brings a change in them; it seems they will be looking charming. How does this happen? It's just the camera trick and the makeup they are given. If we use it originally, will we get that change? No, definitely not. For example, take a product, namely toothpaste. The companies related to it, such as Pepsodent, Colgate, and Closeup, all have the same ingredients and mixtures of the same level. However, while advertising, each company showcases its own product differently, comparing it with others, not mentioning the name of the different company, that their company's product has better features than others. You just tell me how the product is designed with the same formula but with companies having different features.\n\nSo, the way advertisements are used nowadays is just showcasing the product more than it originally is, making the product seem much better than it really is.\n\nAnother example is soap. The company JOCIL designs soaps and sells them to bonded companies. They just label the paper on it and advertise about the product, simply expressing the features of it without knowing it.\n\nFor advertising nowadays, famous bodies are used, such as actors, sportsmen, singers, and so on. So, the people who like the famous body will automatically buy the product, and others who don't like it won't go near the product. This is one of the ways that the product is being showcased more than it is worthy of, as people like the words of famous bodies, they feel that the product is really worthy of being purchased, and they simply buy it because their famous body advertised the product.\n\nThus, I feel that advertisements are just showcasing the product more than its worthiness, making the product seem much better than it really is. There is no doubt that certain qualities are there in the product, but all the qualities mentioned in the advertisement are not necessarily in it; it's just added qualities to attract the public to the product."}

In fact, I have to admit that, based on my personal experience, this has been the trend over the last ten years, even if it is not a good result.\n\nI think that in twenty years, there will be fewer cars because of several reasons. First of all, cities are getting bigger. I read last week that most people now live in cities. That means they will have to move inside the city, and as the city becomes bigger, more people will need to have a car (unless the state offers the possibility to move with alternative transport).\n\nSecondly, cities are often overcrowded, and people who do not have much money are obliged to find another place to live outside the city. This means, once again, that they will need a car to get to the city for work, for example. Also, there are people who dislike the style of life that a city often offers. They would probably try to find a place to live that is outside the city but from where they are able to get to the city by car.\n\nMoreover, I think it also depends on how the state or local community would act. There are several examples that demonstrate that when a local community does not want to have too many cars in the city, some solutions can be found to resolve this problem.\n\nThe first thing is to make a good city plan, which can really help. If a city is planned in a smart way that considers different things, such as where to put major roads or how to plan alternative transports, then moving in the city is definitely easier.\n\nSecondly, the state should try to sensitize more and more people who live in the city, who often do not care about this topic because they are more comfortable moving with their own car or because they think this problem does not affect them. Which is not true, because they do not feel comfortable at all while trying not to get stuck in traffic or when air pollution reaches really dangerous limits!\n\nFinally, I agree with the statement, even if I think that it will be a huge problem if this actually comes true."}

Because I feel that many things might puzzle a student who doesn't have complete knowledge of any subject, but if a student is a master in a subject, they can definitely make a successful life. They will have all the detailed information of the subject, and no one will challenge them at any point in their subject, and they can make much progress in their career.\n\nNot only in knowledge but also economically, that student becomes more confident, independent, and able to carry their life with all leisure, and they will grow up in their life. Many other professionals will promote them, and as their experience grows, they will keep them on the highest peak of success and satisfaction. Their income, respect, and the position where they are working will definitely keep increasing.\n\nAnd all these things will finally relax them at the end of their life; they will have the satisfaction about the professional victory they have gained in their life.

Because they will have experiences in planning and arranging tours. By this way, we don't need to scratch our head to plan the tour. For example, one time our family planned to visit Singapore.

This is the reason why I think that the number of cars will not diminish in the next 20 years.\n\nThere are a myriad of arguments for and against the use of cars: The major argument against cars is certainly the pollution of our environment. And it is true - cars, as we know them today, need certain natural resources and do pollute our environment to a certain degree. If this is always true, there will probably be fewer cars in use in 20 years than there are today. At some point in time, people would recognize the harm of cars and would definitely try to reduce the number of cars to protect the environment.\n\nBut this may not be a realistic case: I am of the opinion that our scientists get smarter and smarter. Until today, they have already invented hybrid engines and engines that are only run by solar energy or plant oils. Today, those inventions cannot replace cars that need gas to produce power, because scientists are still trying to get more out of the new findings. But consider the time the gas engine needed to be as perfect as we know today: It took long years for the car industry to be able to produce those engines.\n\nGiven this evolution, it is possible and very realistic that our scientists will make a huge contribution to the improvement of the 'new' engines in the next 20 years. Even if 20 years might be too short to develop a car that does not pollute the environment at all, I think that the scientists are on a good way to find an engine that drastically reduces the pollution. And after another 20 years, we might already use cars that do not need any natural resources like gas. If this is the case, everyone will recognize the outstanding advantages of cars, so that the number of cars will rather increase."}

Then, some people get poisoned by that product because they use cheap materials.\n\nAlso, in the US, some companies give advertisements to television channels, airing them 10 times a day.

Because they just print 'Made in [country]' on the label.\n\nHowever, people know that advertisement is a way to introduce and sell. So, people can decide whether to buy it or not.

People should get the idea of the advertisement; if they don't, they can feel like 'What was that advertisement all about?'

Therefore, it is essential that tourists have their vacations organized so that they can have the largest amount of fun possible. To have a perfectly organized vacation, people should travel in a group led by a tour guide.\n\nThere are many benefits to travelling with a tour guide. Firstly, the tour guide is a trained professional in tourism. He would know which are the best attractions to visit and what would be an appropriate length of time to spend at each one. He would be able to plan how to spend the whole day efficiently, unlike if a person was alone and had to spend hours deciding where to go next.\n\nSecondly, the tour guide would have tickets ready prior to the visit, and this would enable the group to go straight to the attraction without wasting time. For example, to go up the Eiffel Tower in Paris, France, it would, on average, take a person two hours to get a ticket in the high season. However, a tour guide would get you the ticket well before you arrive there, and then you wouldn't have to waste a lot of time waiting in line.\n\nThirdly, the tour guide would arrange all the transport in advance, and for example, would make arrangements with bus companies to have buses present at the correct times and tell them exactly where to go. If, on the other hand, a person is travelling alone, he would waste a lot of time trying to get from place to place.\n\nThere is also a social benefit to traveling with a group, as it would be likely that your group consists of people mainly from your home country, and therefore you would be able to socialize with them and discuss the attractions you visit, along with the fact that you make new friends.\n\nHowever, some people may argue that having a tour guide deprives them of making their own decisions and their personal choices. Also, it would not allow them to do things that they have always wanted to do if they visited a certain country, but this can always be easily solved by extending the vacation a day or two, or if that is not possible, missing the certain guided tours they are not particularly interested in.\n\nAll in all, I strongly agree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide. Its advantages significantly outweigh its disadvantages, and I believe that most people would have more fun if they travelled in a group led by a guide."}

Education should give students the main ideas and concepts, things that students can absorb, make their own, and use as a basis for further education or even for their choices in life.\n\nFacts are like evidence in a trial, things that support the main ideas and concepts. The students have to read the facts, understand them, and, even more importantly, understand how the facts give an example or an explanation of the main idea. They are very important for the understanding process, but at the end, they are notions, something specific that we learn and eventually forget. On the contrary, what really lasts in our memory is the main idea, the concept, and this is the very important thing.\n\nThe first example that I can cite is history. When we study history, we study a large number of facts, dates, events, meaning that we learn a large amount of notions that we are most likely going to forget in the future. But all these facts are necessary to understand what happened in a specific period and to analyze the causes and effects that took place in those years. The facts are the instruments at our disposal to build a broader vision of the period at hand and to have a general idea of the economic, sociological, or religious forces that interacted in that historical moment. Even if we eventually forget the specific dates or facts, we still keep a concept, an idea of what was happening in the past.\n\nMoreover, I think that it is sometimes even impossible for our mind to store and remember all the notions and information we read. Computer databases are, in fact, very good instruments to store and retain information. Our mind, on the contrary, has the wonderful ability of elaborating information, putting it together, and drawing conclusions in the form of main ideas and concepts. Again, we see what is really important: ideas and concepts.\n\nIn conclusion, I definitely agree with the statement at hand, as I demonstrated with the examples I gave."}

Some people have already visited outer space, and many satellites are orbiting the earth. Instead of using cars, they will move around using their personal flying devices, like planes or themselves. From past times, many people wanted to fly in the sky, and they finally made an airplane. The more wishes make more developments. An airplane was not our destination; therefore, many scientists and dreamers are making new technologies and fantastic realities.\n\nSecondly, the future will be a robot world. We always aspire to more comfortable things and have already made some features to work instead of us. There are many kinds of robots, like those working in kitchens or playing with children, and even dancing robots. Therefore, most of the lighter productive works, such as household chores or delivery, will be done by robots. Cars will not be needed anymore, and we will just call our personal robots when we need some help with moving or delivery.\n\nSurely, the most useful thing, a car is the most successful asset to human beings for a long time. We also utilize cars nowadays almost every day; however, the changing of periods and techniques is more important and influences our life. We cannot deter the change."}

However, I firmly believe that people will still want the convenience of cars, and eco-friendly cars are being developed now.\n\nAt first, the amount of car manufacturing is increasing continuously. That is because people would like to have their own car for the convenience of movement. A study by the Korean Public Transportation Institute showed that the main reason Seoul citizens favor their own cars is the convenience. They can enjoy driving, except for during traffic jams, and do their favorite activities freely, such as listening to music. Even though the government makes public transportation better, people will not be satisfied with their efforts.\n\nAs far as the environmental issue is concerned, it is not a big problem since many countries are trying to develop eco-friendly cars. This investment also means that people still acknowledge the cars' practicality and convenience more than other ways to move. Several months ago, in Japan, some researchers innovated an electronic vehicle that can be used by normal people. So, in the future, more people will use nature-friendly cars.\n\nIn these respects, I disagree with the statement that the number of cars will decrease."}

Knowledge can be broad, as well as narrow. But which one is better to have?\n\nTo be able to answer this question properly, this topic will be divided into two parts: the undergraduate and the graduate students.\n\nThe undergraduate students will take a diversity of courses. This will provide them with a large opportunity that allows them to choose in which field to go later on.\n\nFor example, in the first two years of the pre-pharmacy degree, we used to take, for instance, cultural study courses, arts courses, which are not related to pharmacy. And many students shifted their major after taking these courses. They found themselves brilliant in other fields. This diversity in courses gave them the chance to choose the major that suits them the best. Imagine that the students take only major pharmacy courses from the first year. This could lead to the failure of many students, because they were not given the chance to study other courses. It's a serious situation, especially in the academic majors that are related to public health and safety, such as medicine, pharmacy, engineering, etc.\n\nHowever, the graduate students don't have this problem. They decided to go through a specific field, after taking this diversity of courses, when they used to be undergraduate students.\n\nSo, having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects will not last forever.

They do not know what is really important in their whole life and just spend their time on TV or PC games. All they do is spend their valuable time on something unvaluable, and it is a pity for them.\n\nActually, we can find that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. Due to modernization, parents bring their children with them to cities to find jobs. When they go to work, their children are just left at home or sent to a nursery. Those children can't find a model who gives enough time to helping their communities, and all they know is to enjoy their life and have fun. There is no doubt that parents are always the models for their children. That is the reason why young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. Besides, the public media always deliver error messages to young people. All the media talk about having fun. It is also another reason for this problem.\n\nIn conclusion, young people will need more education and training to teach them to give enough time to helping their communities, and parents also should be trained to be a model.

{"file_id": "1044456.txt", "output_essay": "There are two types of advertisements according to chronological order. One is post-modern advertisement, and the other is modern advertisement. The start of advertisement was with modern advertisement, which concentrated on the utility of the product. Later on, after the Cold War period, post-modern advertisement, concentrating on the image or impression of advertisement, began flourishing and has been the mainstream of advertising technology until the present. Now, here comes the problem. Post-modern advertisement ties mainly with the appealing method of impression, and to appeal to others, it needs such accentuation of positive portions and slipping out negative aspects or to cover the weakness of product competitiveness in utility; they will have to concentrate on overwhelming a person with the other good aspects of products, such as design. This can be said that advertisements nowadays make their products seem better.\n\nIt might be a limited example for my country, but as it is a fair example, I'll discuss it. In my country, insurance companies put tremendous assets into visual advertisements. They put some words like 'No additional money to pay for 2 months' in big letters, while they put some negative but crucial information in letters that can't even be seen without glasses. People see the conditions only written in the big letters, which seem pretty charming to us, people. However, they realize that they were faked when they actually borrowed a loan from that company.\n\nThere is another method in making a product seem better than it is. It is not telling about utility or any other practical values but depicting beauty merely. This is especially severe in visual advertisements. An impressive image overwhelms a person, so that the person forgets the real use of the product is actually limited, and sometimes, advertisements use a person's mind tending to follow celebrities and hire celebrities in making advertisements. A person just mimics celebrities then.\n\nSurprisingly, psychological methods inherent in post-modern advertisements tempt a person to purchase a product. By minimizing shortcomings and accentuating merits, or by visually overwhelming a person without any utilitarian usefulness, advertisements show a product better than it is actually, and people often, dull, get faked by advertisements. Definitely, we'll have to be aware of this, so we don't get faked. Due to the reasons above, I think that most advertisements make products seem much better than their reality, successfully."}
{"file_id": "1047838.txt", "output_essay": "It is important to know both the ideas and concepts as well as the facts. Of course, the ideas of a topic or a problem make it easier to understand and to remember, but it takes much longer to be taught these concepts. So sometimes it is easier to learn only facts, even if they are dry and boring. It depends on what you have to do with the information, whether you have to write an essay about that or if it is just for your own general knowledge. To know facts is sometimes important when you are talking to or discussing with other people. To show them in a short time that you have a big knowledge about different subjects, you will need facts.\n\nTo come back to the ideas and concepts, I can say that if you have a big interest in something, it is not enough just to know about the facts. Also, for yourself, you want to know more and understand the whole thing. If you have exams in this topic, it is much easier to answer the asked questions because you have the background.\n\nFor myself, I prefer to learn ideas and concepts. I am studying at the university, and it is very important to understand the problem. The exams are very difficult and hard. So if you are not prepared and only know the facts, you are lost. But sometimes, if I read the newspaper or watch TV, I try to remember short facts. Usually, I do not have the time to read about every topic too long, so I just remember the most important things. After that, I know what other people are talking about, not at all, but I can understand the problem or topic because of the learned facts.\n\nTo summarize, I would say that ideas and concepts are important to know when it is your course or work.

It is very common to listen on the media or simply when old people are chatting that youngsters do not participate or that they are not interested in community problems. However, I disagree completely with this opinion, not only because I think that it is only a prejudice, but also because from my own experience I can state the opposite.\n\nOn one hand, the basis of the opinion that youngsters do not give enough time to helping their communities lies in the comparison with the behaviors of older people nowadays and in the past, when they were young. In the first case, it seems to me that there is no data to support any different behavior between the different generations. In my opinion, what creates this perception is the recall of past days, which is never accurate. In the second case, I think that the great demonstrations that happened during the 60s and 70s, related to the wars that took place and the stress between the Eastern and Western blocks, helps to a large extent to magnify the false impression that youngsters used to be more committed.\n\nOn the other hand, I can say from my own experience that young people dedicate time to helping their communities. I collaborate as a volunteer in a local NGO, and there, the great majority of the volunteers are as young as me or even younger. But young people are also committed to their communities in many other ways that perhaps are not so visible as struggles in demonstrations. I have friends who form part of political parties and who are very active in any action that is carried out in the community.\n\nIn conclusion, young people are as committed to their communities as they used to be. The reason why it is believed that their commitment has changed is that the ways of participating in helping the community are less visible, such as an NGO."}
{"file_id": "1048903.txt", "output_essay": "It is undoubtedly true that in twenty years, the number of circulating cars will be strongly reduced. Although many people may believe that this statement is simply ludicrous, it is possible to provide some good reasons to support it. Two main aspects of this explanation are the consequences of the environmental problems caused by cars and the problems caused by the constantly rising oil price.\n\nAs everybody knows, cars produce toxic smoke that pollutes the air in big cities. For this reason, many governments and city administrations are restricting the number of cars that are allowed to circulate in city centers. In the long term, this will lead to a change in citizens' preferences, i.e., they will prefer using public transportation to using their cars because it will become simply too difficult to drive a car in a big city. To support this opinion, I could quote a research study on this topic carried out at my university that shows that people are becoming more and more unwilling to drive their cars in big cities.\n\nAnother point that could be made is that having a car is becoming more and more expensive. The first reason for this phenomenon is that oil prices have become very prone to rise consistently at any threatened decrease in production. Grassroots people already have many economic problems, and this one will become too awkward for them. Another thing that influences the cost of having a car is the fact that governments are discouraging car buying by imposing taxes on some ecologically dangerous cars. For example, the Italian government is willing to pass a law that imposes a tax on big cars.\n\nThese two reasons given, it is not difficult to understand why I think that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years than."}

Look, if you were an advertisement creator and knew the innovations for this product, which should be emphasized, the things that improve the usage of it, you would have to focus on them. Let the commercial look like it's an incredible invention made by the company, and this is only for the viewer of the ad. It has to be attractive for the consumer, so that they think about buying the product.\n\nIf there is an advertisement telling me, as a consumer, about the advantages and a lot of other things, I wouldn't think much about it, because it's only one in a million new things. But by telling me the outstanding advantages, the product could attract me and lead me to a shop to buy it. To reach this point in the mind of people who see this commercial, you have to emphasize the improvements and even let them appear much better than they are in reality. You can also use a comparison between the product you are advertising for and another one. By doing this, the other product has to perform very badly, while 'your' one acts normally or even unbelievably well. Now, letting the bad performance seem as the standard before the new advertised product was invented creates also an overrated image of the new one.\n\nDoing advertisements in this way is the only opportunity to lead people to buy this and not another product. It is even the only way for a commercial to get recognized by the audience.

According to the New York Times, everything is changing quickly. For example, technology. We can find everything from simple calculators to modern satellites in space.

{"file_id": "1048738.txt", "output_essay": "Most companies allot a huge amount to advertisement. Why do they do that? Is it still beneficial after using thousands of dollars just on the advertisement? As a matter of fact, it is. I actually read an article about a drink advertisement using a Korean top star. The sales of the product have increased dramatically after the advertisement. Why has this phenomenon happened?\n\nFirst, most advertisers try to make a good image of the product through the advertisement to attract customers. There's actually no one trying to complain about their own product on TV. Hence, the consumers unconsciously accept that the product on TV or in the papers is actually better through the images that the advertisement presents. For example, creating an image of beauty or health by using Jessica Alba in the picture makes people think that ``Oh, if I use that product, I will be beautiful and healthy like Jessica Alba.''\n\nFurthermore, advertisement puts unconscious trust in people's minds. It is a human instinct that the product we know is better than others unknown. And advertisements make products more widely known. People just simply can't trust things that they don't know about. Hence, by using this phenomenon, advertising creates a kind of fake trust in the product. For example, what would you use between Pantene or a shampoo you never saw, even though you never used both? Most people would choose Pantene because they know it.\n\nAdvertising is a kind of magic or trick that attracts people to use it, and it's actually the purpose of the process. By soaking a pleasant image of a Hollywood star, for example, and using the human instinct of preference to famous products, it paralyzes people to buy them. However, we have to be aware that ``A picture means more than a thousand words.'' We have to experience things ourselves rather than just experiencing them through TV."}

On the one hand, I agree that learning facts is significant, but on the other hand, only understanding ideas and concepts allows students to really move forward.\n\nLearning facts, a deductive method, is, in my view, an important basis to invent something, do research, or work on new programs for the government or society in general.\n\nTo illustrate my thesis, I would like to explain how my father works. My father does research concerning synapses, the junctions between neurons. Together with his student research group at the university in Munich, he reflected on all the known facts about neurons. That was the basis for the research and experiments.\n\nAfter being aware of the way a signal is transferred from one cell to another, they started working on concepts of how the information transfer can be blocked. Therefore, they employed poisons like atropine, which is responsible for rejecting specific neurons to pass a cell membrane.\n\nWith this illustration, I would like to emphasize the combination of knowing facts and discovering concepts.\n\nAnother example that conveys my opinion very well is the political system. Of course, a student can learn all the facts about the German democratic system, for example, that it was established after World War II with the help of the Americans, British, French, and (former) Soviets, etc., but this is not necessary when they should think of new opportunities for citizen participation.\n\nFacts are sometimes an important, essential basis or background, but to be innovative and creative, it must be guaranteed that one has understood the gist of an idea or concept.\n\nIn conclusion, I would advise students to learn facts and regard them as a measure of understanding sophisticated ideas and concepts without any problems."}

So, I am completely in agreement with the idea of traveling in a group led by a tour guide.\n\nFirst of all, I agree with paying someone to show me around because it is the best way to visit everything in a city, which I do not know anything about. Furthermore, this guide can show me the history, the monuments, the anecdotes, traditional restaurants, and places to party, and all of these for the same price! For instance, in the trip that I mentioned at the beginning, the one that I did with my mother, this guide showed us every single place in France; actually, my mother went by herself three years before we did, and thanks to this guide, she learned new things about Paris.\n\nSecondly, if I travel with a guided tour, I am going to be safe because this person is supposed to know the right ways and the best times to visit the city, so I do not have to worry about which route I should take to avoid surprising myself with any problem.\n\nTo summarize, I prefer to travel with a tour guide because I think that it is the best way to learn things about a new place.

You could not believe some things that are happening today. So, young people are changing also; they enjoy their lives more than older people do. There are three points that can prove this.\n\nFirst, young people will not think about what will happen when they become old. They just want to enjoy their lives now. In contrast to older people, there is a big difference. Older people will think about their family, their retirement payment, and their future lives. They will save money for that. They will also reduce their activities for health. But young people will not do that. They want to spend more time with friends, lovers, and some modern things. They do not have a savings account; they like to use Visa and spend more money on their habits. In fact, they do not have a plan for the future.\n\nSecond, young people are more easily attracted to new things. They will be mad about computer games, cars, clothes, and so on. At that time, they will spend more money and more time on it. Do not say, 'I am young, I still have much time to do my future work.' That is wrong, because you do not have that money to enjoy your life. You only use older people's money to enjoy your life. In contrast to older people, their situation is opposite. They will not pay attention to new things; they just want themselves to have a good final life.\n\nThird, young people will not think about their families; they think their lives are more important. They will say, 'I must enjoy my life without older people.' They do not want to stay with their mother or father. They only know friends.

This implies that marketers have to prove and show that the product they sell is the best on a certain market. It seems that everybody from the twentieth century must be aware of the great impact that enterprises have on our shopping.\n\nIt is totally right that a firm will try to transmit a message through its product in order to reach our desires and our needs. They put their whole resources into communication; everything leans on it.\n\nKnowing this, customers should be able to distinguish reality from dreams. Enterprises use the naivety and innocence of some people a lot. In consequence, it is our role as consumers to know that an advertisement does not reflect the real qualities of a product. Everything is based on the image the firm wants to show.\n\nFor example, a toy for kids will always seem better than it really is. Mostly because children will want to see it like that and be attracted to it. It is exactly the same thing for a target market like aged persons. The entire society is conditioned to be - or at least to seem - perfect and beautiful until no age. Enterprises know that and use this influence a lot to sell their product.\n\nAs a conclusion, it is hard to define whether advertisements are more or less representative of reality. It is sure, though, that the objective of an enterprise is to make consumers believe that their product will give them beauty, health, or anything they are trying to find. Moreover, it depends on the personality of the buyers because they won't have to buy the product. They will take the final decision. In other words, it is up to us, consumers."}

For example, a television advertisement showing a new car launched by some XYZ company. To buy a car, we really need to go out to a showroom and have a look at it as well as test drive it. But just by looking at an ad, we can't predict how a car would handle at severe turns and bends.\n\nSecondly, nowadays, a lot of advertisement endorsing is done by popular faces like actors, sportsmen, and so on. I saw an advertisement of a bike recently on TV. This bike was endorsed by a rising sports star. In my hometown, a lot of people, after seeing this advertisement, went to the showroom and bought that bike. However, I certainly know from the response I am hearing about the bike from my fellow friends that the bike wasn't even worth a penny. It was so poorly designed. The electronics and engine were the major problems concerning that bike. Now, my friends are complaining to the dealer about their sorry state.\n\nSo, I do feel that by just following an advertisement, one should not lose his normal senses and end up buying false products.\n\nAdditionally, people who are making these advertisements about the products, as well as those endorsing these products, do they really use these products? Well, it seems to be an interesting question. For example, an actor in my hometown is endorsing a product of personal computers and laptops. But recently, at a film production unit, my friends did see him using a laptop of another brand. This means that he is sure that the product which he is endorsing is unreliable. Mostly, we would not find all of the above people who make these advertisements using these products. They would be using products from more famous brands and reputed ones. Hence, we should not always look at an advertisement and buy the product.\n\nIn conclusion to the above-mentioned points, I firmly believe that today's advertisements are no more than a fake piece of information shown on television to make money out of innocent people.

With a tour guide, you have a schedule to follow, and the places where you will go are already planned; also, the places to visit will be the most traditional and safe places for tourists. While you are traveling in a group, you cannot risk getting lost in a place that you do not know; the fact of hanging around with many people makes the tour funny and gives you the opportunity to meet new friends. On the other hand, traveling without a tour guide, for most people, is a way to enjoy a great time with their family. Some people enjoy traveling without a guide because they are not under any schedule or with a big group. It means that these people do not have any planned places to visit; they just go to the first place they look. This kind of travel could be a little risky because you do not know the place where you are, but it does not matter for them; actually, they enjoy it.

The result of this development is that our society is anonymous and there are no real communities.\n\nDuring the last thirty years, I think most of the communities have grown into large cities, because of the process of globalization, which is a major factor why communities break and even break.\n\nIn this case, it is not really surprising that many young people do not spend enough time to help their communities. Another reason why I think this development is not surprising is that most cities and communities do not offer young people the opportunity to help.\n\nFor example, in Germany, where I live, the government decided to close more than half of the institutions where young people can get involved and help the community, maybe to plan a party for the whole community or even a special event on Easter.\n\nThis aspect is also the reason why I say that most do not recognize that a lot of young people support the community, because they do it in private organizations or only for their own.\n\nSo my conclusion is that it is not only the fault of the young persons that they do not help so much, because they cannot change the developments of last years and the process of globalization, and also they cannot influence the decisions of the government, because most of them are not allowed to vote, because of their age.\n\nHowever, I think that young persons are responsible for the community, and so I think they should support them in any way.

I believe this because 'life is full of risks, and if someone (a successful person) does not take any risks, then he/she will end up losing/missing a lot of good opportunities that life brings in.\n\nFirst of all, I believe that all risks generally offer a great benefit in return. If one does not want to take any risk, he/she will receive no benefits. For example, a bank offers you a new type of bond that can bring you an additional income of $1,000 per year. That is great! Why not go for it, and not settle for a $100-bringing 'safe type' just because 'you already know how to do it well'? In my opinion, a person who goes for the $100 is not aware of his/her abilities, and it is a shame not to take a risk. In my view, a successful person would never miss it, and that is why they are called successful!\n\nSecondly, life is full of risks, and one cannot be successful by choosing to stay conservative. Every day, life brings in thousands of new opportunities to a lot of people, and most of those opportunities can add beauty to your life (of course, not everything is related to money). For example, take a risk and join a good club to meet new people: beauty can be in terms of friendships, why not? That is why I believe that a person who always goes for what he/she already knows can never discover new opportunities in life, but a successful person utilizes these opportunities in all the good ways.\n\nFinally, in my opinion, successful people do not lose opportunities. When one observes, I believe that one can indeed detect successful people by detecting their risk-taking behaviors. Successful people are generally the ones who not only take but also 'catch' more risks.\n\nTo summarize, I would like to say and suggest that everyone should take more risks to be more successful. Taking risks will always bring them better things in many ways that will make them successful. If Napoleon Bonaparte were alive, I believe he would say 'risk, risk, risk, success, success, success' instead of 'money, money, money'."}

I am twenty-three years old, therefore I am a young person, and in this period of my life, I am very happy. In recent years, I have done some things, many of which were very important for my growth, many of which were very enjoyable, but on the other hand, there were some bad moments. Moreover, I can say that in my life, the good periods are more present than the bad periods.\n\nI am young, and this thing is very beautiful; in this period of my life, I can do some enjoyable things, for example, yesterday I played football with my friends, and on other days, I have played baseball, cricket, and basketball.\n\nYouth lets me do these things because my body is okay, I don't have any problems, I am healthy. At the moment, I think that I can do everything! It's a good sensation, the best I have ever had.\n\nOn the other hand, this good period can't continue for all my life; in this case, I could be an Highlander! There is a period in our life when all things are more difficult than in youth. This difficult period is when people become older. This is the ultimate state of our life, when our body becomes ill and old.\n\nI think that there are some good moments in this sad period, the close contact with our relatives develops a strong rapport, which is important, and in this manner, we can be more happy than alone.\n\nIn conclusion, I think that young people are more enjoyable than older people, but we must love our life, because it is unique and indispensable."}
{"file_id": "1045426.txt", "output_essay": "There is no consensus among people as to the argument that it is good for a group to travel led by a guide. With an increasing number of people claiming that it has lots of disadvantages, some people more sensible tend to consider the nature that traveling with a guide is amazing. And the latter point coincides with mine, for my reason below:\n\nFirstly, we never remain suspicious of the point that traveling with a tour guide has an extremely positive affect on the mood of the members of the group. For instance, statistics indicate that 70 percent of people who have the experience of traveling with a guide will have a good mood. Another example, I often travel with my parents, and we always travel with a guide. Because of the professional knowledge the guide obtained, he can arrange our activity schedule, and we should not worry about anything; what we should do is just watch and enjoy the charming view passing by. So easy is the travel, we never feel tired because we can focus our mood on the beauty of the view. So the trip becomes happy and easy without thinking about where we should go to, and where is the most famous place, because we can obtain totally from the mouth of the guide. It is so cool. And the group members will have more time chatting with each other.\n\nFurthermore, it is no exaggeration to say that traveling with a guide has a huge influence not just on the mood we have, but on our money as well. For example, without a guide, we are likely to buy something useless but attractive at that moment. However, if a tour guide accompanies your group, it will not be a matter. Once our family went to Qingdao, which is a charming seashore town with charming views that the seagulls are singing with sunshine. So we are attracted by it. When a man sells some seafood, we accept because at that moment we forget anything but the amazing view. At that time, the guide stops us because he thinks the price of the seafood is too high. With his advice, we are awake. Thus, thanks to his help, we save lots of money to buy something useful. Therefore, traveling with a guide has lots of benefits that can influence us financially.\n\nAs we have discussed above, we can safely draw the conclusion that traveling with a guide not only can help us obtain a good mood but can save our money as well. Therefore, it is high time that we should raise the public awareness of the significance of the guide. Just in this way can we get a wonderful journey with other group members."}

Because in primary studies, each one of the subjects is interlinked with other subjects. This means getting some knowledge on each and every relevant subject is good for the basics of studies. Veins are connected to each and every part of the body and supply blood to function in good health. If a person is suffering from internal pain in their body, the patient is to be carried to the hospital and checked by the doctor, who identifies some defects. Planned to do an operation, each and every doctor should have some knowledge on all parts of the human body; neither can a doctor make an operation without having knowledge in relevant parts. Suddenly, the doctor is having good knowledge in veins, for example; a general doctor cannot read about one topic or one specific subject. In the human body, each and every part is related to another part, so the person studying to be a doctor needs all relevant subjects of the human body to be a successful doctor.\n\nWhereas in mathematical calculations, to calculate the estimated cost of a project, one needs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Then only will the final result appear. So, in some cases, there should be good knowledge in relevant subjects, and similarly, we can improve communication and good relationships between people. We need to have knowledge in all aspects; then only can we survive in society. Having good knowledge in all parts is good. Each and every genius is to have vast experience. So, we use to have broad knowledge on academic subjects, which is good off specific subjects."}
{"file_id": "1049746.txt", "output_essay": "In the name of Allah,\n\nIn the first place, we will describe the main lines of our subject:\n\nFirstly, students understand ideas.Secondly, students conceptualize ideas.The main goal of this subject is to 'learn facts.'\n\nNow, I will begin from the presentation of the subject to the students, which depends on whether the subject concerns:\n\nA. Scientific subjects: I think it's not important for students to understand because they should take the subject from a different perspective. For example, if the teacher talks about the sun rising from the east side, no one must discuss the teacher for that because there is no result from the discussion, even if they talk for days. They would not take any additional information. So, I think that in scientific subjects, it's not important for students to understand ideas, but maybe the teacher can explain it briefly, using the earth's movement as an example.\n\nB. Art subjects: Now, here the subject is open because it has no constants, unlike scientific subjects. So, maybe the teacher gives information to the students, and part of them agree with it, or maybe another part does not agree. For example, let's talk about the beauty of the 'Mona Lisa board.' So, maybe most students agree that there are secrets in her smile, but not all can deal with that set from the art, or it came while they do not know - I'm talking about 'Leonardo da Vinci.' So, I think it's not important for students to understand ideas and concepts.\n\nC. Medical subjects: That regards medical students, who must understand everything about humans. There is no data that can pass as it is; every detail should be discussed. So, here I think there is a need for students to understand to learn the facts.\n\nFinally, I talk about the subject from an outside perspective; maybe my opinion is mistaken. In the last analysis, I will say that it's not for school students because they are in a building stage and must understand everything. My opinion may apply to upper-level students, like those in universities or high school levels. But I think you must understand to learn facts until the fact is kept in your brain as much as possible."}
{"file_id": "1049574.txt", "output_essay": "Some people believe that successful people take risks and try new things in order to accomplish their goals, while others believe that doing what they know well will get them where they want to be. I believe that successful people always have to take risks and not just do what they know well.\n\nI will explain why I agree with the statement using an example from a specific career like engineering. Risks can take you to fields of your career that you did not even know existed, because you are always too busy doing what you already know. For example, the development of a new technology or the expansion of one that already exists. If you don't take the risk to explore new things, this new technology might never be developed because you, as an engineer, are doing the same thing over and over again.\n\nAnother advantage of taking risks is that if you fail, you can always go back to what you were doing before. Let's think of a new product we want to develop. If the engineers have a specific product, for example, deodorants in roll-on plastic containers, and they never try to invent another way to apply the product, they probably would not be able to create the spray applications. But let's say they formulate this new application using aerosols and they find out that it is affecting the ozone layer on the planet because of the gases expelled. They can always go back to the roll-on application and help the environment. They took the risk with the new technology, but it brought a lot of problems, so they can go back to the old way to apply the product and solve the problem.\n\nThese two main reasons explain why people have to take risks in their professional environment. However, this also applies to other things in your life. Like, for example, in a personal field, let's talk about marriage. When you get married, you are taking a lot of risks. You are signing a contract that lasts forever, not knowing what is going to happen in your life. But, as I mentioned, this contract can be voided, and if things are rough, you can get divorced and go back to your single life. You took the risk looking for success, but it did not work, so you can go back and start all over again."}

Old people struggled to get out of the hard time, bringing bacon home for their families, and they kept living for their families. Now they have children who have all grown up, and time to spend for themselves.\n\nPeople say that the old do not know how to enjoy their lives; I do not think so.

Insofar, students should achieve a profound expertise in a special area. But one should be aware of the following: The question of whether a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is prior to specialization in one specific subject can mislead the discussion. Actually, specialized knowledge on its own won't be enough to deal with the needs employees and researchers are faced with in our days. To put it precisely: Your expertise in a specific subject must be accompanied by at least some broad knowledge of related academic subjects and common topics in general.\n\nToday, our society is a very complex and fast-moving entity. That is why it is impossible for a single person to have a useful knowledge in all areas of academic research. Therefore, it is important to have a specific academic field in which one develops a profound expertise. By doing this, one is able to understand the complexity of the subject concerned and follow the innovations in this area. This wouldn't be possible if one had a broad but purely superficial knowledge of a wide range of subjects. In this case, one's understanding of each single subject wouldn't be sufficient to solve the tasks and problems that could arise.\n\nFurthermore, our society as well as the academic world is moving very fast. It would be impossible to be up to date in a wide range of subjects. But being up to date is a key qualification in our times. In this context, it doesn't matter if one is talking about technical, economic, social, or political issues. All of them are highly complex and are fast-changing, and therefore specialists are needed in all of them.\n\nBut as stated above in the introduction, one should not forget the importance of some basic general knowledge. Therefore, the best way of planning one's academic career is to strike a balance between specialization and general knowledge."}

But it could be a little bit expensive and dangerous if you do not have the appropriate instruction. In this paper, I want to discuss the advantages and disadvantages that we could encounter when we are traveling without a suitable orientation.\n\nFirst of all, if we are traveling in a group led by a tour guide, we can feel safer and more confident to explore new things and landscapes. It is due to the expertise and experience that a tour guide could have. Moreover, the guide could show the travelers the important and interesting places that the group should visit during the trip. It is too important because it can save money and time; you go straight to the point, and it is fantastic.\n\nOn the other hand, if we travel in a group led by a tour guide, we can feel uncomfortable with many things. One of them is that you cannot visit some places when you want to because it is usually the case that a tour guide has a traveling route decided and scheduled before the trip has started. Adding to this point, you cannot enjoy isolated spaces and activities because most of the time you have to share different activities with the whole group, and it can be a boring experience.\n\nFrom my point of view, it is very important to travel with someone else, but if I have the opportunity to do it in a group, it is wonderful. Because of the mutual cultural and interpersonal exchange, you can enjoy and involve yourself in many activities easily. But if your group has a tour guide, it is an excellent tool to know a lot of places using less time and money. I think the most important issue if you want to travel is to be prepared to do it alone, in a group, or with a tour guide. It does not matter; just take into account your happiness and your feeling of having fun."}

Perhaps you can do your job perfectly, but there are many people who want to have that job. Therefore, you should be more different and effective than the others, and this is possible just by having broad knowledge about various academic subjects.\n\nTo begin with, it is a clear fact that the world is so crowded, and people have to compete to have good living conditions. While their academic education process is continuing, they should try to develop themselves in different fields because being specialized in one subject is not enough to pass other competitors. For this reason, if they want to be successful, they should take into consideration this difficulty.\n\nIn addition to this, people live in a competing world, and if they want to be in a high class or if they want to have good living conditions, they have to be powerful, and of course, they should have enough equipment to fight and compete with other people.

Although real weapons such as guns were the most powerful equipment to compete with other countries and people in various fields in the past, now people are in need of different things such as intelligence, ability, and of course, wide knowledge to show their difference from other people.

Yet, by drawing comparisons between different communities all over the world, I would like to present my home community in order to illustrate the youths' commitment to their communities.\n\nFor my working definition, I see 'helping communities' as a willing and unpaid commitment to local affairs. There is a huge amount of youth groups, covering all ages and interests, which meet once a week in order to pursue their common interests and aims. There is a range from choirs to play groups to sports clubs. By coming together, they foster the community; some arrange public events like summer parties where everybody can take part, and the profit is donated to local institutions.\n\nAdditionally, many youths willingly become members of, for example, firemen, to be able to save their families and neighbors when required. Weekly meetings and trainings prepare them for this task. Moreover, there are many who decide to be social workers, at least part-time, some even full-time for a whole year. They can work wherever they desire. Either they help in old people's homes by taking them for a walk, doing their shopping, or simply spending time with them. Others decide to work with disabled people, helping them to manage their daily lives. Some others prefer to work with young children who have problems at home or at school, etc. There is a variety of possibilities where they can and do spend their time in order to improve the conditions.\n\nAnother possibility to get engaged in the community's affairs is to get engaged in local politics. Thus, young people's ideas and suggestions can improve the community. For example, I have just run a youth campaign which informed the citizens about and collected signatures against the bad conditions in our local kindergarten.

{"file_id": "1052334.txt", "output_essay": "I think that the main point of inventing is curiosity. I absolutely agree with this statement. Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. There are many characteristics that make a person successful. Tenacity and intelligence are only two of these.\n\nFirstly, if a person has tenacity, he/she never gives up, never accepts 'no' for an answer. He/she studies hard to succeed in his/her goal. He is curious about his target. He does his best to achieve his goal for this target. He is so willing to learn new information and make new inventions. For example, one of the great geniuses of our world is Einstein. He was a big inventor. And we are still using his theories in our classes. I think he gathered his ambitions, intelligence, and tenacity and formed a person who will not be forgotten at any time in the world.\n\nSecondly, intelligence is a very important factor that makes a person successful. If a person is intelligent, he/she can understand problems easily and does his/her best to cope with it. If people in our world do not have curiosity about new inventions, nothing could be found. For example, technology cannot be improved widely, beneficial investigations about our era's disease, cancer, cannot be found. These are all beneficial to human beings.\n\nTo sum up, nothing can be done without risking anything. The world is improving rapidly. People must always learn something to cope with these changes. They must not be frightened of new improvements and new technology. Also, they must think 'what must I do to improve myself' instead of doing well what they already know. They have to do this not only for themselves, but also for the benefit of all people around the world."}

{"file_id": "1051036.txt", "output_essay": "I firmly believe that every man has his finest hour, and I am not able to say if it comes in the early or later period of our lives. Generally, I think that a man's finest hour comes when he has worked hard for years and years, to finally discover that he was right in his life and so were the things he had worked for, and this discovery happens when he finally lies on his battlefield, exhausted, but victorious. Homer said that men become more tired of drinking, dancing, and making love than making war; so he would say that men are always at war, and only the dead see the end of it, not because they are bad or barbarians, but because they enjoy living their life on the edge, to take a match every day, to demonstrate they are victorious. I think this is the meaning of 'enjoy life': to take part every day in new competitions, going away victorious, in the end. Now, I'm not able to say when our best hour occurs; it may happen when we're old or when we are young; the meaningful thing is to enjoy this moment. Young boys, probably, live their lives and don't think too much about the far future, when they will be old, like De'Medici said in his poems. Opposite to this argument, we can say that old people have a heavy bag full of cultural notions and experience, and they think much more about the things they have to do, caring not only for themselves but also for all the people they have around and with whom they have relationships. In ancient times, they said: 'Only the good die young,' but this thinking was strictly joined to a pagan vision of the world and life. Now, it is the culture of Christians that has found its way to rule the world, and we can say that we have not only a heroic youth but also a respectable middle or old age: this period of life is not yet rated like autumn. We can enjoy life in every period of our life, at the same matter; it doesn't care how many years you carry on."}

I have made this experience for myself quite a few times. I remember the first advertisements of the iPod from Apple. The customers really got the feeling that the iPod was not only a simple music player in a good-looking design, but even that it was the most handy player on the market. I was one of the first people who bought an iPod, but after a short period of time, I was a little bit depressed about my decision. The advertisements did not show, for example, that it was only possible to change the recorded music with one single software program and only one computer at once. I still have the iPod, but in the future, I will be better informed about the features of a product before I buy it.\n\nFurthermore, quite a lot of products do not aim to highlight their characteristics in the way the advertisements show. A good friend of mine is working in the marketing business unit of a company, which does the advertising for different companies. It is always very interesting and funny when we get together for a drink and talk about our jobs. Every time, it is the same: he tells me about new customers and their products. My friend and his colleagues sometimes do not even see one advantage of a product that should be advertised by them, but it is their job to present the product in a way that people have the desire to buy it.\n\nAs I have shown above, advertisements do not always show the truth about a product and put it in a much better light than it is. I have made these experiences several times, and I have learned from them. I think everybody should be aware that the product they buy is perhaps not as perfect as the advertisement of the product showed."}
{"file_id": "1052180.txt", "output_essay": "This topic reminds us of the popular question, 'what is better: quantity or quality.' The essay is going to focus on the advantages and disadvantages of having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects versus being specialized in a particular one.\n\nThe first part of our essay will enumerate and explain the advantages of each of them, and the second part would discuss the disadvantages. Elementary and secondary education is mostly all-subject teaching rather than specific. It gives the students the opportunity to have an idea of the different fields of study and also gives them a variety of choices as per their future career or post-secondary education. In many cases, the student has enough time to see if he would choose a particular option or career orientation.\n\nFor example, a student who takes physics and biology has various choices of career: he could decide to go into the technical or engineering field or the medical field. On the other hand, a student who focuses on a particular subject would definitely excel in it in the future because of the time spent studying it. This is particularly true for students in technical schools, who choose their career option from the elementary or secondary level. A student who attends an aviation maintenance school from his secondary level would have all the necessary tools to succeed in aeronautical engineering, for example.\n\nRecalling the popular saying, 'jack of all trades and master of none,' we see that students who focus on too many subjects end up not mastering any. Having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects could lead to more confusion also when the time comes to choose a specialization. On the other hand, being specialized in only one subject reduces or limits your options for a future career and also exposes you to the economical and geographical changes.

These programs include activities such as cleaning side roads, collecting charitable donations, and different socially responsible endeavors.\n\nBased on research conducted by a leading consulting firm in Europe, it was shown that 5% of a young person's time is dedicated to assisting their local communities.\n\nSecondly, social responsibility and helping communities is becoming a very hot topic in the corporate world. This phenomenon has extended its effect outside of the corporate world to involve the rest of society. Therefore, many people are becoming more aware of the importance of being socially responsible, hence, they are starting to convey the benefits of being socially responsible to younger people (i.e., their kids, students, dependents, etc.).\n\nFinally, many young people's groups are being used as great examples of time dedication in helping communities, not only their own communities but also international communities. For example, a group of kids from France gathered their toys and other belongings and sent them to Lebanon to help the kids who had left their homes because of the current Israeli-Lebanese war."}

However, I have other opinions on why there will be more cars on the road instead of a decline.\n\nFirst, people try to have their own car personally, not just one in a family. In a family, for example, the father needs his car to go to his workplace. The mother needs her car to go to her workplace. Even though she does not have a job, she also needs a car to pick up her kids or go shopping. There is also a demand from children when they grow up and become of an age to own a car; when they go to college. As a result, all members need a car. Therefore, each person needs a car. As a result, there will be an increase in cars in society.\n\nSecond, the trend of living a little distance from the workplace increases the demand for cars. Nowadays, Korean people, internationally also, prefer to live 30 minutes to 1 hour distance from their work. This means they need automobiles to go to their work. For instance, my professor, who lives one hour's distance from college, has her own car. She comes to school every morning using her car, not the subway.\n\nIt is true that there is an increasing number of people who use public transportation to save money, oil, etc. However, this does not mean they do not have a car. They have their own car but just use public transportation in order to save money. When they are running out of time, when they feel tired of waiting for the bus, or when they want to go somewhere where public transportation does not go, they will take out their personal car and drive.\n\nTherefore, the need for owning a car for each individual, the trend of moving a distance from the workplace, makes the demand for cars increase. Furthermore, even though some people use public transportation, they surely possess a car. As a result, there will be more cars on the road than now."}

Although it might not be exact for every advertisement, this gap between reality and representation is experienced on a daily basis.\n\nFirst, we have to keep in mind the primary goal of an advertisement, which is to attract customers to a specific product. Hence, advertisement makers have to rely on commercial techniques that give the impression that their product is not only good but also better than other products of the same category.\n\nIt is precisely in this process that a gap may occur between what the product really is and how it is presented to the customers. Even if we assume that the advertisement makers are aware of the basic qualities of a product, what is to be understood is that their goal is to make you think that you need this particular product, hence emphasizing its qualities and, of course, passing under silence its negative aspects.\n\nThis unbalanced and biased view on the product's inherent value will surely produce a distorted perception of its real desirability, making it seem much better than it really is.\n\nThe car industry provides numerous examples of this phenomenon. This very competitive market forces advertisement makers to present every car as if they are perfectly fitted for you, which is not always the case. For example, American car makers have the tendency to promote their vehicles by stating their durability and their power. But they naturally never mention the fact that these vehicles are much more energy-consuming than non-American cars.\n\nHence, if one relies only on the advertisement, he will be convinced that this particular American automobile is a really good product. But, if he buys it, he will soon realize that his vehicle has a high gas consumption rate. He then might have the feeling that he made the wrong choice, that the vehicle was not as good for him as the advertisement pretended.\n\nThis illustration shows clearly that advertisements are, by definition, enhancing the apparent value of a product in order to sell it."}

{"file_id": "1053319.txt", "output_essay": "Unfortunately, I have to agree with the statement that nowadays young people do not invest enough time to help their communities. In my opinion, a possible reason for this development might be the lack of a strong incentive for young people to spend their precious free time on helping the community instead of maybe hanging out with their friends, playing video games, etc. As especially cities grow to become more and more anonymous, young people do not see the reward of their work in the community as they would in a smaller one where everyone knows each other, and the youth would get more appreciation for their voluntary work. This is, of course, a misconception, because volunteering for a good cause is appreciated in both environments; it just may not be as obvious to the young people. So the question is: What do the youth do with the time that they once spent on helping their communities? They spend it on activities that they simply find more pleasurable. In fact, this is a trend that we can detect in all layers of society and in all ages; we do not need to search for this phenomenon among young people only. Of course, it is more fun going to the cinema than helping elderly members of the community. So what we need is incentives. We could get incentives from the parents, helping their kids realize at a young age that it is important to take responsibility and help out in the community at least every once in a while, depending on the child. Small activities done for the community may be more important and more valued than one might think, and every kind of work is strongly welcomed and appreciated. The community itself must have a strong core in order to create networks and to attract the young people through, for example, specific institutions and activities only for the young. I say this because I believe that only if the young people can identify themselves with their community, at least to a certain extent, will they be willing to become an active member and help by investing a bit of their work as well."}

{"file_id": "1053274.txt", "output_essay": "Having broad knowledge of many academic subjects prevents one's true learning and therefore is not a reliable way to study, compared to specializing in one specific subject.\n\nWhen I was in middle school in Korea, students had many more subjects to learn than in New York, where I live now. We had to master Physics to Engineering, and had major tests each term. Studying the twelve or more subjects that I was supposed to get as high a score as possible, I wondered if that type of study really helped me to learn and achieve what I needed to survive in society.\n\nMany of the subjects, such as engineering, cooking, or music in my case, were unattractive to me, and most of all, unnecessary for my future. Many other students would have similar problems. Also, it is very hard, or impossible, for a person to master such many subjects.\n\nOne may argue that in order to be well-adapted in our society, people need multiple fields in which one can do well. For example, in typical companies, employees need to be good at calculating and analyzing information, socializing with other people, which might require various kinds of skills. However, if one tries to master too many disciplines, it is more likely not to be helpful for one's career, because still, he/she needs to be professionally good at only one discipline, which the person will be working on throughout their career.\n\nThe most ultimate reason for studying many disciplines is that it prevents one from truly learning something, no matter what it is. When a person has broad knowledge of many subjects, it means that he/she has no professional knowledge about anything. What is the use of knowing so many things when one knows nothing really useful, valuable, and professional? Why should one struggle to have so many meaningless pieces of knowledge that everyone else can easily learn also?\n\nThere is no meaning nor fun in having broad and common knowledge of many subjects. The fun of learning and concentrating on one discipline sincerely and truly is in consuming the subject which you love, and which fascinates you."}
{"file_id": "1053480.txt", "output_essay": "In this essay, I will express whether I agree or disagree with the question. One idea states that it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts rather than learning facts, while another idea suggests that learning facts is more beneficial. I support the idea that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts. Because, in order to discover something new, a student should learn the basic concepts and ideas. Learning facts is a part of the process. It is more important for a student to understand the ideas and concepts. In the academic world, in universities, we are told that learning concepts and ideas is more important because, by learning them, you can learn the facts and make the facts more efficient for humanity.\n\nSuppose an electrical engineering student wants to make an innovation about transistor concepts. A transistor is a kind of device used in all electronic devices. When that student wants to learn the facts without knowing the ideas and concepts, he cannot be an engineer. An engineer should be innovative and think about something new. To invent something, the concepts and ideas should be understood. To learn the facts, a student should know the ideas and concepts; without knowing the concepts and ideas, the student cannot invent anything and could only be an electric technician.\n\nThink about the communication area. Fifteen years ago, mobile phones were not widely used. However, nowadays, everybody uses cellular phones. Technology becomes more efficient over time. If engineers and students only learn the facts without knowing the ideas and concepts, it will be impossible for them to increase the technology level. By understanding the concepts, they are sharing information, and technology can be used in a better way.\n\nIn conclusion, I want to reiterate that it is more important for students to understand the ideas and concepts rather than learning the facts. If a student wants to introduce something new, he should know the ideas and concepts. If he only learns the facts, in my opinion, he cannot introduce something new. That is the way academic learning is taught in universities. They teach us to use ideas and concepts as a way of learning. By doing so, we can learn facts, but if only facts are taught, there will be no way to increase the humanity level or technology; there should be different opinions."}

The first reason is that people would take the environment into consideration a lot more than they do now. Another reason is that the economic status may be affected for the worse in the future.\n\nPeople would appreciate a good and healthy environment more in the future because of the fact that it is rapidly changing for the worse now. If we looked at the earth as a creature, it would not be in good health; it would be 'ill,' and it wouldn't take people long to notice that. As soon as they do and as soon as this fact shocks them back to their senses, they would be acting in more responsible ways and will take immediate actions to prevent further illnesses from appearing, and that's where the reduction of using cars must take place.\n\nTake the global warming issue, for example; it is already capturing people's attention and driving people to want to do something about it.\n\nThe environmental status will have a larger impact on human society and would most probably change its economic structure. Once that is done, the individual won't be able to have the luxury of having his or her own car, and therefore, will force the reduction of using cars onto society. Other methods of transportation would be even more popular than they are now. For example, public transportation would be a must and not an option.

Many people think that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are, while others believe that most advertisements portray products as they really are. I think that advertisements make products seem better to make more money, attract more people, and expand their business.\n\nOne reason is to make a lot of money. Many of these owners don't have any respect for others. These persons just want to sell you something at a high price, and maybe the price is lower than they claim it is. Like my grandfather, who wanted to buy a computer and saw an advertisement on TV that said the computer was worth three thousand dollars. Because she was naive about computers, she bought it. When she told my father that she bought a computer for that price, my father was shocked because he said the computer only worth one thousand dollars.\n\nAnother reason is that the owner wants to attract people with this product. They just care about attracting the maximum quantity of people. For example, my mother bought a vacuum machine that she saw on TV. She said that this was the best one she had ever seen. When the vacuum arrived, she was excited and started to use it. In four days, the vacuum broke, and she couldn't use it anymore.\n\nFinally, these advertisements make products seem better because the owners want to expand their business. For this reason, they can sell more things and also make more money. First, they start selling only one product, but with the money they made from this product, they will start making other products. As a result, they will expand their business.\n\nTo conclude, I would say that many advertisements make products seem much better than they really are because the owners want to make more money, attract more people, and expand their business. I think that these people should have more respect for their customers and make advertisements that show the product the way it is, not the way they want it to look like."}

For example, cars emit carbon monoxide when they burn gasoline, which is poisonous to people, animals, and plants. In addition, cars also emit carbon dioxide, which is responsible for the greenhouse effect.\n\nSecond, the governments also restrict the use of vehicles due to fear of depletion of natural resources, especially petroleum. That valuable natural resource is necessary for vehicles to move \u2013 i.e., to burn gasoline. In addition, it is necessary to manufacture vehicles. For example, the process of manufacturing cars needs high temperatures, which are given by petroleum. Moreover, cars use plastics as parts thereof, and needless to say, plastics are produced from petroleum.\n\nIn addition, according to media and recent official reports by the United Nations, the governments of many countries in the world are not only beginning to restrict the use of cars but also trying to find alternative transportation that does not have the problems that cars have. For example, in my nation, Japan, the government has been investing in research for commercializing the 'linear motor car.' It moves by the energy of magnets, so it does not emit any poisonous gas. Experts estimate that the linear motor car will be used more popularly in 15 years.\n\nTherefore, I agree with the opinion that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today for these reasons."}

It's not a healthy life, and not a responsible life either.

I think it is more important to understand something and to develop our critical judgment. But both are really important. \n\nNevertheless, I think we should learn in order to be able to understand what happens in our life or in our society. Let's take an example. If we want to understand a political debate or we want to vote, we should know and learn what a Republican or a Democrat is, in order to vote correctly. In our life, we always need to know something to understand it. Thus, the importance of learning. \n\nHowever, we should be careful not to learn without understanding, which is completely stupid. An example may be when somebody has well learned how to write words. If he does not practice or understand how to make a sentence, it is completely useless to know words. \n\nDespite the fact that learning by heart something can be very boring, we should be able to do it. Because the more we will have learned a subject, the more we will be able to talk about it and to understand it. So if we learn how the American parliament works, we should better understand the role of G. Bush, for example. \n\nTherefore, I think that we should not decide only to understand or only to learn. These two notions should go together; they are complementary. Although nobody really likes to learn by heart, we must do it, in order to understand better what happens in our life or in our society."}

The huge academic syllabus is a combination of both facts and ideas. However, the point that needs to be focused on here is, \"How much do students remember after all?\" They remember only what they learn and not what they mug up. Therefore, we can sum up that it is important to grasp concepts while at school rather than merely registering facts and forgetting them later on.\n\nThe endless chapters on history often fail to teach us what we are supposed to learn. For example, Alexander the Great was a great conqueror. He conquered endlessly. However, being murdered and left was what reached him to the almighty. Here, we need to appreciate his dynamism and heroism, not failing to see the other side of the coin, that is, he was overconfident and was consumed by his own avarice to conquer.\n\nWe need to formulate our education system where students can develop their mental capacity. A developed individual would be self-confident, reliable, and a good human being. In this context, the earlier system of education in India is worth having a look at. The then schools, called \"gurukuls,\" meaning house of the teacher, were considered sacred and holy. Students would focus more on learning and understanding. Of course, they were taught facts, but they knew how to use them and gain knowledge as well, which is the ultimate aim of education. A confident student, with an understanding of basic concepts, would be more successful than one who has simply mugged up facts, which he will ultimately forget."}

After some years, or due to the continuous increase in fuel costs, people may be forced to move away from cars and mostly depend on public transport, which is quite economical and has several advantages.\n\nThe government will implement different plans to discourage people from using cars by levying heavy taxes on registration, insurance charges, road taxes, and yearly renewal charges, which makes it not affordable for people to own a car. Due to the continuous decrease in petroleum resources, the auto manufacturing companies are focusing on non-conventional sources like electric cars, hybrid cars. As electric cars are limited to a certain distance and require charging for some time to make them run again, which is a major drawback.\n\nA hybrid car works by using more than one fuel to run, which is quite costly, but it is stated as a future car.

In my opinion, each of these ways has some advantages and some disadvantages, but the second is the best.\n\nAs regards the first possibility, that is, having a specific knowledge, I think that the most important advantage is that whoever has a specific education has a high possibility of finding a job, a well-rewarding job, in the field where they studied in depth. Indeed, nowadays, firms and companies look for people who can give sensible help to the firm. Students who are well-prepared are a competitive factor that allows firms to gather much money.\n\nOn the other hand, people or students who have a wide range of interests, who study different subjects, have the possibility of using the information they gather during their training in order to create a good social life. Moreover, I think that these people are more flexible in changing their work during their life.\n\nFor these reasons, even if at first view, the first kind of knowledge could seem better, I think that, especially in the long time, for example, during the whole life, the second kind of knowledge is more useful for people.\n\nI think so because I chose to study a subject in depth, that is, management engineering, and I study this subject in depth to make myself more competitive than the other students in the world of job. When I have some free time, I prefer not to spend it reading because I'm very tired from my work at university. But when I meet people studying something different from economical, mechanical, or industrial subjects, and I talk with them about something they have discussed in class or they have read in a magazine, I always feel that I'm incomplete, my education is incomplete, because even if I'm clever, I haven't the basic information to say my opinion about the topic. So I think that everyone should spend part of the day reading magazines, journals, and so on in order to have a rewarding life."}
{"file_id": "1054691.txt", "output_essay": "I agree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to help their communities. It is because the technology is much better now than before, young people are too happy, and the effect of the media.\n\nThe technology we have today is way better than it was 10 or 15 years ago, and young people have more entertainment in their lives. The bad thing is that most young people spend most of their time on entertainment such as TV, video games, MP3, and computers. Compared to the older days, people would be more helpful in their communities since they did not have much entertainment. They would spend a whole afternoon at a community center to help and learn. Young people would rather spend most of their time in front of a computer or TV instead of helping their communities because there are too many better things waiting for them.\n\nMoreover, not caring about other people is the point of view that most young people have nowadays. It is because they have not experienced hard times in their lives since birth. They are too happy, and so they do not have an idea of helping others. Older people would spend time to help others because they know that even a little help would be a gift for some people. So, young people would not spend a lot of time to help their communities because they do not know that their help would be a great reward for some people.\n\nFinally, the attitude of young people is a problem as well. If the media encouraged them, there would be a lot of helpers in the world. Media is the pathway that young people relate to the most, so if the media encouraged young people to spend time to help their communities and told them that a lot of people would need help, they would spend more time to help.\n\nTherefore, the improvement of technology, the way and attitude that society is having now, and the effect of the media are the most important things that make young people not give enough time to help their communities."}

There are two important reasons why I think that this statement is true.\n\nFirst, today, in our society, the most important thing for people has become the appearance, and not the real essence of things. In the everyday life of each individual, the aesthetic and exterior aspects, such as clothes, beauty, money, richness, and material things are most relevant rather than the interior aspects, such as ethical values, love, friendliness, helpfulness, etc. For this reason, people think it is right to appear and to demonstrate these aspects rather than their essence.\n\nSecond, today, TV, radio, papers, and other forms and sources of information, like mass media, have developed very quickly, connecting groups of different people all over the world. So, individuals are slaves of this information sphere that influences them.\n\nSo, we can transport these two concepts from the life of people to their relationship with the different kinds of products, which they see and consider all day. I think that because people are influenced and pay great attention to exterior aspects, most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.\n\nIn conclusion, I think that this process is really developed, but it is wrong and it damages our society within a few years."}
{"file_id": "1058151.txt", "output_essay": "Opinions might exist over whether most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. \n\nPersonally, I agree with the above statement because advertisements are a method to maximize companies' profits. As well, the time for advertisements is dramatically short.\n\nTo start with, the purpose of making advertisements is to attract customers. Today's society has many companies, and many products are made by them. As a result, the companies tend to draw people to buy their goods. In this sense, advertisements are one of the best ways to increase selling rates. To illustrate, every day, people are surrounded by a numerous number of advertisements. To hold people's attention, the functions of goods in advertisements are different from their original functions. My mother is a case in point. She often suffers from bad flu and buys medicine after watching medical advertisements. However, she always fails to find effective medicine for her flu. This is because every good in advertisements seems increasingly perfect for her, but they do not cure her pain. As a result, she has no choice but to buy new medicine. As illustrated above, most advertisements fake people to a certain degree of functions for more profits.\n\nWhat is more, the time of advertisements is dramatically short, and companies have to give people impressions about their products in a short time. Therefore, they have no choice but to make products seem much better than original."}

They met every day after school in the library, not only studying their homework but also helping other students. Yet, there were some students who could not pay the money to attend test-prep schools or college-prep programs in community college; those who formed the tutoring groups would answer almost all the questions those helpless students had.I was one of those helpless students because I had just arrived from a foreign country; however, they helped me improve my English ability.Now I participate in the group and teach other students in Math and Chinese.As young people, I think my classmates and friends all did a good job in helping the communities.I believe that there are other student groups in other schools that are doing the same job.\n\nIn the summer, most of my friends would participate in taking care of the children or old people.Some of those children had no parents, some of them were abandoned.Once, I participated in the service, I read stories to them.At first, I was thinking of practicing my English reading ability; however, I cried after I went home because I felt I wanted to do more for them but I couldn't.I asked more of my friends to join this service, and we all learned different things from it.One of my friends had once participated in a service in a hospital.She talked to the old people, and then she read the books and newspapers to them.She told me that participating in community service was a really different experience, and it would lead you to learn more about life, about helping other people without asking for a reward. Young people do participate to help their community without speaking of it loudly; they choose to help society silently.Once they join it, they would continue the service."}
{"file_id": "1055329.txt", "output_essay": "The older generation sometimes says that the younger generation does not play an active role in helping their communities anymore. They think that the younger generation is selfish and only wants to earn a lot of money. There are a few points supporting this opinion, but there are also a few against it.\n\nThe first thing to say is that the traditional bonds between the younger and older generation have dissolved nearly completely. For example, it is not common anymore that both generations live together in one house. Therefore, the younger generation cannot feel this strong sense of community that once existed. From this, I think that the younger generation is involved in several other activities to help their communities.\n\nFirst, there are a lot of teenagers who help the church or the local administration, for example, during elections. I have some friends doing that, and I can say that the work they do there is really admirable. Second, there are many teenagers who are involved in fighting against environmental problems. These activities are really beneficial to the local community because they help to achieve a sustainable lifestyle. The last point is that many students are working hard for school or university. That does not only mean that they want to achieve professional success, but they also want to improve life at school or university for themselves and for all other students.\n\nNow, let me talk about a point I've just mentioned: the hard work for school or university. Of course, this means that they have to spend a lot of time learning and not directly helping their community. But I think that learning is the best way to achieve a good life for the whole community. The young generation knows that without working hard, they won't be able to achieve a good life for their community, for example, if there are no skilled workers in town, the economy and finally the whole community will suffer a lot.\n\nFinally, you could say that it's not true that young people today do not spend enough time to help their community. As we've seen, young people engage in a lot of activities in order to help their community, but they do this differently than the generations before."}
{"file_id": "1053966.txt", "output_essay": "I do agree with the following statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. It is a known fact that in today's society, the word 'community' is not as usual anymore. It surely still has a strong meaning in the villages or small towns, but if you look at bigger cities, you will find most people living alone without even knowing their neighbor's name. \n\nEspecially, the young people are not involved in the communities, so actually giving time to helping their communities probably does not occur to them at all. One problem is definitely that young people already grow into a society that does not really care about society anymore. So, they do not really have a chance to learn how to be part of a society, and that being part of a society, in this case, a community, also involves being motivated to give something back to it. \n\nOf course, they are supposed to learn it at school, but if the parents do not care, then the children will keep it the same way. Another problem is that young people often have a lot of other stuff on their minds. Like going to town with friends or to a disco. Working for your community is not really considered as 'cool,' and your friends might even start making fun of you if you start giving your free time to help your community. \n\nAt last, helping your community normally means working for it as a volunteer, so you will not gain any money for it. Many young people who want to finance their lives or have a bit extra will invest their time doing something they will be paid for. \n\nAll these reasons show why young people do not invest enough time into their communities. But it would be so important that they would do so. First of all, your community is not just a couple of people living at the same pace on this planet but can be a wonderful social network that might help you in hard times. But if you want to be part of it, you will have to get to know the people and be part of the team. That is only possible if you show that you are interested in your community and really try to be part of it. Communities also have a lot of financial problems. So, they need volunteers working for them so everybody can keep the standard of living people now have. Young people tend to believe things would just be given to them without thinking about the work behind it. If the people giving time to their communities become less, things will start to disappear. Probably, young people then will wonder where the bus went driving kids to school or where the mall comes from where there used to be a park. All these reasons make it so important that young people start to learn how to be an active part of the community and why it is so important that they start giving time to helping their communities."}
{"file_id": "1058201.txt", "output_essay": "Broadening knowledge of many academic subjects is much better than specializing in one specific subject in my opinion. Not only because it will be more interesting, but also because people will benefit more if the subjects are varied.\n\nThe main reason that broadening knowledge is more helpful is that people will be aware of many things in this world. They can expand their knowledge in an easy way too. If the subjects are limited, a lot of people won't care to know about other things in the world or in the kingdom where we live in. They will be satisfied to have the information that is circulated around the environment they live in. I can't judge and say that all people will have poor knowledge, but I'm sure that the majority won't have that good knowledge. In other words, our society will be weak.\n\nAlso, if knowledge is limited to only one subject, scientists wouldn't have reached the success they have today. For example, if Newton didn't bother to expand his research on gravity and stayed on figuring out why the apple had fallen toward the ground, I don't think he would have known the formula of gravity at all. He could have spent his whole life thinking alone and not knowing the reason of gravity. I think that his effort in studying every single detail made him conclude the concept of gravity.\n\nIf I were given the choice in any university or in any school whether to study only my major or have additional subjects, I would choose to study both my major and other additional subjects. That way, I will not only be well-educated but also my mind will have a good understanding of the world which I'm living in."}
{"file_id": "1057251.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with the author's opinion that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. The present generation faces various challenges, working with too many responsibilities in a world of immense competition. They hardly have ample time to help their communities.\n\nMan's life today has changed tremendously with the advancement in science and technology. The more the changes over the years, the higher their aims have become, the greater the responsibilities to be carried out, and the greater are the accomplishments to be made. His needs have changed tremendously with the advancement in technology and science. This change has not made his life easier but also challenging to succeed.\n\nMan, irrespective of his age, is working harder than he was doing 20 years back. If we consider a small kid, he too is busy with his academic schedule, with a change in his syllabus, and the amount of material to be studied. He hardly finds time for his co-curricular activities. If a teenager is considered, he is busy making a career for himself. A middle-aged man is quite occupied in improving his skills or standards of living. It's only a retired person who seemingly has time for activities but lacks enough energy.\n\nThe change in technology over the past few years has brought a change not only in man's life, making things easier for him, but also in his way of thinking. Today, even a small kid thinks about what advantages he can get for sacrificing something. Every individual is more focused on what he or she can become, how much can he or she earn, and how to make more profits. They lead a very mechanical life where they mainly believe in the famous saying, 'Time is Money.'\n\nThey would not like to spend their time on something that does not benefit them in terms of money or luxury. As considered in management science theory, man's social needs come only after his financial needs.\n\nIn such a society, people hardly think about their communities and take out some time to help their communities. Therefore, the author's opinion about young people not having time to help their communities is very much agreeable."}
{"file_id": "1059882.txt", "output_essay": "I don't agree that human beings will have fewer cars in use than we have today. There are two reasons that I think so.\n\nOne of the reasons is that more and more, our populations are increasing in number because of the explosion of the population all over the world. This is to say, our population is 6.0 billion right now, and it will increase up to 6.5 in twenty years or more. Therefore, the car usage percentage will increase in number.\n\nAnother reason is that our social attitude toward young people has changed. Comparing the past with now, the latter is much more liberal to young people. As long as 50 years ago, in many countries, cars were driven by men, not women, but nowadays, a lot of women drive cars because of the social change from conservative to liberal. The age at which people are able to get a driver's license differs country to country, and in certain countries, young people who are 16 years old are able to get a driver's license. With the social change, some of our countries might have such a law.\n\nWith these reasons, I don't agree that, but even though we will have more cars in our future, the fuel will totally change, from oil to electricity or something like that."}
{"file_id": "1055820.txt", "output_essay": "The word advertisement comes from the root 'advert', which means 'to draw attention'. The central motive of all advertisements is, in fact, to get considerable attention. And the advertisements generally go beyond a simple enumeration of product features. They try to make a product look much better than it really is. I totally agree with the statement.\n\nWhile advertisements today are much more sophisticated than they were a few decades ago, the chief theme of an advertisement was always to get more public attention, so that the products could sell better. Initially, in the 70s or 80s, only the features of a product and customer testimonials were greatly exaggerated. This made a product look much better than it really was. Inflated customer testimonials helped create a sense of a happy consumer. While such techniques were already creating a sense of false product perception, it is only in the past one or two decades that advertising has become so complex and sophisticated.\n\nPeople, children and adults are beguiled by the aura that modern advertisement creates about a product. This aura is better known as 'The Brand' among marketing and advertising firms. These modern advertisements basically create implicit associations of certain product types with certain behaviors in the consumer's mind. Associations like - if you drive 'Car Z8', you are cool. Or if you use certain perfumes, you will be much more attractive to the opposite sex. These associations create illusions in front of consumers, hence ensuring that they cannot make rational and logical choices about products.\n\nMoreover, with such advertising, it is no longer necessary for a product to be good in order to be commercially successful. A regular garment line with similar designs could command twice the price with a celebrity endorsement. Such techniques ensure that consumers and manufacturing companies ignore what is really important - the product, and not its aura.\n\nAlso, this false image contributes to what is called mad consumerism. People getting insane to get certain products is not good for society. With advertisements and branding, people are sometimes unable to separate the wheat from the chaff. What is really important and what is just a fake?\n\nI strongly believe that advertisements make a product look much better using various methods. However, such marketing does harm to society in general, and consumers in particular."}
{"file_id": "1057810.txt", "output_essay": "Well, it's a kind of statement that can be made just to encourage kids to learn more and new things in their life. But as the saying goes, 'All that glitters is not gold'; the same can be applied to successful people as well. The fundamental cause of this problem is not in the people we talk about, but it's within us. It is because we always measure a successful person only when his/her work achieves more recognition, fame, and/or money, and that he/she is really worth something, which most of us are not. Thus, it's very hard to judge and measure success in terms of money or fame or recognition, as for him, it's just a task he wanted to accomplish for himself.\n\nLet's consider a sport, say soccer. We know that some of the players do play very well compared to the rest of the players of that game, but in reality, they only play those games which they practiced for years without having to gain success in other games. The very same way, we cannot just say the founder of Microsoft has been a very successful person as he did not do anything apart from being in the business of providing software for computers. I wonder how much of knowledge or expertise he would have in the area of mining; the same would be the case in the designer ware and clothing segment of business. Interestingly, there was an argument that Walmart or the other chain stores should be considered successful people. I would opine against the people as well in terms of success, as what they had been doing is that of selling.\n\nI definitely would have said some person successful if he would have achieved a good name and money in the area of selling, also gaining the same momentum in other areas such as manufacturing and in research. Thus, I would rather say that some people remain successful even when they try new things."}

But do the advertisers tell the truth or do they lie or exaggerate about their 'perfect' products? This is exactly what the given statement is about.\n\nI agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. For example, laundry detergents. Every brand claims to be the best product, to make your clothes look like new, to remove every single stain. They compete in comparing their products to each other. And their product is always better than that of the competitors. But, in my belief, this is not true. Some advertisements say that they don't bleach your clothes, that they still look like new after 30 wash cycles. But no detergent can hold this statement.\n\nAnother example is shampoo. If you would trust the advertisements, every shampoo can make your hair shiny, strong, and even not greasy anymore. But this is so untrue. Shampoos often don't hold the consumer's expectations.\n\nMy last example is cigarettes. In advertisements, cigarettes seem to make you feel free, that they make you happy when you are sad. They even make you feel like you are in another world. But is this really true? Doesn't it have any disadvantages or even dangers?\n\nOf course, it does! Only a few years ago, no cigarette advertisement said that cigarettes affect your health and that they can cause cancer that sometimes ends in death. Today, they warn their customers in advertisements and even on cigarette boxes, but it is usually written in a very little size and so often ignored or not seen by consumers. Some consumers take these warnings ironically.\n\nIn conclusion, you always have to be aware that advertisers try to sell their product to earn a lot of money. That's why they sometimes exaggerate or even lie about what their products are able to do. And if so, it makes you should be careful and you should buy different products to compare them to each other and to think about how they can harm yourself or others. Only then will you find out which products are the best for you or which products you shouldn't even buy because of their harm."}

Due to the increase in companies and their products, each one wants to increase their share and dominate the market. Advertisements seem to play a key role in the sale of the product.\n\nI agree with the fact that advertisements make products seem better than they actually are. In order to trap customers, companies show their products in a great manner, giving great publicity and employing celebrities to promote them. Ultimately, when a customer buys the product, what happens? The customer feels cheated and becomes red with anger towards the company.\n\nFor example, it was told that a company, as part of their publicity stunt to have an upper hand over their competitors, produced a bike that would give a mileage of 120km per liter of petrol to attract customers. However, they had hidden the truth that they had overstated the mileage. Many customers bought the bike, and when they practically experienced it by riding, they felt that the product was underperforming. They went to the company and asked for the facts, but the company officials' response was not up to the mark of what the customers expected. They went to the consumer court and got their money back.\n\nIn the above-stated example, the case gives a very good insight into the topic. It is right that the company lost a lot of money in paying back and instead got a bad reputation. Any person wouldn't even think of having that company's product. The company feels that publicity is everything; they think that seeing is believing. They are in that vision and advertise hugely on the qualities and standards that the product does not accomplish. But in reality, seeing is not everything; we might believe, usually we should not believe in everything we see.\n\nCompanies should be transparent and should advertise what the product really has in order to have a long-term good relationship with the customer and maintain a good name for the company."}

First of all, when you are young, you do not have the same pleasures as when you are old. On one hand, when you are young, you enjoy your life in the current moment. Indeed, during your studies, you prefer to go out with friends, do sports, and discover new things by traveling. However, on the other hand, when you are older, you enjoy different things in life. Indeed, you want to get married, have children, buy a nice house, go on holidays with all your family, and succeed at work.\n\nSecondly, the responsibilities of a student are totally different compared to an older person. Indeed, as a student, you do not have many responsibilities because, in most cases, you do not have a child to take care of and you depend a little on your parents who help you financially. The main responsibility of a student is to have good marks and succeed in their studies. When you are older, you have much more responsibilities. If you have a family, you have to take care of them by working, buying food, and paying bills. Having responsibilities as an adult may enable them to enjoy life less. However, having responsibilities can be a good thing for some adults because they think they are useful.\n\nFinally, young people can enjoy life less than older people do because they generally have less money. If you are a student, it is more difficult for you to go on holidays or go regularly to the cinema. In most cases, students have to work and go to the university at the same time in order to pay for their distractions and their university. Contrary, older people do not have to work and study at the same time, and generally, they have a better salary.\n\nTo conclude, when you are a student or when you are an adult, you enjoy life differently because their life situation is different."}

For example, in World War II, some countries said that their country did the right thing, and on the other hand, their enemy said that they just defended their country, so they were right. I can give more examples, but I want to try to explain this example; if you want to do something, you have to have a reason, so it cannot change from person to person, so it is real. But everybody has an angle to look at the situation; everybody can say, 'I am right,' and this is their idea, but nobody can change the facts.\n\nIf I want to learn something, I really have to know the facts. Of course, we should learn the concepts and understand the ideas, but these are not the main things. Because I want to have my own opinion about something. However, concepts are important to create an idea, but if you learn facts, you can imagine the concept and make your own truths.\n\nUnfortunately, this is really difficult; a lot of people choose to accept another person's right. But not me. If we live in a democracy, we have to decide our own way; we can choose our idea and concept.

The last thing is, I read a lot of things about the U.S., but when I went there, I saw the real U.S., and it was not the same as my past opinion.

Latin is really similar to math, and it can permit you to elaborate more sophisticated concepts when you know how to use words or sentences in a logical way.

I didn't learn specific and practical arguments like math, physics, or geometry, but I learned to think.\n\nDuring my university time, at the Architectural School in Milan, I found out how much my professor's statement was true because I didn't get any problems studying really difficult arguments like math, structure, calculation, etc. because my mind was able to process every kind of data, even if they were different from what I studied at high school.\n\nFor this reason, I think it's really important for every student, with every kind of personal background and goal, to understand and to learn how to understand ideas and concepts instead of just merely learning facts.\n\nWhen you are able to understand an idea or a concept, you can approach these things with a critical view, elaborate them, and create a personal view about them, and not just learn facts without understanding why they happened, which reason generated them.\n\nFor students, their future is the most important thing, and understanding ideas and concepts will give them specific skills to approach every kind of problem in life."}

Today, community services and charity work are done much more organized compared to way back then.\n\nIn conclusion, the conditions of today and past generations are very different from each other. Although it may be seen that youth spend less time helping their communities, they still play a significant role in helping it."}

I do not think so. I believe that at each stage of your existence, you 'enjoy life' in a different way.\n\nFirst, when you are young, you have no children. One can consider that, as he has no constraints such as feeding his offspring, he is more enjoying life. But I think that I will be deeply happy when my child grows up and becomes an autonomous human being. At that time, despite all the constraints, I think that I will 'enjoy life'.\n\nIn addition, when you are young, even if you entertain yourself playing tennis, for example, you cannot do everything you want. You have to respect your parents' rules. Being an adult allows you to choose your activities and experience new leisure. For example, my mother used to prevent me from swimming because she was afraid of water. I discovered this sport quite late, but now I really enjoy it. Moreover, when you are older, you start appreciating new activities. When I was young, I found highly bizarre the idea of watching paintings for hours. But now I am fond of art exhibitions! In the meantime, I learned to enjoy life in a different manner.\n\nBeing older also enables you to have a professional life. You can manage to reach great achievements and be financially rewarded for it. When I received my first income, I was really happy! The idea of making money just using my brain still thrills me. It is a way of enjoying life that I never thought about when I was in my early ages.\n\nIn a nutshell, I think that being happy and enjoying life is not a matter of age. It is more an ability to enjoy the best moments and learn from the worst. I hope to be happy with such a philosophy of life!"}

You will have to give up many other important things. You will not have enough time to play sports, and your health will be worse. Otherwise, you will not have enough time to communicate with your family and friends. You will feel lonely after a long period.\n\nSecondly, even if you have spent so much time working hard and you have broad knowledge of many academic subjects finally. But probably, you only know some common information of many academic subjects and are not good at one special subject. For example, a physician who knows many pieces of knowledge about history, computer, plants, and so on. He must not have had enough time to study his medical knowledge, so he will not be a good physician. Otherwise, if everyone has broad knowledge of many academic subjects. In the result, they can do all kinds of jobs, but they cannot do them very well.\n\nIn conclusion, I think people should have special knowledge in one specific subject and review broad knowledge of many academic subjects but not spend too much time on them.

Advertisements are produced to promote a product and to make it sell better. So, what do we do if we want people to buy our product? We try to tell them that our product is the best choice on the market, which may not be true, but people need to believe it to choose our product. That is the reason why many advertisements make their products seem much better than they actually are. In our everyday lives, we are confronted with many examples. My favorite example is the washing powder advertisements on television. Wouldn't it be wonderful to put your clothes in the washing machine and, when taking them out again, all the ugly stains are gone and the clothes look newer than before? I have tried several times, but it just does not work. So, there, the advertisements definitely make the washing powder seem much better than it is. Another product that has to be incredible according to advertisements is energy bars for sports. You do not only get an inhuman power and condition, but the bar turns your outer appearance into an athlete's body. 'This is much cheaper than the fitness studio,' I thought and tried. But again, I was disappointed. Neither did my condition improve, nor did my body shape change. Disillusioned about advertisements' promises, I resigned, until recently, when I heard Ovomaltine's new publicity. The advertisement of the chocolate powder to flavor your milk does not claim to make you stronger, but more enduring. It says: 'Ovomaline - not better, but longer.' So, this is the one and only exception I have seen in my life, where an advertisement does not make a product seem much better than it is."}

I believe that young people enjoy life if that means going to parks or beaches and practicing extreme and difficult sports. Young people can stay late at night, drinking or dancing, but they also can wake up early in the morning and go to work. They don't have limits on how much risk and danger they take. Many young people receive economic support from their parents, and that gives them more time to enjoy. Parents always try to give their kids the lifestyle they never enjoyed. The society and the process of evolution in technology also give an advantage to young people to experience new ways of enjoying life. Young people don't focus too much on the future; they just want to live and enjoy the present.\n\nOn the other hand, there are old people who feel the weight of life in their bodies. Even if they take good care of their bodies, older people can't practice sports or social life for long periods of time. Sometimes that's not really important because everything in excess is bad. Older people see life from another point of view. They do the same things as young people, but not with the same intensity. They discover the beauty of life and develop the quality of looking for details. The details give you the ability to recognize when someone or something is special. Seeing the quality versus quantity when you give or receive is an art that needs to be cultivated. The precious reality in this situation is that everyone is going to experience at some point in their life both sides of human nature. I am a 37-year-old male with a Latin tradition. I love my Lord Jesus, and I believe that at this point in my life, I identify with the old people. I prefer quality versus quantity."}

And we can't live anywhere without seeing cars running on the streets, whereas we can use some alternative transportation such as trains, tubes, and motorbikes. Many people have started working towards schools caring about their health. Using cars regularly or using another way to transport, both of them have their advantages. It's difficult to guess in twenty years which will be more likely, that there will be fewer cars or not. But if I had to predict our life in twenty years, I wouldn't say there would be fewer cars than now. I disagree with the idea the test had given me. There are some reasons underneath.\n\nFirstly, having cars is one of the popular habits among men. After working hard to earn enough money to buy a cool car, they show how cool their cars are by driving through cities. It might be like their dream to buy a good car.\n\nSecondly, Toyota, which is known for being the leading company in Japan, has been making a big profit and provides Japan with a lot of profits. Now we can say it's necessary for our economy in Japan. In short, we can see the fact that there will still be lots of demand in twenty years.\n\nThirdly, for families, I'll recommend going on a trip by car because it helps them feel closer more than staying at home. On holiday, even if they get stuck in a traffic jam, they can have a good conversation. Using cars is a good enjoyment.\n\nIn conclusion, for those reasons above, I disagree with the idea the question gave me. Of course, on the other hand, we have to think about our environment more carefully."}

Since I was a kid, I understood that I had goals, the ones that made me work and continue through school and college. I experienced a lot of things, which made me the man I am today. I took risks during that time, like moving from my town to get a better education, but at the same time, I continued with the same goals and doing what I did best, maths and sciences.\n\nI understand that people do both, they take risks while they do what they know how to do well. For example, a story about a guy who knows how to sell TVs to people. After doing that for a long-time period for a ``X'' company, he realized that he could do that kind of job with his own company, and he quit the job. Then he started his own company named after his son's name. That was the huge risk he took, but he understood that people like him had choices, and that he would be successful because he knows how to do the job.\n\nWith that story, an integration of risks and experiences can be observed. He does know where he is good at, and he uses that to try new things. My experience tells me that I should integrate both, while they are acceptable. My life is made about experiences, and each day I take risks to keep living.\n\nOverall, I do not agree with the statement ``Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.'' People are the owners of their actions, and the success will depend on it. A person can be successful by just doing what they know how to do, or by trying new things, which will take them again to the point of doing what they know how to do.\n\nI know that my future is around sciences, but I do know that I have to take risks to achieve my professional goal, to be a Meteorologist. I have to move from my home country, knowing that it is for my own good. That's the biggest risk I will experience next year, while at the same time, I know how to talk to people, make new friends, and take the best from every opportunity I encounter. Success is around the corner and should be experienced with new things or by just doing what they do best."}
{"file_id": "1059581.txt", "output_essay": "The definition of enjoyment, the very feeling that brings you joy and happiness, may differ from one individual to another. Even though most people enjoy their life in their own way, I agree with the claim that young people enjoy life more than older people do.\n\nThere are various reasons for the opinion I share. Firstly, young people are much healthier and more energetic in contrast to older people. A lot of activities that an individual may enjoy require physical energy. This physical energy diminishes with age in most people. They have to worry about their health at all times since it deteriorates with age. They might have a particular activity that they enjoy, but it may be restricted due to different reasons. For example, an older person who enjoys listening to good music may have a problem with their hearing due to age. Such people are highly dependent on medication, which has its share of side effects, such as drowsiness, etc. On the contrary, young people have all the energy in the world to enjoy. They do not get tired easily. They are very enthusiastic and in the best of health at most times. Their lifestyle is at a faster pace compared to the older generation.\n\nYoungsters can indulge in adventure sports, traveling, partying, eating, and drinking without any restrictions, which would be troublesome for the aged. Secondly, young people are far more independent than older people. They are not dependent on somebody to take care of them. Nor are they dependent on asking someone to drive them somewhere. Moreover, the older generation spends a lot of time worrying about trivial issues and restrict themselves from experimenting. They are more orthodox in comparison to the younger generation and consider a lot of things that youngsters refer to as enjoyment as taboo. The older generation, by far, has more value for money and believes in saving it for a later day. Youngsters, on the other hand, may use up that money for luxury or for a pleasure activity that will assure them a feeling of fun and happiness.\n\nI conclude the essay by restating my opinion that young people enjoy more in life, and I'm sure most older people would also claim to having enjoyed more in their youth."}

It is true that it is easier to work on tasks with numerous strategies that are already discovered. However, I strongly believe that real successful people try new things and take as many risks as they need.\n\nTo begin with, although money is not always the best material to measure one's success, most of the billionaires started something on their own for the first time. Bill Gates created the Microsoft program for people's efficiency in using computers at affordable costs before anybody else thought of it. To pursue that business, he had to drop out of Harvard University and concentrate only on his new business. It must have been a hard choice to do so, since Harvard is an extremely competitive school to get into. Now Bill Gates is one of the richest men in the world.\n\nMy own father is another good example of the same situation. Born to a poor family, he entered the hardest medical school in my hometown in South Korea with his own efforts. However, he changed his major to engineering, giving up the easy way to success by staying in the medical school. After studying in the engineering school, he pioneered biomedical engineering and became the first doctor of biomedical engineering in Korea by founding the subject in his college. If he had not done this, he was sure to be a medical person, but not the first biomedical engineer in the nation.\n\nI myself have already taken one big risk in order to be successful - coming to America. I could have continued my education in the institutions of high level in my native country, as a selected student in science in previous years. Yet, I had a strong desire to try new things with the cost of risking what might seem to be important in a certain moment, and still do. Of course, there are many obstacles I need to overcome, but I believe it will pay off if I try hard enough, just like Bill Gates and my dad did in their youth."}
{"file_id": "1061074.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with the statement that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. The producers are using the latest trends of marketing, advertising, and promoting their products. Some of the common methods used are promotions, product launch offers, door-to-door selling, discounts, etc. All these methods motivate the consumer to purchase these goods without even knowing what the good is actually made of or what its actual function is.\n\nAdvertisements make the product look really appealing and user-friendly. For example, an ad for a car would usually include the car speeding away really fast and highlight the interior technology and luxury of the car. However, what the ad does not tell the consumers is that speeding away causes accidents, technology advances every day, etc.\n\nA good ad should be planned in a manner that shows the use of the car, that is, how it can help not only you but also other people and even the environment. If the ad for the car displayed the comfort, the space available in the car, etc., it would be more useful for the people.\n\nAdvertising is taking over the marketing sector tremendously. Ads in forms of banners, flyers, stalls, etc. are providing all the information to the people, and these methods make sure that the consumer looks at the product in a positive manner.\n\nUsually, the quality, functioning, and looks of a product are quite different from what they appear on an ad, and this makes the consumer suffer. Some of the ads provide us with information we don't need, and some of them display material that offends people culturally, religiously, or makes them feel at a low status in society. For example, an ad for underwear would display the man wearing it and running behind a horse, which is not true.\n\nI conclude this essay to ensure that people are aware of what they consume and how it is going to affect them or others, or whether it would still be of any help for the consumer in the future."}

Although I think it is not always true, and each case should be considered a part, I agree with this statement for several different reasons.\n\nNowadays, we are living in a world much more competitive than the past one was. Furthermore, a family is today normally composed only of parents and sons, and this fact does not help young people to develop their sense of community.\n\nFirst of all, the world where we are living is getting more and more complex: for a young person, it is more difficult today to achieve his or her goals, to have a successful career and a good job in order to give safety to his or her new family. This fact implies that today, there is generally not enough time to spend on taking care of someone else, like their communities.\n\nThe second problem is related to the normal structure of a family. Living in such a small unit does not permit developing, from childhood, a sense of community and solidarity for other persons.\n\nIf someone is used to living in a family with many brothers and sisters, and also grandparents, uncles, and aunts, he would be maybe more sensitive to the problems of others.\n\nIn conclusion, I have to agree with the statement that says that today young people do not spend much time on helping their communities for the reasons that I explained before. I've said 'I HAVE to agree' because I think this is not a positive fact, and it gives a bad idea about young people, but, with sorrow, I have to say that this is the truth."}
{"file_id": "1061257.txt", "output_essay": "Learning facts is undeniably a necessity for all students of all ages. That is even the first thing that a child is asked when he enters school. He learns rules, such as standing straight and in line before entering a class, or not walking around while the teacher is giving a lesson. Those rules are transferred to him before the notion of good and bad; he understands the consequence of his actions earlier than the reasons for their necessity and acts consequently. In our school systems, learning prevails upon assimilating, at least at the beginning.\n\nThe expectations necessarily evolve with the age of the students. In higher grades, it becomes almost impossible to learn by heart without understanding. Assimilating a concept is likely to develop the cleverness of a student, while learning will only fill his memory. As school is supposed to teach children how to think, learning becomes of lesser importance from a certain age.\n\nYet, learning is still necessary for exams, for proving one's ability to memorize combined with one's intelligence. Also, as it is the only means by which one can assess a student's motivation at work and ability to memorize, learning cannot be neglected as a key factor in a student's success and in a whole school system.\n\nFor a student's personal development, understanding concepts and ideas is obviously more important and almost necessary, but it doesn't suppress the learning part, which is much more easily assessed on a copy, for example.\n\nThis raises the question of the role of school. Indeed, if it is only supposed to insert people into their future professions, the ability to learn fast and a lot inevitably prevails. But school is also supposed to be the fundamental pillar of a nation, as it structures people's minds and is therefore essential in a democracy, for example."}
{"file_id": "1061634.txt", "output_essay": "The reasons for success are multiple. On one hand, many people think that to be successful, we need to find new solutions, anticipate new trends, and, by the way, take risks. On the other hand, people tend to think that experience prevails and that the best way to succeed is to focus on and master what you are already able to do. In my opinion, success is directly linked to the risks you are able to take.\n\nIn the business world, one of the most usual words to explain the success of a company is 'innovation.' Nowadays, clients or shareholders are attracted by companies that take risks by offering really new products. The world is moving and changing; the company that will survive is the company that is able to anticipate new social or economic trends. For example, easyJet is very successful because this firm understood and analyzed the trends of 'low-cost' before anyone else. It was risky compared to the traditional and expensive offer. But finally, easyJet or RyanAir are the most popular.\n\nIndeed, it is quite important to focus on one specialty to be the best in what we do. Nonetheless, people who give priority to experience are more static in their way of thinking and have a weak ability of adaptation toward a changing environment. People who take risks, for example, in an artistic activity, will be awarded because they go against a kind of conformism. This is exactly what we are looking for in a globalized economy. To be successful, we need to be 'different' and take risks for that.\n\nTo conclude, exploring new fields brings new ideas of business. Risks are the basis of success. Simply, we can say that 'who dares, wins,' and even if your objective is not to succeed, risks are important in life because they spice up our daily life."}

However, I think it is true that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.\n\nFirst of all, we should know what an advertisement is - a way to sell the products a company makes. Therefore, the advertisement has to make the products attractive to people, which is a main reason that leads people to decide whether to buy it or not. For example, if you want to sell cookies, you may want more and more people to buy them, so you have to catch people's eyes. You may need to use some technology to improve your cookie's features. Like the color, it should be more bright, or make a suggestion on how to eat this cookie in the best way. Thereby, it is impossible to just use the original features of your cookie to make its advertisements. So, you have to make your cookie seem much better than it really is.\n\nAlso, there is an interesting thing - advertisements may trick kids into being interested in the products, like transformer advertisements. In that advertisement, you will see that transformers can fly. We all know that is impossible because transformers do not even exist. So, when you buy a transformer for your children, they may be disappointed about this toy because it is different from what they saw in the transformer's advertisement. That is another reason why advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.\n\nBesides that, competition is another reason why advertisements make products seem much better than they really are, because this is a competitive society, and all businessmen are compared with others. So, advertisements are another way to improve their business, and sometimes they may focus on the effect of advertisements instead of the quality of the products. When you watch the advertisement, you may have a desire to buy it, which only proves that the advertisement of products affects you, but not the real products, because before you want to buy it, you may have never even used or tasted the products before.\n\nFrom what has been discussed above, we could safely draw the conclusion that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are."}

They spend too much time studying their classes, waste much of their time on personal enjoyment, and do not understand the real meaning of helping their communities.\n\nAs a fact, the parents in Taiwan always want their children to have good academic achievement more than other things. They want their young people to study again and again and do not expect them to pay any attention or spend much time on other things except reading and studying. As a result, the young people will not spend much time on other things, such as helping their communities.\n\nThe young people are still like children, so they prefer to play, such as spending their time playing computer games or watching TV in an air-conditioned room during their vacation or off-school time, rather than helping their communities outside the door, especially in hot summer weather in Taiwan.\n\nFor example, my nephew is a teenager, but he did not know anything about the community where he lived for more than ten years. He prefers to talk to his friends by cell phone and have a date with his girlfriend. He spends his time helping his community only when his high school asks him to hand out a report about his service in his community, and the report will be graded. Except for this, when I suggested that he may have a community service in our community, he was surprised that I had such a strange idea that he never had.\n\nIn conclusion, it has become a common social phenomenon that young people do not give enough time to help their communities because their parents and the whole community did not facilitate them to help their communities and give a good reward, helping them to understand the real meaning of helping their communities. As such, the young people are losing their recognition of their own communities."}

Actually, it might be helpful to have many types of knowledge, but objectively, that is unnecessary compared to specializing in one specific subject. Anyone can have many other types of knowledge by using some time. But if you specialize in one specific subject, then you will get more specific knowledge that other people do not know about. It is more useful to have this knowledge. For example, let's say you are the owner of a company and you want to hire someone for the marketing section, and there are two people: one who went to a university and another who went to a specific business college. Who would you hire for your business? I am not saying that the university person is bad, but objectively, I would hire the specific business college graduate. Because I want the person who has an idea of a specific section, which is business, and who has lots of knowledge in the field. And not only is my question like that, but also the real world is like that. There are lots of people who have achieved success in their field, such as the CEO of Microsoft, who not only was good at it but also specialized in one specific subject. Maybe having broad knowledge of many academic subjects will help you decide your field, but if you have your goal already, then I suggest having knowledge in one thing.

I think that there could be an increase in the number of cars used, depending on the policies issued. I say so because with the ever-increasing development in technology, there is a reduction in prices of the previous models, and certain additional features are being added in the new cars, which would only be a dream a few years earlier.\n\nMoreover, the notion of a car being a necessity rather than a luxury thing is changing, as even members of not-so-affluent families or well-to-do families also own cars. This change could be attributed to various factors, such as easy payment options given by the car manufacturers or the installments given by them. The other reasons could also be that the willingness of the bank authorities to give various loans for the purchase of cars or for the changes to be made in cars.\n\nAnother reason could be that the company's exchange offers, which say that you can exchange your old car for a new one for an additional payment, which keeps on increasing the sales of the cars.\n\nPlus, there are additional benefits of using a car, which make it hard to resist or abandon it. The benefits of the car are that you can go with your family wherever you want and at whatever time, plus it is useful in cases of emergency. More than the benefits, cars are usually associated with social status. That there is ever an increase in the demand for a new car with certain added features that its precedent is not having. Then, there are cars that hold special status as being the royal cars or having your own vintage collection.\n\nBasically, you can reach different destinations according to your own schedule at your own speed. Nowadays, there is a whole lot of variety being offered, wherein special additional features are built-in, like conference room settings or bedroom settings. With such offers, it has a lot of benefits for the people who are really busy and can't afford to waste time.\n\nWell, with so many benefits, it's really hard to think that there will be a decline in the number of cars in the near future. With the benefits, there are also certain disadvantages, like the gas emitted from the exhaust of the cars is polluting the environment, and that the fuel used for the functioning of the car is depleting the natural resources. Well, for the fact that cars are increasing air pollution, with the development in technology, various models are being developed which do not emit any dangerous gases in the atmosphere, and for the second disadvantage, that they are using energy resources, new cars are being developed, and some have already been developed, which use solar energy as fuel or run on electrical energy.\n\nThus, with so many advantages, I think the demand for the increase in cars will outnumber its decrease, or there won't be any drastic change in the number of cars in the near future. Thus, I think that in the near future, there will be an additional number of cars than there are today."}

Here are my reasons: More and more people are concerned about the polluted environment, and not only do governments decide to pass bills that can protect our natural environment, but people also reduce the damage to our environment. And cars are one of the vital contributors to this pollution, because they release carbon dioxide. If people reduce driving cars by themselves and instead use mass transportation, the amount of carbon dioxide, which is a vital reason that causes pollution, can be eliminated. So I think there will be fewer cars than today.\n\nSecond, cities are developing gradually, and more and more cities will have their mass transportation, such as MRT, trains, or buses. These useful developments can provide a more economical way to transport for citizens. In order to save money and priceless time, people will choose to use mass transportation rather than drive cars by themselves. For example, although many of my teachers have their own cars, they only drive cars by themselves on rainy days. Because the MRT in our city provides a cheaper and comfortable journey for us, and they do not need to drive.\n\nIn addition, the expenditure to maintain a car is very big. For example, the expenditure of gasoline, the tax on cars, etc. This huge expenditure would affect the willingness of people to have a car.\n\nFinally, the crowded traffic situation would also make people not want to drive cars by themselves. And there is still a big problem for drivers: finding a parking space is extremely hard.\n\nTo sum up, the idea of environmental protection, more convenient mass transportation, the expenditure of having a car, avoiding getting stuck in a traffic jam, worrying about how to find a parking space on time, all of these considerations would make fewer and fewer people plan to have their own cars."}

In each part of life, people can enjoy their life, but each part differs from the other in terms of the enjoyment of life. Some people say that young people enjoy life more than older people do, and it's true to say that.\n\nFor young people, we can see that they enjoy life more than older people because they are still young and new to exploring life. They have new things to see and learn in life, and they are free to go everywhere. They will have many new opportunities to choose their life, make friends, go out partying, participate in real life, and join service groups or political groups, for example. They will share in political life, have their opinion, and decide what they want to be in their future life, such as an engineer. They will join the university, dream about their future life, and really enjoy life when they fall in love and dream about making a family.\n\nAt the same time, older people enjoy life in many ways. When they remember their own life that has passed and the things they did, they will see their family growing up, and especially, they will be happy when they carry their children's children. They will absolutely be enjoying life. After retirement, older people will enjoy their life, being free to do things like going fishing or hunting, for example. In the same time, they will have problems, but they will still enjoy life with the rest.\n\nFinally, all young or old people will enjoy their life in different ways, but we can say that young people enjoy life more than older people do because they have many different ways to enjoy it than older people have."}
{"file_id": "1066453.txt", "output_essay": "I disagree with the opinion that in twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. I will raise the reasons in the following passages.\n\nFirst, as one of the Japanese and a citizen of a developed country, I think there are possibilities that the number of cars in use will be reduced. This is because, particularly in cities, people can transport easily without a car thanks to the sophistication of the network among trains, subways, and buses. And I think that in the suburbs, similar methods of transportation will also develop. However, what I want to say here is that the opinion I mentioned now is too narrow to think globally.\n\nSecond, I think we must think more globally. On earth, there are many countries that want to be more developed. In these countries, I think the number of cars in use is increasing. The reason why developing countries will use more cars in the future is that, to develop their country's economic capacity, the need for cars will increase to transport many goods for commerce. I think transportation ability has a significant meaning to these countries.\n\nIn conclusion, to think about world development, I disagree with the opinion."}
{"file_id": "1063282.txt", "output_essay": "Who enjoys life more, young people or older people? In my opinion, I tend to say that older people enjoy life more. First of all, older people have much more leisure time than young people. As older people have already worked for a long time, they do not need to work as hard as young people. They do not need to struggle as hard for survival as young people do. As a result, older people have more leisure time than young people. With more leisure time, older people can travel, have holidays with their families, and do other activities. Imagine what young people are doing when older people are enjoying their lives. Students at universities may be busy writing their assignments, cramming for exams. Those who have jobs may be doing extra work in the office. How miserable they are!\n\nSecondly, older people have more money compared to young people, making them lead more comfortable lives. As older people have worked for a longer time than young people, they earn more money and have more savings, which can make them afford long-distance travel to Paris, to Rome, or even to space, depending on their financial ability. However, young people can only enjoy short trips and some hiking. Though no one can deny the interest that short trips and hiking can bring, they cannot be comparable to those brought by romantic travel abroad.\n\nThirdly, older people can manage their lives better than young people due to their longer living and social experiences. Older people know what is most important to them. They know that the enjoyment of life, instead of making money or working, is more important to them. They know the value of being together with their family members, so they try their best to accompany their wives or husbands. On the contrary, according to my knowledge, most young people do not realize what is important to them. They make every possible effort to make money and grasp every chance to get promoted in their workplaces, neglecting the happiness of being accompanied and accompanying their family members.\n\nIn conclusion, I think that older people enjoy life more because they have more time, more money, and they can manage their lives more effectively."}
{"file_id": "1065118.txt", "output_essay": "The following essay describes why I agree with the fact that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. Advertisements play a tremendous role in our lives. Let me first state my personal feelings about the situation in our society today. I am often irritated and confused when I see all the different advertisements. When I turn on the TV, read the daily newspaper, or even when I go outside for a run in the park, I am influenced by advertisements. Everywhere in the media and in the public, there are advertisements, and people are oversupplied and do not recognize them anymore. Therefore, in order to gain the attention of consumers, companies have to exaggerate in the advertisements. They praise their products extremely in order to be recognized by people. The competition is very hard due to the huge variety of products. The increasing significance of communication channels like the internet makes the competition even harder because people are now penetrated even more with advertisements and commercials. Only if the advertisement is extraordinary and special will people eventually buy the product. However, in reality, the product is not as good as the advertisement has promised. I have also been disappointed by a product that I bought several times. One example is the new iPhone, which promises to be much better than it really is. However, that is a very subjective impression because other people like the product and are satisfied. As a conclusion, one can say that the attitude towards a product is a very personal feeling and differs a lot."}

Scientists have been developing flying cars, and bigger and faster public transportation vehicles will be developed. However, I firmly disagree with the statement that there will be fewer cars in the next twenty years. There will be more population than today, and there will be many barriers to using those technologies actually.\n\nTo begin with, the growing number of population will make the world more complicated and complex, and each person will have their own car. Compared with the past, it is true that we have a lot more cars nowadays than in the past. For example, in Seoul, Korea, three out of ten had their own car even ten years ago. How about now? The percentage of possession is almost the same as in the past. However, the number of cars is five times more than in the 1990s.\n\nIn addition, twenty years are not enough time to develop some new technology and actually use it. The government has tried to make a new subway system and monorail system within ten years, but the thing was already twenty years ago. There is no change, and they have still been planning. For example, one of the experts from the government said last week that they were planning to adapt a new system for aircraft within five years. The essay for the next day, however, criticized that the government should finish the Air Force-military system changing plan, which had not been finished for ages. Also, it said, 'No more people in this country believe the government!'\n\nIn conclusion, we all hope that there will be fewer cars in the world in the future. It should be replaced by great public transportation, such as subways and buses. Also, the government should make the cost of flights much cheaper than now. However, I do not agree with the statement that there will be fewer cars in use than now in the next twenty years with all these reasons."}
{"file_id": "1062900.txt", "output_essay": "Advertisements are usually a particular kind of product developed from many people working together, each one with a different role and each one with different skills. Those people are paid by companies and they have a great interest in improving companies' profits, just because if they don't, they risk losing their jobs. I think this is enough to show how advertisements present products in a better way than they really are.\n\nFirst, when a company decides to spend money on advertisement, it's usually waiting for a reward from that. An advertisement campaign is costly. For this reason, they expect more people will buy the product in order to achieve a higher profit.\n\nThis is why people who produce advertisements have to attract more buyers than their competitors and so will try to present their products as the best products people can desire to buy. They must convince people that if they buy, they are doing the right choice.\n\nSecond, people who are paid to produce advertisements have a lot of different skills; they usually know a lot about marketing and they know who they are going to refer to sell the product.\n\nFor example, some days ago, I was in the library and I was really surprised when some boys and girls near me began to talk about a marketing research project they were developing. They didn't care at all about the quality of the product; they cared just about how to sell it. They tried to find the best way of convincing people and didn't care at all about being honest in the way they had to do that.\n\nMoreover, I can surely add some personal experience. For example, I've got an eleven-year-old sister who always asks my mom for many products she sees in advertisements. Sometimes my mother buys her the product she wants, and even if she spends a lot of money doing that, often they are not high-quality products. I noticed this can happen easily for products they sell to kids or teenagers, just because this public usually cares less about quality and more about how the product itself appears.\n\nIn conclusion, my opinion is that advertisement is often a way of earning more profits for companies or a way of creating a brand name. The market itself is competitive. How can they reveal the weaknesses of their products?"}

Unfortunately, when I use that brand, the magic didn't happen to me.\n\nFor many reasons, advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.\n\nThe first important reason is that when clients believe the advertisement, they will buy the product. The producer can earn much more money than before. A little more than fact, nothing is a big deal.\n\nThen, there is a lack of management from the government. Some medical and food advertisements have effects that are different from the advertising, and the end-users can be hurt or even die. But some products haven't been challenged yet and are still being produced without the government's control.\n\nAs a person working in advertising, I know this situation needs to be changed. With my workmates, we always try to persuade our clients, the producers, to accept the advertising concept 'The advertisement, the real fact.'\n\nWe can believe that with more government and people's support, no one will buy these products with no benefits, and the problem can be solved."}
{"file_id": "1064402.txt", "output_essay": "Older people usually consider young people of our generation as lazier and more self-centered than young people of their own generation. Although the origin of this belief is easy to understand in individualistic countries, I find it difficult to accept the idea that people nowadays don't give enough time to helping their communities.\n\nIndeed, I think that modern societies offer more structures and organizations to allow people to help the community indirectly. For instance, systems such as the social security system in France allow workers to help indirectly the people needing healthcare by paying taxes. If this idea does not seem to apply directly to young people, once again we can argue that young people are indirectly helping their communities. For instance, when they spend time working for school in order to get the needed skills to eventually find a job and contribute to the wealth of the country.\n\nSome people would argue, on the other hand, that governments of modern societies do not offer enough to the people who still need individual help, not only in terms of money, but mostly in terms of time. An example could be the lack of volunteers for the care of retired people needing personal help. If one approach consists in blaming the people having free time, like the young people, for their selfishness, an alternative attitude can be to look at who helps, and who doesn't help to change the situation. Modern societies probably reached this point of no-return where people got used to relying on the government for social issues. Therefore, it seems reasonable to give more credits to the people who actually act on the government - by the power of voting, by protesting, or taking part in the political life - so that social issues become a major concern.\n\nAs a conclusion, there are different ways of helping a community, and we can find, depending on the culture or the country, specific groups of young people who actually give time to make something useful, either by working hard at school, or by voting."}
{"file_id": "1064740.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with the statement, and I do think understanding ideas and concepts is really important for students. And I have three reasons.\n\nFirst, it's quite necessary to understand the ideas and knowledge when students first learn them. In this way, they learn more effectively than simply memorizing the facts we come across. Also, a good understanding of the knowledge would help students recall what they learned before. If the study is all about reciting and memorizing, there would not be a better student than a computer.\n\nSecond, as my teachers always told me, students should learn \"how to learn,\" rather than gain the knowledge only. And I believe that's the real purpose of education, to teach the student how to think and solve new problems they will meet in the future. My high school could be a bad example. When I studied there, although my teachers told me it was important to know how to learn, they cared too much about memorizing. It was indicated in the exams. In order to get a good mark on the examinations, all we had to do was to copy the facts into our minds. What's worse, the process of study was so fast that we couldn't have time to have a good think about the ideas. As a result, I can only remember a few of the things I learned from the high school textbooks now.\n\nIn addition, to understand and take a deeper thinking of what we learn is the way how we've developed our cultures from the very beginning! It's the way we gain the knowledge from the people before and create new ideas of our own. Imagine if all the students don't learn how to understand and how to think deeply, how would the future society be like?!\n\nIn a word, the way I see it, it's not only important but also fairly necessary for students to understand ideas and think more about what they learn."}
{"file_id": "1064511.txt", "output_essay": "In this fashion era, people usually want to try diverse new things, such as food, technology, and clothing. Successful people normally will try new things and take risks rather than just doing what they already know. This is why some investors are so successful nowadays. People would love to try products and styles that they have never seen, rather than just repeating the same idea over and over again.\n\nInvestors usually try to make a high profit in business. In order to let the customers feel different, the company needs to keep changing. If a company sells housing technologies, such as freezers and microwaves, and suddenly it starts to produce cell phones and computers. Customers will have a very different impression rapidly about the company, since they think the company only sells housing technology. Buyers will not need to run to a couple of different places to buy freezers and computers if they want to buy them at the same time.\n\nBusinessmen should also love to take risks. Risk does not necessarily mean a harmful thing. People who are willing to take the risk will most likely achieve success. Creative work can open customers' minds. We will never know what customers want. If buyers are surprised by the company, they will definitely have an excellent impression about the company. For example, in clothing, designers sometimes need to take the risk if they have a very different idea of what to design. The designers are not sure whether the audience and buyers will like it. Even if they do not like it, at least they try.\n\nTwo common methods should be used in order to achieve success: trying new things and taking risks. We can find out from almost every single great investor around the world. Without these methods, they will probably not be as successful as they are today."}

I was out shopping with my friends and I was on the lookout for a new mobile phone, which I had fallen in love with as soon as I saw it on my television screen one fine morning. I had vowed to buy that mobile phone, whatever the consequences. This action can be appraised by the fact that the phone looked really cute in the advertisement and it boasted of many features as well. This phone was the ultimate gadget for any teenager. But I had the ultimate shock when I saw the same mobile phone in the mall. It did not look as cute as it did in the ad, for one thing, and it did not seem to have as many features as it did in the ad. The ad was an illustration of what is defined as cheap publicity. The phone had been wrongly displayed, and if it were not for my trustworthy friends, I would have bought it with all the love I previously had for it and then would have ended up as the loser, disappointed as well.\n\nMost advertisements seem to display products in such a way that the consumer would fall in love with the product just by viewing the advertisement. This can result in serious damage to the customers' trust in advertisements as well as in the manufacturers of that particular product. The consumers will be heartbroken when they come home and realize that the product, with which they were previously so in love, has really let them down, quality-wise. The advertisers or the manufacturers are hoodwinking the consumers into buying their products at high prices, ensuring profits for themselves, but breaking the trust of the consumers nonetheless. The advertisements should be more realistic and they should not display something that the consumer may not find in the product later. The advertisers should only advertise those characteristics of the products that actually exist and serve a purpose. Not the characteristics that ought to be in a product. If the advertisers are so keen on advertising such characteristics, they should suggest to the manufacturers to actually integrate these characteristics into the product and then advertise them, so they would not be cheating the customers but actually showing a true, realistic picture."}

The environment around us has rapidly changed recently. For example, the invention of the Internet has made the world borderless, and email has shortened the time it takes to convey information. Under these circumstances, we have to adapt to succeed. In order to adapt, we should try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. For example, most people related to the IT industries are successful because they can adapt to a new environment earlier than ordinary people. This is because they try to launch new things that no one has done before.\n\nSecond, successful people try new things and take risks to improve their own methods. I think that doing the same things, such as doing what they already know how to do well, provides only the same consequence. There is no improvement and progress. In such cases, we cannot be successful because success has to do with something superior to others. In other words, even if the methods are superior to others at one time, they become the same level or inferior to others over time. For instance, Ichiro Suzuki, who is a major league baseball player, continues to seek new batting methods to improve them every year. Needless to say, he is one of the most successful people.\n\nThird, successful people tend to have challenging spirits. I think it is important to do new things. Doing new things brings us new skills and discoveries. Those lead to being successful.\n\nIn conclusion, I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well for the main three reasons stated above."}
{"file_id": "1057852.txt", "output_essay": "One could wonder if, in twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. I personally think that, because of a lot of factors we will explore, this statement is not accurate. On my way to this test this morning, I was able to read a copy of the 'Le Monde' newspaper. Inside it, an article stated that the State of California has decided to cut down on CO2 gas emissions by taking car manufacturers to court. The reason I mention this article is that it stated that there are about 36 million cars in California for about 35 million households. In my opinion, California is one of the best examples of a region in which the use of the car is essential in order to be able to move around its vast territory. But California is also the most prosperous of all American states and therefore can demonstrate to us the type of situation that could arise if a country developed to such a scale and therefore had this type of need for cars. It has become common knowledge, or fear, or indeed both for many people, that in twenty years, China will be a lot more prosperous than it is today. If we just considered the fact that its GDP grows by 7% a year, we could say that by 2026, China would have equaled California's prosperity. What makes me tend to refute the proposed statement is the fact that China has a population of about 1 billion, this would probably equate to about 400 million households and therefore potentially about 350 million cars needed by a new prosperous population to wander through their vast country and cities. I am, of course, not stating that China is a car-free environment at the moment, but the increase in the volume of cars the country experiences today would be monumental. Furthermore, one would have to consider other growing economies such as India. Europe is saturated with cars, and efforts are made in order to diminish pollution by increasing alternative means of transport. But this is possible because the territories are relatively small in comparison to immensities such as India or China. One could also say that, as demographics are increasing, there will always be more people on earth, until we finally destroy it, and therefore more potential car drivers and buyers as a whole. It must also be pointed out that, since the appearance of the Ford T model in the 1920s, the first affordable and mass-produced car, the car has become an object that symbolizes liberty. No indication seems to show that, in a near future, men will invent a new symbol and vector of liberty to replace the car. If they do, the psychological aspect gone, and only the practical aspect of owning and driving a car remaining, we might witness an increase in alternative transportation methods and therefore car usage would slowly decrease. However, it is very unlikely that this will happen during the next twenty years, and even if it did, that twenty years will be enough to witness a drop in car usage. A change of people's psychology takes time. Finally, one has to point out that the argument that petrol will not be available in a couple of decades is not valid. Firstly, this theory has been enounced many times, and new petrol reserves are being found day after day. Secondly, new energy supplies are being developed, such as biometric fuel or the electric car. The car may be cleaner and even potentially out of date in twenty years, but, as far as the proposed statement is concerned, there will not be fewer of them on a global scale, as long as there will be more humans and more economic growth on this planet."}

If a person is fully convinced about the ideals and goals of the community, then he would show full support and cooperation to it.\n\nRecently, I heard news that a former student of my college was suffering from brain cancer. As soon as this news hit the campus, many student bodies became actively involved in collecting funds to succor the patient. Thus, the young students showed great enthusiasm in order to further a cause which they believed strongly.\n\nAlso, in my country, many political parties have special divisions called 'Yuva Shakti' which are entirely comprised of youth and have come into existence only to exploit the strength that rests in the young generation. These young men actively support the party principles and do their every bit to publicize their ideals and objectives. They spend their precious time and effort to help their community.\n\nMany youth also associate themselves with non-profit organizations in order to help poor people get access to various facilities. For example, I am a member of a community that aims at increasing awareness among underprivileged and uneducated people about diseases, their prevention, and symptoms, etc. We go from village to village in order to spread this valuable information. In the last few years, since I have been a part of this organization, I have seen a great increase in the number of youngsters willing to join hands for this cause.\n\nThere are numerous other instances in which youngsters have been promising in showing support to the communities they are affiliated to, and so, I believe that they are standing up to the expectations of society and are still fulfilling their responsibilities very well."}

When faced with the decision of who enjoys more, quite a few would claim that young people have more energy to enjoy life more, and that is my point. There are numerous reasons why young people enjoy life more. I will explore a few of the most important ones here.\n\nThe main reason for my opinion is that young people are at the beginning of life and they have more advantages. Take my father and my brother as an example; my father has a lot of responsibility, while my brother doesn't have any. When my father wants to do something new, he should think about himself and his family. My brother, in contrast, goes out at night and comes back whenever he wants, and he isn't the bread earner.\n\nThere is another factor that deserves some mention here. People are different. They have different traits, customs, beliefs, and lifestyles. Some prefer to stay at home when they get older, while others go out more than they did when they are young.\n\nSimilarly, these reasons also apply to young people. When we consider that some young people have a lot of responsibility, while others don't, young people have the opportunity to choose what they want. When they have the opportunity, they can go for it and make the most of it.\n\nIt seems very difficult for us to prefer one to another because some people are very emotional, while others are very strict, and small problems don't usually get to them. In short, even though young people have some problems choosing their career, they have more advantages to enjoy life. But that doesn't mean older people don't have fun. They do.

It can be very useful when one wants to interact with other people. It is essential to share ideas and thoughts with others. In professional life, for instance, if somebody in a company has to work with another department, their task will be much easier if they know a little bit about the activity of this department. Even if it is not a complete understanding, it will be appreciated by the other party.\n\nTo give another example, related to personal life this time, it is very agreeable to be able to argue or discuss when we meet someone new. Without this broad knowledge, how would we make contact, at least at the beginning? We would obviously miss the opportunity to get in touch with people. I would say that having a broad knowledge is really a plus in life, it is like the promise to be welcomed and integrated almost wherever we go.\n\nOn the other hand, I think we cannot only be satisfied with a broad knowledge. We need to go further sometimes. We need to be involved in something exciting to keep a goal in our life. And this cannot be achieved without being specialized in one subject. Again, professionally speaking, it is essential to be specialized. Nobody can pretend to a job, which is something specific of course, if one does not know enough about this particular topic. That is why we usually start our studies by general education, a broad knowledge, and then, gradually focus, year after year, on what we want to do.\n\nPlus, I think it is something very valuable for a human being to go in-depth of something, to prove to ourselves that we are able to do something special, something that defines us.\n\nTo conclude, I would say that both approaches are necessary.

Indeed, they think that you need to go through all the details of a specific field if you want to be efficient. Is that true or not?\n\nI don't agree with such a prejudice. On the contrary, I think the more you know, the more efficient you are. For example, if someone wants to work in a library, will they be more efficient if they know everything about books, publishing, and printing? I don't think so. I think they will be more efficient if they know about different things such as history, anthropology, philosophy, literature, or science. Practice can give you all technical knowledge, but it will never replace broad knowledge provided by schools and universities.\n\nThe second reason why I think broad knowledge is important in our society is that people who have broad knowledge are more flexible. They are able to switch from one field to another. In other words, they are what I would call 'complete persons'. They can adapt themselves to every change. For example, you can be a banker today and become a manager tomorrow.\n\nMy last point is about my political vision of a modern society: I think that a good citizen needs to have a broad knowledge of all academic subjects in order to make good choices. Reality is complex: if you want to understand what is happening in your country and in the whole world, you need to have a solid knowledge in different fields such as geography, economy, or technology.\n\nTo conclude about this subject, I would say that the British ideal of the 'gentleman' who knows about all aspects of human things continues to be important in our modern world."}

That is a very difficult question, taking into account that most people would think that young people might have more fun than older people, just because they think that they are healthier, faster, stronger. As my mom used to tell me, teenagers think they are superheroes; they take risks that older people normally wouldn't take, they stay up all night, go to parties, drive fast cars, and maybe even do illegal drugs. But that does not mean that young people have more fun. I once read a very good book, 'Tuesdays with Morrie.' It's a book about life, it shows the experiences of a young man interacting with an elder. The elder has gone through various experiences, and the youngster wants to learn from those experiences. And eventually, the teacher tells him one thing, 'You first need to learn how to die, then you can learn how to live...' That tells the student that he has to absorb all that he can from his experiences, and then let go of some of his emotions, and then he can know how it feels to taste success, or love, and even pride. Morrie, who is the teacher in the book, tells the main character that once you know how it feels to die, you know how to live because you learn how to enjoy life even more. The point I am trying to make is that older people know how to take more and more from each new experience, and they probably enjoy life even more, although there are a few exceptions. Some young people are very mature and find a way to have fun even in the worst situations, like people who don't have as many economic resources; they learn how to take advantage of the few opportunities they have to go out or party, as we say nowadays. I honestly think that older people have more fun because they have learned how to enjoy life, and young people are just living at a hundred miles an hour, trying to do too many things to have fun, and not getting a lot out of the experiences that they go through in their daily lives."}

I think this fact is displayed in any family that has a grandmother or an elderly person in general and some children. If it is true that maybe we are used to hearing this kind of thing, I think that the real situation is different.\n\nFirst, I think that when old people talk about their health conditions, it is only another way to say 'Hello, I am here'. After all, they probably don't feel so bad that they feel sick. When you are old, it can happen that you are alone for a long time, having too much time to think. As a result, you start to consider your feelings too much. Imagine if you start to think that your foot hurts; probably after one day, you will really be hurt by that. Why? And if it is only because the power of our mind sometimes overcomes our own sight. I don't know if it is true, but often I have thought I was sick, and at the end, it wasn't anything. So it can be.\n\nSecond, what can you talk to someone who comes to meet you if you spent the day sitting, looking at the street, doing nothing? I think nothing. But now, let's talk about the young. In my opinion, it is really bad to listen to some young guy who complains about his or her age, probably because he or she is really sick in their mind. It is rare, but sometimes it happens to listen to these kinds of people who spend their time continuously claiming to be sick. You are not! You have the common problems that a person can meet during their age of growth. You are growing.\n\nBy the end, I think that every age has a good reason to be lived. When you are old, it is because you have your childhood memories; when you are young, it is because you are full of energy, and the world seems under your feet, waiting only for you. So probably the best thing that we can do is think by ourselves, our results, and what will happen tomorrow. Life is a guess, and we mustn't be bored because sometimes it doesn't go where we want. Life is life, and age as well."}

In fact, when I was at school, I studied a lot of subjects, including Latin and ancient Greek, and when I was at the university, I took twenty-five exams on different aspects of economics.\n\nI think that it's important to have a broad knowledge of many subjects because today, when you work, you need to be more flexible than before; a lot of things are changed, and it's quite different from the beginning of the twentieth century when Ford theorized the 'work specialization.'\n\nBut, probably, in some cases, it should be different; for example, an engineer needs to know a lot of things in a specific subject and must specialize in a specific construction sector, and, I think, it's similar for medics.\n\nOn the other hand, my preparation is general because I would become a manager, and it's known that a manager must be able to resolve a lot of different problems in different ways; you may use your ability to find new solutions to the problems.\n\nFor example, if you have a problem selling a product because the market doesn't like it, you have two choices: the first is to retire the product from the market, and the second one, which is more creative, is to find a good marketing solution to make the product 'pulled' by the market.\n\nIn conclusion, I think that you must choose your formation depending on your interests and your future job."}

For example, some Tokyo university students who live near my city nowadays began to clean the river-side. They usually come to the river-side to bring up trash, cans disposed of on it. As a result, the river became very clean. Then, the people in the area appreciated them very much. And they are proud of the activity. This shows that young people want to receive respect from others by helping their community.\n\nSecond, the rise of concern for the environment helps young people contribute to their communities. They have had more chances to learn about environmental issues. As a result, young people have more concern for the environment surrounding them. For example, when I was a freshman at Kyoto University in Japan, there were a lot of lectures about the environment.

{"file_id": "1070118.txt", "output_essay": "Why do young people not give enough time to helping their communities nowadays? I presume there are several reasons for that.\n\nFirst of all, young people have increasing possibilities and money to spend their leisure time, so they might rather spend their time enjoying themselves with friends than helping the community.\n\nAnother reason might be the changing living conditions. People nowadays have to be and are more flexible. The number of young people leaving their hometown to study in a city far away has increased. Young people are changing jobs more frequently than before and thus have to move houses. The time a young person spends in one site has shortened, and accordingly, the feeling of being a part of a community. Helping a community means being motivated as you feel responsible for it. Without having spent a certain time in a community, you are less motivated to help, as you do not know a lot of people personally. The personal knowledge of people, though, increases your motivation to help strongly.\n\nThe strongest reason for the fact that young people nowadays help less in communities is the changed behavior towards communities. People have become more individual, more focused on themselves and their needs. Families, as much as communities, do not mean as much to people as they used to in the past. People are economically more independent, so that they do not need the support and help of the communities as much as in the past.\n\nTaking all those factors into account, I would agree that more and more young people tend not to give enough time to helping their communities."}

That is because of the great enthusiasm young people might be having towards accomplishing their responsibilities. For example, the percentage of failure in senior high school was 30% in the Middle East between 1989-2000. However, between 2001-2006, the percentage of failure has been highly increased to 70%. This statistic tells us that young people nowadays are not having the potential to accomplish their responsibilities, in order to respond to several generations after them.

{"file_id": "1066982.txt", "output_essay": "I partially agree with this statement. I think that having a broad and wide knowledge is a really good thing: if you are open-minded and can discuss many topics, you can get many opportunities, and you can also have more immunity to market variations. For instance, in case of macro-economic problems in a certain productive area, you can be able to change your work more freely and more rapidly than those who are very deeply specialized. Otherwise, workers (and here I also refer to managers and people who have great responsibilities) also need to be specialized in a certain field. According to my opinion and to my knowledge, today the market needs people who are specialized, but also needs people who can share their knowledge with their colleagues, in order to obtain revenues by synergy and cooperation practices; for this reason, I think that while you are a student, you need to widen as much as possible the spectrum of your knowledge, investigating as many fields as possible; according to me, it is reasonable to improve a specific technical ability just after finishing your studies (or during the last year of your academic career); behaving in such a way, you could have both the basic wide knowledge to effort changes, and also the specialization, which could make you the best worker in a certain field at a certain time and in a certain region. For example, workers with a low instruction level may have many problems in case of changes in the strategy of their company, or (and this is a more dramatic problem for workers involved in the process) in case of market revolutions, which make a certain product obsolete, or generate the so-called 'killer applications.' So, in order to be an attractive worker for the labor market, you need to specialize your knowledge, but in order to minimize risks and to avoid market changes, you have to widen your knowledge; you also need to improve your capabilities and knowledge after you have finished your studies: this is the so-called 'life-long learning,' which I believe is the best model in modern society."}

For example, if you are traveling all alone to a historical monument with no background knowledge about the place, it's as good as seeing the monument/place in books.\n\nIf you are traveling alone, then things will not be of great interest. There might be moments that you want to discuss with someone on a specific painting or architecture. This calls for a tour in groups rather than individual. A monument/painting speaks a thousand words when you observe them, but it cannot listen to you.\n\nThere are some points of the guided tour that make it more interesting. First, the intricacy of the depth of the knowledge of the guide about the importance of the place, which obviously we as tourists are not aware of. Second, there are places that may not be listed or published in the maps, magazines, books, etc., and there might be some local place that might be of interest, which the guide knows. The third point is that in a group, there are people with different ideologies and thoughts. The inquisitiveness of anyone in the group to know about something might prove to be useful for the entire group to learn more about the place. Obviously, a guide is the best one to answer such questions.\n\nThus, the best way to travel is in a group, led by a tour guide. There is, of course, the other side of this, where the guide might try to tell things differently and might say wrong things about the place. The guide might be prejudiced about some of the historical views and opinions. These are factors that depend on the type of guide you choose. If there is a good guide with a good reputation, then it is always advantageous to hire him for a guided tour. If you consider saving the guide charges by not hiring him, then the money spent on coming to the place may go in vain, since you would have only visited the place but do not know anything more about the place than what you have seen."}

I will explain in this writing why I disagree with this opinion.\n\nAs an 18-year-old, I have recently heard this statement. In fact, all grandparents or parents say that their children do not do all they must do for the community. They think that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. They always say that their childhood was more difficult than it is for us. It is very frustrating when parents are always against what you do or have done. That is why I disagree with this statement. I will explain the reasons in more detail in the next paragraph.\n\nIn my opinion, this statement is wrong. A lot of people help elderly people when they need assistance. They often help their parents at home and engage in various activities. I think that helping the community does not only mean volunteering. Going to school is not directly helping the community at the beginning. However, if young people do not pursue their studies, the community will suffer because we need people who have acquired a lot of knowledge to manage others.\n\nFrom my point of view, old people think that because they do things that we do not do. For instance, visiting elderly people in their homes, organizing activities for their town, like planning the next party. These are activities that we do not have time to do. Because of our busy schedules, including courses, sports, and social activities, it is difficult to find a moment to do what they do.\n\nIn conclusion, as you have seen, I strongly disagree with this statement.

Take the example of an electric motor. Without proper understanding of how an electric motor really works, it is impossible for one to create motors of various sizes and for various utilities. If one merely learned the facts about a motor, we wouldn't have all the pleasures in life made possible by all the miniature motors! Look at the car's power windows, whose operation is facilitated by small motors, or at many of the useful robots whose motion is made possible by various sizes/types of motors, or at many of the precision tools that use something called stepper motors to precisely control various operations.\n\nFurther, understanding of a concept enables one to look for ways the concept can be extended to other applications, or to find ways two or more concepts can be combined to come up with new ideas that make exciting things possible. Take the example of a device that scans printed material and converts it into typed matter on a computer. This device is the result of a lot of different concepts put together. The scanning technology - which scans the printed material, which is then combined with pattern matching technology - that can look at the scanned picture and recognize the letters based on their shapes. Simple learning of facts doesn't really allow for this kind of innovations.\n\nHowever, no one can deny the role facts play in helping people visualize things and in putting things in perspective. Take, for example, the Saturn rocket that took man to the Moon. Unless one knows the size of the rocket, the amount of fuel used, how many inventions were required to make the flight possible, one may not really appreciate the scale of the device and the project. But one can still see that the facts help one gain a perspective of things, but the real usefulness comes only when one understands the concepts that make it possible for the device to work.\n\nIn summary, it is clear that it is far more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn just facts, despite the important role played by the facts."}

Gadgets, friends, movies, discotheques, pubs, and other such things are taking them away from their families and the community.\n\nIf they are not having fun, then it is the increasing pressure of studies that keeps them inside their homes after school hours. Their studies and the style of the present school curriculum make sure that the students are studying continuously.\n\nThe curriculum of most educational institutions is designed to give theoretical knowledge to the students. The lack of practicals takes away the chance of any external exposure from the students.\n\nApart from studies, the lack of interest in extending a helping hand for matters related to the communities can also be observed amongst the youngsters. They are becoming a bit self-centered. For them, it's 'ME FIRST.' Everything else becomes secondary for them.\n\nAnother reason for their non-participation can be traced to the fact that they do not understand the importance of joint families and thus the concept of loving and sharing is a little alien to them. Earlier, joint families kept people together. They were more tolerant, more caring, and had a better understanding of the importance of community. But the concept of nuclear families has taken away the element of 'together we stand' away from the youth.\n\nLast month, the Mumbai blast rocked the whole nation and questioned our unity and security both.

You will agree with this idea: a person who knows the nature of a matter can perform well when they work on new problems, rather than a person who only memorized the surface of the matter. They can apply their ideas if they know the matter deeply. Now, it is often said that Japanese students lack application skills. We are ranked in a lower position when the research is out. In contrast, countries like the US are ranked highly every time. We know the cause of this situation. The education in Japan highly emphasizes memorization. We must take a hard entrance examination when we enroll in high school and university. So, although we often memorize the facts, we seldom have an opportunity to think about the matter deeply. So, students can raise their application skill by understanding the concept itself.\n\nSecond, understanding the nature of problems is much more attractive for students. They can get pleasure when they find out the solution or they could understand the concept. Therefore, they can continue studying with joy. We want to do what we like rather than dislike. It also helps raise their academic skills. In contrast, in the case of learning all things, they will stop studying. For me personally, I didn't like studying at all until I entered university. I could not find joy in studying because I had to memorize many facts. However, almost all studies in universities assign us to think by ourselves.

Mostly, younger people join groups to have people around to enjoy their time with friends. This can happen in the church community, sport clubs, or just for socializing. Especially, activities in church try to teach the younger ones how important it is to, for example, help people with disabilities. However, because of the increase in media consumption, especially TV, community activities are being perceived as \"uncool\". It is more important to be individual and gain one's own popularity. Another reason can be that people lose trust in their government. They feel the pressure that lasts on them if they want to have success in their life. So, they try to get the best for their own advancement. As well, when people recognize that government members, who should serve the public, think it is more important to fill their own pockets, this can have the effect that people turn to be more egotistic. Especially because of the new information era, people are aware of the selfishness of some government members. As well, they are told about the risks in life every day in the news. I think this constant pressure and the lack of honesty have led to the point that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. But with society being aware of that matter, chances are not bad that a new way of thinking and acting can be taught. So, you can see a lot of effort being taken from media and government to emphasize this problem and to point out how important it is to serve the community.

In high schools, for instance, it is important that students learn about many different fields before being allowed to choose which major they want to study. It can thus make students discover fields of knowledge they didn't know before, but also fields that can attract them a lot.\n\nBesides, I think that choosing to specialize or not depends on what kind of job you want to do later. Some jobs require good knowledge in many academic fields. This is, for instance, the case of journalism. Some journalists do decide to specialize, but the majority are able to write about every topic, whether it concerns a pension reform or a football match.\n\nOn a personal point of view, this attitude - to make the choice of not choosing a specialization - can be very interesting. Somebody who decides not to choose a major field of interest will be interested in much more numerous things than somebody only interested in history or philosophy.\n\nBut I also think that there is a danger for people knowing lots of things in many fields. The society also needs specialists who deeply know some aspects of the society. For instance, teaching biology requires being a specialist in biology. And it is the same for all the teachers. In some countries, teachers are teaching two subjects, but I think it is not such a good idea since they can't know very well two fields of knowledge.\n\nTo conclude, we can say that societies need both - specialists and people who stay in general knowledge. But personally, I like having learned many different subjects before specializing myself. Thanks to this, I discovered what biology, physics, and many other fields were, which I would not have discovered without my high school classes."}

I think changing one's own thinking is too difficult. If I were older, it would be more and more difficult. But I will be able to get more significant advantages. To get more significant advantages, for example, I can change to a higher salary work and get a bigger house.\n\nSecond, trying new things will enable me to connect with many new networks. For example, work, friends, and my own lifestyle, and so on. Getting more intelligent friends may brighten my life. And if I had very difficult problems in my life, they would have good advice for me. For example, work, relationships with friends, and so on.\n\nThird, trying new things may get me a more sensitive mind. Trying more difficult problems will enable me to change my heart more strongly. Getting a stronger heart will enable me to communicate with many kinds of people, I think.\n\nSo, I think trying new things is better than not trying.

To 'enjoy life' is a very subjective concept that varies according to age, cultural background, religious beliefs, social environment, and many other factors. From my own experience, I have learned to enjoy life every day.\n\nWhen I was a child, I was completely unable to socialize, to relate to other children, and have fun with my friends. Family problems that I was going through made me a very shy girl. In many occasions, I could not find a way out of uncomfortable situations. The inability to ask for help made my childhood pretty sad.\n\nYoung people today sometimes have problems expressing what makes them happy because of 'peer pressure.' Most teenagers who are 'followers' (meaning not leaders) may find themselves in awful situations, doing and performing acts they do not want to do. As we grow up, we dare to be different. We learn to say 'no' and do not feel bad about it. Our personalities get stronger, and we feel more comfortable with who we are.\n\nAs we grow up, we learn to overcome obstacles, and as we get older, we get wiser and learn from our own experiences and others' experiences. The more we know about ourselves, the easier we find our way to happiness. It takes time to discover and understand what makes us happy. That wisdom to understand and comprehend what joy means to us comes with age, with a life full of experiences, mistakes, and successes.\n\nI strongly believe the opposite of that statement. A shy girl who does not know how to ask for help, or a teenager who feels oppressed by their peers, and a life with no experience will certainly have a harder time finding happiness, to enjoy life. As I get older, I get wiser. When I make a mistake, I learn from it. I heard a long time ago that growing older is mandatory, growing up is optional. I agree with that."}

It is the reason why we go to university after secondary school. Being a professional and knowing one subject thoroughly gives us many advantages on the job market by giving us appeal to customers, clients, and future employers.\n\nAfter completing my undergraduate studies, I plan to get a master's degree in law and study one specific area of the law. In today's market, professionals are getting more and more specialized because there are so many changes, and so many topics and subjects to study.\n\nWhen a client is having a divorce, they will not go to a surgeon or a corporate lawyer; they will go to a lawyer who specializes in matrimonial action, because he is more likely to help them, after seeing so many clients in the same situation.\n\nFurther, it is not time-efficient to cover many academic subjects and know them all. Some people have more than one degree and spend their life studying and going to one school after another. They know about economics, finance, or banking, but it is not possible to know them all very well.\n\nIn addition, it can cost a lot to study so many subjects, and at the end, not being able to compete with one person who spent less time in school but only knows one subject.\n\nFinally, it is impossible to learn many subjects and know them all well. It is a sign of lack of stability and indecision. Some students spend their college years changing from one major to another, and they can never decide which one to study. So, they end up spending years in school and get discouraged by the time they graduate and quit school. In sum, specializing in one subject is the best choice for me, although I would also like to learn about other complementary disciplines like languages, sports, and art and be able to exchange intellectually with other people."}

Only if there are risks will life be more interesting. And also, if we work on the same things, we will feel bored. For example, if a software engineer works on the same project for several years, then there will be no improvement in his technical skills, or he will actually lose his imagination power. Only if he works in different scenarios can he improve his own knowledge and gain experience.\n\nMukesh Ambani is the best example, I think, because first, he is a successful person in various kinds of business. First, along with his brother, he started industries and developed those industries to gain more profit. Then, he started oil refineries, and then came Reliance Mobiles. Apart from this, Reliance Energy Resources are doing a great job in the mutual funds and share markets.\n\nThis also helps to provide jobs for people in different fields. If there is only one industry, then we can support only the people who are in that field. By trying new businesses, it also helps to reduce unemployment and to develop various economic levels.\n\nAnother reason for doing various businesses is that if there is a loss in one of the businesses, we can manage the loss because of the profit in other businesses. In case we are doing one business, then we cannot manage that situation. For example, learning both hardware and software will help when there is a less number of jobs available in software or hardware. So, if we learn more and keep ourselves updated with the new technologies, then there is no way for loss.\n\nMaybe there are successful people who do the same thing they know (same business), but the probability is very less. Trying new things and developing new skill sets will give us a good position."}

Trying alternatives and gaining new perspectives will be efficient in reducing the risk of failing by progressing potential to produce solutions for problems. Steady knowledge is important to maintain the status quo, so that a person does not take a risk in order to change the situation.\n\nInitially, people who are supervising a project have to see the situation from many aspects. How it is to be achieved is directly correlated with how much they are experienced. The only way of increasing experience is to try new alternatives and take risks for creating new solutions. Making observations cannot be as efficient as applying them and gaining experience.\n\nIn addition, in daily life, people face new people and new situations that are not identical to each other. In any unwanted case, all of the previous knowledge can be helpful to some extent. If it is considered as a problem with many unknowns, changing any unknown will directly affect the result. As in our immune system, our body will respond to invading pathogens more powerfully in subsequent exposures than the first one.\n\nBeyond these, human beings sometimes can be on the pursuit of new tastes in order to renew their lives and refresh their souls. A life consisting of eating and sleeping is not worth living, so how many years you lived cannot be as important as how you lived. People who are afraid of taking risks for adding up their lives, in fact, do not want to violate their identities. Therefore, they continue to go in the way which they know well. However, there should be differences between human beings and plants in order to put them into another group.\n\nTaking everything into account, it can be concluded that experience is of great importance in finding solutions for unwanted situations and gaining new perspectives."}

To know as well about history as about biology or astronomy is fantastic. If I had this broad knowledge, I would be able to speak with a biologist or an historian. But is it possible to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects without being specialized in one particular topic?\n\nIn fact, my knowledge in biology would not be as accurate as that of a biologist. That is to say that somebody who has a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is specialized in nothing. So, in that case, it is hard or even impossible to find a job. I think it is important to specialize in one specific subject in order to find a job or to be able to provide accurate information about a precise topic.\n\nIn conclusion, in my opinion, it is better to specialize in one specific subject. But in that case, it is important too not to forget that other subjects exist. So, it is necessary to read books about other topics. For example, a biologist must know about history, even if he will never be as good in history as in biology, because he may need historical information to explain several phenomena that he is already studying."}

It starts from helping your family in its daily chores, taking care of the neighbors' house while they are away, or spending some time in charity organizations. At the core of all the above is the recognition that we are not just individuals, but part of a community. There is also the sense of gratitude for one's gifts in life, such as youth, health, or any skills, and the sense of enrichment that comes from sharing those gifts and making them useful to others.\n\nOverall, I agree with the idea that young people do not seem focused enough on the needs of their communities, and I actually think that they are fairly detached from the concept of community altogether. I think this is a very complex phenomenon and linked to a great number of reasons.\n\nFirst of all, it seems that our society and culture put a high value on time, especially spare time. Partly because modern life is very demanding, partly because the offer of entertainment and outdoor stimulations is so varied, we praise our time as a supreme luxury and feel very frustrated when we cannot use it in complete freedom.\n\nSecondly, I think Western societies have developed more and more in a hedonistic direction. In other words, we feel it is our own right to enjoy ourselves, feel free in our choices, and simply follow instant gratification. I think this is particularly apparent in young people, as they claim the right to play and have fun, and resent any request of help or support as a form of injustice.\n\nIn a dominant culture of self-absorption and pleasure, taking the time to communicate with people that are different in background and frame of mind seems unjustified, and this leads to another worrying trend. It seems to me that there is a general detachment between young people and older generations or people in need. These are generally the people that need more time and support within the community, and it would be the duty of the younger generation to look after them.\n\nIn conclusion, I think that values that have become more and more present in our societies are now central in young people's vision of life. As a consequence, there seems to be a more selfish conception of one's use of time and gifts, that unfortunately leads to the neglect of parts of the community that might be in need."}

Just trying new things without knowledge is just risky.\n\nSecondly, when I play a tennis match, in those situations, I do not try a new style of serve when I really want to win.

{"file_id": "1071692.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. Consider scientist Einstein, who had developed the power and light source for the world because he had conducted his experiment sixteen times and saw the same result, which was failure. But he never gave up and conducted the same experiment for the seventeenth time, and at that moment, he achieved a result and became one of the most recognizable people in the world. There are so many people who try until success meets them.\n\nNow, let us look at the present technology and the innovations that are happening in the world. Before the centuries, if a person wanted to develop power, there was no way of obtaining it. But another scientist, named Edison, who is famous for his wooden block model bladeless turbine, which is used to develop power from water, might not have been a successful person at the beginning of the era. However, he conducted many experiments and revealed the result from greater risks and won an international award given by the American society.\n\nI disagree with those people who do the same things they have already known. Because God has gifted people with superficial knowledge, and one has to aspire to that knowledge and increase their potential skills to develop new models. When people do things that were very well known to them, they will never obtain something different in their life, and they always seem to be in the same position. One should try new things, which involve risks and many hurdles, but when you pass through the risks, there will be a result waiting for you. So, everyone should try for new things.\n\nLet us consider an example: the person named Newton, because he was unaware that he would be the most successful person in the world in the field of science. He was just sitting under a tree, and suddenly an apple fell on him, and he questioned himself immediately, 'How did it fall?' and then, as a result, he discovered Newton's law of motion. So, I would like to conclude that when a person takes risks and passes through difficulties and hurdles instead of doing the same thing that was well known, they will meet success."}

I completely agree with the statement that 'successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.' This can be well explained by citing some examples of a few legends in different fields, like the ones mentioned below.\n\nFirstly, I would like to start with the richest person in the Indian market, Dhirubhai Ambani, who was once working as a vegetable vendor. He was a master of selling those vegetables, no doubt, but drew interest in the communication field and started researching in that field. It's a completely different field that he opted for, but the determination he had in his work and the confidence he had in his ability made him a successful person, and finally, he became the master in that field.\n\nSecondly, the all-time legend in the field of cricket, Sachin Tendulkar, was pursuing engineering because he wanted to become a successful engineer, but had a lot of interest in cricket. So, he opted for cricket after getting into engineering, though it was a big, risky decision that he had taken up; he was ready to work hard for that. And now, he's a renowned cricketer. The risk that he had taken was a huge one, but it really paid him off.\n\nThus, I certainly feel that a person who is versatile in their work and, at the same time, diversified in their thinking and morals can become a successful person. Thus, a successful person is not the one who takes risks but also strives hard for that and makes their risky decision count at the end of the day."}

According to my own personal experience, I think that specializing in one subject is better than having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects. I am an electronics engineer, and electronics is a very broad subject; you cannot learn everything about every subject.\n\nFirst of all, if you cannot pick a subject, then in the future, there can be some instabilities in your knowledge because you are not focused on one subject. The knowledge you have from other subjects can misguide you in one specific thing. But if you are specialized in one subject, then you know all the basics and important parts of that subject, and you become the person who is required for that specific topic everywhere you go.\n\nAs an example, my major is Robotics and Control, so I am very experienced in that topic. When there is a problem with control systems in the factory, I can easily go and understand the problem and provide a solution as fast as possible. But if I were not specialized in any topic, then I would have to analyze the problem, do some research to increase my knowledge, at the same time trying to get over with the confusion in my mind from the knowledge of other topics in my head, and then try to solve the problem. This will take longer time, and I guess it won't be that effective.\n\nMost of the companies today are based on time effectiveness, and they can't wait for you to increase your knowledge for the job that is assigned to you.\n\nSecondly, when you have broad knowledge of many academic subjects, it is harder for you to show your eligibility to the people. They will ask you, like, what is your area of specialization? And if you say I have a broad knowledge on many subjects, most probably they won't accept you because today, teamwork is the key point to success. Nobody needs a person who says, 'I have a very broad knowledge; I can do everything required on my own; I don't need somebody else.' You cannot compete yourself with a team with a mix of specialized knowledge about the topics that are related to them.\n\nIn brief, I think it is important to specialize in one specific topic. By this, you can work in any team, and with the mix of this specialized knowledge, teamwork is the best way to provide solutions to the problems.

The reason is that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. For example, there are many medicine advertisements that state that the medicine will soothe pains and cure diseases very quickly. People suffering from pains and diseases will buy the medicine because they believe what is promoted in the advertisements. These medicine advertisements have exaggerated the facts.

It is clear that students learn more about ideas and concepts rather than facts in classrooms. So, I agree with this statement. In general, any subjects are classified into two ways: either science or social. Specially in social subjects, we learn many things like history, geography, economics, and civics, which differ from what we see to what we learn in history. Suppose a few countries have a history of less than 500 years, but those countries are now among the world's biggest economies and rule the entire world.\n\nIn the starting of the twentieth century, there was no development of electronics science. Now, we are not thinking without electronics and computers, and power, but is it the truth? So many things, the ideas and concepts, are very important. Like materials, their chemical bonding, conductivity, types of materials - these are learned from ideas and concepts only, not through facts. In materials, we have different types of classification based on their characteristics.\n\nSuppose now we are discussing a science class. In this case, I would like to discuss the solar system. In the solar system, the sun is not revolving, but we feel the sun is moving from east to west; naturally, the Earth is moving from west to east. And I will give another example: if we travel in any vehicle, we feel the surroundings are moving, and we feel we are stationary, like that. Another example is that we feel the Earth is like a plate; it's not like a sphere shape, but actually, our Earth is a sphere shape, not a flat shape. But generally, we feel it is a flat shape; if it is a flat shape, sun rising times and sun set times must be the same, but it is not true. I feel that the above three examples show that we understand ideas and concepts better than facts.\n\nI give one technical example in this case. In general, we are not accepting energy transfer in real life, but energy transfer from one form to another form of energy. But from facts, we are disagreeing; we can produce from heat to cold. In our real life, we feel it's very difficult. But it produces heat (in a boiler), some kinetic energy, which is converted into electrical energy with the help of a turbine, and finally, electrical energy into cold with the help of a refrigeration process.\n\nSo, I strongly agree with my entire part of the discussion.

For example, compared with younger couples, instead of getting drunk and dancing like mad, older couples are like to go traveling together and to recall their honeymoons. Even though it looks pretty boring for younger people, but those moments are significant in the older people's life. So older people actually know how to enjoy their time more healthily and more meaningfully.\n\nSecond, there are a lot of things that older people can also enjoy, such as younger people's favorite things - parties, clubs, and gems. Older people like to go to somewhere that is more quiet than the party rooms, but they do enjoy dancing with their lovers and sharing their special beauties with the one who is important to them. And also, they love to go to clubs to know more people and friends. For example, my grandmother used to go to parties and have fun with her friends.\n\nThird, here is one thing that younger people cannot understand and enjoy, but older people love - garden works. Younger people assume that garden works are only for grandparents for their extra time. But actually, it is not true; garden works are another way that shows how much older people enjoy life, because time goes by very fast, so older people enjoy the moment when their flowers grew up, or their apple tree has little apples, and so on. Because they understand the joy of creating life and in order to enjoy life.\n\nTherefore, in my opinion, older people know how to enjoy their life and even better than younger people.

They have their living styles that provide for better living standards and qualities. So these are the reasons why I disagree with the statement."}

I agree.\n\nFirst of all, the car is very important for a lot of people because men need to go to work, or at home, or in general, we must go to the city, but also out of the city with freedom.\n\nI think that today, even if we can choose what to use for transport, the car is the first choice that makes sense, because it is free and we can go wherever we want.\n\nSecondly, I hope that the situation will be better because our cities are very polluted and we can't go freely for the city streets because there are a lot of cars. For me, the city must have streets true for driving, and we learn to drive with sureness and with respect for other cars without going fast.\n\nIn conclusion, we must use the car only when it is necessary, and when we can't use other solutions, because sometimes we forget when it's all easy, but in the future, we can't return to the past.

I say it is important to have knowledge in many subjects because life in every country is different. Life is like a path filled with stones where you need to be prepared to move so as not to fall.\n\nI am a high school student hoping to get accepted into a university. I want to major in physics.

If I have knowledge in a specific subject, I am not going to have any money to live like a normal person, which means I cannot pay for my food, I cannot pay for a place to live, and I cannot pay for my studies.\n\nLife has its stones.

{"file_id": "1073932.txt", "output_essay": "We often hear people saying that young people should enjoy life as long as they still can. Therefore, it is sort of commonly accepted that older people are not enjoying their lives, or at least less than younger people. We will discuss both sides of this statement and will express our final point of view as a conclusion.\n\nYoung people have fewer responsibilities than older ones: older people are responsible for younger ones! As an example, it is rare to see parents buying firecrackers to make a joke to their neighbor, whereas it is clich\u00e9 for youngsters to do so. Young people don't have to work to make their family live; they attend classes and have a lot of activities; they are young and they enjoy themselves, because they simply have fewer responsibilities. But this is a youngster's point of view.\n\nDo older people really enjoy their life less than younger people? Obviously not. For example, having a family and giving birth to an offspring is enjoyable, perhaps the most enjoyable thing in the world! If older people enjoyed their lives less than younger ones, our world would be a very sad world... Thus, some young people do not enjoy their life, and some old people obviously do. The statement can't be true because of this simple fact. Honestly, if older people didn't enjoy themselves as much as younger ones, would it be worth living this life? Obviously, if life is not enjoyable, then life loses its primary purpose, and living this life would be purposeless.\n\nI think the statement is a young person's point of view, and is not really well thought. At first, we feel it is true, but in fact, it is because what we think is enjoyable or not changes when we get older! Loving to read poetry at the age of 13 is rare, but at the age of 65, it can be fully appreciated and understood, because the person has more experience and can catch the sense of it. I think that how we enjoy ourselves is different, but no one enjoys themselves more than someone, based on their age. Enjoying life is universal, and has no age. Young people enjoy life as much as older people do, and vice-versa."}

What I try to mean is that with globalization comes competition. According to me, to stay ahead in this highly competitive race, one has to excel or master whatever academic field one may be in. This mastery of an academic subject can only be attained by specializing in that particular subject rather than having only a broad knowledge of various related subjects. The old clich\u00e9 'Jack of all trades but master of none' does not appeal much to me.\n\nI would like to elucidate my theory that specializing in a particular subject is better than having knowledge of various academic subjects by citing a practical example. Obviously, a company would prefer a person with a master's degree in Chemical Engineering to another person applying for the same job but with a diploma in Chemical Engineering and a diploma in Biological Engineering. Even if the company would employ the latter for his skills in both chemistry and biology, he would definitely be given a post subordinate to that of the former and a pay package that would be lesser than the former. However, if the person with the diploma would hold a degree in, say, a management course and if the company would also require managerial skills at the same time, then it would be a different question altogether.\n\nTo sum it up, I would say that a specialized course in today's world is given a higher priority in the competitive market."}
{"file_id": "1073628.txt", "output_essay": "Some people may believe this is true, but I totally disagree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do. From my point of view, I think that young people do not enjoy their life more than older people do. \n\nFirstly, young people have less spare time than older people, because they are young and have a lot of working pressures and long working hours. They must strive for their future by hard work; therefore, they do not have much spare time to pursue their interests. However, older people have fewer working responsibilities and shorter working hours than young people do, and many of them are retired from their work. They can spend more time with family and engage in many hobbies that interest them.\n\nSecondly, older people have more friends than young people do. As time passes, older people have been in society for many years, so they have met a lot of people and can have fun with many friends. It is really a happy thing to stay with many friends, and there must be a pleasant atmosphere.\n\nFinally, older people have fewer living pressures than young people do. Many older people have already retired from their work. They do not think much about how to keep their job and how to make more money. They have already done this when they were young. Now, the only thing they need to think about is how to spend the rest of their life enjoying the wonderful things in the world. They can travel to many beautiful places in their spare time, and they can visit their friends and have fun with them. They do not think much about work and just play for fun. However, young people will still face heavy work and pressure from society. So, they cannot enjoy themselves as much as older people do.\n\nMaking my father and my grandmother as an example, my father works more than 40 hours a week to earn money to afford my study fee abroad, and he does not have much time to have fun. However, my grandmother has a lot of spare time and fewer working pressures, so she can play a lot of funny stuff with her friends.\n\nTherefore, from the reasons I listed above, I think that older people enjoy their life more than young people do, because they have more spare time, more friends, and fewer working pressures."}
{"file_id": "1075051.txt", "output_essay": "I both agree and disagree with this statement. On one hand, a broad knowledge of academic subjects is often, dare I say, always good to have. It is important for one to have knowledge of many fields as possible. As human beings, we always want to learn more, and in university, for instance, one subject is not enough at all.\n\nI am currently a student. I study at La Sorbonne Nouvelle University, which is the top university for foreign languages. I am majoring in both English and German, but there are many other languages one can learn, such as Spanish, Italian, Arabic, Chinese, or Hindi. After graduating from this university and this major, students often apply for jobs in commercial trade or International Business. In this context, the knowledge of many academic subjects is much more than useful. In the case of two graduate students applying for the same job in International Business, I somehow know that the one who has knowledge of different foreign languages will get the post.\n\nMy university is also famous for cinema, dramatic art, and communication, and it is absolutely possible to major, for example, in both Foreign languages and Cinema or follow theater classes.\n\nBut on the other hand, I think that there is a time when students have to focus on what they really want to do and what they really want to be, and then, according to it, try to get as many chances as possible in order to succeed. For example, the knowledge of many academic subjects could lead students into confusion. They try to learn as many subjects as often because they are interested in all sorts of fields, and if you ask these students what they prefer most or what they would rather study if they had to choose only one academic subject, they do not know.\n\nThis fact can explain why a lot of students fail their first years of college. Most university failures in France are caused by a mistake in the choice of majors, which are caused by bad information after the twelfth grade.\n\nI would say, as a conclusion, that it is always interesting to have knowledge in as many fields as possible, but students have to focus on the main point, which is success."}

I have never been old in my life, so I cannot know if I agree or disagree with the statement, basing myself on my own life experience. But I can answer based on what I have lived since this time and on what I have seen around me during this time. And I will say that I agree.\n\nThere are a lot of advantages in getting older. Older people have more freedom (they can do whatever they want to and do not have to ask anyone), they earn their own life, so they are able to plan it better than young people because they do not have to rely on their parents. But I am still thinking that young people enjoy life more than older people do. There are just much more things to do, things to enjoy, for young people. They do not have as many responsibilities as older people, so they do not have as many things to worry about. For example, I said that older people have more freedom, earning their own life. It is true. But what I did not say then is that there is more fun, to me, in enjoying life basically, without any trouble in mind, or much less important ones.\n\nFurthermore, young people have often much more possibilities to meet new people and make new friends than older ones. Older people have to have a job to earn their life. And most of the time, after the first weeks in their company, they will see the same people, colleagues, maybe for the rest of their life. A young person, doing their studies, meets a lot of new people each year when they come to a new class. They could even meet more new people if they change universities.\n\nSo young people meet more people, make more friends, have more fun, and have less problems to worry about. Well, I am also excited to get older and have more freedom and responsibility every day, but I think that I may regret these years one day."}
{"file_id": "1075584.txt", "output_essay": "In my definition, the enjoyment of life is living life to its fullest. And thus, I believe that young people enjoy life more than older people. There are various points to discuss this issue.\n\nFirstly, young people are mobile. In other words, they have young minds, young blood, and dynamic energy. If someone is mobile, they can reach anywhere to satisfy their need to live life and make it full without any compromise. Whereas, older people are at an age where they have at least one problem, which makes them immobile. At this age, they are out of energy and liable to have at least one health problem, making them stay at home and dependent.\n\nSecondly, young people are doing at least one task, such as studying or working, and this makes them come into contact with lots of people and new friends. This gives them the opportunity to make new friends, with whom they can enjoy life on weekends, long drives, etc. On the other hand, older people are handicapped in this regard. Since they are compromised by health issues, they are forced to stay at home and alone with their health problems. So, no health, no going out, no friends, and no enjoyment of life.\n\nMoreover, young people are twenty-first-century people. They utilize all the latest technology by gaining knowledge through reliable sources, since they are intelligent enough to utilize it and convert it into a new source of enjoyment of life. On the other hand, older people still have an outdated mindset, which is not suitable for the enjoyment of life.\n\nIn conclusion, younger people do have enough energy, chances to make friends, and adequate knowledge to live life to its fullest, which older people lack."}

If a student once has understood an idea or a concept, he is able to increase his knowledge easily without learning a lot of facts. He will, without doubt, learn facts, but not because someone tells him the facts, but because of his increasing interest in the subject. And the interest increases because he understands the idea or concept of a system.\n\nFor example, global warming: if a student once understands the connection between the increasing temperature and the effect on the climate, he is able to look deeper, to see how everything is connected. This can be a very fascinating experience. It is also important to have an inspiring teacher who knows how to fascinate his students. If this is the case, the teacher doesn't have to bother the students with boring facts; he just has to explain the idea or concept of a system properly.\n\nIt is also important to give the students time and support to find out things by themselves. The result is an increasing self-confidence. I guess it is like a vicious circle in a positive kind of way. Once a student has gained more self-confidence, his interest in the matter grows, the research becomes more intense, the results also become more accurate, and he will learn the facts as a result of his interest, because he wants to know the background.\n\nHe doesn't need to have a boring lesson to learn the facts.

Recently, we have had an increasing number of newly formed organizations, which are specialized in helping the community. Most of these organizations are constituted of young people. I do believe that young, motivated people can serve and help their communities.\n\nYoung people are usually highly motivated. However, due to many circumstances, they might not find the time or the appropriate way for helping their communities. For example, I am a lawyer, and most of the time, I have to work for 10 to 12 hours per day. And during the weekends, I usually have papers to study and review. Therefore, I do not have that much time to do any social work. But that does not mean that I do not want to, or that I find that helping my community is not that important; it is just that the rhythm of the fast-paced world that we live in today forces us to fix some priorities first. But I do try my best to participate in any available community work that I can find.\n\nDuring my college years, I did a lot of charity and social work. I was a member of a social club, where we accomplished a lot of beneficial projects that I'm really proud of being a part of. And we were not the only club; there were over 50 clubs in my university. We believed that the important thing is to help the people who need a hand, try to make their world a better place. Like, for example, in the summer of 2002, I participated in a project where we had to paint a primary school in a very poor district. The students of this school also helped us on this project, and it just felt great seeing these great smiles of happiness painted on their cute little faces.\n\nI believe that young people are a very important element of the society. But all they need is just to find the right direction. They are full of hope and faith and have a lot to give. And nowadays, they do give their best to help improve their communities."}
{"file_id": "1074721.txt", "output_essay": "Let's define what we mean by a young and an older person. For me, a young person is typically a student. On the contrary, an older person will be someone who has accomplished their professional career.\n\nFirst, we will try to define how young people enjoy their lives. I am convinced that students try to experience many things. It is said that it is the best age to travel. In fact, young people do not need great comfort to travel. Moreover, the connection with their parents begins to break. They do not really have many things that can make them stay in the same place. So, that is right; they really have all the arguments to travel, discover new countries, customs, and civilizations. But is it really enjoying life? It is sure that it is easier for them to travel, but are they mature enough to keep in mind their experiences? They certainly do not have the same approach as their parents would have by visiting new countries.\n\nIt is also important for them to experience new things like being responsible, having a budget to conserve. Those things can inhibit their lives.\n\nThen we will describe what can be the life for an older person. If this person is healthy enough, I assume that it is the best period. Your children have finished their studies, and you have managed to educate them. You can finally enjoy your life and have the profits of your years of professional activity. Traveling, taking time to cook, making sports, taking part in associations. In fact, you have time for doing what you want. On the one hand, you have a lot of time, but on the other hand, you do not. Certainly, you had established many things to do, but it is hard to manage to do all. Usually, the question is also, 'Am I still able to do this?'\n\nTo conclude, I would say that older people may more enjoy their lives. Principally, it depends on their health. It is sure they will be quickly tired, but they have their experiences to choose essential things to do. Younger people do not have this experience, but are working on it by trying to enjoy the most they can their lives."}

{"file_id": "1076020.txt", "output_essay": "Yes, I agree with the statement that 'Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.'\n\nHumans can be broadly classified into two categories.\n\nThe first category consists of those people who are happy to live a risk-free, normal life. They like to get up in the morning, do the house chores, and leave for the office, sit in a cubicle, and spend 8 hours, 5 days a week. They want to enjoy the weekend with their family and live happily ever after. The main characteristic of this category is that they want to live their life exactly in the same manner as their neighbor is living. The only example that comes to my mind for this category is the common man. This is what differentiates them from the other category of humans. They make a contribution to society as a whole, but their individual contribution is minimal. They will not be remembered because of the fact that they do what they are told to do.\n\nThe second category of humans are those who actually make the world a better place to live in. People in this category have names like Albert Einstein, Thomas Edison, Mahatma Gandhi, Yuri Gagarin, and many others. What makes them special is the fact that they were all curious and excited to explore new areas in their field. Albert Einstein and Thomas Edison made breakthroughs in science, giving us gravity and electricity, respectively. Mahatma Gandhi created ripples in the political world through his approach of non-violent movements. Because Yuri Gagarin dared to enter into space, we were able to think beyond the planet Earth.

{"file_id": "1076604.txt", "output_essay": "Can we say that successful people are the ones willing to try risky possibilities rather than running business as usual? I would think so. There are, indeed, different ways to 'try new things': launching a product that creates a new demand almost from scratch, and adding small changes to the way a business is run. As successful people would not necessarily have to make a 'revolution', bringing slight changes can sometimes be a challenging risk.\n\nFirst, let's consider meaningful changes. When taking a close look at the business world around us, there is no denial that many company leaders have succeeded in creating very profitable products that have sometimes meant the start of a new story for their company. That's what happened with Apple when Steve Jobs decided to launch the iPod. Instead of merely sticking to the core business of the company, which is selling Mac computers, this leader decided to take the risk and start a totally new product. And, indeed, he succeeded, reaching a point at which his product triggered a new way of listening to music, therefore changing some cultural habits in American society, then worldwide, and creating a new demand for his specific product.\n\nThat has also been the approach of Starbucks, which changed the way people drink their coffee: not anymore in a caf\u00e9, but walking in the street! There was a huge risk for this success story at the beginning, as it involved changing people's habits and way of life, but the risk was definitely worth it given the success of the company.\n\nSecondly, we delve into detail in a different approach: the small changes to a business model \u2013 but that can mean more, indeed, when put into practice. It can also be a significant risk to change slight things in appearance, but a very rewarding one. For example, Dell created a new way to make computers with customized computers ordered piece by piece by the customers. That was very successful."}

By careful observation, I believe that young people nowadays do give enough time to help their communities.\n\nThere are several ways to help the communities, such as by volunteering, caring for people, and participating in community activities. Many young people today make contributions to their communities by participating in volunteering jobs. A recent news report in Taiwan has shown that more and more students today are willing to volunteer at places including libraries and hospitals during their summer vacations. This may seem common in America; however, it's a revolutionary trend in Taiwan. Ten or twenty years ago, students in Taiwan were regulated by their parents to only focus their attention on their studies. Young people during that time were educated to only care about themselves, about their studies, and were not allowed to do \"unpaid\" works such as volunteering jobs. However, during recent years, young people are more willing to sacrifice their time to do volunteering works, which shows that young people today spend more time on helping their communities.\n\nIn addition, young people today care more about people, even animals in their communities. There was a horrible news report about a man who abused cats in his home recently in Taiwan. The man forced his cats to drink detergents and made them make bubbles. Then, he took pictures of this abuse and posted them on the internet. The young people in Taiwan were irritated by his actions and, by cooperation, tracked down the man's internet IP address and located where he lived. Consequently, the man was punished by the police for his actions, due to the help from these young people who care about animals.\n\nFurthermore, many young people participate in their community activities. For example, I have a friend who joined the dance club held by his community. He was able to meet lots of people with similar interests for that particular club. And if members from that club had problems, he would try to help them at no cost.\n\nFinally, young people today do give time to helping their communities. And this trend can be easily found by careful observation."}
{"file_id": "1076556.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with the following statement. In my opinion, successful people are successful only because, at one point in their life, they were faced with a challenge and they had to take a risk in order to succeed. People who only stick to what they are good at will only be 'good' yet they will not succeed if they do not take risks and face new challenges.\n\nTrying new things, ideas, and being able to overcome new challenges is what defines a successful person in my opinion. For example, if a person is quite gifted at a certain sport and is considered talented, it is still not enough for him to be 'labeled' as successful. This person will have to test his abilities against other people, try improving these abilities, and risk injury or loss, and improve even more in order to move forward and become successful. If this person did not risk losing to people better than him and overcoming them, he would never know how good he actually is.\n\nAnother example could be opening a new business. If a businessman does not risk losing some of his money while starting the business, he would not be able to make up for his loss and gain even more money. Not only is it important for a person to face new challenges to improve on himself, but it is also important to proceed forward, and see his level compared to other people or any other competition around him.\n\nFacing new challenges and taking risks is the only way a person would be able to succeed in life overall. Talent is important, yet it's not the only factor towards success. All the famous athletes, businessmen, superstars, etc. have faced many challenges and were able to overcome them regardless of how talented they were, and that's what makes them successful."}

He goes to college on his bike, meets friends every evening, has a big chat with them about movies, and then goes to his classmates' houses to have a fun time with them about the funny things that happened that day.

So, they are involved in other things and do not want to cut their spare time down. They are not so motivated like some years ago. You can see this by different organizations; they lack students to help them. Another point is the money. It is not sure that they earn some money for their help, but money has become so important for young people. Why should they help other people and offer their time and get nothing but a smile? These things do not count so much. I am pretty sure most young people would have the time to help, but they are not interested. You could get back so much if you help others. If the parents would help in the community by themselves, it would be a motivation for some children to do it too. Mostly, I agree with the statement, but there are still some individuals outside who do their best. They offer their time and are not interested in money. I know some people who tried to get money to help children, so that they had the possibility to buy toys. I babysat at various events, so that the parents could enjoy their time and had not to worry about their children."}
{"file_id": "1076207.txt", "output_essay": "The speaker hits the truth when he says that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. Commercials were originally a mode of informing consumers about the availability of a product. But over the years, the sheer innocence of an old banner proclaiming the opening of a new KFC restaurant in the neighborhood has been lost in the relentless wrath of commercialization.\n\nToday, a commercial informing viewers of what the product actually is would not even be noticed, much less lure prospective buyers to a hopeful brand. In the deadlock of efficient brands we find ourselves in today, advertisements need to be one step ahead of each other, a phenomenon previously seen only amongst the firms employing them. And this very much involves enhancing the features of the product they endorse.\n\nThe world of advertising revolves around competition offered by others, and that has brought it to such a stage where enhancing a product is a common practice. Probably the most appropriate example would be that of a recent advertisement my eyes fell upon a few days back. It promised a 'mansion draped in greenery,' but the actual house was ironically different. It was a modest two-bedroom flat, hardly something you could refer to as a mansion. But sometimes advertisements cross the limits of what would still be classified as acceptable.\n\nPerhaps the most blatant of these are the ones employed by the automobile industry. In a recent controversy, one automobile dealer in New Delhi was fined and barred from operating for a year because he had promised a prospective buyer a sedan, which turned out to be a mess of pure lies and thievery.\n\nAlthough sheer malpractice is evident in this 'enhancement' of products, some people still advocate the validity of these advertisements. A recent survey in the United States of America brought to light a staggering number of people who see nothing wrong in this new trend. It only goes to show one thing: that we have learned to live with it, and although unwanted, it has become an integral part of advertising today. So much so, that all you need to do to be sure of it is look into the local newspaper. Even though it might not tickle our fancy, if statistics are anything to go by, this practice is here to stay."}
{"file_id": "1077768.txt", "output_essay": "Apparently, young people have much more time to enjoy themselves. However, it is difficult to say that young people enjoy life more than older people do. There is a problem somewhat too complicated to speak of in an easy way. Everyone enjoys their life. Indeed, they enjoy their life in their own way. So, young people and older people both enjoy their life, but in their specific ways.\n\nOlder people, of course, have more time to work in their field to make money for their family. Sometimes they cannot have a break all day long. Even in Asian countries, older people cannot have a vacation all year round. They have great loyalty to their family. Although they may complain about their life like this, they will not leave it. Sometimes they enjoy this situation, having a chance to support their family by themselves and to grow their children in better circumstances. This is the life they actually enjoy every day.\n\nYoung people cannot help but enjoy their time every day. They have no responsibility to work for someone except for simple homework. So, young people have much more time to spend on themselves. In my experience, more time does not mean more joy. In fact, young people spend time uselessly more often than older people do. But it is obvious that if young people can manage their life valuably, they have much more chance to really enjoy their life.\n\nIn conclusion, the critical point about this question is not the quantity but the quality of life management. Although older people have less time for themselves to enjoy than younger people, they can manage their life more valuably, so they can enjoy the result."}

I believe successful people are different from normal people; they will not be scared of risks, so they try new things. Therefore, we always enjoy new high-technology products because they try.\n\nSecondly, if people just do the same thing over and over, they will not know what they are good at, and they will never improve themselves. They should try new things when they were young, to tell themselves they can do what another person did, even better than them. For example, you are a vice president in a company because you did a good job in the company, but the president gets fired. You want to keep your position or get the highest position if you take the risks, which is getting fired by the boss. You never know if you don't try.\n\nThirdly, since we already did well in something, why don't you challenge yourself to a higher level to widen your eyes? If you know the mistakes you have made, you just don't take the mistake again, and then next time you will do better. So, on you will be successful in your job. For example, you work in one store for a long time, you already tried lots of things, learned a lot in the store, you knew how to run a company and do well, and now you want to open your own store, you just need to take risks and make yourself successful.\n\nIn conclusion, it's because lots of people try new things and they were successful, so that our living standard is getting much higher. We can't stop all the time; otherwise, our lives will never improve."}

I agree with the following statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they are. Firstly, advertisements should provide information that a product has. I mean the quality of the product (whether it has reliability and guarantee). The advertisers using some showy labels, packings, etc., should stop. Because they charge even for the packings, which are expensive, ordinary people can't buy those things, even if they are daily household products that are necessary. Secondly, they use some celebrities for canvassing the product, and they offer even some royalty from commodity sales percentage. Thirdly, the advertiser attracts the consumers using graphic design and animation by showing them more fascinating than they really are. These kinds of things really work on children and make their parents buy for them. And dazzling stickers also make them more attractive. All these will definitely increase the cost of the commodity. So, I finally conclude that these kinds of advertisements, I mean, I agree with the quote that 'most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.'"}
{"file_id": "1078916.txt", "output_essay": "I agree that it is better to have broad knowledge or many academic subjects because this gives you the experience to talk with different types of people and can also help you in looking for a good job.\n\nOne of the good things about having a good broad knowledge is that you have the chance to talk with different types of people. Knowing or having experience or being specialized in different topics gives you the possibility of talking and discussing with different people of different knowledge and ideas. A good example can be if you are in a conversation about Organic Chemistry and you know about this topic, you can ask questions or get into a big discussion with other specialists on the case. This will give a good impression to the other people and make more friends or knowing more.\n\nAnother good thing about having a broad knowledge is that you can get a very good and well-paying job. Today, in our society, big institutions and companies are looking for people who are very smart or have a good understanding of something. If you can have a good understanding and know what things that good companies ask you to do, you can have a very good fundamental job. For example, today it is really essential to use a computer. Well, if you know how to work the computer and how to work many programs in the computer, you can have a good-paying job and security.\n\nToday, it is really good to know about different topics or different issues because this new society is changing really quickly. To have broad knowledge in this new society can help a lot to survive or even to have a good understanding of what all this new vocabulary is about, because many people who study only one thing can sometimes not know anything about other topics."}

There are many reasons and examples that I would like to list in support of my position.\n\nFirst, let us consider those cases in which the author's contentions, in fact, my contentions, hold good. Firstly, let us consider the field of science and technology. Consider, for example, a biology student who is faced with the problem of replacing a burned-out fuse. If he does not have any knowledge about electrical subjects, he may not be able to fix a very simple task.\n\nAlso, a student of technology should have a minimum idea of what medicine to take when a minor health problem arises. So, a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is necessary.\n\nSecondly, if, for example, a student is confined to studying only the history of his own country, which is his specific academic subject, then he may face problems when asked about world history and some important events in world history.\n\nThirdly, consider the example of designing a computer. Many people who do different tasks are involved in designing a computer. If the person who designs a part of the computer does not understand the functions of other parts and the link between those parts, then a computer cannot be designed.\n\nFinally, also, a person of science or technology may find difficulty in the business world if he does not know anything about the stock market. This can be extended even to politics. If the party members have ideas only about their own party, then they are at risk of losing their position if they do not have knowledge about the other parties.\n\nIn sum, I would like to reiterate that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject, which helps an individual enhance his general knowledge in addition to the regular subject."}
{"file_id": "1076939.txt", "output_essay": "I fully agree with this statement. Young people do not give enough time to helping their communities. They mostly indulge in activities that they want to do or having things they desire, instead of looking at the problems affecting their homes and localities.\n\nI myself, being a young person and living alongside numerous other fellows in a hostel, have lots of experiences of such neglect shown by young individuals towards social and community needs. Most of the time spent by young people goes mainly into fun activities like partying, gaming, chatting, etc., or either into studying, preparing for exams.\n\nThere seems to be no thought process in the mind that deals with the immediate difficulties, shortages, or problems that are going around the place, which need to be solved.\n\nFor example, in our institution, there is a major problem of standing water bodies in and around the campus, which provides a typical breeding ground for mosquitoes that can cause dangerous infections to the locals living in and around the area. But, despite this, there seems to be no concern shown by the students who themselves might be affected by it. The situation can grow worse if not taken seriously. Effective measures can be applied with the help of young students if they are willing.\n\nSimilarly, there are issues like the education of poor workers and their children, who work in the campus for the construction of new buildings. Young students can really help such poor people by organizing free weekly or monthly classes within the area, and it could be of great help to the children who can think of having a much better life in the future. But, till now, nothing has been done by the young people living here.\n\nYoung people mostly don't listen to the advice given by seniors or the elderly people. They always do what they feel is right. Spending time to help communities is not the popular choice in their minds. Going by what I have seen in my campus hostels, most of the young people, including me, like having fun, going to bars and restaurants, having nice unending chats, or just studying the curricular courses and interest-related subjects. Spending time for social and community services is not there nowadays among the young people."}

Indeed, the reduction or increase of cars and their effects on the environment are mainly discussed in our everyday conversation and political programs. As far as I am concerned, I agree that there will be fewer cars in use in the near future than there are today. Let me explain why.\n\nOn the one hand, the current trend is that everybody (the government, households, and corporations) has to take care of the environment, and it is going to be a real obligation in the next few years. Indeed, we all know that many things are going wrong around us, such as global warming, for example. Did you know that with this frightening global warming, glaciers disappear, and that can lead to the disappearance of the Maldives in less than twenty years, for instance? So, the point is that if we do nothing, we are certainly going to lose our planet, and we will have to find somewhere else to live! It is terrible, isn't it? The pollution contributes to global warming, and what is the primary source of pollution? These are obviously cars and their CO2 emissions. This gas also contributes to many diseases... Therefore, cars have to be reduced.\n\nMoreover, other transportation modes are developing in an impressive manner. Let's take the example of Paris. We can notice that having a car is totally impractical with all this traffic in the streets! Why don't we take the bus instead? At least we definitely know what time exactly we are going to arrive. Driving in Paris can take four or five times more time than taking the bus, for example.\n\nFinally, questions of security have become so important in our society. We should reduce the number of cars because of the too many accidents that occur. It is unacceptable.\n\nTo conclude, I will just say that there is another solution: changing our current polluting cars to ecological cars, which deeply consider and respect our environment. They can work with sun or non-polluting oils, for example. I really think that this is the best solution since you cannot order people to stop using their cars."}

For instance, a manager has to know advertising and also has knowledge of accounting in order to be an effective one.\n\nAs far as I'm concerned, it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject. There are many advantages and disadvantages of having broad knowledge of many subjects. However, I want to explain its advantages because they outweigh the disadvantages.\n\nFirst of all, knowledge does not harm the brain. It is always useful. For example, I am a math teacher, nonetheless, I have many hobbies like painting. I took courses on this topic, drawing, and colors. My friend invited me to an exhibition, and as a result of this knowledge about painting, I gained an advantage, such as having intellectual knowledge.\n\nSecondly, life is so complex and full of tasks, and as a result, every time in our life, we need various kinds of knowledge. Consequently, it makes our life easier. I want to explain this with an example. For instance, I am a student, and in my daily life, I don't need the knowledge of economics, such as interest rates. However, on the other hand, when I want to be a cashier in a bank, the manager of the bank asks me, while I apply for the job, if I know what the interest rate is and how it is counted and how it changes the amount of money. Thus, I have no chance; I have to know that if I want this job. Consequently, it makes my life easier, such as attending a job for earning money.\n\nMost important of all, people who have broad knowledge of many academic subjects are always achievers. For instance, I read Einstein's life one week ago and understood that Einstein was one of these kinds of people. He had a wide range of knowledge about everything, such as science and also math. This knowledge enabled him to establish new scientific research.\n\nAll in all, having knowledge of many subjects makes our life easier and also makes us happier at the same time, making us successful."}
{"file_id": "1079141.txt", "output_essay": "I think a basic knowledge is necessary, but in my opinion, our society needs more people who are familiar with one specific subject. Having broad knowledge does not necessarily help you to solve a specific problem. In my home country, for example, there are many people who can handle a computer, but there are only a few who have enough knowledge to deal with certain problems on their own. That's one reason why many computer firms hire people from countries like India. This situation is not so good for our inhabitants, because often they do not get a job.\n\nThis is only one example of why specialization has advantages for the economy of a country. There is no doubt that employees need a broad knowledge to be flexible, if they, for example, lose their job, which is a great problem in our country. But I think that if there are experts for almost every area, a country's economy has many advantages, although it is very risky for the inhabitants to specialize, because they may get no job in their specific academic subject.\n\nBut as I said, there are many advantages that support the idea of specializing in one specific area. But it should be regarded what size and capacity the firm has. A big company has many employees, and so each employee can handle a problem on his own. If he needs to know anything about another subject, he can ask another expert for help. So, with the help of teamwork, they can nearly solve every problem. In smaller businesses, this looks a bit different, because small firms cannot afford so many employees. So, for smaller businesses, it is better to have a broad knowledge, so that you can solve many different problems."}

Actually, we move in a very high-stressed world (obviously, in developed countries), that sometimes does not allow people to increase their human values and their helping in their communities.\n\nProbably, many years ago, young people did not use to do such things that young people, at this moment, do. We had more relationships with each other and also we had more dependence on the rest of the people. Industrialization, technical developments, new discoveries, independence, competition, stress... have really made the world change.\n\nFirstly, parents want to give their children all they did not have when they were children, and in many cases, they are making a mistake, and in this way, young people can't think about things' values and the cost of them.\n\nSecondly, sometimes children's schedules are like a minister's schedule.

{"file_id": "1079500.txt", "output_essay": "There is a common belief that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. There are people who do not believe that advertisements tell the truth, but the opponents of the subject do not think so. I also agree that advertisements make products seem better than they really are. Here are three main aspects why advertisements may lie.\n\nFirst, to think about advertisements is their purpose of preparation. Advertisements are designed to convince the consumer to buy or consume that particular product. In order to convince a consumer of a product, one should make him believe that he really needs that particular product or make him believe that the product is the best of all. For both of these purposes, the product has to be shown to be the best. This brings us the possibility that advertisements may reflect non-real facts about a product.\n\nSecondly, advertisements are prepared to increase the profit for a specific product. The producers, who would like to profit more and more, would also agree to display a non-realistic advertisement in order to make the product seem better, so that they can increase the sales. When the sales increase, the profit also increases. In short, if the product seems better, its sales increase, and this leads to a higher profit for the company.\n\nFinally, the third purpose of an advertisement is to help the company dominate in the market. Companies have to compete with each other with respect to their products in order to survive in the market. So, an advertisement that shows a specific product better than that of another company would make that specific company win the race among the companies. This again shows that advertisements are not designed to describe a product but rather make it seem better.\n\nIn short, people who believe that advertisements make products seem better than they really are are right to think so. Because advertisements are prepared with the thought of financial profits, a company would not agree to tell the truth at the cost of earning less."}

Young people might not be able to pay money, but they might be able to do some jobs, such as teaching the young kids, babysitting for the babies, making food, gathering things. Maybe if they arrange certain days for making certain activities, like the cleaning day or week, which everyone in a certain age has to come and share in the cleaning.\n\nYoung people have to improve their skills and themselves by reading, learning, especially the third world country's people; they have to raise up their countries and communities. Young people might do meetings for discussing what to do for improving their societies and their communities.

{"file_id": "1076492.txt", "output_essay": "We do not have any proof to support this statement, and so we can say many different things. When I talk to my father and we are stuck in traffic, he keeps saying that when he was a teenager, there was not all this mess. Streets were not full of cars because there was only one car per family. Now everything has changed. First of all, every year we hear about statistical investigations that give us a completely different point: the number of cars is increasing. This may be caused by the improvement of our wealth conditions. When my father was young, Italy was a poor country and was just at the beginning of its transformation into a modern country. So the actual situation does not seem to sustain the statement.\n\nThere are, however, some other considerations that we can make. Our development cannot be sustained by our planet. Our supplies of oil are getting fewer and fewer, and we have not found valid alternative powers to substitute oil by now. There is hydrogen, but it is more expensive. At the same time, electrical engines do not have the same performances as the actual engines. So if, for example, hydrogen will be our only alternative, it will probably be impossible for a family to have enough money to pay for more than one car with hydrogen as a propeller.\n\nThe other thing that can influence the number of cars is the policy of our governments. As I have already mentioned, traffic is increasing more and more every year. But it will not be always possible to build new streets and new routes. There will be a limit. This fact can already be seen in the choices of some important cities. To get into London with our car, we must pay a ticket. Also, Milan is going to adopt similar decisions. So perhaps there will be a strong development of public transports.\n\nInstead, some countries have already found different alternatives. The Netherlands, for example, is the country where there is the highest number of bicycles in the world. If you walk around the streets of Amsterdam, you will see bicycles everywhere, even in front of bars, megastores, and fast-foods. But this result is related to the choice of the government of building streets for bicycles. So the politicians have encouraged people to lock their cars in their garages.\n\nIn the end, I do not see the possibility of a spontaneous reduction of the number of cars. There are too many interests often related to the oil industry and to the factories that build cars. They are often important parts of our economy, and the governments do not want to damage them. But they will probably be obliged, with us, to change our lifestyle when the situation will get unsustainable."}

This is because feeling satisfaction through the trip and spending time well is essential.\n\nFirst of all, people have to be satisfied with their trip. People usually want to see, hear, eat, and feel what they want and have wanted when they are traveling. However, in a group tour, people cannot experience whatever they want because they have to follow their guide. For example, when I went to Paris for a trip alone, I unwillingly took part in a guided tour one time to go to the museum. Because the museum entrance fee is cheaper for groups. Unfortunately, I did not have satisfaction with the guided tour for the museum, because there were so many people, so I couldn't see all that I wanted to see and couldn't get much information that I expected.\n\nIn addition, traveling individually is better at spending valuable time. Time cannot return or be used again, so it is very important how to use time. However, in a group tour, it is easy to waste people's valuable time. To demonstrate, according to research at Harvard, individual trips spend time two times more effectively than group tours. Moreover, according to this study, people who travel individually are also more satisfied with their time-consuming and whole traveling.\n\nIn brief, the best way to travel is individually, not in a group, because it makes one feel good during the trip and allows for well-spent time."}

But serious study is critical for success. No doubt, reading varied subjects helps broaden one's thinking. But one could gather basic knowledge and information about other subjects without much effort. In this age of information and technological revolution, one can have easy access to information. Further, we do not live in isolation in a society.

Young people are full of life and like to experiment with different options. Such experimentation builds their life experiences. Exercising different options provides multiple opportunities to enjoy life.\n\nYounger people have higher physical strength to endure outdoor activities. For example, while a senior citizen may require detailed planning and preparation before they could take an adventure camping, young people could combine their youth with a sense of adventure to take up such a trip with little or no planning.\n\nYoung people also have time on their side to take risks. Unlike older people who are risk-averse, young people can take higher risks. Young people realize that in case of any negative consequence, they will have time to repair the damage. This risk-friendliness allows young people to stretch their limits and enjoy life to the fullest.\n\nWhile it is true that young people do not have as much time in their schedules as compared to older people, however, to enjoy life, time is not the sole requirement. Young people have multiple outlets to enjoy life - at work, home, or socializing. Hence, a person need not wait till retirement to enjoy life.\n\nMost of life's enjoyments will require a commitment of financial resources also. It is likely that smart older people would have achieved financial success to enjoy life; however, it is more probable that young people will have more expendable income to enjoy life.\n\nIn conclusion, while life can and should be enjoyed in every phase of life, young ones should capitalize on this opportunity. Young people have all the supporting factors in their favor to enjoy life to the fullest."}
{"file_id": "1082036.txt", "output_essay": "The following essay deals with the question of whether it is useful to have a broad knowledge or a smaller, specific knowledge of many academic subjects.\n\nFirstly, it is obvious that there is no general answer to this question, because our modern world of work is too diverse for that. A wide knowledge of academic topics is needed for responsible jobs such as politicians or higher managers. In some situations, they do not have a lot of time to decide what would be right or wrong. In such cases, they have to know things clearly and precisely to avoid wrong decisions.\n\nAnother point is the educational sector of work. People who work in this category have to know the majority of their subject in great detail as well. Professors or just a regular teacher have the duty to have a broad knowledge, because they must answer questions immediately and precisely.\n\nOther jobs may not require a huge knowledge of academic subjects, because there are jobs that need a vast background of knowing all details and all information existing on one specific issue. People working in labs do not need to know all about chemistry when they do repetitive work such as reproducing specific drugs.\n\nTherefore, easy or repetitive work does not own the necessity to have wide knowledge.\n\nIn conclusion, it is necessary to distinguish between the huge differences of our modern job world. As I mentioned before, it is not possible to give an overall answer on this topic, and it is useful to examine every case separately."}
{"file_id": "1077659.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. I believe that a lack of altruistic and selfless acts are directly spurred from economic and social reasons.\n\nIn today's world, many youths do not see a valid social reason to immerse themselves in community service. Although the majority of the world's population lives in abject poverty, those who are capable of giving to their communities are often segregated from those who are in need. Hence, the lack of awareness prevents today's youth from helping out.\n\nSpeaking from personal experience, I find that there is a gradual decline in my own community of youths who refuse to give or help out their communities in any manner. As the president of Key Club, an international community service organization in my high school, I find it more and more difficult every year to recruit new members to replace the ones that have departed. I remember when there were about 40 members in the group - now I find that it is even difficult to gather 20 members for the meetings. The only sense of giving that can be felt in my school's atmosphere is purely caused by the need to 'look good' on transcripts for college. Of course, I'm sure not all of them feel this way, but I truly think it's safe to say that the majority feels this way.\n\nEvery year, monetary donations rise in Key Club as the number of members declines. This is an economic reason why I believe that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. Inevitably, most of us in the world have been brought up as capitalists - when we give, we expect something back in return. However, when youths help out with their communities, they do not receive something tangible as rewards. Hence, today's youth neglects to help their communities. Due to this fact, those who can help and give find it extremely annoying to invest their time in helping others. Thus, their only token of help is through monetary means, which they believe is compensation for not giving time to their communities. Nonetheless, society's greed can even prevent the giving of money.\n\nIt's truly a shame to look around and see that today's youth, or tomorrow's leaders, refuse to invest their time when they are perfectly capable of doing so. It is time that society creates more awareness in young people to be willing to invest their time for others. Once youths overcome their laziness, fear of helping out, and learn that the greatest reward (as clich\u00e9d as it may sound) is the fuzzy feeling they get from giving time and helping others, it will be the massive stepping stone in getting the world's youth more involved."}

Moreover, I think that the number of cars being used is going to increase in the near future.\n\nThe first reason I would like to give is that the cost of cars is going to decrease gradually. If you observe the past trend, previously it used to be a luxury to possess a car. But now it has become a necessity. Also, the cost of cars, when compared to the past rates, is very low now. Hoping that the same trend continues, in some 5 or 6 years, even the common man will be able to afford a car. So, everybody will be rushing to own a car, and hence the number will rise exponentially.\n\nThe second thing is that cars are thought to be safer when compared to other two-wheelers. This feeling is gradually spreading in countries like India, where two-wheelers dominate the roads. If this notion becomes stronger, present two-wheeler owners will replace them with cars, and again the number of cars will increase.\n\nThe third idea is that cars can transport many people at a time when compared to bikes and scooters. So, these bike or scooter owners will also be trying to purchase cars. Also, as the prices of petroleum products are going to increase, people will think of spending money on cars and have combined transportation rather than investing in individual transportation means such as two-wheelers.\n\nLast but not least, many people think that owning a car is a kind of prestige issue. In this modern world, where people are constantly trying to show off, it won't be a surprise if more numbers of cars are purchased. Hence, in the near future, more numbers of cars are going to land on the roads throughout the world."}

As the definitions of enjoying life and how to enjoy life can differ from young people to older people on a huge scale.\n\nAs a young woman, I believe that youth enjoy life for the sake of enjoying it, not for the happiness that this joy can result in. Young people think that there are many years left in life, and we should enjoy it as much as possible before we have serious responsibilities such as a career and family. Unfortunately, sometimes enjoying life for young people means irresponsibility and carelessness in life; this is not true for all young people, but many of them interpret it this way.\n\nAccording to what I mentioned before, I don't agree with the statement that says \"young people enjoy life more than older people.\" As I believe that older people do enjoy life, but in a different way than the younger generation would understand. This is due to many reasons, like the lack of communication between older and younger generations, and their different definitions of enjoying life.\n\nFor example, I enjoy life by traveling around the world and by meeting new friends and new contacts, and I always request my mother to do so. But she, as an older generation, tells me that her biggest joy now is to raise her children well and to watch them get successful and happy, while years ago she used to enjoy herself differently.\n\nTherefore, I believe that older people enjoy life as much as younger people, and sometimes even more. But the difference is about the thinking of older people, and their experiences after growing wise and mature, which are great things that the younger generation can learn from, and therefore enjoy life more."}

Everything is organized and put in a way that every little thing is different from the other. The perfect example of this is a career in college. The programs are divided into faculties, and the careers that a person can pick from, like: Engineering, Business, Teaching, Music, Medicine, etc. Every single one of the mentioned before is specialized in a field of study, and deals with different aspects of knowledge, maths, biology, languages, politics, etc. A world of possibilities.\n\nIt is not possible for a human being to know all about something; just a little bit of everything. If a person dedicates their entire life to studying astronomy; investigating, making studies, asking questions, promoting projects, etc., surely they will get far and will acquire a huge knowledge in this field. That person will go beyond someone who studies a little bit of many academic subjects. This takes time and effort, and there is not enough time in a human being's life to get knowledge in many, many different subjects and get as far as if they specialize in one specific subject.\n\nIn school, the kids get all the basic knowledge they need to start. Then it is their decision to go for the subject that they are more interested in. This does not mean that a person has to specialize in one and only one subject and cannot know anything about anything else. This just means that that person will be more wise in that specific field and will contribute more to society and the world. Specializing in one specific subject is equal to a better and deeper understanding of it."}
{"file_id": "1080585.txt", "output_essay": "At first glance, it seems to be a baffling question, but if you take a closer look, you might reckon to say that this subject needs to be examined.\n\nThis essay deals with a broad description of why it is necessary to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects.\n\nFirst of all, I would like to say that it is indispensable for any kind of student to broaden their knowledge. Let us assume that you earned your Bachelor's degree in sports and that you would like to get some overseas working experience. Due to the fact that you attended a university that did not allow you to learn a foreign language, it won't be possible for you to fully indulge in new surroundings.\n\nFurthermore, you can just work in a small working field that does not allow you to obtain more responsibility. I am quite sure that you will soon feel uncomfortable and that you might regret that you did not take the opportunity to broaden your academic skills. Rome was not built in a day, and it is quite apparent that you can hardly obtain more knowledge from one day to another.\n\nIf those students who just focused on a specific subject, such as sports, attended different classes besides their major, it would be easier for them to survive in the capitalistic world.\n\nI am trying to reinforce my point of view with a quotation from Darwin: 'The survival of the fittest' expresses a fact based on several incidents that took place in the early 19th century. You can easily link it to our assignment.\n\nThus, what happens to those students who attended business classes besides their normal major? Let us assume that they have learned how to plan tasks and how to meet their targets via schedules and agendas. Maybe these business classes taught them how to control people via 'carrot and stick' or through normal philanthropy.\n\nThese skills would truly broaden their possibilities to apply for other jobs, such as managing sports events or leading an enterprise in the fields of sports. I am pretty sure that everybody takes advantage of a broad knowledge of many academic subjects, as I've examined in the lines above. I grew up with the belief that a person never truly finishes their education and that there is something new to learn with each day.\n\nReferring to my introduction, it is vital to succeed academically due to these hints."}

On the one hand, I think many young people are egoistic today; on the other hand, I know that it is not easy to manage social ambitions today, especially for the youth. I can imagine the young people because I am one of them. \n\nI do not help in my community, nor do I work in a social program. The reasons for that are my limited time between duties that fill my whole day. I think the possibility to help without any pay in communities is better at a younger age of children, from eleven to fifteen. Many older young people are busy with their education and own future, and too young children may not have the confidence or responsibility to work for the community. \n\nMany of the work that is to be done in German communities is made by so-called young people who have finished school. If they do not want to go to the army, they can choose social work in communities, hospitals, etc. The truth is that young people do not help for free. They are always looking for a payment and do not do any help beneficially. I am sure that there are many things that young people could do in a community."}

They also enjoyed their life at that time. This is the reason why they always give suggestions to young people about what to do to enjoy their boring lives.\n\nFirst, they cannot do what young people are doing with their fresh bodies anymore. Exactly, they want to do the movements that young people do, but their bodies don't let them do so. They cannot do what is going on because they were so healthy and they could do what they wanted to do with their legs, their hands, and other organs, but they can't use these organs anymore. It's like a drama for them, where they are acting the main character.\n\nSecond, young people are excited about this because it's a new field for them; they were born and they didn't try this life in their mother's stomach, life is starting from the beginning for them. It's normal to try everything, especially for fun. Human beings can live on this earth only once, and you cannot choose your end, so human beings must enjoy their lives. Young people are much more brave than old people because they can do everything they want to do with their bodies, but old people can't do that kind of actions. They have regular lives and they support their children to do what they personally cannot do anymore. Young people enjoy when their children can do what they said to them. They really enjoy when the children listen to their suggestions.\n\nFor my opinion, young people have advantages about enjoying their lives, and young people know what will be in the future."}

First of all, because I know many boys and girls who do not enjoy their everyday life. They seem to need something else; they are not able to be happy with what they do. Everything becomes a problem: the wedding, the children, the job. I recognize that we live in a difficult time, with political affairs and economic conditions that are not very good, and there is also the war. But I ask myself: what are the differences between the actual and last times? My father told me about the Second World War and also about the problems he had in finding something to eat and then the problems he had in taking a job. My father died three years ago, but I think he enjoyed his life more than many young people. I want to talk about another point: the wedding. I see that many people now prefer divorce to the possibility of solving problems. I do not understand very well this position. For me, having a family is a way to get better in life, but probably I am wrong because many people I know do not think in the same way. I want to enjoy living alone or going out until 5 or 6 a.m., so they refuse the idea of building a family until they are 35 or 37 years old. Probably I am the first person who does not enjoy enough her life. I try every day to put passion and love into what I do, specially from the time I live alone, now I have no father and no mother, but I see that if I am correct with other persons, I am not alone."}

I think this statement may be true for some people, but not for many other young people who actually make a great effort to help the communities where they live.\n\nIt is true that modern society is becoming more and more individualistic, and this means that more and more people only care about themselves, disregarding the lives and potential problems of other people living in their community. This phenomenon is especially affecting young people, as they are growing up in a society in which the most important values are related to personal achievements. The post a person occupies, the salary they receive, the commodities of their house, the car, the clothes, and other material things that a person may own are nowadays far more important than the ethics of a person and their behavior towards other human beings and the place they inhabit.\n\nHowever, it is not fair to affirm that all young people act in that way. There are many young people who really help their communities in many different ways. Some of them apply to take part as volunteers in programs designed to help people with different kinds of problems, ranging from disabled people, immigrants, children who suffer from cancer, old people who live alone, and so on. Some of them even travel to remote areas in Asia, Africa, and South America to enroll in international aid organizations that deal with very serious problems affecting millions of people in those continents, such as natural disasters, wars, and epidemics, among others.\n\nSumming up, because of today's society, there are some young people who are forgetting to take care of others and their communities, but there are many other young people who dedicate an important part of their lives to helping people who are in a difficult situation. In my opinion, everybody should follow their example."}

They make people have a wildly broad sight. Different courses have different logic to solve problems. For example, Geometry, that is, solves problems usually using diagrams, lines, and curves. The Data course uses a logical way to think about a question. So, when people have a problem, they can think about it and solve it in different ways.\n\nTo have broad knowledge of many academic subjects can make people feel confident.

If the person just studies one specific subject, that is hard to find a topic to communicate with other people, then keeps silence in the corner. The people will miss confidence.\n\nIn conclusion, it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.

That is what young people take advantage of \u2013 their physical condition and psychological standpoint drive them to seek gratifying experiences more often than elders do, and finally accomplish such a goal.\n\nMy grandfather used to play soccer when he was young, and that was his favorite sport. He received so much joy and gratification from this activity that he would never miss a game. Now, he is 70 years old, and all he wants to do is rest. He used to tell me, 'Soccer is it, son; once it's gone, you only live from your memories.' Now I am a soccer player, and this sport has become part of who I am, like a blueprint. My life would not be the same if I did not play, due to the fact that I find so much joy and happiness in it.\n\nThus, I believe young people do enjoy life in a more complete manner, not to be unjust or partial, but because it goes beyond what is palpable \u2013 it is a cycle, the cycle of life. Just like a flower reaches its most beautiful point and opens up in all its splendor, and after a certain time dries up and dies, similarly, a man who lives and finishes his race. Even though older people might find joy in different tasks, their cycle has already allowed them to reach a certain climax that was once considered true enjoyment, therefore leading the way for those behind them to discover and get to search for the same type of gratification, making the levels of joy definitely higher at a young age."}

Also, they attract consumers and make them buy their products by advertising. However, there is a problem with most advertisements. It is that the real products are often worse than the products shown in advertisements. Advertisements often fake consumers by hiring famous actors and hiding bad characteristics that are involved.\n\nWith such a famous actor, companies could make a lot of money in advertisements. Suppose that a certain company hired Brad Pitt. In that advertisement, Brad Pitt uses a new after-shaving lotion that the company has made. Then, consumers think that the company's after-shaving lotion has great quality because a well-known actor uses it. In addition, people believe that if they buy that product, they could be like a famous actor or they could follow the actor's fashion at least. Unfortunately, the products are not that great as people expected. Although well-known actors use it, it does not mean that their products are well-made.\n\nObviously, companies often highlight the good characteristics involved in their products, but they often hide the bad things in advertisements. There are a lot of research studies that have been done by undergraduate students related to this topic. They finally found that even though companies should inform all characteristics by law, they often make bad characteristics invisible. Companies usually put the negative information under their products so that consumers cannot see it. People often see the highlighted words such as 'This product is free from pesticides' or 'This product is the first invention in the whole world.'

Enjoying life doesn't depend on people's age because it depends on people's vision, expectations from life, and spirit.\n\nEven though some people are young, they aren't happy with life because their vision is not enough to be happy. They think that some small obstacles prevent them from being happy. For instance, I know a lot of old people who try to enjoy life despite having some disabilities.

To be a younger person is not important. This only provides people with some advantages. For example, to spend more energy and do many things in a short time, but old people organize their lives to do more things (like trips, sports, etc.) to enjoy life.\n\nConsequently, to be happy is not really related to people's age.

For example, if a scientist didn't try new experiments and went to new places and learned new concepts, he could never come up with a fact that everybody studies and knows.\n\nUsually, a fact is more respected than a concept because the fact is certain and it's there to see or to check, but the concept may be a little frightening because it's hard to predict whether it is going to be a fact or people will simply forget it. Therefore, people rather study a fact-full major than a concept major at the university.\n\nAll the new cars and the new buildings start as a concept, and the engineers modify it as they want, and when they are all done, they start doing the project. After the project is introduced, it becomes a fact for everyone who doesn't know about the concept in the first place.\n\nDenying that facts are important in our lives is wrong, but I think that they are less important than the concepts.\n\nFor example, a fact is a result of a long-time thinking and studying, ready to read and learn in a number of lines, so it is much easier to learn an existing fact than to think about one using concepts and ideas.\n\nFinally, if a person wants to get the best possible knowledge, he should consider and study both facts and ideas because the start of every fact is to prove the idea and introduce the concept."}

The exotic culture, history, art, architecture - all these are attracting people to step out of their own homes and get involved in the fantastic amusement of the tour. How can I imagine getting to our destination with a lot of people and being scheduled by the tour guide?

For example, when talking about billboards, how many times have we seen an ad or an offer for a fast-food restaurant? They show a big burger and say that we can now buy one and get the other one for free. Wow, amazed by this offer, we all go to this restaurant and order the offer, but surprisingly, we see that the burger is such a miniature that if we eat 10 of them, we won't be satisfied! So, in this case, they played with the font of the ad.\n\nAnother example will be a whitening cream. They tell us that in four weeks, we'll have a white, princess-like skin. The first step for those who want to whiten their skin is to go and buy this product. They use it for one month, maybe, but no differences at all, so we all wonder here if the problem comes from us or the product itself!\n\nToo many examples can support my answer. Let's list another one. The best example ever is the 'best seller,' which is an advertising program seen on TV. Well, here comes a catastrophe because they show too many products and try them on TV, but when we order them home, I bet we can use them for more than one week because they're bad quality.\n\nDetergents are one of the products that do not show the real effect of it. For example, when they show us a certain laundry detergent on TV, they bring a t-shirt and drop coffee, chocolate, ketchup, etc. on it, and as if by magic, all is gone, and the latter becomes white as if we just bought it.\n\nAlso, advertising for clothes, home appliances, cars, technology, etc. has an impact, and a strong one, over customers because some people, even if they don't like the product or don't use it, will buy it maybe because their celebrity is in it.\n\nI think that good companies do not promote their products. We can see very profitable companies with a relatively high profit that don't put an ad on TV, but everyone goes and buys from it. That's because it's an old and trustworthy one. Also, now we can differ from a medicine that is good or bad. Every company that promotes a medicine is certainly facing a low return, and its medicine is not that good because, in general, we put ads in order to attract customers, and who is not in need won't do it.\n\nAdvertising is an important thing, but it should have some limitations in order to be more realistic and so can attract many people. It's better to be real than a dream one!"}

I agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do because they are healthy, they have a lot of time, and they like to go out always, even when they are busy.\n\nYoung people are healthier than older people. When people go out, they only see young people playing outside and enjoying themselves when they play. For example, every day I go outside with my friends to play football and other games if we do not have a lot of work to do for school.\n\nOlder people are always busy with their work, so they do not have a lot of time to enjoy life like younger people. Older people need to make time for enjoying. Always I ask my father to make time for us to have fun and go out to enjoy, but he always says yes, but he did not do it until now.\n\nOlder people, when they are busy, do not take a break to rest, but younger people give themselves time when they feel angry or tired. For example, I give myself time when I am tired, but my father does not, and I asked him why, but he did not give me an answer.\n\nIn short, everyone who is younger will enjoy life more than older people. In my opinion, everyone has to enjoy their life every moment."}

However, one can always support ideas with the facts and figures of day-to-day life. For a student, the more knowledge one gets, the more beneficial it is.\n\nIf everyone starts practicing learning through facts, then there won't be any room for research to take place, and people will stop showing interest towards innovation and new things. For example, the fact is that a school bus fetches kids from school to home, whereas the idea and concept behind it are to make their journey more comfortable, safe, and enjoyable.\n\nUnderstanding a subject in depth is the basis of getting knowledge about it. It's always good to support your idea with a fact, but if the knowledge is totally based on facts, then one has to make sure that it is complete and accurate. When my mother-in-law got admitted to the hospital, everyone knew that she had gone through a massive heart attack, and the underlying fact that everyone was stating was that she was old enough to survive. My husband and I were more interested in knowing how to take better care of her so that she should not have many complications afterwards, so the doctor took time out to explain to us how the heart works in a human body. The impact of a fat-rich diet on blood vessels and heart, which may lead to the process of atherosclerosis, and how the heart has to do more work. After getting the concept cleared on the same, I think both of us are in a better position to take care of her and to discuss this topic with her and our family.\n\nI strongly feel that it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts, and it's always advantageous to learn facts about the same, so a combination of both is important."}

They aren't responsible for knowing information about any other subject. This way, the distribution of jobs is formed.\n\nAlthough this way job distributions are formed, knowing everything about one subject can make people boring.

They can look at the world from different angles, and since humans are social beings, a little color in everyone's life is needed.\n\nIf people only knew about one topic and had no idea about any other topic, everybody would be boring. People would only make friends with people of the same job type because they would have no common subject with people of other job types.\n\nIf people knew a little about everything and did not focus on one topic, then everybody would have to do all their work themselves, and no job distribution would be made. Also, subjects like science, history, geography, surgery, etc. would not go a long way because nobody would be working mainly on one topic. This way, new inventions and explorations would not be made.\n\nIn conclusion, I think that only focusing on one subject and not knowing anything about other topics, as well as knowing a little about every topic and not focusing on one, are both bad. But if I had to choose one, I would say that specializing in one specific subject is better than having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects because this way, the standards of life do not decrease; only people get more boring and have friends only from their own area of knowledge.

But some details need to be analyzed to prove this idea.\n\nThe first point is related to birthday anniversaries. It is common that children and teenagers are often very happy when they get one year older. This is often related to presents, parties, and lots of friends wishing a happy birthday. But old people are very often sad and ashamed of getting older, and their anniversary reminds them of those feelings.\n\nThe way people enjoy life depends on their age. It is different if we consider children, or teenagers, or adults.\n\nChildren seem to be happy very often. They can enjoy any little trick during hours and keep smiling and laughing without any relevant reason. Children do not have to worry about important things; indeed, they even do not know about them thanks to their parents, who try to keep them apart from any troubles.\n\nThe way of enjoying life changes as the children become teenagers. The main reason teenagers enjoy life is freedom. Even this often goes along with little fights with their parents, teenagers have the will to create their freedom by proving that they can be independent. As they feel free, teenagers have new hobbies, sometimes forbidden, but they enjoy the risks they take.\n\nIn opposition to the happiness of children and teenagers, adults cannot enjoy life as easily. Being an adult means having responsibilities. Adults have to work to earn money and have lots of bonds, which keep them out of entertaining and enjoying life. Moreover, when adults have children, they manage to offer their children the happiest life they can. So they do not hesitate to sacrifice their own happiness to the benefit of their family. But even if that is difficult, parents enjoy every little moment of happiness they can share with their children."}
{"file_id": "1085733.txt", "output_essay": "I totally agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. I have three reasons to explain this.\n\nFirst, the aim of the advertisement is to sell more products. No producer wants to decrease the functions of the products in the advertisement. On the contrary, the producer will try their best to show the positive aspects of the products and minimize the negative aspects. So, the products in the advertisement will only have the advantages. For example, the advertisement of the medicine will only tell the customers which disease it can cure and neglect the serious points of the medicine. Some customers will be extra-damaged by the medicine due to the negative aspects of the medicine.\n\nSecond, in order to sell more products, the producers exaggerate the functions of the products in the advertisements. The products in the advertisement will seem much better. For example, mineralized water is good for the health of the human body. Some producers take mineralized water as a panacea, which can be used as medicine to cure some illnesses.\n\nThird, the advertisement is a good too. The advertiser can sell it only when it can satisfy the producer of the products. That means the advertiser needs to make sure the product in the advertisement should be excellent, even better than it actually is.\n\nFrom the above, we can draw a conclusion that the products in most advertisements are not the same as themselves. Their functions are being enlarged in the advertisement. So, the government should care about this problem to let the customers know the truth of the products."}

And car is emerging as a basic need of the world today. Technological advances have made the dream of a common man, to own a personal car, true. The rates of the car have never been so low, and this sharp decline of prices will continue as the technology progresses. This would further encourage their sale in the near future, as more and more people will be able to afford one.\n\nIn earlier times, cars were meant only for the main member of the family, the earning heads. While today, even children and other family members use cars for their personal needs.\n\nMoreover, nowadays, the two-seater sedans are in vogue. This means that if a family of four members use a single car today, they may go on to use two 2-seaters in the future.\n\nFurthermore, the other modes of conveyance, like buses or three-wheelers, generally cause more pollution than that generated by cars. Nowadays, cars have been manufactured that use electricity or solar energy to run. The availability of such cars at affordable prices will help, to some extent, check the so-called never-ending pollution problem, and hence will be supported by the government of any nation.\n\nHowever, the increase in the number of cars will accelerate the problem of traffic.\n\nThus, I strongly feel that in the future, the number of cars being used will continue to rise, and so will the problem of traffic, but with a decline in pollution."}

If you are good at understanding ideas and concepts, then you can make yourself think of the facts pertaining to it. An idea, when brought into implementation, can be known about the good and bad associated with it, thereby making us think about the facts related to it.\n\nI feel the sequence related to this idea-concept is, firstly, the generation of an idea is important and is followed by its analysis, which is made in our brain by thinking about its results. Next, its implementation, and thereby deriving the facts out of it. So, the fact can be derived from the concept itself.\n\nIn my opinion, simply learning facts without knowing any information regarding them will be like 'eating food without knowing what it is.' The food that you are eating may be tasty, and you are enjoying it, but without knowing what you are eating seems foolish.\n\nIn this contemporary world, understanding ideas and concepts is in existence. So, when the world is running, if you still continue to be lethargic, it's not good on your part, and you can't do justice to your profession.\n\nUnderstanding an idea makes a person think about it, thereby making him develop or innovate new ideas regarding the topic. It enables man to be thought-provoking always. Knowing the fact will be a part of this process if a person adopts a habit of understanding the concepts and thereby filling the essence of studying.\n\nThus, I feel it's more important for a student to understand concepts and work upon them, mindful that he is also filled with the fact along with the idea."}

When this theory was employed by factories and manufacturing plants, it resulted in a dramatic increase in production. Of course, specialization has its drawbacks and faults, which are caused due to a lack of knowledge in other fields, but the benefit of knowing one thing really well greatly outweighs the faults of specialization.\n\nA reason why specialization is so successful is that eventually (usually after 12 years or so of schooling), people realize that they are better at some things than others, or they realize that they have a passion for a certain field and that's what they want to do for the rest of their lives. At this point in time, it becomes apparent to them that other knowledge that doesn't further their understanding of their subject choice is a waste of time. After all, if someone wishes to be a mechanical engineer, why do they need to know the literary features that Shakespeare used to capture his audience's attention?\n\nI've already decided what I want to do in life, and to tell the truth, studying things like Spanish and Business seem to divert time away from my goals of becoming a research scientist. I love reading about the latest medical breakthroughs and discoveries, but all I get by learning Spanish is frustration and low marks. I sincerely doubt the importance of Spanish in the long run; I mean, sure, it might help me communicate with people who only know Spanish, but how many people will I meet like that?\n\nThrough my personal experiences, I've learned the importance of knowledge in all areas, but I've also seen the importance of specialization, and in my opinion, to know one thing very well is a lot better than knowing relatively nothing in everything."}

First of all, it is difficult to be successful in an already developed field. People in that field have been specializing and putting their effort and energy for a long time. For example, the techniques for shoe-making are already very well established, and people in this sector know very well how to produce high-quality shoes at low costs.Secondly, change is unavoidable in virtually all areas of human activity, and people not taking any risks for exploring new things are deemed to be surpassed by the 'risk-takers'.Sticking to the same example, a person using leather as the raw material for making shoes and not willing to learn about how to use other potentially useful materials would one day have to retire.Maybe the most important reason for trying new things is the potential of generating synergy between what we already know and what we will explore: the world is divided into 'things' artificially by humans, and we can always find fruitful relations between one 'thing' that we already know and another one that we get to know.\n\nOn the other hand, history is also full of famous people who achieved success via persevering in a well-defined field, from army commanders to artists to shoemakers and athletes.The reason is that in any given area, there are many very talented people trying to be the number one; through improving their related skills and also via obtaining relevant knowledge, both of which require long periods of hard work.So the definition of success is always pushed further in terms of required perfection.\n\nAlthough the first man on earth had naturally to try new things, he also had to improve on his skills for not failing - if he had not, we would not be here.There are always new areas potentially very useful for humanity to explore.But the process of exploration requires..."}

Some of my friends said to me that they have experienced the same as me. Therefore, like this, it is common for advertisements to seem much better than they really are. We can say the same in other occasions.\n\nLike my experience, people are easily made to want products that popular and famous people, for example, artists, models, actors, or actresses, use. Companies use this method. Therefore, today, we can see advertisements in many cases. These are commercials on television or radio, in newspapers or magazines, and finally even in trains or buses.\n\nTake an example of online shopping on TV. The buyer shows us their pleasure after using the products on the screen. Or, the clerks or famous actors appear on the screen, then they insist that the products are good. Then, people who saw the TV program make up their minds to buy the product. Until we touch the product directly, we don't know whether the comment on the screen is true or not.\n\nBesides, the clerks emphasize that the product is cheap, or comes with some presents, only now. It is the way of showing it's good by the clerks. So, the more effectively they introduce the product, the more people want to buy it.\n\nTherefore, I agree with the statement."}

To peel the onion or to get to the center of the point, we need details, little facts that decorate our lives and the way we learn to see and understand the universe.\n\nGood educators are the ones that can awaken their students through a simple fact, such as a date or a number (that can be easily forgotten), using it as a door to walk and search into an unknown universe full of possibilities that let them understand the ideas that once introduced, we never forget.\n\nIt is like a game. When we play to find the treasure, we cannot forget our objective, but we have to be careful of the facts and the extra information that we can collect during the search.

It can be easily seen that well-educated people care more about their community than other people who are not well-educated. For example, think of somebody who graduated from university. The person we are talking about has knowledge of things that a community needs and can give a decision about what to do for the community.\n\nSecondly, young people can get easily affected by the people they are living with. Is it not right that young people want to be like their parents? Nor do their parents care about the community they live in, neither do the young people become the small versions of their parents.\n\nThese are not all the factors that can affect young people in a bad way like this. Has anybody ever thought that the idea of daily events can affect young people in a bad way? For instance, think about the topic of war occurring in the Middle Eastern countries.

Since today's development of technology, many things seem fascinating to people. Especially to the young people, who are curious about the society. There are too many things that young people want to experience and try, and it also includes many negative things, such as smoking and drinking.\n\nUnlike today's people, our previous generations learned to treasure their communities because they felt responsible to their own environment; it is something they were told when they were young.\n\nUnfortunately, today's values are different from before; people concentrate on physical enjoyment. But, while they are experiencing the sensation of enjoyment, they are also ignoring their obligations to their communities and society. In schools, we all have learned to be responsible to our surroundings; however, many of us have forgotten the real concept of this responsibility.\n\nFurther, there are many examples of helping communities. For example, maintaining the cleanliness and order of a community is everyone's obligation because everyone is a part of the community. But many young people do not realize the importance of this obligation. When the elders ask them for some work, they usually respond with bad or unpleased attitudes; they think it is a waste of time to help the community. By looking closely, I see many negative things that will happen as those young people become adults. Our society will be decadent if the government is ruled by lazy people; more scarily, it is not only a joke but a truth of today's young men.\n\nHowever, our society has already realized the importance of correcting the young people's attitudes. They first began the work at school by requiring community service for each student before they graduate from schools. This is an important step to start with, because school is the place where everyone goes to. Besides the effect of community service, many schools now also spread the idea of protecting our environment. Personally, I see these two things starting to work in many young minds.\n\nFinally, before we act on anything, we should first notice that Earth is our home; we are all the owners of this planet; therefore, while we are enjoying our physical happiness, we should also do something for our community. The community is not only our home but also belongs to our offspring. Even a bit of work we contribute to the community can make a change in society.

Nowadays, with travelling being such a normal thing to do, one is confronted with the choice of choosing between travelling with a group and, or by oneself.\n\nSo, can one choice be better than the other? First of all, most of the time, travelling with a group tends to be relatively cheap, and with the tour guide usually being a local, it allows the tourists to receive additional information during the trip.\n\nAlso, since the tour guide is doing this for his living, preferably as a professional career, it is ensured that the quality and quantity of the information given during the trip will be better than a tour organised by oneself.\n\nSecondly, a point that is often missed is the socialising factor. While travelling with a group, it is impossible for one not to get to know anyone. It is not a given, though, that one's fellow cohorts are as gregarious as oneself.\n\nLastly, efficiency is the key, meaning so much as: seeing a lot with little time. This allows the traveller to see as much as possible in a limited time. On the other hand, efficiency, such as many other things, is a double-sided sword. Being as efficient as possible prevents the tourist from savouring his moment during his travel, such as Mt. Rushmore, for example.\n\nOn the other hand, travelling without a group releases the tourist from the shackles of time. One can enjoy every moment of the tour, go back to an exhilarating sight, or just relax for a day - freedom is the key element here.\n\nInforming oneself is of the essence when travelling without a tour guide, though, since nothing can be worse than a tourist without an idea of what he is doing. This does not mean that one may not opt for a private tour guide, though.\n\nOf course, all of this comes with a price. With this, one can conclude that if one wants a truly informative and economically feasible trip, one should opt to travel with a group.

In recent years, we have witnessed new modes of transport coming up. The hovercrafts, the underground rails, the overhead rails, and supersonic aircraft are just a few of them. With such novel and efficient means of transport springing up by the minute, and with people becoming increasingly reliant on these novel means of transport, we can say for sure that the cars on roads will reduce.\n\nWe often read in daily newspaper reports that new airline companies are opening up. The low-cost airlines have been a big success in Europe, and the same model is being tried out in countries like India. People have changed their preferences of traveling from one city to another or from a country to the neighboring country due to the new form of airlines. This is because these low-cost airlines offer cheap rates, especially to the everyday business traveler, and these travelers have such a plethora of options in choosing the cheapest deals. As a result, people have started abandoning cars as their mode of transport for short routes. With the success of such airlines, it is definite that in the near future we will see many more such business models, which will ultimately result in the number of cars being reduced.\n\nThe organization of society is fast changing. Two major forms of establishments are coming up. One, in which the residential and business localities are under one roof, and the other in which they will be independent. If such structures are adopted on a worldwide basis, then people will have to resort to different modes of travel. In the first case, they will not need to travel, and in the second case, they will prefer public transport modes such as underground or overhead rails. This is because it will help them reach their workplace faster. This, in turn, will cause the reliance of people on automobiles to decrease.\n\nThus, we see that with the times changing, people have come to rely on various other means of transport, which assist them to reach their coveted destinations faster and in a much easier manner. These factors give us an indication that over the years, cars will be replaced by many other means of transport. I only hope that, like the dinosaurs, these four-wheeled species do not become extinct."}
{"file_id": "1085090.txt", "output_essay": "I definitely agree with the statement 'Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.' \n\nI will explain this opinion as follows.\n\nThe world is in a great stage of transformation. If people still follow the same old traditional ways and ideas of the past, we will not move further in our lives. If Graham Bell had not tried out new things, where would our communication system be? If the Wright Brothers had not taken risks, where would our transportation system be? It is all about thinking differently, creatively, to become successful.\n\nAccording to experiments, our mind is very creative. It can think about a wide variety of things in a wide variety of ways. We must not suppress our thoughts to traditional ideas our ancestors followed and stick to the rules and regulations. It may be necessary to follow some rules in some cases, but in all cases, it is not. This trying out for new things must be cultivated from childhood itself. Take, for example, a math problem to be solved. A child must think of finding a new way of finding a solution rather than following the solution given by the teacher. This makes the child better understand the problem and will never forget about it. This makes the child successful, and the success is carried throughout their career.\n\nIn the initial stages, we may be criticized for our ideas, but one should not be given up by such critics. We must remember that great people are often criticized. 'Even Einstein was questioned.' To be successful, we need to go on with our ideas and creativity, we need to try out for new things every time, we need to take risks, forget the old traditional ways of doing things, but not care about the criticism. We should challenge the critics.\n\nSuccess involves a lot of risk when we are trying out for new things. Nothing can be easily obtained. We should never be afraid of the amount of risk involved but should always head towards success after the risk. The success involving a risk gives us great pleasure than success without involving risk. 'The fruit gained from a great risk is more tasty.'\n\nIt has been proved in the past and will be proved thereafter that trying new things, thinking differently and creatively, taking risks brings great success. In this way, I support my statement."}
{"file_id": "1085178.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with the statement that people who achieve success do try new approaches, rather than sticking to older things that are familiar to them.\n\nFor example, ancient people were under the impression that the earth is a flat surface. Scientists who proved the theory of the universe did not stick to these preformed concepts but rather thought innovatively and achieved success. So, new ways and ideas are always essential for the success of a person. They allow us to increase the horizons of our knowledge and perception of facts.\n\nTechnological advances are demanding that people acquire new skills and approaches. Only those people who adapt to these circumstances will flourish in the present-day competitive world. To illustrate, suppose a person is well-skilled to type on his typewriter and is complacent with his skill, with no interest in learning computer skills, will not meet new expectations of the employer and might lose his job. Moreover, a person who adapts to the new demands and learns computer skills will flourish in his career.\n\nA successful person has the habit of exploring new ways and new things and tries to put himself in a superior position through his hard work, which is also innovative. If a person sticks to the methods well known to him and refuses to acquire newer skills, he will not get increments and promotions in his job.\n\nSome people do not dare to risk new changes in their work. But we can never discover anything new without experimenting. So, people should try new things to improve themselves, but that move should be genuine. For example, a wealthy businessman who invests all of his wealth in shares might experience a severe loss and may become a pauper. So, I feel that new approaches should be definitely encouraged, but the person should judge his move rather than hastily implementing his idea. If the person is reasonable in his approach, risks due to new approaches get minimized, and he enjoys the fruits of his innovation. So, it is not always risky to take up a new thing. Rather, we cannot achieve anything in our life without facing that minimum amount of risk."}
{"file_id": "1088092.txt", "output_essay": "In my view, while one may say that people in general do not give enough time to help their communities, I do not think that young people do not help enough.\n\nThe first reason for my view is simply that I know many young people who care a lot. Some of them would help their communities directly, by spending time with the elderly or taking care of adults' children. Some others would even do bigger things to help people in the world. For example, I have a friend who left France last year to work as a volunteer to build a school in a certain country in Africa.\n\nThe second reason for my view is that we have never seen young people caring and participating this much before. In the last presidential election in France in 2002, when Jean-Marie Le Pen, who is known to have racist and segregationist opinions, reached the second phase of the election, the first group who demonstrated in the street to show its reluctance at seeing such a man becoming the president was a group of students and some teenagers from high school. I believe this would have never happened before.\n\nFinally, I think it is important to say that young people do not always have the possibility to show that they care. Indeed, young people do not earn much money, if any at all. They are at an age where they have to give priority to their studies or have just started a job, which can be a very difficult period. Because of all these reasons, I think that even if some people think it is too low, young people are helping communities largely enough.\n\nTo sum up, I believe that while it is sometimes difficult for young people to find the time and the money to help communities, they are caring enough, especially compared to the past. According to me, young people more and more understand that they are crucial actors of the community."}
{"file_id": "1088466.txt", "output_essay": "I claim that learning facts is more important than understanding ideas and concepts. I explain my idea by using the example of the controversy surrounding Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution. Just knowing the ideas and concepts does not directly mean we have an understanding of the topic and have an opinion to act on it. Thinking about the controversy over Article 9, the argument is whether to revise it or not. Surely, understanding its history, which has kept our country peaceful for 60 years, and its idea and concept of renouncing war after the tragic memory of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, is very important. However, by just 'understanding' the ideas of its existence, we cannot protect ourselves from the threat of terrorism. So, what do we need to live? We are strongly in need of 'learning' the facts of the Japan we face now, and the ways we can take to maintain peace. What happens when North Korean missiles are launched at Japan? Do we not fight for it? Or do we fight with self-defense forces, which are well known to not suit Article 9 itself? Therefore, understanding ideas and concepts is not helpful in our lives. It is a very idealistic approach. It's good to have, but it does not do anything for us. It's not practical. What I want to claim in this essay is that it is not the importance of Article 9 that matters, but that learning facts and knowing what we can do for it next is much more important in our real lives."}
{"file_id": "1088126.txt", "output_essay": "Although I understand why some people think it is more important for students to learn facts, I think it's more efficient for them to understand ideas and concepts.\n\nTo my view, there are three reasons why ideas and concepts prevail.\n\nFirst, ideas and concepts enable a student to understand not only one fact but also plenty of other facts because facts happen once, and ideas can explain many facts. For example, you can know how to cook a specific cake, but if you understand how cakes are made in general, you will be able to cook every cake. It means that by understanding a fact, a student would be able to anticipate only this precise fact next time he experiences it. Instead, if a student understands the concept, he will be able to anticipate the outcome of many related facts.\n\nSecondly, ideas and concepts are the first things that you learn at school, and I think it is efficient. For instance, in mathematics, you always begin by learning the rules before applying them. Moreover, theory is something that gathers information from the experience of other people. That is exactly what the teacher is teaching: concentrated experience rather than a fact.\n\nLast, according to my personal experience, I think it's more important to understand ideas and concepts first. I created a fashion company, but I knew only a few things about this industry. Thanks to my knowledge that I have learned in class, I was able to adapt and anticipate things as I already knew this industry. For example, marketing concepts can be used for every industry. By using them, I was able to clear the hurdle, which was my ignorance of the industry.\n\nTo conclude, I think that ideas and concepts prevail over facts, and that is why. Still, as I said at the beginning, I understand people who think the opposite because you need facts to understand how to apply the theory."}
{"file_id": "1084478.txt", "output_essay": "The world has changed, and so have people. Young people have become more irresponsible, the world has become more competitive, and young people have started not to care about things happening around themselves.\n\nFirstly, young people are irresponsible in what they do. Young people are not helping their communities. We can't say they never do, but it has been reduced compared to long ago, when it was the 1900s, when revolutions occurred. At that time, the leading group was university students. But these days, people of that age are harming and ruining society. Since they don't have any difficulties such as coup d'\u00e9tat, war, or revolution, they have become addicted to drugs, crimes, and other bad things. They are not responsible for what they do, especially rich people, who, when they make a problem, ask their parents to solve it. These irresponsible acts by young people are ruining society more than in the past.\n\nSecondly, the world has become more competitive. Since unemployment has risen high and competition has increased, young people don't have time to help their own communities, besides community services, which they have to do as school work. Young people should spend their time more on studying to get a job or to make their business bigger. Otherwise, they will be buried by society. For example, in my country, during the 1970s, people who graduated from universities could choose the company where they wanted to work. But these days, even those from top-ranked universities can't get a job. The percentage of those who get a job was 77 percent. It means it will become harder and harder, and the competition will be more and more.\n\nLastly, young people do not care about things happening around them. Young people have become selfish because of the second reason. So, they have become dull about other people's harshness and hardships. So, when they see old people standing in the bus when they are sitting down, they rather ignore them or pretend to be sleeping. Young people don't want to involve themselves in other people's business, especially dangerous things. When I was watching a news program, I saw an interesting news report that showed a survey. The surveyor asked people what they would do when they see perverts in a crowded subway. Most people answered that they would ignore it. They think that it's not their business.\n\nAs time goes by, the world has become harder to live in. And fewer people are helping with the difficulties in societies. Even though the society becomes harder, I want to encourage young people to help their society. When they ask me why, I will answer that 'you will see the difference.'"}
{"file_id": "1086263.txt", "output_essay": "I do agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.\n\nA possible explanation would be that these advertisements are based on different surveys made by professionals in order to know what the target public wants to hear. For example, if a company wanted to sell a new skateboard, it will interview teenagers who are skateboarding to know what they are looking for in a perfect product. They will do the same with the parents of the skateboarders because they are the ones who will pay for it. Once these informations are analyzed, a publicity will be made out of that. The content of this advertisement would be based on scientific data. The target public will see in the product exactly what they are looking for; it will appear as the perfect product. However, they might be disappointed once they have bought the item, realizing that it is not that perfect.\n\nAnother way to illustrate my point is the advertisement for Kraft's dinner products. This publicity targets whoever makes lunches at home, i.e., the mother and their kids. The product is sold as a healthy and convenient lunch. The kids look really happy to eat it, and it seems really tasty. However, one can easily realize that Kraft's dinner products are not a healthy meal and are not tasty.\n\nThe publicity conceptors know that someone will be more likely to buy a product if it has a pretty presentation. That is the reason why all the products are in nice little boxes with bright colors and printed with impressive designs. Another way to make a product look attractive is by using the picture of a good-looking woman or a handsome man. Therefore, the client will purchase the item in order to be closer to the model on the box. But the product inside might not be that exceptional.\n\nIn conclusion, I think that advertisements companies are able to identify the desires of customers and make a nice publicity featuring all of them. They are able to show a way to people to reach their dreams. But dreams do not always come true."}
{"file_id": "1088250.txt", "output_essay": "In my opinion, it is better to have extensive knowledge of one specific subject rather than having some knowledge in all fields. There are a few reasons, namely accuracy, the dangers of half knowledge, and specialization being possible only after some general knowledge, that I venture to opine in favor of specialization.\n\nFirstly, if a person is more widely knowledgeable in the field of their own interest, they not only perform well but also are able to put in their own efforts in the form of information to be used more accurately. For example, a doctor, if specialized in heart and its related aspects, is capable of helping a patient more efficiently than a general physician would.\n\nSecondly, as I said, the dangers of half knowledge are not unknown to us. If we have not mastered even one subject, we cannot put in any effort to get something out of our knowledge. We do not have a sense of direction in which to proceed, and we have to stop in the middle of an invention or discovery because we do not know what lies ahead. This can also be decisive for the growth of a society as a whole.\n\nFinally, for any specialization to happen on any subject, we start with a knowledge of various fields, related or unrelated, which might help in the better understanding of our field of interest. So, the knowledge of all academic subjects is, in a way, the foundation stone of any specialization and is therefore a part of the learning process. Like I stated, if it is a cardiologist in question, then they would have some knowledge of the whole body's functioning, as that is evidently related.\n\nThus, I can safely say that specialization not only helps in developing our skills in our own field of interest, but it also is the destination for some knowledge that we acquire in all subjects. Eventually, helping us to mature as an individual, as an expert in our field, and in the growth of society as a whole."}
{"file_id": "1085663.txt", "output_essay": "I do not believe that the given statement is true. Indeed, I understand the logic that lies underneath that assumption, but personally, I do not have the impression that it is a veracity.\n\nFirst of all, it is important to analyze why someone who only meets success is more likely to take risks than somebody else. As a matter of fact, when you succeed in a project, you feel satisfied. The more you achieve what you want, the more you become confident. Then, it is like a spiral: the more you get, the more you want to get. In fact, when you plan to start a business and it works well, you think about expanding your activities. If it works and you are already at the head of a big company, you may diversify your business. That is why big companies like Bouygues are in building, mobile phones, and so on. Virgin makes discs but also develops its own mobile phone programs. Those companies take risks while entering new markets. They believe in their success because they are supported by their customers.\n\nHowever, new things are not always done by successful people. Creativity, for instance, has nothing to do with success; it is about personality. So an artist does not always meet success. Nonetheless, his or her desire to create will still go on. That explains why a lot of painters did a lot of breakthroughs after many failures. Another example is Alain Baraton, a famous gardener in Versailles. He has failed during his school years, but then, while he worked in Versailles, he developed a passion for gardening and created new arrangements around the castle. Besides, you cannot be successful all the time, but it does not mean that you are less willing to do new things. In addition to that, someone who really wants to be recognized by society and has never achieved that goal will probably try everything he or she can.\n\nAs a conclusion, success is not so closely tied to 'boldness' as the statement suggests."}

They say that they do like it because they want to avoid people, planned moving, and take a break with self-time. Although it is a suitable reason, traveling in a group with a tour guide has many advantages that deserve our consideration.\n\nNot only can group touring reduce danger in abroad nations, but it is also really convenient and enables us to visit essential points.\n\nFirst of all, group touring with a tour guide includes less danger of tripping in foreign countries than tripping alone. Since people are not familiar with foreign nations, there are many dangers of fraud or accidents. For example, many Koreans are frauded by foreigners during an East Asia trip. It includes murders, robberies, and so on. Moreover, if there are accidents in foreign countries, people usually become embarrassed, so they cannot do properly. However, since guides are usually people of that country, they are well aware of the country's conditions and situations, so dangers decrease much.\n\nNext, group touring is really comfortable and helps us to see essential places. Since tour companies already make plans and reserve completely, people can enjoy their journey with only following schedules. For instance, it is needless to say that there is no danger of lacking hotel rooms because companies have already booked them. Moreover, as stated above, guides know well about that country, so they can bring us to the most famous and beautiful places.\n\nAs I mentioned above, a group tour led by a tour guide has many advantages. It contains less danger because we are doing it in a group and led by a tour guide. Also, it is convenient since companies already make a schedule about the trip; all we should do is follow the plans.

In my case, when I traveled with a tour guide, there was a place where I wanted to stay for a longer time, but he said, 'We must go to the next place.'

{"file_id": "1085846.txt", "output_essay": "Over the last century, advertising has become one of the most developed and important activities in humankind. It surrounds us everywhere today: on television, of course, in the street, in the subway, on our cars... We cannot avoid it. Some may say that: 'Most advertisers make products seem much better than they really are.' Do they? Is advertising that simple? Do they not take into account the risk it creates when the customer will be disappointed? \n\nFirst of all, the question seems simple: of course, they do; they surely will not make their products seem worse. They are paid to sell something to people who did not even want to buy it in the first place, who did not even need it sometimes. They must create a need in customers' minds and a will to buy precisely that product. How could they do that without making their products look good, even better than they are, to kind of sell a dream to people? It is not what they do it for, but in the end, they kind of give hope to people, like when one sees an advertisement that would make one believe that the product it defends is exactly what one has hoped to find during all these years, or that it is so much better than all its competition. That is why in all soap spots, the laundry is whiter and smoother than ever, or in all shampoo spots, the actress' hair shines more than ever. \n\nHowever, is it always like that? Do not advertisers fear people stopping buying a product because they were deceived by the difference with the ad? Actually, even if it is not to be more honest with people, some advertisers use other techniques to sell their products. They can choose to criticize their competition in order to make their product look better by comparison. It is what is important in the end that the buyer chooses your product over the others. It was used by Coca-Cola in a spot in which a little girl shows her deception with the voice of a Godfather when she is given a Pepsi Cola and not the Coca-Cola she ordered. Advertising could also use reversed psychology, maybe to play with people's curiosity, like the campaign using 'do not go and see that movie, it is bad' for instance. \n\nTo conclude, I would say that whereas other techniques exist, most advertisers make products seem better than they really are. Nowadays, even though people know all they see in advertising is not true, they fall for it anyway, and that is how the consumption society got this far."}

Sometimes we would fail and cry, but soon we would try again until we succeed. Then, we soon try another new thing and get more and more ability. To me, I believe learning new abilities is a life-long process for successful people. We should take risks to try new things in order to succeed because it provides us with opportunities to benefit from life, improvement, and correction.\n\nTrying new things benefits people's lives because people could gain many usable skills that would be useful in the future. For instance, Bill Gates gathered valuable knowledge of computing in his early life. He then used this knowledge to establish a unique computing system - Windows. The new ability allows Bill Gates to be the richest man in the world in his later life. Trying new things always lets people gain wealth. Thus, people would always pursue studies even after they have been working for a long time.\n\nWhen people try new things, they would get improvement that they could not get from doing things already familiar. For example, if I read a book that I already read before, I would probably learn very little or nothing. The book is of no use to me. In contrast, if I read a new book about 'How to Straighten Your Personality,' I may alter my old way of doing things. I could improve my way of doing things. Last but not least, people could make corrections while they try new things. The reason for that is that people can make comparisons. The new things would let people rethink the way they do old things. They thought they did things pretty well, but actually, they did not do it right. Therefore, successful people always try new things in order to correct the mistakes that they did not realize before.\n\nIn order to be successful, people should always not hesitate to try new things.

The tour in a group can feel like one family, with brothers, sisters, uncles, grandfathers, and grandmothers. So, there, we feel very happy by spending time with all the group people, and there is no worry as there is a guide who helps and shows all the locations all the way.\n\nIn a group, there is no need to worry about security problems or feelings of loneliness. In a group, we may have many concessions in fairs and some packages that are offered at low rates, which is an advantage for traveling in groups.\n\nThe best example is when I was in high school; we had a tour to New Delhi. Meanwhile, we enjoyed all the way in the train by singing songs, dancing, and commenting on one another. After reaching there, we, in a group, visited all the tourist spots and spent very jolly.\n\nIt was the time when I visited the same locations alone, and I felt very bad, even not interested to see all the places. Another reason is that the people with whom we like to have the tour may always be busy or unable to have time to come with us. So, we never feel like missing them when we move in groups. We don't know the time spent with them; it is like a magic that may make us forget all the things and move to the new world of dreams.\n\nEveryone likes to visit all the places, but mostly they think about the traveling time and the expenses. If we travel alone, the expenses will be more; we should spend more on commodities for our needs.

In my opinion, in the early ages, people can do lots of things easily without worrying about anything. They just decide and enjoy what they do. I agree that young people have more chances to enjoy life for the following reasons: having fewer dependencies than older people, and the desire to learn new information and have experiences.\n\nFirst, young people have fewer dependencies, such as looking after someone, the need to earn money, or health issues - obstacles for traveling to countries - than older people have. Young people are able to travel to different countries easily without thinking about anyone staying back, like children. For example, my parents have three children, including me. If they want to travel to Spain during the rest of their time, they cannot leave their children because children need to be looked after. In this case, young people who do not have any children can easily go for traveling.\n\nMoreover, young people usually want to learn and gain a lot of different kinds of experiences during their early ages. I can remember when my brother was nineteen; he used to go to music festivals, theaters, and travel a lot. Basically, he enjoyed a lot because he had time, a sufficient amount of money, and energy. Also, he could easily adapt to difficult conditions whatever he faced. I cannot imagine that older people join a party and a boat trip on the same day.\n\nIn conclusion, older people and young people cannot be compared as to whether young people enjoy life more than older people or not.

I think that advertisements definitely show the products in a better light because they don't mention the dangers of the product. Furthermore, the real price is often not viewed.\n\nFirstly, advertisements should change our consumer habits. Thus, the products are displayed better than they really are. For instance, McDonald's tries to attract people by showing consumers photos of their burgers. The burgers in the photo are made of plastic because they look fresher than the real burgers.\n\nWhat's more, the advertisements don't show the dangers of these products. Let's take McDonald's again as an example. It is commonly known that the products of the fast-food restaurant lead to overweight. Nevertheless, the advertisement doesn't mention any of these disadvantages because McDonald's wants, of course, people to buy their product. Another example is toys for little children. As they are often produced in China, they contain materials of low quality. In some cases, the toys are even toxic for the children.\n\nThese are dangers that are definitely not mentioned in the advertisement, an unacceptable way to distract from dangers in my opinion. Thirdly, the real price is always hidden in the advertisement. For instance, the big airlines try to attract people with cheap offers, e.g., one flight from Munich to Berlin for only 30 Euros. In fact, this offer doesn't represent the real price because it doesn't contain the additional fees of airports or the extra costs of the fuel. Actually, the flight costs about 55 Euros, almost double the price of the advertisement.\n\nAll in all, advertisements screw up reality. McDonald's tries to offer its burgers with photos that don't view the real burger. Additionally, the hazards of the products are not mentioned. Hence, McDonald's and Co. distract from the problem of overweight by showing salads that seem to be good for health. It is a fact that these salads even have more energy than normal burgers. Moreover, toy-selling companies want to make their toxic products attractive to the consumer. Finally, false prices annoy the consumer.\n\nAs far as I'm concerned, I think the development of advertisements should be stopped. Products should be bought by people because they have good quality, instead of being consumed only because the advertisement makes it seem much better than they really are."}
{"file_id": "1091257.txt", "output_essay": "There are many things people should know and learn because knowledge is increasing every day. Therefore, it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject, as it can help people improve their social lives, develop their other skills that they have not yet discovered, and get good jobs.\n\nHaving broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better because it can improve people's social lives. For instance, when one talks to other people who like sports, even though one may not like sports, they can still discuss sports topics with others. Because they know about sports, they can create good friendships by communicating easily.\n\nMoreover, learning various subjects might help people discover their other skills. For example, a doctor who always works every day may one day study dancing and find that dance is their interest. Therefore, they have another skill and interest, which has a big difference between being a doctor and a dancer.\n\nFinally, it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects because it is easy to change to a better job. Because people have a lot of skills and knowledge required by some companies, they are likely to be hired by any company. For example, there are two people interviewing for a job. One has wide knowledge, but the other has specific knowledge. There are much more chances that the boss will hire the first person.\n\nConsequently, having broad knowledge of many academic subjects can make people not only get good social lives and develop their other skills but also get good jobs."}

Some people think that advertising is not very effective and does not do any wonders. On the other hand, there are also some people who think that advertising really has a lot to do. And I think I would be counted in the second group.\n\nAdvertising may make anything better by good picturization of that product. The better the picturization, the better would be the fascination towards the product. And looks matter a lot. For example, we go to some coffee shop and there we see a lot of coffees, and all the coffees are totally unknown to you. Which one would you like to have? Certainly, that looks most appealing to you. Isn't it? That is where advertising comes into the picture. It's the magic of advertising.\n\nAdvertising enables us to show the good sides of anything. As we all know, anything in this world is not perfect. All things have dark sides too. So with a little help of advertisement, we can highlight the positive points of some product and can hide the negative parts.\n\nFor instance, let's take the example of cold drinks like cola, Pepsi, etc. These drinks are so popular among people. But the question is, why are they? While we know that these drinks are not good for health. Even then, they do a great deal of business all over the world. Credit for this should go to advertising. Advertising totally hid the negative effects of the drinks and made them popular.\n\nNowadays, even some schools are providing training on how to do advertising. These schools consider advertising as an art. And we all know what art is for - to increase the beauty of something. And that's what an advertisement does. An advertisement increases the worth of the product.\n\nA coin has two faces. Now, it is up to us how we are going to show it to others. Advertising not only tells us how we should present something but also how to present it with even better looks. In conclusion, advertisement enhances the worth and beauty of the products. And that makes people buy them."}

This statement is very true, as a person who tries to do things differently and takes a different approach towards certain things in life proves to be successful, but success cannot be guaranteed. If a person goes about doing things as he usually does and is perfect at, he will not suffer any loss, but will be stable - no growth and no loss. These are the people who like to play it safe in life and lead a life without stress and tension, whereas taking risks in life is a stressful thing, but you can increase your growth only by trying new things and innovating ideas and ways of doing things. A careful analysis is very important about the type of risk being taken and what is the appropriate method for going about the decision. Most business houses have been successful because of their ability to take risks and try innovative strategies and plans. Such people like to enjoy life to the fullest and are determined about what they want in life and work their way up to it. \n\nI believe that people should take risks in life, but they also should be careful and know the pros and cons of taking the risk. They should take risks that they can bear. Without taking risks, a person cannot achieve what he wants; he will have to be satisfied with what he has. Only people who have the thirst in them to achieve what they want take risks; some succeed and some fail. Therefore, it has to be well strategized and well planned in order to reach the objective and move ahead in life. Risk has extreme consequences - you either succeed or you fail, so people should take risks knowing what they are getting into. Therefore, it's not everyone's cup of tea to take risks, and those who do not have the heart to bear the loss should not go ahead with it."}

{"file_id": "1089601.txt", "output_essay": "When it comes to students' learning, the discussion of the issue has become a vogue during the last decade. Considering the social atmosphere today, some people hold the opinion that learning facts is more important for students than understanding ideas and concepts. Others, however, contradict learning facts. Personally, I agree that understanding ideas and concepts is superior because it has more advantages.\n\nFirstly, those people who agree on learning facts forget a universal truth, as an old saying goes, 'you don't know the smell until you test it.' As I remember, the people popular in society all have strong abilities that can play a role in their work areas. These abilities cannot be learned in classes, because they need more practice in the real society.\n\nIn addition, another more essential factor why I advocate understanding is that learning facts without understanding will soon be forgotten. An example I can give to illustrate the argument is that some people like to copy others' work in order to hand it in to the teacher, but they never understand what the answers mean, because they only learn to do, not to understand. Thus, they couldn't get the knowledge.\n\nOf course, choosing to learn facts also has advantages to some extent. For example, the teacher always gives us the right answer, which could avoid wasting time; they also guide us to the shortest way to reach the results; and they do good for us to make a better life; and so on.\n\nBut if all these factors are contemplated, the advantages of understanding ideas and concepts carry more weight than those of learning. To sum up, based on the above discussion, it is obvious to conclude that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts."}

For example, I trust a person who has more knowledge than I do. My football coach has a lot of experience, having played football in the NFL for four years. Because he has more professional skills and knowledge, everybody trusts him. Then I realized that the more knowledge you have, the more trust you get from other people. The trust unites the team, and it makes a team stronger. It is not only applicable in sports, but this statement also fits in a company. If you have a trustworthy boss, your company will be more united than having an untrustworthy boss.\n\nHowever, broad knowledge can change your surroundings, and it also helps you become a great leader. Because people tend to believe a person who has more knowledge than they do, broad knowledge is needed by a person who wants to have many friends around them. The people who have many kind friends always have broad knowledge. They have friends who are good at history, math, computer, and sports because people who have many friends have many connections between these kinds of people. Without any connection, nobody wants to be friends because they will not have a topic to talk about. However, broad knowledge is needed to make many friends who will support your life after graduation.\n\nIt is better to learn many academic subjects before you graduate from university because it will help you after school life."}
{"file_id": "1089959.txt", "output_essay": "I don't really agree with the statement that says learning ideas and concepts is more important than learning facts, because I believe both of them are important skills students need to learn to possess during their learning periods, and they both are crucial for those who wish to become a person who can think critically and creatively.\n\nFirst, I believe that learning ideas and concepts from previous scholars and great thinkers is important for students who haven't yet possessed a fixed thinking style. Since they are still young and changeable, they can learn from others' ideas and beliefs and find out what kind of ideas they would prefer more, and try to adopt those ideas in their own daily experience. For example, a student can try to examine whether the idea that cooperating with others is always better than working on one's own is true or not, while using different techniques when working on a project. If this student finds out that working together is more efficient, he or she might want to try this method again in the future.\n\nSecondly, I think that there are a lot of different angles from which we can look at one thing or even an object, which means that there are a lot of aspects for us to examine a fact when using different ideas and concepts. When students learn a fact, they can try to use their previously learned different ideas and concepts to look at it. After examining things from numerous aspects, through different ideas and concepts, students will start to understand the diversity of every single fact, and eventually, learn to think critically and flexibly. For example, a student might find out that working with others is sometimes more efficient, but there are also a lot of risks he or she might encounter.\n\nFinally, it is always important for each of us to have our own set of ideas and concepts towards this great universe; we need to try to come up with our own thinking system and develop our unique ways to examine different facts. We learn from others' ideas and concepts; we examine these through our daily experience; we match them with facts to see if they are correct; and finally, we will develop our own way of thinking. These are the reasons that make me believe that both learning ideas and facts are important."}

Older people find it difficult to do that. But the older people had the time to adjust to the world, and they must have enjoyed it at that time. So, I agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do.\n\nIn fact, I am part of the young generation right now. I, of course, enjoy my life. Going to school, exercising my body, and exploring the new world are all enjoyable for me and other young people. To do them, pioneer spirits, healthy bodies, and motivation for getting new things are required. However, it is a heavy task for older people. Among them, some people still have those powers, but most people tend to be less motivated. For example, my grandmother does not want to do anything except for her routines, which are to take care of the household or talk to only similar people every day. One time, I asked her to travel with my family. But she refused, even though she was very healthy. She just did not want to leave her house and normal environment she spent with.\n\nOn the other hand, we young people are not afraid of new life or environments because we have a lot of dreams for the new world.

{"file_id": "1088862.txt", "output_essay": "In today's global environment, some people prefer to do routine tasks to be successful, while others prefer to create new things to be successful. \n\nPersonally, I believe that successful people try new things and take some risks instead of doing routine things.\n\nFirstly, people who try new things and take risks are generally successful in making profits in a business environment. In these days, most corporations prefer innovative employees. Innovation means creating new ideas, such as new products and new services. The new products developed by corporations, especially by employees, are successful. As a result, these companies can have higher profits. Generating new ideas and things can provide success for an employee. For example, I had an internship experience in my country two years ago in the summer. I observed that managers who are in high-level positions always talk about innovation. Also, they suggested that I should be open to new ideas.\n\nThe second important point is the demand in the world. In today's world, in society, people have higher demands with regards to products and services. When a buyer buys a new product, one can be bored with this new product in two or three months. To provide new products, the market needs people who can take risks to create new things and be successful. For example, Bill Gates, who is the owner of the Microsoft Company, is the best example of this situation. When Bill Gates first developed Windows, he went to IBM to sell his product. However, IBM rejected his offer, and he set up his own company. As a result, he has become the owner of the highest-valued company, and his products are used in most parts of the world. He is successful because he took some risks and created new things that are beneficial to society.\n\nThe other important point is life satisfaction. People are born to survive and create new things. Every person has skills to create new things, so they use their skills.\n\nTo sum up, successful people always generate new ideas and take risks for their trial. In most cases, they are successful and happy. Routine tasks are boring things, and people who do routine tasks do not have enough life satisfaction."}

For a moment, let's take the phrase 'enjoying life' as having fun and doing lots of things.\n\nYoung people are active because of their age. Their age is a big advantage. They have the energy to do lots of things. For example, traveling, riding a bike, running, and, of course, things that most older people don't have much energy to do. And, of course, they may have kids, maybe even grandkids, to tie them into the life they currently have. This may be their only satisfaction in life - to be able to achieve lots of things that younger people have not achieved yet. Because of this satisfaction, they may have no need to really experience different things.\n\nOn the other hand, I cannot really say that young people can enjoy life much either. The 21st century really does not allow many of us to explore. With the need for a successful job, the need for a diploma appears. With the need for a diploma, money comes into the story. Well, we all know that we cannot grow money on trees, so we start working part-time or full-time at an early age. On top of working, we have to study in order to graduate. Even after all of this, the only time we will enjoy life seems like retirement. Well, again, when we retire, we are considered older people. So, tell me, who are the people that really have fun? Younger or older people?\n\nHaving fun is not about age or activity. It is about being able to enjoy life at its most. We are the ones who determine the term 'enjoying life' for ourselves.

The reasons that support my argument are disclosed as follows.\n\nFirstly, it would be of great advantage to be accompanied by a guide because it proves to be beneficial to be directed in a place that a group is not well acquainted with. It is better to be guided in a place that is new to us because it prevents the group of tourists from being split up in case of any mishap. Therefore, the group is led in unison, preventing the chaos of losing some members. Hence, it saves a lot of time to concentrate on the purpose of travel.\n\nSecondly, employing a guide provides us with details of all the important places to be visited. Therefore, it provides us with a good review of all the important places without missing any. This again saves us time in searching out for places to be visited.\n\nThe third point of advantage of employing a guide is that of the awareness of the places visited. A guide really provides us with very valuable information about how, why, when, and other related questions of the places visited. Therefore, it is of great advantage as the knowledge regarding the places is complete.\n\nAnother advantage is that of communication with the people of that habitat. This is really very important because the right way of communication with the local people might be really very difficult in most cases. This might mislead a group in knowing certain things, for example, the whereabouts or a route to a monument for that matter. Therefore, if a guide is accompanying us, we need not really face the communication problems as he translates the dialect of the local people and speaks out what is really understood by us.\n\nAnother important advantage is that a guide might really help us to sort out our accommodation at an economical place in case we are paying more for the stay than we are actually meant to pay. This again proves to be an economic advantage of employing a guide.\n\nTherefore, from the reasons that I have disclosed, I really favor employing a guide, although it is a bit expensive."}

{"file_id": "1092270.txt", "output_essay": "To be afraid to do something new is inherent to all humans. Failing is a very unpleasant thing, and the best way to avoid failing is not to do anything. But if history has taught us something, it is that the only way to improve and be successful is to try new things and take risks, no matter how hard or painful this might be.\n\nThe Western world as we know it came hand in hand with industrialization. This period of history is known to be a time where steam and dreams made massive productions, better goods, and an increase in quality of life possible. Without people taking risks and failing hundreds of times before finding solutions, none of these could have happened.\n\nAnother good example of the results of risk-taking actions is the development of airplanes. Probably all of us have seen some old movies of the first plane prototypes. Crazy machines that look more like games than real planes. But after years of trial and error, someone got it right. And thanks to that, it is possible to travel in hours to places that otherwise would be impossible to reach.\n\nI have a personal example, as a Brand Manager of a wine company. No one believed that we could develop a wine to be as fun as beer. ``It is simply not wine's essence to be fun,'' an important manager once said. But my team and I strongly believed that it was possible to do it. So after a lot of mistakes, we finally developed ``FRESSCO,'' a new brand that combines wine with fresh fruit in a completely innovative packaging. The results: FRESSCO is now one of the top 3 wines sold in Chile and has become a real competitor to beers.\n\nSo, concluding, even if being afraid to do something new is always a challenge for any person, it is fundamental to know that innovation is the only way to progress. It is true, mistakes can really be painful, but the reward of doing something new compensates for all."}

For example, opening a new business, like a restaurant, would be a risk for people who do not have the expertise in that type of business. However, if they ask for advice from experts in that area and make a sound judgment of the possibilities of that particular business, it is good to take the risk.\n\nAnother example of a type of risk that people can take in order to reach success is taking the chance to apply to a university to get a degree. Some people think that they will be rejected, and because of that, they just keep in the same position that they are at that moment, maybe because they have a fear of failure. If they do not work hard to get what they want and do not risk the possibility of feeling rejected, it is something that, I believe, will affect them in the future when they think about the things they have done in their past and did not do it. That won't make the person feel successful.\n\nFor all these reasons, I believe that successful people should take risks and learn to do new things in life."}

For instance, there are many interdisciplinary fields, such as Biophysics and Biomedical Engineering, which require knowledge in two or more specific subjects to understand. Secondly, the knowledge of many subjects can provide the advantage of making analogies. It is possible, for example, to explain the Cardiovascular System with the concept of Dynamics of Fluids, which is a subject of Physics. With more known subjects, it is more clear to understand new concepts and make analogies with concepts known in the past.\n\nThirdly, it is important when pursuing a work position to have knowledge in several academic subjects because the salary will be higher. People who have degrees in different subjects can obtain better positions and higher incomes than people who just know one subject.\n\nFinally, the importance of several knowledge areas can be summarized as understanding different fields that require a strong background, like interdisciplinary sciences, making analogies with known concepts, and obtaining better work positions."}
{"file_id": "1096607.txt", "output_essay": "I disagree with that statement. I have three reasons why I have an opposite point of view. First, I think that continuing one thing for a long time is capable of making a person successful. For example, a doctor has looked for a more effective cure for his patient to get rid of his patient's suffering. He has to think about risk and return. He should not take high risk and high return, high risk and low return, or low risk and low return. He has to take high return and low risk. If the doctor tends to take risks, what happens at the end? Second, I think that it is more important to concern ourselves with old things. Trying new things is a means to throw away old things. But old things that you had thrown away long ago may bring you a great chance. That is a possible story, isn't that? Third, obeying that statement has the possibility of losing tradition. So we should look at old things and low-risk factors more intensively. That may make us successful."}

Newer sources of energy are being pursued, and more efficient ways of using resources are being researched continually. The demand for transportation will always remain, and people would always like to travel in their own personal space.\n\nThe most common fuel used for running cars is petroleum, and this fuel will be in great scarcity, with its demand increasing as years progress. People have already started switching to other sources, such as hybrid cars, which provide a combination of electricity and fuel on which the car can run. Researchers and scientists are continually trying to harness the potential of hydrogen (H), which, if successful, can be easily used to reduce any dependence on other fuels because of its abundance on earth.\n\nGovernments of various countries are making efforts to make the use of public transport, such as public buses and trains, more common. For example, in the United Arab Emirates, a huge project is presently under construction for the metro train. Various governments are trying to relieve the dependence of a commuter on cars. But this does not mean that every single person is going to make use of the train or bus at all times.\n\nMany people need to travel short or medium distances frequently throughout the day, pertaining to their job requirements. There are also people who do not like to travel in public or need to travel in controlled atmospheres because of medical conditions. This category of people will always require that some sort of personal transportation be available, which is also comfortable. This requirement can only be fulfilled by a vehicle such as a car.\n\nTherefore, cars will always be there as a means of transportation and will definitely not decrease in number from what is present today. Various new sources are being developed, and some may also be discovered by scientists and researchers. It is only a matter of time before something more efficient than petrol comes into the picture and replaces it."}

Nevertheless, early in my studies, I realized that to enhance my criterion regarding international dealings, I would have to delve into the area of sociology.\n\nIn-depth personal research on this subject has not only refined my capacity to understand but also my capacity to negotiate and go beyond the evident, specially when dealing with different cultures and perspectives.\n\nAmong my favorite authors is Dr. Kevin Skandia, who in his work, 'The Clash of Civilizations,' strongly bears, in one of his chapters, on the subject of leadership and how to be successful.He states that in order to become a leader and a pioneer, you have to get out of the conventional; you and I have to go beyond the 'establishment' to break the way things are done so as to create a better way to carry on things.Obviously, people have to take risks and have to be aware of failure, so successful people will go after their goal, knowing in advance that they probably will fail, knowing that this is the best way to succeed.\n\nMy work as a specialized purchaser for Walmart, one of the largest retailers worldwide, has faced me with enormous challenges that have demanded full effectiveness to work well under pressure and competition. This experience has helped me to realize that innovation and imagination are two important tools to succeed anywhere you are, and again, in order to be successful, we have to go beyond and try new ways to do our duties.\n\nSince it is company policy to upgrade the expertise of employees, we are consistently enrolled in conferences and meetings, many international in nature, that have given me many opportunities to exchange ideas and share decisions that helped us in our everyday jobs.While exchanging ideas or having conversations with people around the world, our conversations often drift to more casual topics like the everyday decisions we have to take in our lives, and we remark on the importance of being sure of yourself and sure about the things you are to carry on in order to be successful.\n\nAt the end, I have always thought that only a few people have the courage to do something else in order to break their 'status quo,' and those kinds of persons are the ones who change and succeed in what they are after, so I do think that successful people try new things and take risks."}

In fact, from my point of view, young people are less responsible than mature people. Generally, in recent years, the way to enjoy life has changed. In fact, today, young people have fewer problems than young people of forty years ago, for example. Today, a boy depends totally on his parents. In this way, he has less responsibility, and this causes a total dissatisfaction for all.\n\nInstead of young people, older people have achieved total maturity that permits them to enjoy life more than young people with small things, like a simple dinner with friends or a trip with family.\n\nIt is also true that young boys have a lot of enthusiasm compared to older people. But this concept doesn't go over the problem. There are also cases where older people don't enjoy life because they have very big problems, like the fact of not finding a job or, for example, because they are very tired.\n\nSo, my personal opinion is that young boys, in a state of parity of conditions, don't enjoy life as much. In fact, also in my family, I see that my parents enjoy life more than me and my brother. Finally, in this way, I say that I disagree with the above statement."}

I want a good job and a good career, I want to marry and have a family.\n\nOld people enjoy life not less than young people, but I think that they have already left this important moment of their life and they prefer to stay together in quiet and not busy places.\n\nAn example is my grandmother. She is 78 years old. She likes to stay home to watch TV or to read lots of books. She likes to cook and to fill her leisure time with her friends to speak. On holiday, she likes to stay every day in the sun, she prefers to go out for a walk to look at the landscapes or to eat ice cream.\n\nI think that young people and old people enjoy life, but they have different interests and different ways of experiencing life.

People can travel for pleasure to exotic places like Hawaii or Bermuda, or they can travel in search of culture, like Egypt or Japan.

These activities are for relaxation and fun. You do not need a guide for that. However, if you are planning to go to Egypt, for example, you will need a tour guide.\n\nA tour guide is a person who knows about the area and, most importantly, knows about history. When people travel, time is very important, so you need to see and learn as much as you can in less time. Therefore, a tour guide is the right person to accomplish this goal.\n\nA tour guide not only knows about history and important places but also recommends good restaurants, places to have fun, and places to avoid due to security concerns.\n\nI remember when I went to Mexico, my friends and I went to visit some ruins, and we hired a tour guide. While we were on the bus going to the city of El Carmen, the tour guide started explaining and talking about these ruins, and by the time we got there, we knew what to expect.\n\nI would like to go to Egypt in the future with a group of friends, and we will definitely be led by a tour guide.

And that if you just learn the facts of the events, they won't last in your mind that much.\n\nAn example that I believe can be given is when high school students learn about historical events. If they just memorize dates, names, and places, they will be able to remember them just in order to apply them in a test, unless it's a super important subject of history.\n\nBut if they analyze the situation, analyze the events that occurred, and comprehend why that event occurred in the first place, they will like the subject more, they will feel a little bit smarter, and the dates, the names, and the places will be left in a second place. So, this will even help them when they will have to memorize dates and such, because they will be able to associate the purposes and reasons of the events with the numbers and the names.\n\nI believe that it is not necessary for learning to be boring. If you just memorize everything and study just because you want to get a good grade, you are not doing the real purpose of learning; you're just dealing with a lot of problems and getting yourself tired and bored.\n\nStudying can be fun if you understand everything; you will feel smart. If you just learn the facts without actually understanding what they mean, you will feel bad and less intelligent. So, I think that teachers should encourage students to exceed themselves and to develop their intelligence, and not to memorize a thousand books without understanding anything or without even learning things that will truly be helpful in your life.\n\nPeople who are truly smart can solve a problem without the necessity of consulting someone else who's supposed to be more intelligent. And if you need to read something a thousand times to actually get a hold of the idea, you're just a mere puppet, and it's pointless to live as a puppet because, at the end of your life, you will feel bad for having restricted your true intelligence."}

All of the previously mentioned forces students to keep on with their mental growth. Facts are obviously helpful; however, that's as much as you'll get from them. Facts will avoid learning because most of what you do with them is memorize and file them in a redundant folder of your brain.

My classmates and I, chosen to represent our school in the meeting, were newcomers and needed an explanation in order to fulfill expectations. We weren't clear about the process. Our highly demanding teacher made us participate in a re-enactment of last year's meeting, and even though it took us a while to get the idea, once we got the hang of it, we cleared our doubts and understood the concept. Model UN is not just another extracurricular activity; it was an opportunity for success. We were training our minds to think for others, to speak for those who can't for themselves, and to come up with resolutions to worldwide problems. That is the truthful concept of the Model UN, and we knew that even before getting there. Once we got to La Ceiba, the Model UN scenario, we had an ultimate learning experience.\n\nOur instructor could have listed a series of facts, and sure, it'd help, but we'd have to wait until the next meeting to outstand and get the idea.\n\nIt is always a clever move to be able to have an image of what the teaching is supposed to go and not walk blindly through a learning path.

However, I disagree with the idea for the following reasons.\n\nFirstly, success can be achieved if you continue doing what you already know how to do well. For example, in Japanese traditional arts like Kabuki or Noh, the performers repeat the practice of the same story every day from the day they start practicing when they are 3 years old or so to the day they die. However, we all admit that they could succeed in fully expressing the traditional arts as parts of Japanese culture. The same also applies to traditional craftsmen or even professional baseball players. They improve their abilities by repeating the same things that are most familiar to them every day. These examples are enough to deny the statement above.\n\nBesides, even if trying new things brings you chances for success, new things must mean things that are new to everyone, not just to the person alone. Someone who always changes their focus cannot have a chance to get success."}
{"file_id": "1093616.txt", "output_essay": "People do not always reach success by trying new things and taking risks, even though sometimes it is necessary. If someone has the formula for success, whether they found it or it was given by the environment, they should not change it unless they want to or are pushed to do so.\n\nCarlo Ancelotti, coach of AC Milan, an Italian soccer team that has won several tournaments and awards under his guidance, declared on the day before the final of the Champions League, 'A team that wins never changes (set up).' The next day, using the same players as the previous game, AC Milan won the Champions League, the most prestigious tournament in soccer. Just like Carlo Ancelotti suggested, something successful should often remain uncorrupted to succeed again.\n\nNot everyone, though, already has this opportunity in their life. This is the case when a person should try new things and take risks. For instance, considering a large and profitable factory, the son of the boss will not have trouble reaching working success (considering this is the kind of success he is looking for) as his heritage includes a business already started and well run. However, one of the workers in the factory has great manual skills, but in the factory, he does not gain much profit and does not fully use the resources he has. If he never took a risk and never tried anything new, he would always work in the same factory and hardly reach success. Instead, if he decided to start his own activity, taking the risks that such a choice brings, he would have a much larger chance to succeed.\n\nNevertheless, looking at the society on a bigger scale, risks might be necessary to succeed and develop. In fact, there is one important factor to consider: competition. The pushing force for many people is often other candidates who try to reach success by doing something innovative. Unfortunately, there are times where the success of one is the unsuccess of others. This cycle, in fact, is infinite. The positive aspect of this situation is that the society will always offer newer and more innovative things.\n\nTherefore, success is not always found by doing something new and taking risks, but there are times where the situation requires it."}

The second reason is that you can get professional development and get a good job, and the third reason is to solve specific problems.\n\nThe first reason, which refers to being an expert in the matter, explains the idea that some people have the knowledge to get the information and can explain and show results.

For example, if you have a Ph.D. in Computer Science, you can be a candidate for big companies like Microsoft to contract with you.\n\nThe third reason refers to the idea of solving specific problems. For instance, if you are studying something related to medicine, maybe you can find the solution to big problems like HIV or cancer or diabetes.\n\nIn conclusion, I agree with the idea that being a specialist in some area is better than getting just general knowledge, and to be a specialist is equal to saying an expert in the matter, and maybe being an expert in the matter brings you, in the future, professional development and opportunities to access better jobs."}

But often, you do not have enough time to study for such an exam, and therefore, you just learn the most important facts by heart to succeed in the exam. However, you forget the facts you learned by heart very quickly, and after a few months, nothing is left anymore, and you take only a minimum of what you have ever learned at school with you.\n\nThis is not a very good preparation for life because at school, you often only learn how to reproduce facts about a topic in a few days. By practicing ideas in an enjoyable way, such as in group work or role plays, for example, you keep the essence and the main content of a concept in mind. That way, you do not have to feel under pressure to learn facts very quickly by heart; you can enjoy learning! And if you enjoy learning, you will take more essence with you.\n\nTeaching concepts and ideas may contain ideal ways of behavior that you could never teach with the help of facts. Students can learn about values and strategies that are important for their future life. If they understand the background or the concept of something they learn, they will always be able to reproduce these strategies of behavior in daily situations. And in my opinion, this is the task of school.\n\nSchool should prepare all of the students for their future. It is up to a school to teach values and virtues because very often parents fail. It is sure that values cannot be taught by giving facts or by learning things by heart. Values can only be taught by practicing them, and therefore, I agree with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts."}

There are two reasons for this: being more active than older people and having more experiences.\n\nFirst of all, young people are more active than older people.

When my family tried to hike Mount Fuji, which is the largest mountain in Japan, my sister and I could get to the top. However, my parents could not do that.

For example, there is a crossover between Law and Political Science, so any specialist who is interested in Law needs to study a little about politics. And there are many sciences that are concentrated from many sciences, such as Biochemistry and Economic Law.\n\nFurthermore, specialists need to know some information about broad sciences to build bridges with other specialists. They and other people need each other to provide their knowledge, experiences, and research. For example, a professor of Physics will get a lot of benefits from a professor of Math, which will encourage their ideas and theories.\n\nMoreover, a broad knowledge expands awareness of the mind, giving a lot of information that cannot be found in a similar lab where a specialist stays. For example, a professor of Law cannot know anything about periods of Arabic poets if he does not deal with an Arabic Literature professor.

{"file_id": "1091757.txt", "output_essay": "There is an ongoing debate about whether it is best to travel in a group with a guide or not. Some people insist that it is better to take a trip alone because it allows them to explore the new environment freely. However, I strongly believe that following a tour guide with a group of people is the most efficient way to travel because people can enjoy the most beautiful and popular sites in a short time and also learn interpersonal skills by socializing with the team members.\n\nFirst and foremost, with a leader who knows about the sites, people can save their time to enjoy the most renowned places. Some people say that this kind of traveling does not satisfy every other member in the group. However, as the guide has experienced every kind of traveler, he/she would surely be able to schedule the best course for the most members. According to a survey released by the Korean National Research Center, more than two-thirds of the surveyed people who had traveled abroad responded that they would like to take a trip with a tour guide who knows about the places. In this survey, they answered that a tour guide who has already taken numerous trips would be able to lead them to the most magnificent and indispensable spots they can't miss. Also, they replied that as they have the best way to drop by all the remarkable places in their heads, it would save their time rather than traveling all by themselves with a piece of map. Therefore, traveling with a tour guide as a member of a group is the most time-saving and efficient way.\n\nMoreover, by socializing with others in a group, people would be able to have more benefits. In these days, social skills are considered to be important requirements to move up the ladder. And by traveling in a group, they can achieve needed interpersonal skills. For example, an adult who decides to take part in a group traveling to India has to deal with troublesome behavior and incomprehensible words from others. In this process, he/she would be able to learn how to remain calm on the face of others' irresponsible behaviors and eventually be on good terms with them. Traveling in a group will finally turn out as a precious memory of not only having been to various kinds of spots but also making relationships with many different kinds of people. Furthermore, he/she would be able to succeed with the social skills he/she has got. In this sense, traveling in a group does good to each individual by teaching them how to harmonize with others.\n\nAll in all, traveling in a group is the most recommended way to take a trip because it is the most efficient method with a guide, and people can achieve social skills by it."}

Although some might say that such people tend to have failures because of the high risk, I think that most of them have success in terms of their personal achievement.\n\nI prefer the idea that people should try to do their best within their ability and resources. And, even if they fail, I think they have had their own success. This success means that breaking one's own limitation could be happiness for people. For example, there was a man who quit a big company and started a small coffee shop. Even though he was so enthusiastic to make the shop profitable, he eventually went bankrupt. I saw, however, in some magazine that covered his failure story, the man said he felt so happy because he could know his limitation. I think that knowing one's own limit could be success since it could be helpful for people to have a good life in their future.\n\nAnd, it could be too easy to do what others can do easily. In this circumstance, even though people can have some profit, I cannot say it is success. For instance, after Henry Ford introduced a commercialized car for ordinary people, many car makers tried to follow and jump into the car industry. Nevertheless, they were just followers. They did just what Ford did. While some car makers still make great profits, in my opinion, they are not truly successful. They imitate what the great man did.\n\nOf course, the followers can have great success. They can reduce costs and attract consumers a lot. They might be some kind of successful people.

People have to work individually, but they also should work for the group to which they belong. Not a specific group, I mean; they have to participate in public, for example, in a school or in a family. Teenagers are not familiar with their responsibilities as a student and also as a family member.\n\nUsually, people start learning to be a part of a community in a family. Children should study lessons, show respect to older members, while parents should work for the family and help their children to become better adults. Besides the general idea, they also have to love each other and have a good relationship. Unfortunately, young people avoid getting closer to their parents. They don't listen to the advice an experienced adult can give; instead, they start getting away from their home. Teenagers even want to be with their unknown friends rather than spending time with their brothers or sisters.\n\nAnother example where young people show responsibility is in their schools. They have to participate in classes, study for exams, and also study for the future to get a good job. Recently, students think school is somewhere to get away from home or have fun without preparing for lessons. They see the rules as challenges that they have to break and get attention. Then, school disciplines have more strict rules to control them. So, the community they try to work falls apart. Teenagers should give some of their freedom to have a peaceful school life.\n\nTo conclude, young people should sometimes act like grown-ups to control their lives better.

In fact, there are only young star players in professional leagues of these sports. In addition, it is not only the number of sports they can do but also the risk of injury when they play the sports. The possibility of getting injured is higher in older people's cases.\n\nSecondly, young people can travel more easily than older people, especially in foreign country cases. When we trip to somewhere, we sometimes face cultural differences with other people who live in that place and should have a flexible mind to accept such cultural differences to have a good relationship with them. Moreover, sometimes it is necessary to communicate with them in their own language. In that case, we have to learn another language to communicate. It is easier for young people to learn because of their flexible and fresh thinking way.\n\nThirdly, young people have enough time to do what they would like to realize. Basically, older people have more social responsibility, especially if they have sons or daughters. It is quite difficult to make time to do things in the quite tight situation of older people.\n\nFourthly, there are a lot of chances for young people to change situations according to their preferences. For example, it is easy to get a new job for young people rather than older people because they have a lot of potential to learn more about new jobs. The main reason is they can work more time due to the law. Currently, it is difficult to have jobs for people over 60. Some people who would like to work cannot get jobs because of these reasons. In young people's cases, it fully depends on themselves."}

It is expected that they be enthusiastic about giving back to the community that raised them.\n\nBut what actions constitute 'helping' our community?

Small acts of kindness - like helping a senior citizen cross the road - are often cited as ways for young people to serve the community. I believe that any work - paid or unpaid - done for the right intentions should count as helping our community.\n\nHaving said that, I think that the amount of time young people nowadays devote to their communities is regrettably lacking. I personally know a few young people who have never done an hour of voluntary work in their lives. Not only are they uninterested in the welfare of their fellow citizens, but neither do they see any point in serving their own family members or friends. Since they fail to see beyond themselves, there is no hope that they will give any time to help the community at large.\n\nMost educated young people have a vague sense of responsibility involving their communities, but there are so many distractions that prevent them from devoting time to it. Peer pressure, new technology, the mass media, and pop culture simply teach them all to concentrate on themselves and try to live a happy, materialistic life. It is a pity, since so many young people are led away from exercising their civic responsibility. No matter how much they are told by parents to help their community, it is impractical if there are so many distractions in their lives.\n\nMany young people do a small part in helping the community by doing community service. However, performance isn't satisfactory either. Even if they are doing voluntary work for no monetary pay, many young people are inevitably waiting for payment in some other form - points for an academic scheme, an impressive mention in their resume, or an award for 'outstanding service.' If they are intent on these superficial rewards, what follows is that the extent of their help will not be proportionate. Moreover, what little heart they have for service will diminish quickly, and of course, this is definitely not 'enough.'\n\nIn some situations, it is certainly understandable that young people choose other activities over service. Students should put their studies on high priorities, and young people in general seek excitement and new experiences, so they are entitled to some level of self-centeredness. In fact, pursuing wild, creative ways of doing things will probably be a help to the community, if these young people choose to lend their talents and innovations accordingly. This requires a much deeper understanding than exists in the young people of today, but it also goes to show that the measure of contribution is hardly as simple as time - it involves an awareness and some heart in all of us."}

But new knowledge can only be gained by daring to step aside from the enlightened path and searching in the darkness. Risk has to be accepted as a part of this search.\n\nTo become successful, you need to distinguish yourself from the crowd, and this also means accepting some risk. One possibility to do so is by exploring new ways and, thereby, inventing something new or developing new skills. Successful entrepreneurs, for example, are usually recognized as risk-taking people. Innovation is the result of their effort to become better and make things better. With their success, they shape our economy and our society.\n\nIt is people like Bill Gates who changed the world we are living in today; and he started in a small garage, working on something people at that time might have called 'crazy' and 'useless.' He definitely tried a 'new thing,' and that is what made him very successful.\n\nAnother proof that success and risk-taking go together can be provided by the financial markets. It is taking the risk that pays off. But that does not necessarily mean that risk is uncontrollable. Information can be gained and used through personal effort to assess the quality of the risk. So, to become successful, it is also necessary to get informed, implying that one cannot only do what he knows how to do well already but has to try 'new things.'\n\nAcknowledging this, I have to agree with the given statement."}

The way of reaching their purpose is making consumers admire them. So, products must be attractive and appeal to other senses of the consumer. Demands must be created by advertisements.\n\nThe advertisement is one of the marketing tools. It isn't given a direct message by advertisement; they are general, imaginative, colorful, and attractive. It mustn't be boring. Advertisements serve the six senses of humans to create demands.\n\nFor example, orange juice advertisements, all ages of people could be a product. Messages might be power, energy, sex, dream, healthy, even as like medicine. Even pictures of nice, real oranges and more colorful, but its ingredients are sugar, water, fruit perfumes, glycos, fruit nectar, etc. Maybe they will create an enjoyable atmosphere in the background of the advertisement, for example, a young people's party. That could be a message of sex, romance, etc.\n\nSo, a successful advertisement will be determined by the rate of consumers. So, how much separate people earn profits, add value are important points of making advertisements that products seem better than they really are."}

First, recently, concern for environmental pollution is getting higher. Of course, it is not caused only by cars, but the great number of cars apparently affects the air and water, and so on. Moreover, in our daily life, cars are a very notable element to the environment.\n\nSecond, from the aforementioned first reason, the number of proprietors is not increasing like before. For example, my parents thought it was a dream to buy a car when they were young. Now, I am almost the same age as them at that time, but I do not need a car. I do not feel it is necessary to have one. The meaning of having a car is changing more than before.\n\nThird, many vehicles have developed very well, so we can go anywhere by using them, such as trains or airplanes or ships. Moreover, although there is not only one company but also a lot of companies offering their vehicles with competing prices, we can use them cheaper than before.\n\nSome people may disagree with my opinion. The market of motor cars is still strong now, therefore it will never decrease in number. Of course, in Japan also, the market is still vigorous. If I watch TV programs, I can see a lot of commercials throughout the time. Even now, a lot of people may be purchasing their new cars. But I think that the recent mainstream has changed obviously, that is to say, recently the most motivational stream is the new type of car that never exhausts any pollutants. In addition, eco-cars are famous and popular, which use not non-renewable resources, petroleum, but electricity. I think that this shows our view has changed from before.\n\nTherefore, I agree with this statement that recently fewer cars are in use. The number of cars will change into fewer."}

Why I used 'tend' above is that it is a possibility, not an absolute solution for successful people; otherwise, the answer should depend on how to define 'successful people' and how do successful people succeed? If success means money, and someone who is called a successful person comparatively, but not a real money bag like Bill Gates, there is no absolute answer for success. However, even in that case, the possibility for success is consistently changing up to the definition of success or how much they are successful.\n\nApparently, the possibility for success is given to people who are willing to try something new. Because in the fields that have been well-known benefit makers, many people have already taken their benefits from that, not much is left for others to gain, and it could be called a monopoly. It's like fossil fuel depletion. A small part of the world is still taking big gains from fossil fuel, and there is no chance to get entered into that industry, because those fields are already full with prior property.\n\nIn a given situation, like their DNA, such as their looks or how they are smart, like how much money they get from their parents, the possible way to improve their possibility for success is to challenge the uncovered world. Even though they are having a risky business, which is originated from itself (because it's new!), the people who only do what they already know how to do well cannot easily catch up with those people who try to do something new and achieve great-great success rather than great or just success.\n\nI am aiming for great-great success, like I wrote above; what I require to get the goal is to improve my creativity, to be creative enough to find something new and explore it.

One simple example is when I used to love labeling the heart diagram in biology class but just despise explaining Newton's First Law of Motion in physics class.\n\nOn the contrary, when there is a written response question on a test, it would be much easier for students to respond when they actually understand what they are talking about rather than just knowing the fact.\n\nAnother broader example is when we had to make a student committee with the job of spreading the word in school about aiding with recycling and cleaning up.

On the other hand, young people are busy going to school, doing assignments, and working to support their life. For example, now I am attending law school and I spend most of my time preparing for classes. Also, I do some part-time job because I need money to socialize. However, my parents are retired and they spend most of their time traveling, planning trips, and so on.\n\nSecond, older people tend to have enough budget to enjoy their life. For example, my parents love traveling and they went to Peru and Western Europe last year. I also like traveling abroad, but I do not have enough money, so I ended up traveling domestically by renting a car and staying in motels.\n\nThird, older people are more likely to have concrete objects regarding what they want to do in their free time because there were many things they could not do when they were working as a result of insufficient time. For example, my father's dream was to visit Peru, which he could achieve because he was unable to get enough long vacation to go abroad when he was working.\n\nIt is true that young people are healthier, and some older people cannot do what they want because they cannot move. There are, however, many older people who are organizing poem clubs or reading clubs and enjoying their life regardless of their immobility.\n\nIn conclusion, older people are enjoying their life much more than young people because they have more free time, more financial resources, and have a stronger desire to do something they could not do when they were young."}

Their families spoil them to no end, which leads the youth to be unaware of what is going on in their community, let alone the world.\n\nThe thing with young people these days is that they are being brainwashed by some industries and are victims of these industries. Like the food industry, which created a new form of ideal for women's bodies, and nearly all young girls are concerned about their weight more than anything else. This nonsense is what is taking their minds off other things, like helping their community!!!\n\nAnd this generation, which I am a part of, is very self-centered because what is expected from them is perfection. Which, we all know, is impossible to reach. So, to reach that impossible goal of themselves, they give their full attention to themselves.\n\nI know the things I wrote down are a little bit off the topic, but thinking twice, they are somehow related. Youth is striving for an unrealistic goal, making them imperfect by way of characteristics, just the opposite of what they are striving for.

A student might agree that the subjects they are learning in school are useless and meaningless to learn. This is not true because as you grow more mature, you will realize that the things you learned in school really come to help in real life. So, it is better to study and have knowledge on various types of subjects rather than having unlimited knowledge on one subject.\n\nIt may seem better to specialize in one specific subject when you get a specific job that requires those knowledge skills you learned. Well, this is just in your career. When you get out to the social world, the things you learned are too professional that no one, but you and people who work with it, understand. If you want to get involved in a social life and understand life better, it is better to know many things. For example, when you go to a party where all kinds of different people gather, you want to talk to people, but you only know that specific topic and do not know other topics that people talk about. As a result, you will be secluded and feel alone.\n\nIn conclusion, it is better to have broad knowledge of many subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.

A community job integrates you into your environment if you are new. It can also help you to find friends, or the community helps you if you have a problem. It also can give you social support if you do not know what to do or have no other things in your life. It is a good way for older people who do not have to work anymore to get a job for their life.

I considered this piece of paper for a very long time and came to the conclusion that it is more worth distinguishing between young and old people than between female and male. But nevertheless, I am of mixed opinion concerning this question.\n\nOn the one hand, you might get the impression that young people enjoy life more than older ones if you observe from outside. But the only reason for that is that young people live their life more actively than older ones. They try new things, have fun whenever there is a chance to have, and make their own experiences in order to develop a personality. Students, for instance, like to go to parties or hang around at the beach playing soccer because they know that in later professional life they will not have the chance to act like that.\n\nOn the other hand, older people have gathered a vast amount of experience during their life. Consequently, they do no longer feel any pressure to act like younger ones. I believe that they also had an active, excited life in their youth. But with a certain decrease in age, other things like family, health, or financial security become more and more important for them. So, in my state of view, they simply have a distinct way of enjoying their lives. They get their satisfaction by going for a healthy walk in the park or having a cup of tea with their husband or wife in a nice restaurant next to the beach. Unfortunately, these facts are invisible to people who observe from outside, so the wrong impression might come up that older people do not enjoy their life.\n\nAll things considered, I would state that neither the young nor the older people enjoy their life more.

I met a few people, old and young ones, and I often had the time to talk with them for a while. Everyone had their own life story, and many of them really liked to tell me about their positions in life and their experiences. Now I would like to describe two really significant conversations I had.\n\nThe first conversation I had was with an older woman. She was about 80 years old and lived in a pension for the elderly. She was very sick but always had a smile on her face. We met several times, and we always talked a lot. She told me great stories about her and her husband Karl, who died two years ago. All the time, she felt absolutely fine with herself and the world around her, and that's why I asked her one day what her secret was like. She laughed and answered me, 'Young lady, do not believe that I do not know how cruel life can be; I have seen it.' But this is the reason why I am so lucky. I thank God for what I have, and I enjoy every day in my life. It is a question of perspective.\n\nThe other situation I would like to describe was with a girl of my age. She wanted to kill herself because her boyfriend had left her two days ago, and she thought life would be over now.

Actually, from my point of view, facts are just as important as ideas and concepts.\n\nFirst, without facts, how can ideas and concepts exist? Ideas and concepts cannot be separated from facts. For example, when we learn the concept of force in physics, students need to conduct experiments to be aware of the fact that there are different kinds of forces everywhere in the world. The teacher will confuse the students if he or she just draws a symbol and points it to them, then says, 'Look, it is what we call force.' By doing this, the teacher is at risk of being fired.\n\nSecond, students should not just grasp the ideas and concepts but also know the detailed facts in order to pass the exams. For example, in an exam of a biological course, students should remember the exact examples of animals in order to describe the process of reproduction. I cannot imagine a person can write down all the materials the teacher wants without any facts. Although there may be some exams that allow students to take books with them, remembering the exact facts benefits the students greatly, because they can save the time spent on referring to the books.\n\nThird, students should learn facts in order to find a good job in some cases. For example, I major in computer science, and it involves a lot of programming. The mathematical concepts and ideas do help me learn theories of computer science. However, it was when I tried to find a job that I realized that facts, such as the parameters of the computers, did me a big favor in finding a job as a programmer.\n\nIn conclusion, while ideas and concepts are important in learning, facts are of the same weight to students."}

So, it is a sort of chronological process. \n\nI do not think, for example, how a student could come up with a certain invention or innovation in a certain machine or subject without clearly taking in all the basic facts of how this machine works and the basic scientific factors controlling its function, or they may end up with a catastrophe. \n\nAnother reason is that the study of facts broadens the horizon of the student's vision; then, they would be quite capable of finding out the concepts and basic ideas by themselves, by studying how everything in life correctly works. It is only after passing that stage of basic learning that their ability to investigate and relate new concepts and theories develops. \n\nYoung students tend to be arrogant if they believe that they know concepts and ideas, which would be useful only after ensuring they really learn the facts and can use them in the proper context. \n\nAnd last but not least, education is an active process, and unless students are forced from their youth to learn hard and are given facts and certain assignments, they would be reluctant to offer anything useful to the world or be aids in the world's progress. \n\nIt is at that young age that students could be taught all the human sciences and knowledge, and if we start by teaching them the facts and basic sciences, we will not end up with an ignorant generation. \n\nIn conclusion, I believe students should be taught facts and basics of sciences rather than merely being given ideas and concepts, as it would not help them enough to proceed in their careers."}

They stayed there for three days, but they had no guide to lead their travel. The heavy rain caused a flood, and after that, they fell sick. Unfortunately, they had no medical care to attend to them. Fortunately, a local tour guide helped them from danger, because she could communicate with them and found some pills made from a special plant.

Sometimes I feel that I need to play with dolls, but my ego controls me, especially in front of people. I know I'm young, but within limits, on the other hand, I can do things my mother cannot do. For example, I can use computers, which is something my grandmother cannot do, but my mom can, such as cooking. Being old is a thing we cannot run from; with years, humans lose lots of their life. But if you think of the things old people live with, you will know that every person takes what is his must own of happiness and fun to be fair. Someday I will get enough of fun and wish that I will find fun in my children's eyes. It doesn't have to be something I do; the only thing I think will make younger people have more fun is that they have more time to try and lots of empty places to fill in their memory. Fun is nice, but looking for it is even nicer. I'm out of time, but I still try to pass this; it's hard to look after fun with it."}
{"file_id": "1099116.txt", "output_essay": "I totally agree with the given statement because I've taken broad knowledge from my school till college. I think it is very important to have knowledge about the things around you. Studying or specializing in just one subject is not enough in today's world. For example, to become a doctor, a student must not only take science classes like bio, chemistry, physics, and math, but they also have to take some elective classes as well (politics, economics, humanities), in order to understand how things work around them.\n\nI'm an engineering major student; I've completed most of my science classes, but I've also taken classes like history, art, sociology, which helped me to understand the importance of the other subjects. These classes developed the understanding of other topics like politics, history, sociology, and world religion in me. I was very surprised to know how important these other subjects are in order to understand the nature of our society. After taking all these classes, my way of looking/thinking about the people around me, or in other words, the society that we are living in, have changed a lot in a positive way.\n\nSomeone who doesn't get a chance to learn about the other subjects finds a hard time getting a job, because their knowledge is just on specific subjects. In the modern world, companies are looking for people who have knowledge of all sorts of fields, rather than having knowledge on just one field. For example, there are more chances for a computer programmer who also has some kind of background in the field of electronics than the other programmer who just knows about his own programming field.\n\nIn my opinion, it is really very important for all of us to have knowledge of all aspects of life. If you go to universities, it is very common for a student to have a double major, that means to have a degree in two fields. Because they know what companies are looking for once they graduate. That's a kind of having another tool when others don't work. We should definitely have knowledge of other fields as well."}

I believe that selling and gaining money from a product has a very important and coherent chain. And advertisements play a very important role in this chain because without an advertisement, the product won't be known by lots of people. Then, you will not be able to sell your product to many people because your product is not well known, and also because you didn't sell enough to gain people's trust, so your product is not trustworthy enough. And because of this, you will not gain money. And because you don't have money, you will not be able to produce your goods. And finally, your company will be closed.\n\nIf you look at the big companies like Coca-cola, you might understand what I am talking about. Coca-cola today is a huge company and has lots of factories in lots of countries because it introduced itself to the whole world through advertisements. Even in our country, Turkey, they have very big advertisements. In every month, they produce a new 'creative' advertisement to attract people to buy Coca-cola. Because they know that advertisement is a very important and helpful way to introduce new products and also to show and make them remember their old products too. So that's why they put lots of money into advertisements to make people buy their products, even though Coke is a very unhealthy thing.\n\nFor another example, fast food advertisements. We all know that fast foods are very unhealthy things for us. They have lots of chemical things that are not needed by our body. But when you watch McDonald's TV advertisement and see a billboard advertisement of Burger King, you immediately think about eating a hamburger and drinking a Coke and eating extremely unhealthy French Fries.\n\nSo advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. Even though they are extremely unhealthy and not needed by humans, you immediately want them. But this making-better seller is not just for foods and drinks; it can be a car advertisement, or a game console advertisement, or a clothing company advertisement, or every single thing you think of."}

There are two reasons for this: the ability to concentrate and maintaining memory.\n\nTo begin with, learning facts is easy. I think that simply listening to a lecture does not necessarily mean people are learning; it is all that some people can do. However, understanding ideas and concepts is not easy. For example, when I understand the idea behind a theory, I have to study very hard. Therefore, understanding is equivalent to studying hard, which improves one's ability to concentrate.\n\nIn addition, the things that people spend much time understanding are not easily forgotten. For instance, a theory that I only listened to in science class was soon forgotten. However, when I studied the theory by reading a book about it very hard after class, I did not forget it for a long time.\n\nFor these reasons, I agree with the statement that it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts."}
{"file_id": "1100270.txt", "output_essay": "As a young person myself, I often feel guilty for spending so little time with the community. I have often noticed that the social bonds between neighbors have diminished in recent years, and people are becoming less caring than before. That's why I think we should definitely spend more time helping our communities.\n\nBut how? The main reason nowadays that young people don't spend much time with their communities is that they are crammed with homework, extracurricular activities, entertainment, etc. They are simply not spending a lot of time strolling about the neighborhood. Without any interactions with their neighbors, young people will easily neglect their role as a member of their community. Although they read about community service in their textbooks, few actually participate in it. And when you ask them why, they simply reply, 'I don't have time.'\n\nSo if we wish to solve this problem, the first thing to do is to decrease the amount of burden on young people. Schools should end earlier so that young people can spend more time inside the community. Teachers should give their students less work on weekends so they could have adequate time to conduct effective community service. Parents should relieve their child of too many activities and should not force them to go to cram schools. Without these corrections to our education system, schools would end up actually teaching young people not to spend time with the community.\n\nOf course, one might contend that young people will end up spending the extra time playing computer games and not doing community service at all. That might be the case for some kids, but in my opinion, if people felt they were involved in their community, they would try their best to make it better. This sentiment can be further enhanced by government propaganda and social education.\n\nIt is everyone's responsibility to bring young people back to community service. They should not simply put the blame on laziness manifested by the younger generation. I pray for a day when the old bonds between neighbors can be re-established."}

I disagree with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.\n\nFacts are the things that we see as virtue and are used as the basis of ideas and concepts. You can hardly tell whether the concepts and ideals are true or false, because everyone has their own observations. We know that neither the Earth nor the Sun is the center of the universe, but most people believed that the concept that the Earth is the center of the universe.\n\nAlso, concepts and ideals always determine our own thoughts and lead them to the wrong or even opposite way, taking us far away from the truth. It is widely known that the research on brain cells had not made any progress for years since scientists used their outdated concepts and ideals to analyze brain cells. This concept that every kind of brain cell uses electricity to transfer their signals made them totally ignore the importance of other cells.\n\nLast but not least, facts not only provide us with materials to observe but also function as the inspiration of scientists. By learning facts, we can think in our own way and then learn to select the best way of thinking. As we know, men must suffer to be wise. If you suffer from your own thinking and figure out what the facts reflect, you will finally be able to handle the problems that you will face. By this way, people become much more mature, and know the essentials of life, which do not have the concepts of how to live a good life."}
{"file_id": "1101889.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with this opinion. Of course, there is also a chance to enjoy older age; however, it is up to the younger age, which people have spent. So I want to point out three points to explain why young people enjoy life more than older people do.\n\nFirst of all, young people have the power to gain what they want or to achieve some kind of goal. Physically, they are so young that they can work all day without sleeping, sometimes. Besides, they are not too tired after working. It is one of the important things to achieve the goal. Mentally, they don't feel responsibilities for society or family, so they can challenge something important or need to work hard without thinking deeply. If people become parents or need to care for their parents, there is some negative factor to challenge something.\n\nSecond, there are opportunities to make them change, study, or grow up. There are chances to take education and study abroad or something. Older people, mostly parents, give younger people time to concentrate on themselves, in other words, to think about themselves. It is the most important thing to grow up and have identification of themselves.\n\nThirdly, younger people can have time to have communication with many people who have different backgrounds. Older people mostly have jobs, and it is limited to opportunities to communicate with people in the office and people. On the other hand, younger people have the chances to have conversations and have time together with many kinds of people. They have time to go all around the world, and mentally, there is nothing for them to lose. There is only to gain."}
{"file_id": "1100356.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with the statement. In my opinion, there is a famous saying that 'to get success, you have to take risk.' I agree with this statement because I feel that success doesn't come without taking risks in life. Today, it's a world of competition, and to compete in this world, you have to try new things to get success.\n\nIn order to get success, sometimes you try to find out new ways. By going on those ways, you think you can achieve success, and you often take risks in your life. I feel that if people only do those things which they think they know how to do well, they can get success up to a certain level, but cannot reach the heights of success.\n\nIn my opinion, everyone has their own definition of success, and it depends on the person to person, till what extent they can take risks in their own life. For some people, success means peace of mind or a happy life. But for some, success means reaching the heights of the world, to conquer the world, so that person tends to take more risks compared to that person who is happy in their own world, or to that person who has a different meaning for success.\n\nFor example, if you take the example of cricket, if a batsman wants to score quick runs, he has to play sloppy shots in order to take quick runs, so he has to take risks. Sometimes he gets success, or sometimes he fails. So, it just depends on the person: is he ready to take the risk in terms of getting success? But I don't think you can buy success without taking risks.\n\nSometimes I feel that 'success has its negative side.' This question always bothers me a lot. Does success not come without taking risks? Till now, I am not able to find out the answer till date, maybe I have not achieved success yet, but the day when I will achieve success, I will come to know."}
{"file_id": "1101246.txt", "output_essay": "So far as the question is concerned, I am not quite at home with the statement that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities. Although it may be argued that the young population is not interested in social and political affairs as it was in the 1960s, I believe that young people have a willingness to help the communities in which they live.\n\nIt is a well-known fact that the young population is aware of the communal issues, as they are part of a family that belongs to the community. In other words, the more they live in a family, the more they give enough time to their communities. For instance, in a village or in a minority group, the young population do not hesitate to participate in charity programs, such as visiting hospitals and helping the oldest members of the community. They even become members of NGOs in order to demand or help for communal interests.\n\nOn the other hand, we may acknowledge that there are some current problems that keep the youth intact with their community as well as with their families. The process of globalization creates a global village where individuals gain universal attributes and goals rather than being interested in their communities. Therefore, it becomes difficult to keep the interest of the internet-based youth aligned with that of the communities. However, this situation cannot abandon the young willingness to help their communities.\n\nConsequently, we may consider that young people prefer to be interested in private and global objectives rather than communal or social ones. Yet, we should not ignore that they are also active in especially helping their communities and finding time to help, even if they feel themselves busy and overloaded by educational or professional life. Briefly, young people nowadays give time to helping their communities, despite the difficulties in their globalized and internet-based lives."}

With each day, our roads are becoming increasingly congested with a growing number of cars, and our air is being infused with a higher density of vehicular pollution. Obviously, there is a limit to how much our infrastructure can support. What happens when there are so many cars on the road that there is no more place to move?\n\nThat is a rather scary vision. However, it may well be that the number of cars on the roads twenty years from now will actually be less than what it is today.\n\nIsn't that a rather exaggerated claim? After all, even if the world population stabilizes as the estimates have indicated, it will still be much larger than what it is today. And with increased economic prosperity, more and more people can be expected to own more and more cars.\n\nTrue. However, if the current trends are any clue, the number of cars should nevertheless reduce.\n\nFirstly, many countries, especially developing nations with large populations, are rapidly developing their public transport systems to tackle the problem of urban transportation. Public transport systems are not only more cost-effective, but they also ensure a better quality of living by eliminating traffic jams and exposure to vehicular pollution. Therefore, it will not really be surprising if more and more people take to public transport as their primary means of moving about.\n\nSecondly, fuel prices are expected to rise heavily in the next twenty years as world oil reserves get depleted. In such a scenario, it will be much more economical for people to use public transportation systems.\n\nSuch trends are already showing in countries like India. The Delhi Metro is a success story that well illustrates the point. With high-quality service available at low prices, even the rich and affluent of Delhi prefer to keep their cars at home and use the Metro when they need to travel to the crowded areas of the city. Rapid Bus Transit Systems introduced in cities like Indore and Bhopal are becoming increasingly popular amongst citizens.\n\nThus, the day may not be far when you might be the only person driving on the road! In fact, if one wants a better quality of living for one and all, one should actually hope that it happens."}
{"file_id": "1098553.txt", "output_essay": "The statement asserts that understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning facts.\n\nBefore we move on to judge the merit of the assertion, let's try to differentiate between 'ideas and concepts' and 'facts'.\n\nIdeas and concepts represent the fundamental 'line of thought' or 'logical progression' behind any phenomenon. For example, different cultures use kinship nomenclatures, e.g., Uncle, father, mother, etc., in order to express not just natural relationships but also social relationships, status, power equations, and economic situations, etc.\n\nOn the other hand, 'facts' represent the 'hard examples' or 'expressions' which can be immediately placed in their context and are self-explanatory. For example, Uncle is a term used for father's or mother's brother. But in many cultures, uncle is also a term used for any significantly older male, even if no biological relationship exists.\n\nWhat it essentially means is that it is very difficult to understand 'ideas and concepts' as separated from 'facts', and vice versa. The two are interlinked in many ways.\n\nIt's only through 'observation' of similarities between facts that ideas and concepts emerge. That is, if it is observed that in a culture, all providers of food and security are termed as 'Father/Mother', it means there is more to nomenclature than the biological relationship. It's no coincidence that Hitler was termed 'Fuhrer', i.e., father.\n\nOn the other hand, once an idea or concept has been 'observed' and 'established' through the study of 'facts', it provides a medium for understanding all future factual observations. That is, whether they support or oppose the idea or concepts.\n\nHence, observation of 'facts' is both the 'initiator' and 'distiller' of concepts.\n\nIn this light, it will be foolhardy to see ideas and concepts as opposed to facts. Both of them are equally important for real learning. Students need to understand a 'concept' through assimilation of facts. Concurrently, a concept or idea provides the medium for assimilation of a large number of facts. Both are inseparable for complete learning."}

Does it mean that becoming an adult dissipates happiness and good times? According to my own experience, I think that people were generally happier when they were children. They just lived how their minds guided them, without thinking about consequences.\n\nFirstly, I think that young people are happier than adults because they do not care about material things. They live their lives without thinking about the consequences. Indeed, everything they want to do is possible, so they just have to realize what their hearts tell them to do. People are used to saying that mankind is led by money and interest, contrary to children who are only guided through life by happiness and pleasure. For example, a young boy does not care about what his mom is doing. But his mom must take care of her baby and she has to save him and protect him from dangers.\n\nWe can also say that young people are in good health, which enables them to live their lives without money problems, job problems, and more. They spend most of their time playing with their friends without being disturbed.\n\nAccording to my own experience, I can say that being a child is the best period of your life. You do not have to care about anything except just playing outside. You are not stressed by your destiny and by the world around you.

Some people say that young people provide enough time to help their communities, as they are doing some voluntary work for communities. However, I agree with the statement that young people tend to spend more time studying and do not have a sense of belonging to their communities.\n\nTo begin with, nowadays students do not help their communities enough. This is because they think that their grades are more important than helping communities. Therefore, they are spending more time studying for good grades than doing volunteer work. For example, my brother is a high school student. When he was asked to work for his community by his school, he got angry. That's because he thinks helping his community is a waste of time and does not help improve his grade.\n\nIn addition, because young people do not have a sense of belonging to their local communities, they are not willing to help their community a lot. Young people think they can move to other places whenever they want to move. Therefore, they do not feel the necessity to provide aid to their local communities, sacrificing their own time. For instance, according to KBS, Korea's national broadcast station, 70% of young people do not feel the need to help their local society. When they were asked for reasons, they answered that they did not have a sense of belonging to their communities.\n\nIn conclusion, young people do not spend enough time helping local communities to meet the needs of communities. This is because young people invest their time in studying for good grades. Also, they do not feel a sense of belonging to their communities. This phenomenon must not be underestimated in the aspect that young people will be the ones leading local communities."}

You build new friendships and see different facets of life. Moreover, the cost of the trips is relatively less since most of the guides/operators have tie-ups with different resorts, transportation companies, etc. It gives a better deal for the consumers. Your trip is organized, and any problems arising can be dealt with by the guide since he is seasoned and experienced in the trip.\n\nHowever, there are a few disadvantages even. We may not get individual attention during the trip from the guide if he has many tourists under him. Sometimes a consumer may also feel that he is not getting a raw deal, i.e., not a good deal, and it's expensive because the tour operator's margin (commission) will be added to the package costs.\n\nImmaterial of the disadvantages, I feel that the best way to travel is in a group led by a guide since you tend to enjoy more, and any hassles relating to foreign exchange, visas, etc. are dealt with effectively.\n\nAnyway, as the saying goes, 'The More the Merrier'."}

People just buy them only because their favorite star has advertised for it.\n\nIn India, most of the drinks like Coke, Pepsi are advertised by famous local film stars, and people started using them, even though they are proved to contain harmful residues of pesticides. After a concern of the media, they reduced their usage.\n\nIn some contexts, they make us feel they are modified products, even though in reality they are not done so.

I like most kinds of food, from cold food to hot food. Whether it is spicy or not, I do not care. I will eat it. I like Italian food. I am in love with Chinese food. I do not mind Mexican food. I mentioned that because if I see a commercial on TV about any type of food or a big picture of a hamburger on the wall that says 'come and taste it,' I have to try it, and then I decide whether the advertisements of this type of food are good or not.\n\nIn the end, advertising agencies are really smart in what they do."}

On the contrary, their levels of awareness about the plight of people around the world have increased from yesteryears, and a growing number of youngsters are lending a helping hand to society.\n\nToday, people are making a mark for themselves at very early stages of their lives. Young movie stars, musicians, sportspersons, and the likes of them are winning the hearts of millions around them. In the process, they are making millions. But one can proudly say that a considerable proportion of their funds is directed towards charity. The 'Bill and Melinda Gates' foundation was set up a long time back when Bill Gates was in his prime. The amount of work that has been put in by the then young couple is commendable when it comes to talking about AIDS and cancer relief. Although a middle-aged couple now, their work goes on.\n\nIf we don't talk about the celebrities and concentrate our attention on school kids, we find that community service has started coming more naturally to them. There is a sense of pride attached to reaching out to the less privileged. Children consider themselves to be heroes of sorts if they do a good deed and help out people. The fact that schools and colleges have taken a positive step by according due importance to social work while considering admissions is an added impetus. It prompts youngsters to do their bit. Even if done out of personal interest, it exposes one to the joy of 'reaching out' and prods them to do more.\n\nOne can cite numerous examples of engineers and doctors who have graduated from Ivy League colleges and can easily make big bucks. But statistics show that an ever-increasing number of these graduates are turning their backs to high-paying jobs in favor of settling down in small villages and towns. All this because they feel a sense of attachment and duty towards their homeland and truly believe in alleviating the troubles of their nations.\n\nThus, the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to their communities is unqualified and underrates the contribution of youngsters towards building a better society."}

Also, the way we choose to travel is highly dependent on the place we choose to go. From my personal experiences, I think that traveling in a group led by a tour guide is the best way if we would like to go to a new place or city.\n\nThere are several reasons for this. First, and maybe the most important one, is that we might choose a country or a city where the local language is not our mother tongue, so the tour guide would be a helpful resource in this case, and of course, s/he would help us with the procedures such as booking a hotel, knowing the restaurants, etc., while entering the place.\n\nAlso, as we are new in the city and do not know many things about its social culture, by having a tour guide with us, we can easily be informed of the useful information about the habits and culture of the people in that specific country, and we can be well-prepared for the travel.\n\nThe second reason, in my opinion, is the fact that we surely would like to visit many new places in our travel and, of course, get many new pieces of information about the history, art, social life, music, etc. of the place. How can we obtain such information if we travel without a group led by a professional tour guide having lots of interesting information about the city?\n\nI think it might be possible to do all of these things if we travel individually, but really, we will waste lots of time on it.\n\nThird and last, traveling in a group is much safer than the other ways, since there might be some possible dangers along our trip, the tour members can be helpful in these cases.\n\nAll in all, if I choose a new place to go, I prefer to travel in a group led by a skillful tour guide to have a great time and enjoy my trip."}

The gifts that a young person takes to their life coach are deeply wrong. It's true that people do not help enough their communities, but it is also true that at the moment, there are not good examples to follow, and so everyone will become the best person they can be. I know that there are many people who are more interested in helping everyone, but for me, these people are still a small number. I am very interested in this theme. Really!!! At the moment, in fact, I work at a call center that helps some students from my country who have family problems and do not have the possibility to explain their problems to anyone. For this reason, I think that it is very, very, very important to tell all people to do the right thing and begin to help the people around us.

It is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one particular subject.\n\nA prospective student may want to pursue his career by learning only the subjects he requires. An architect, for example, would want to study Physics and Mathematics, as subjects like these help him in his field. Though English literature and environmental sciences are not required in his field, they pass on some principles that would help him throughout life's journey. A look into the environment may help him to select different types of materials to be used in construction, so as to keep the environment safe. After his education, he would come out more knowledgeable.\n\nDuring one's schooling, one is exposed to a variety of subjects like History and Geography. Have you ever come across a time when you wonder, 'Why? What use is this going to be to me in the future? Will the knowledge of what happened to my country a thousand years ago help me in the future?' Twenty years later, will anyone ask me how high Mt. Everest is? Though this information may seem useless at that age, after progressing through life's obstacles, one realizes that the knowledge one had gained by studying such subjects is very precious and valuable. We now remember that Mt. Everest is 8,997 meters high and is growing higher every year. It gives us a sense of superiority and pleasure that we, after so many years, remember such tiny details.\n\nSpecializing in one specific subject may give the student more time to understand the subject and achieve perfection. Specializing may give one an edge over others. But when we emerge into society, ready to make a difference to our lives, the lives of others, or the world as a whole, we realize that a broader knowledge of subjects is better than specializing in one subject. With knowledge comes power, and with power comes responsibility. It is our responsibility to make this world a better place."}

If we want to save the world, we must reduce the pollution, and one way is the reduction of the cars in use. We must implement ecological alternatives.\n\nThe Earth is collapsing due to too much pollution. One of the most important factors of high pollution is the presence of many cars. Cars have become a mass way of transport, and in many cities, they are used in the wrong way, for example, one car is used only by one person instead of three or four. We must change that. It is not difficult.\n\nWe must improve our behavior toward ecological problems. One way, for example, is using public transport. By using public transport, there will be fewer cars in use. Fewer cars in use mean less pollution. I'm sure that is one of the reasons that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years.\n\nI see a world in the future with fewer cars, less pollution, and more attention to the environment. I can see happy kids in big city parks, running and screaming, people with large smiles on their faces. Maybe it is only a dream, maybe it is only a hope, but it must be our future.\n\nChanging ways of life is difficult and has high costs, but surely this is the straight way to follow."}
{"file_id": "1105022.txt", "output_essay": "I strongly believe that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. Whether the advertisement one sees is through a television or a magazine, this particular individual is bound to receive some sort of effect upon immediate exposure. This exposure can be explained in two interesting ways. One is explained via visual effect, and the other is through the means of incorporating one's psychological effect.\n\nAs we all know, in order to advertise a certain product, excessive visual luring is to be expected from the viewers. The makers of these advertisements will try in every conceivable way to present their products at their finest. This is where the visual effect comes in. There will be many trials and errors, and thorough, various steps will also be required in order to complete one final advertisement before they are presented in the buyers' eyes. When that item is then advertised, the viewers will inevitably be tricked and alluded to see beyond the actual practicality and state of that particular item.\n\nThe second effect, the psychological one, derives from the audience's point of view. Sometimes the products being advertised in the media just look nice, glamorous, and even useful simply because they are unattainable. At times, that particular item may be too costly, and it is one's budget that is exceeded. This explains our natural human instinct to need and want what we cannot have. Therefore, the hope to be able to possess a certain product - perhaps in the near future or never at all - will push your desire to purchase that product even more. Hence, when a buyer does not conveniently have the item at hand while seeing the advertisement, it is only natural to make that particular item seem much better than it really is.\n\nTo conclude, the reasons, whether they are external or internal, bring the same result to the viewers of these advertisements. They are not necessarily good or bad, but the need to control one's perception is important in deciding if that reason is valid. The viewers, the buyers, must therefore reason and fight for what is real and what is not. Sometimes it is simply our mind that tricks us into buying. This is when you realize you've made the wrong decision."}
{"file_id": "1105276.txt", "output_essay": "Education is ongoing for our entire life. In addition, it is commonly known that education at school is one of the most important parts of continuous education in life. I totally agree with the statement that 'it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts' for two reasons.\n\nMy first reason comes from the fact that it is impossible to impart all ideas and information at school. That is, because of the limited time, you cannot teach everything to students at school. That's why students must be provided with the ability to understand ideas and concepts. For example, last year I took a mathematics class and we discussed theories of a certain subject. There were plenty of theories to study, but the class was once per week for a semester. The professor helped us to understand the subject completely, and afterwards, we could handle other theories by ourselves.\n\nMy second reason is that we are educated at school to have some ideas to practise in our life after school. If we understand ideas and concepts at school, we can have a chance to apply them into the rest of our life. Hence, all information and ideas can be valued to be worth our time spent at school. To give a specific example, I am a professional now, and last week I met a really complex problem at work. Studying at university with my mathematics project helped me surprisingly. Because at that time, I really understood the idea in the project. I also felt that I was not regretful for the time that I spent at university.\n\nTo sum up, it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts to give a hand to them for their future. Finally, it must be the main point for education at school."}
{"file_id": "1102947.txt", "output_essay": "The contemporary youth is surrounded by very different challenges as well as distinctive opportunities to organize their lives. The competition in the job market, for instance, has become very hard, and education is now considered to be of utmost importance for future prospects. This can lead to the fact that many youths do not have the time to help their communities due to the time they spend studying for school or college.\n\nAdditionally, modern young people have many options to spend their leisure time. There are so many opportunities for youths to spend their free time that they might forget to think about others. Media, such as television, computers, or the internet, are just a few opportunities to spend free time. Due to this reason, the youths might be overstrained with the diversity of possibilities that surrounds them.\n\nAnother factor that can keep young people from being concerned about their community is that many of them are just too lazy to offer their help. The generation of so-called 'couch potatoes' illustrates this issue. Many young people are just hanging around either at home or anywhere else. The reason for this might be, on the one hand, that they lack the guidance of their parents, who often spend the whole day working. On the other hand, the invention and improvement of computer games and other sources can be a reason why young people spend less time outside the four walls of their room.\n\nIn addition to this point, it seems also reasonable to me that the life standard, which has considerably been improved in contemporary society, has made students dull and even indifferent. Many young people just do not care if others need their help since they are satisfied with what they have and do not see any reason to think of others, especially their community.\n\nWith reference to these reasons, I would agree with the statement that young people do not spend enough time helping their community in contemporary society. The youth, in general, has many interests that have nothing to do with their community, which can be the peer group, the media, the school, and a huge amount of other issues. Additionally, they lack some guidance from their parents or other adults who could make the community more attractive to them."}

These programs are quite convenient because we do not have to make efforts to make schedules on our own, and we are led by a tour guide with a reserved tour bus. However, I do not agree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide, for the following reasons.\n\nTo begin with, we cannot have great fun and excitement, which are felt while we make plans for a trip for ourselves, if we use a traveling program with a guide. I realized the importance and fun of planning my trip by myself when I prepared for a trip to Europe last summer. I had the trip with two of my friends, so we met frequently to decide which place we were going to visit, what we would eat, what to buy as a souvenir, etc. I think that we had equally or even more interesting time, or even more exciting time, while we made our schedule and imagined our trip compared to actual traveling. A group traveling led by a tour guide is already planned by travel agencies, so we cannot make our unique and special choices and plans.\n\nAdditionally, we will probably be restricted to the group's decision and behaviors even if we have different ideas. For example, we can have some chances to choose what to eat even though we travel in a group. However, in this case, we should follow a certain choice that many people selected. It is a really sad thing that we cannot eat exotic foods that we really want while traveling in foreign countries. Furthermore, we cannot take public transportation because of a reserved tour bus. I found it very interesting and impressive to take other countries' subways, trains, buses, and trams during my trip. I must have missed that precious experience if I had traveled in a group led by a tour guide.\n\nIn conclusion, I am convinced that traveling in a group with a guide is not the best idea to travel. We can have really interesting and exciting moments while we make our original and free plan for our trip. We also can behave freely if we are not included in a group. We can eat whatever we want, go to wherever we want, and even decide to take risks or adventures when we travel by ourselves. Besides, we can experience minor things, which are done by residents of a foreign country, such as riding public transportation and walking along rivers and streets. These are great advantages of traveling by ourselves individually."}

{"file_id": "1105047.txt", "output_essay": "Different approaches in education discuss whether it is more important for students to learn about facts or to understand ideas. If one has to choose between both, I would say it is more important to learn to understand ideas. I will first present some arguments to support this point, emphasizing the intellectual importance of ideas. Then, I will try to explain how complementary these points are and why they are necessary for any good student.\n\nAs a student myself, I feel very concerned about this topic, especially because I am a young researcher and the relationship between concepts and facts is critical. However, mainly because facts can be learned outside of school, I would agree to state that it is more important to understand concepts. For instance, in my own research about the gentrification of Harlem, I am less interested in the facts and details than in understanding the whole process and the trends that drive it. It is true that it is very important to understand the concepts of class, place, and territory (their role, symbols, etc.). I think it is the role of the school to teach students to think for themselves and to succeed in giving them the intellectual and conceptual keys and tools to understand a problem and solve it.\n\nHowever, saying that concepts are more important than facts (as implied in the question) I face a big ethical problem. In effect, how can you understand a concept or an idea if you don't know some facts to contextualize it, for example? Even if facts can be learned differently than in an academic way, they are required. For example, if I don't know how many people are displaced by gentrification or to what extent the rents rose due to gentrification, how can I expect to understand the nature of the transformations occurring in the neighborhood? I think concepts and facts are linked, and the reciprocity of their relation is the secret of a good understanding of concepts and ideas.\n\nTo conclude, I would say that theoretically, understanding concepts is more important, but it can only work with very abstract objects of study. The reality is more complex, and to understand an idea efficiently, you need to know the context and the facts."}

Because if every person specialized themselves in one and only one academic subject, it would be difficult for us to discuss together on general subjects.\n\nIn our society, there are continuing changes, and we need specialized people who can well understand topics on their favorite academic subjects. Nobody can understand all problems on all subjects and find solutions for those problems; we need experts for that. For example, we are not able to explain how the financial policy of a multinational can affect the company's profits. But the people who are able to explain that may not be able to explain how education can reduce violence in poor countries.\n\nThese experts, I think, are the more able to teach their knowledge. It's important that this knowledge doesn't begin a sort of integrism. Even if we are specialized on a subject, it's important to understand other people's point of view. The fact that our society is in a permanent state of change puts another problem on the table. What happens to people specialized on a topic that becomes old-fashioned? Do these people lose all their skills? What can they do now? The key is that people should be able to work, learn, and think about other subjects.\n\nFor example, there are some technologies that will become inefficient in the next five years.

My point of view is to specialize in one subject to know many subjects, because by doing so, we will be in more depth of one rather than just being superficially attached to many. This can be further elaborated by taking certain examples, like a general doctor who can treat many diseases but can struggle with some critical disease, whereas a specialist doctor can take care of complex diseases in his specialized branch.\n\nThe same way, in any other branch you take, a specialist would always have an upper hand over a non-specialist. Today, where the world is developing at such a fast pace, the contribution of a specialist would be more than a non-specialist.

{"file_id": "1105857.txt", "output_essay": "People get an education because knowledge serves as the background setting for young adults, which means that those complex math questions or the dates for historical events are not applied directly to society.\n\nThus, if I had to choose between understanding ideas and concepts on a certain subject or learning facts, I would choose to understand ideas and concepts.\n\nThere are two reasons for agreeing with the statement.\n\nThe first reason is that if you focus on understanding ideas and concepts, you can obtain knowledge much easier and faster. This is because when you try to obtain ideas and concepts for yourself, it is easier to concentrate, as the process of learning them is fun and interesting. For example, when I received my report cards from school, I could divide them into two groups. The subjects with high grades were the subjects I understood the concepts and ideas very well. The other group consisted of low grades, which I considered boring and waited for the class to end. As you can see from my experience, the quality of the outcome differs whether you understand ideas or just try to learn facts. This shows why understanding is more important than learning facts.\n\nThe next reason is that the ideas and concepts you understand remain for a longer time. This reason is conceivable among people. In my case, I still remember the math formulas I understood in my high school days. This is because if you understand the ideas or concepts as your own, they can be applied to other areas, thereby the formulas or other facts can be used and remembered on and on, even when you become old.\n\nTo sum up, the two reasons presented above show why understanding ideas and concepts is more crucial than just learning facts. Understanding ideas and concepts helps your knowledge be installed in your brain in a shorter amount of time with a positive attitude towards it, and can be applied to other spheres as well. As I have experienced a variety of cases related to this statement during my high school life, I strongly agree with the statement."}

{"file_id": "1105165.txt", "output_essay": "In modern capitalist society, advertisements are a natural part of life. In this situation, I believe that it is all but inevitable that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.\n\nThe fundamental reason is that modern consumerism has made it necessary for companies to advertise their products simply because there are more goods than are necessary. Before the advent of mass production and mass consumption, the situation was vice versa: there were probably fewer goods than were necessary. Naturally, therefore, producers did not need to advertise at all. But in today's society, because of the tremendous advance of technology, it is possible to churn out unnecessary commodities produced mainly, or perhaps only, to gain profits by selling them. As a result, producers are forced to make their products look much better than they really are so that they will be able to sell them out.\n\nAnother significant reason why advertisers exaggerate the value of their products is people's expectation to have newer and \"better\" things. In order to keep up with these consumers' demand, companies are compelled not only to make new, slightly-upgraded products all the time but also to make the small improvement as impressive. The case in point is the computer industry. PC makers change their models three or four times a year even though the improvement is minor. Because people expect this and because all the other competitors do so, a PC maker cannot afford to continue to sell a PC first put on the market a year ago. As a result, it is necessary for PC makers to make their products look significantly better than their previous models by, for example, changing their looks although the content is not much different.\n\nIn conclusion, I agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are for two reasons. Modern consumerism has made it necessary, and as a result, people are accustomed to having \"better\" products, which forces producers to exaggerate minor improvements. It would be impossible to change this situation, and therefore, consumers need to be wise enough not to be deceived by advertisements."}
{"file_id": "1105098.txt", "output_essay": "Most people have lost their interest in their communities day by day. People also do not want to involve themselves in helping their communities. So it seems to me that these people, whom I am not accusing of not helping their communities, are especially youngsters. However, I can't accuse them directly, since the sense of helping people around us should be taught in their early education, such as in elementary schools. Moreover, families should take care of this issue.\n\nThe first point that I would like to make is that if you are willing to help your community, you shouldn't wait until you earn money. As a result, young people think that helping others or participating in some charity organization is a waste of time. However, thinking like that is not their fault, yet their families do not talk with their children about the importance of helping people. Moreover, teachers or school departments do not encourage youngsters to help their communities. For instance, when I was in high school, our teacher encouraged us to go to the house for the elderly. Furthermore, they were bringing us to the forest in order to cultivate a tree every month. But the school stopped doing these activities because of their cost. In addition, I am convinced that young people can't understand the benefits of helping their communities.\n\nLet us look at another reason why youngsters do not help their communities. I believe that their curriculum in school is so busy. They have to study and they have to pass their classes. It is apparent that those responsibilities are stressing them out. However, they can help their communities in their spare time. I am convinced that most youngsters spend their time playing video games, chatting on the internet, or being interested in celebrities' lives. They can take action in some helping organization instead of doing these activities.\n\nTo sum up, I agree that young people do not help their communities as much as they should. But, most importantly, it is not their fault. Someone should teach them the importance of participating to help their communities, such as their parents and their teachers."}

The students will not have a chance to confirm that what they know is true, and it might cause a decrease in the students' interest towards the subject. Also, they will not have the ability to adjust their own knowledge to perform in the actual world, which is the main reason why students learn. Therefore, it is not more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.\n\nUnderstanding ideas and concepts involves receiving information from others who have already experienced them, and by not being able to actually see how the ideas and concepts work, the students might not be able to have enough interest in the subject as they should. If the students are not actively experiencing the facts on their own, they can easily doubt whether those ideas and concepts are true in the real world. Lacking the ability to see how they actually work can cause a decrease in their interest, which brings negative effects on learning habits.\n\nStudents without skills to perform correct actions in the real world often do not have enough experience, which comes from learning facts through their own experiences. As they grow up and prepare to play an important role in society, it is required to have a lot of knowledge as well as enough experience to know how to adjust the knowledge for each specific situation. Students with only ideas and concepts that other people have introduced will lack the ability to gather specific information of their own and place them into correct consequences.\n\nIt is more important for students to learn facts because it increases the willingness for students to learn as well as the ability to perform better in various situations in the real world."}

The cars play an important role in human history. Also, being a cultural symbol, cars mean safety and convenience in our life. These all made the dependence and demands of the car never vanish.\n\nMoreover, the world-wide population is still increasing nowadays. The large population, and the related growth of it in the past years, implied that the reduction of vehicles is impossible. Then, the car industry is a very important income for big countries all over the world. It is very hard to change the composition of the industry in simply twenty years. Scientists and engineers are dedicating themselves to improve cars using modern technologies. More and more high-efficient, green technological cars are still emerging. The pollutants of the cars are potentially to be reduced significantly in the near future.\n\nHowever, some opponents mentioned the development of new vehicles. There might be some substitution of the cars in the near future, such as the development of mass transportation. But I don't think that will result in the reduction of the car. More and more emerging industries stimulate the development of each other indeed.\n\nThe discovery of new energy, such as alcohol or gases, implies that the cutting edge of new cars will be more and more important in the near future.

I hold this opinion because young people are less weak, less afraid, and less fragile than older people tend to be.\n\nFirst of all, the majority of young people have a lot of energy, which they can disperse without becoming tired easily. While most aged people get tired after just one activity, young people, like students, can do many activities in just one day. Even after long hours of work in school, they can easily take part in an afterschool activity, and then come home to do homework and chores. On the other hand, older people get tired quickly, even after one activity, such as cleaning the house. Being able to do many activities in one day promotes the sense of accomplishment and happiness, and thus young people, who have more energy, enjoy life more than older people.\n\nIn addition, young people tend to be more brave than older people and take more risks. Risks, because no outcome can be predicted, add excitement to the lives of young people. However, most older people prefer being stable and assured, and do not take risks. For example, a lot of young people will travel to distant countries and gain more experience. However, older people prefer remaining where they are. Thus, in the lives of older people, things are monotonous and predictable, whereas in the lives of young people, nothing can be predicted, and everything is exciting.\n\nFurthermore, young people are also more mentally capable than older people. As people grow old, they lose their ability to concentrate for long periods of time or to learn new things. In contrast, young people are full of potential and can learn new things, like another language or a new recipe. Learning new things is very enjoyable, and younger people, who have the advantage of better mental capabilities, enjoy life more than older people.\n\nOlder people are restrained by various factors, such as fragility and inability to continue activities for a long period of time. However, because young people are stronger physically, mentally, and also have less fear, their lives are filled with excitement and fun, enabling them to enjoy life more than older people do."}

In order to realize this goal, they represent the product as far superior than it really is. Hence, today the image of the product exceeds its practical use in terms of importance and its practical use.\n\nWhat advertisements offer is therefore a status remark and a definition for a person's identity. The item describes its owner in a particular way that the advertisements load them with. For example, a Diet Coke is never just a simple drink that would cut back your thirst or accompany some food. Rather, it is an item that turns its consumer into someone attractive, lean, and one who knows how to live well. Even the label that your pencil bears on it would transmit a message about who you are, just because of the advertisements' way of representing it. You can be a hardworking and determined individual or even someone rebellious.\n\nIn this sense, I agree that advertisements render products much better than they really are. They shift their practical meaning into a sign for your personal identity and status. Thus, they sell not just the item itself but also the message it entails.

There are some reasons why I think young people enjoy life more than older people do.\n\nFirst, young people have a lot of energy to move their bodies. Some of them enjoy sports, traveling, and working. They can do many activities. Even though they are tired, they sometimes continue moving without enough rest. If they sleep well, they will be fine the next day.\n\nFurthermore, many of them do not have serious health problems. Many older people have some health problems, even though they have lived a healthy life. Because they have grown older, it is a natural thing. Many young people do not have health problems that older people have.\n\nIn addition, the lifestyles between young people and older people are different. When I visited a retirement home, an activity director said that if I could come there as much as I could, it would be helpful for them to escape from boring times. They usually stay in the home because it is hard for them to go out by themselves. Therefore, if they do not have any outside activities, they spend their time on a sofa watching TV. However, young people can go anywhere and anytime by themselves. They can choose how they act on their daily life, but for older people, they cannot have the kind of choice.\n\nThese reasons show that young people tend to enjoy their life more than older people do. Young people have some benefits to enjoy their life more than older people, so they should enjoy their life. If young people provide an enjoyable life for older people, the older people will have a more enjoyable life than they used to have."}

It's true that having a tour guide has its advantages, such as being taken to all the typical local tourist attractions, and you will be almost certain that you won't be missing out on any must-see places. Yet, on the other hand, having a tour guide limits your free time. When traveling in a group, you want to spend time with your friends and spend it as you wish, not having to be tied to a schedule as it is when using a tour guide. It could also be said that when traveling in big groups, people always want to see different things, and arguments may occur. Although having a tour guide could prevent these disagreements by simply following the itinerary set for that day, there's a better way to solve the problem. The group could just simply separate, each person goes to where they want, and at the end of the day, meet again. The advantage of this solution is that when a big number of people are together for a period of time, usually arguments happen; by sending each person on their different way, it gives them time to refresh from the environment of the group. Most importantly, of why it is better to travel without a tour guide is that having a tour guide babysitting you around the city takes away a great part of the social and cultural interaction. The experience that you earn when you explore an unknown city on your own is something that cannot be shown by a tour guide. In conclusion, for all the reasons named above, my suggestion when it comes to traveling in a group is to not hire a tour guide and explore the city on your own along with your friends."}

This is a question that I face myself as a student almost every day. On the one hand, it is necessary to understand the theory that lies beneath all facts and new information, in order to get a solid knowledge of how things work. On the other hand, it is also necessary to just learn new words or relationships. Without that base knowledge, it is not possible to communicate with others because they do not know what you are talking about.\n\nI guess there is no black and white view on whether to say that a student should learn everything new just by heart or to understand just the facts. It must be a middle way; you have to find a way to combine these two views.\n\nWhen repetition is the aim, then I would say that learning the facts is enough. However, when it is necessary to find new conclusions and relations between different cases, then it is a must to understand basically what the new information wants to convey.\n\nNowadays, knowledge is given to everybody through various databases like books or the ultimate information base with the technology of the internet. It is just a matter of how to find information and how long you need to access the new information. It is getting more and more unimportant to know every fact by heart with help from data on pages like Wikipedia online. With that help, it is just a matter of a few seconds to access the right topic and to get any information that is so enormous nobody could keep in mind.\n\nTo come to a conclusion, I wish that in many more fields than today already exist, students learn the 'why' standing behind instead of just pure facts and knowledge they will never need in that particularly case in the future."}
{"file_id": "1109886.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with this idea for four reasons: color, sizes, words, and the feeling of people.\n\nThe first reason is the color impression. In fact, I am easily fooled by this strategy. For example, most advertisements, of course, have their specific characteristics. However, my brain always focuses on color. My composition of the brain is, at first, color, and then, the personality. Even if the ability is bad, I often buy the product.\n\nThe second reason is sizes. In the bills, we cannot know the size of the products. This sometimes happens in cases where we are buying something big or large, such as a refrigerator or a car. On internet shopping, it is cheaper than usual shopping; however, this kind of shock can easily occur.\n\nThe third reason is words. Words can dramatically change our hearts. Take an example. The cloth is 100 left in a vintage shop. 50 clothes sell 1 or 2 for a day. The owner is confused. One day, he made a poster that read: The clothes are left, only 50!! This made a meaningful effect, and the products were sold out in only one day. Like this instance, words are very significant in advertisement activities.\n\nThe last reason is the feeling of people, or personality. On TV commercials, various famous people advertise many products. In fact, the profits can become high or low depending on the person who is acting in the commercial."}
{"file_id": "1107011.txt", "output_essay": "Traveling plays a predominant role in the lives of all middle-class families. There are two major issues involved while traveling: one is traveling along with other people initiated by a tour guide, in other words, he is the person led by a traveling agency. Another issue deals with people taking their own way to travel to a particular place. According to my view, I strongly believe in going along with a tour guide because he knows about the cultures and traditions prevailing in that place; he also knows about the history beyond each and every monument present in that place.\n\nAs far as the place is concerned, there may be dangerous places where there is a prohibition for tourists, and without getting initiated by a proper guide, we may fall into problems by entering into that place. The main reason for going along with a tour guide is that we can know about the place in depth, i.e., what are the cultures and traditions of the people living in that place, and we can really enjoy our journey. We can know about the cultures, rituals, symbols of religions, and so on. So, I think it is better to go along with a tour guide.\n\nAnother reason I want to make is about the monuments present in the place. When we are moving along with our tour guide, we could know about the monument. For example, when we want to visit the Statue of Liberty at Manhattan, we have to know the basic purpose or the history behind the Statue of Liberty. However, without a proper guide, we can also visit the place, but we cannot know about the beauty of the place as we are missing the thesis of the place.\n\nIn conclusion, the main reason for us going to a particular place is completely fulfilled if we are accompanied by a tour guide. Moreover, by going to these places, we can improve our knowledge about the culture and traditions. As a result, we can increase 'international cooperation among the people,' and this will lead to a world of peace and gratitude."}

Although it may not be evident in the present scenario, with car sales going up each year, many factors like pollution, space crunch, and an increase in public awareness will see more and more people relying on public transportation as their sole means for traveling.\n\nWith the price of gasoline skyrocketing beyond the general public's purchasing capability, people are slowly realizing that their cars are becoming more of a liability to them. It is highly unlikely that fuel prices will ever decrease, given the limited resources of fossil fuels.\n\nCars based on unconventional sources of energy, like fuel cells and solar power, are yet to establish their financial viability. All these factors suggest that people will look up to public transportation as a permanent solution to their woes. Besides being lighter on the purse, statistics suggest that it is a much safer mode of transportation than cars.\n\nAlso, the exploding population in metropolitan cities is leading to a major space crunch on roads and parking lots. People are fed up with wasting hours in traffic jams and parking queues. They are realizing that if most of them use public transportation, it would benefit all in terms of driving space and time.\n\nNon-polluting vehicles like cycles are once again gaining popularity among the masses for various reasons, health being a prominent one. In fact, many people in China go to their offices daily on bicycles.\n\nTherefore, it seems that the idea of the 'Ford', the famous car manufacturer, to ensure a car for all may not come true.

Organisms that do not adapt die, and eventually, their entire species will become extinct. One can easily project that image onto human fields of knowledge.

Ways of presenting goods and advertising to them in a proper and honest way include mentioning the components and items utilized to manufacture these goods. Companies utilizing materials with quality might point out how good the materials used in manufacturing are. Another way of fair advertising activities is highlighting the efforts required to produce some good and pointing out the professional and continuous planning to achieve this perfection. Marketing trends in some cultures attract consumers by utilizing cultural concepts (e.g., cultural and traditional sayings as a logo). Another example of fair advertising is studying the trends and behaviors of consumers (e.g., packing children's toys in bright-colored boxes), and we shall not consider this a manner of manipulation whereas no false information is mentioned about this product. By observing international markets, manufacturers and goods sellers all over the world are now trying to give glorious and attractive names to their products, which isn't a sort of decision-makers manipulating.

The human body is constructed to become weaker and more feeble as it becomes older at a certain age. For example, there was a young man who loved football and became a star high school football player, but thirty years later, he cannot play his favorite sport anymore because of his physical fitness. Even if the old man had kept his physical fitness and played football, he would not fully enjoy the sport as much as he did when he was in high school, since he does not have his old friends to play with.\n\nAnother reason is that young people have school, which provides them with an opportunity to find many friends to enjoy their time with. On the other hand, older people have less chance to meet new friends who can give them enjoyment."}

The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.\n\nPeople travel in order to enjoy and take a break from their routines. Some people travel for pleasure, but the main reason for traveling is to see new places and meet new people. We cannot meet new people unless we travel in a group, and as far as seeing new places is concerned, we cannot know the history of the places without having someone to tell it to us. A person who has all the knowledge about the past, present, and future of a monument, city, or a country is best equipped to provide this information to a traveler.\n\nTraveling alone does not serve the purpose of traveling itself. We go to new places and want to explore them, but we are unable to do so because we are new to the place and do not know where to go and what to do. A tour guide leads us to the right places and tells us things we would never know if it weren't told to us, especially about historical monuments. There is a reason behind every historical structure ever made, and visiting the structure without knowing when, why, and by whom it was made is like seeing pictures in a book and saying we have read it. Only a tour guide has the knowledge and communication skills to make people more familiar with a new place.\n\nWe have heard about the saying 'the more the merrier,' and this is the right way to describe a trip taken in a group. When there are others traveling with us, we not only get to know them and make new friends but they also add to the whole experience of traveling by sharing their backgrounds, cultures, and experiences. The kind of excitement it adds to your trip is worth it. What do people get by traveling alone? Not even half the experiences of the people who travel in a group led by a tour guide. Because they haven't met new people, made new friends, or gathered knowledge about the place they have visited.\n\nFor a person like me who loves to talk, make friends, and learn from my experience of traveling to new places with new people, there cannot be a better option for travel other than traveling in a group led by a tour guide."}

In addition, we can visit famous places in a good way. It means that we can visit many places without wasting time. At the same time, we will be able to get a lot of knowledge about the places we visit from a tour guide. If we travel with a tour guide, we will enjoy and we will be safe.\n\nHowever, if we travel with a tour guide in a group, we have to mind the time all the time. If we have free time, we have to come back on time, as the tour guide says. If we want to look around more, we cannot do that if we travel with a tour guide. If we have a place we want to visit, we cannot go there if it is not part of the course, even if it is very near the route. If we travel by ourselves, we do not need to mind the time. We can stay at a place as long as we want. Furthermore, we can make a travel plan as we want. Therefore, we do not need to go to places we are not interested in, and we can go to the places only we are interested in.\n\nIn my opinion, planning the trip is one of the enjoyments of the trip. If we make a plan from start to finish, we may have some problems. However, if the trip is finished, we can get a lot of happiness. Therefore, I disagree."}

By using famous people, such as players, singers, and artists, that does not make the product good or useful. Therefore, my opinion is to see if the product is good or not is to ask people who use it.

{"file_id": "1106076.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with the statement that 'The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide' because, generally, people want to visit different places to relax and learn more about them. If they don't keep a tour guide, they take much time to know about the place. At the same time, if a person goes alone to visit places, he doesn't get interested in watching them and can't express his ideas and thoughts about the place what he sees. If it is the case, that he travels along with a group and with a tour guide, it makes the people's tour successful and happy because the tour guide can explain about the places briefly and interestingly, providing a well-knowledgeable tour guide. If the person travels along with a group, he can have an advantage to express his views and get other views about the place they see.\n\nGenerally, tours are included with long time night and day journeys. At this time, the tour guide can decide where to stop the vehicle for emergency and where should not. At the same time, if anything happens to anyone, others can help out in solving the problem they face. By traveling in a group along with a tour guide, they can help each other and make their tour most successful.\n\nDuring the journey, they face many problems like food, shelter for changing clothes, etc. If the people go on a tour along with a group, they can help out in providing shelter, food, and other small and big problems.\n\nIf suddenly the vehicle breaks down and it takes a few hours to repair, then they can have a nice time with their mates. Simply, they pass the time happily and unforgettable. Anyway, that's all depends on the individuals, but going along with a group makes the individual see the things happily and have a great scope to have good knowledge about the place what they see.\n\nIf we take an example of an industrial tour of engineering students, like Tata Motors in India, etc. There, I definitely prefer to go along with a group because they have to recollect their subject when they see the industry. At the same time, your professor acts as a tour guide. No one can recollect the information at that moment what they studied, but if you go with a group, they can share their own knowledge with others, such that they can see the things more interestingly and gain more knowledge. Similarly, if an office staff wants to improve their industry, there it is need to visit higher industries and make points what should improve in their industry. This is possible only when he goes along with teammates and a guide. He can point out very good things if he discusses the things with his mates. At the same time, he need not spend much time to know the unknown thing as a guide is provided for them.\n\nThus, I can strongly agree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide."}

It is supposed to be a more liberal education with fewer rules and more freedom, but maybe we are giving freedom to people who are not ready to use it properly yet.\n\nWhat I wanted to say with that is that young people today spend more time looking at themselves than trying to be part of society.\n\nMaybe it is because they are living in a society that does not offer them what they are looking for, and for that reason, they are not in the mood to participate in their communities.\n\nWe are living in the telecommunications era. You can live without human touch, without going out of your own house. Most young people think that their community is too small for them, so they use the internet to feel they are part of something really great, to feel important. They do not mind if their neighbor needs salt or if their hometown is clean or not. They are above all that.\n\nAs an example, I can use a new kind of culture that I read about in a magazine last week. It is a new way of life, very extended in Japan, and their philosophy of life is not to have any personal relations if it is not via the internet. So they break off with their families and with their friends and start living all by themselves. Using the internet for everything, for working, making their shopping, making friends, and all the natural things that we are used to doing in our lives.\n\nHearing things like that, I have got the hope that maybe in the future, young people will help their communities, maybe they would be cyber-communities, but the main idea is to be part of something."}
{"file_id": "1110699.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with this statement. Advertising is an art, an art of making products seem attractive and perfect. It is also the art of convincing consumers to buy the product. Consumers who are not wise enough or who are too influenceable buy products because of the advertisements.\n\nFirst of all, I would say that advertisement companies tend to have a lot of money, so they can make beautiful, attractive advertisements. They have a lot of means to attract the consumer. TV advertisements are the easiest way to convince a consumer to buy your product, whereas written advertisements in newspapers, for example, are less convincing because they are not interactive. On TV ads, you can see people using, eating the product the company is selling. They reach the consumer more easily.\n\nSecondly, advertisements are made to make products seem better than they are in real life. It is an art. For example, when you see an advertisement for a frozen pizza, the pizza always looks hot, savory. Usually, you can see the cheese melting, whereas when you buy it and heat it up, it is nothing compared to that advertisement; it is a normal frozen pizza, not a homemade one.\n\nThirdly, advertisement is a lure for consumers. People do not buy a product for its consistency but for the way it looks in the ad. Sometimes, ads tend to lie about the qualities of the product, for example, toothpaste that makes your teeth white as snow, or a soap that eliminates all the imperfections of a teenage skin.\n\nTo conclude, I would say that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are because it is one of the goals of advertising, the first one being to sell a product. But to sell a product in huge quantities, you have to make it special, better than the others, attractive, or even emphasize the results of this product."}

Life goes fast, and we want to pursue and achieve our plans because today everything is planned in advance, and there is no time for civic behavior.\n\nIn addition, globalization and internationalization have made the population mix, as there are more mixed communities, and people have an identification problem: which community for which people? Regarding recent events, communities are rivals and fight between them. So, there is no unity in this world; why would young people change this by helping who and with which means?\n\nModern life makes young people very narcissistic and selfish, but some want to implicate themselves in a cause, in something they can progress and be useful. Some will help the oldest and disabled people in their neighborhood by doing their shopping for them. Others will come into an association to create a better life place for their community.\n\nIndeed, some associations and organizations have social aims in which young people want to be involved.\n\nIn my case, I really want to represent Blacks in France because there is a lack of representation, even in media, fashion, intellectual, and scientific work. So, I went to Boucle d'Ebene association, which promotes African and Caribbean entrepreneurs, even though I have my studies and different things to manage before helping them.\n\nTo conclude, I agree with the fact that there is a lack of motivation among young people to involve themselves in social and civic activities to help their communities. In fact, they seem to be overbooked by their stuff, such as school, work, friends, and early childhood responsibilities. Indeed, nowadays young people have much more responsibilities than fifty years ago! But the reality is that there are a lot of young people who want to change some things in this world by giving time to helping their community. However, sometimes they do not have the means to achieve their project, such as creating an association or a company, and sometimes they are dissuaded by the lack of recognition and credit they are given."}

The old people around me are complaining about the same problem. However, I do not share their idea. In my opinion, young people try to give time to help charity, but they haven't got enough time because of the rush of the twentieth century. Young people have a lot of work to do but not enough time to spend in this century. However, they spend a lot of time on their communities. For instance, they are visiting their family in every celebration. If they have, they give it to the poor people. For example, last night on a television show, a lot of people gave money to a charity to plant trees, and most of the people who gave money to charity were young people. Actually, there wasn't any old people there. This is a remarkable point; a lot of people say young people are guilty about this topic, but maybe old people are guilty. There is an adage that comes from the Hittites; in a Hittite paper, an old person was complaining about young people. It shows that complaining about young people has never changed. The people living in the twenty-second century may complain about young people too. However, it doesn't mean young people are not giving enough time. In conclusion, the young people living in the twentieth century give enough time to their community, even though they have got a lot of jobs to do. We can see this from the television shows, or if we look at history, we will see the same complaints. This is a typical thing, so the old people have to get rid of their complaints."}

Environmental problems are linked with the huge number of cars in the world. Pollution has become a central problem in our societies. In order to respond to this problem, governments focus on many possible solutions, such as the limitation of cars in cities. As an example, the mayor of London has introduced a congestion charge in the center of London in order to limit the number of cars. As far as I am concerned, I think that this solution is very convincing, as it has been proved that the number of cars has been reduced in the city.\n\nMoreover, public transports are supported by many governments. The cost of underground is very cheap in some countries, such as France. I would rather take the bus or the tube instead of driving my car. On the other hand, the cost of driving licenses has considerably increased during the last years. As a result, people are more likely to take the bus or to use the underground than before.\n\nHowever, emerging countries such as India or China are not ready to reduce their production of cars. Most of their economy is based on this production. Therefore, environmental issues are not the priority of governments. Although these countries are aware of cars' pollution, they do not take preventive measures in order to solve this problem.\n\nBut many measures have been taken in order to face this problem. The Kyoto Protocol illustrates the capacity to deal with the huge problem of pollution in the world. The problem is that many industrial countries did not sign this protocol.\n\nTo conclude, I think that we can hope that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today, because governments make us aware that cars represent a huge scourge for our societies. As a consequence, many measures have been taken and will be taken in order to reduce car activity. However, even though many things have been done, the number of cars will increase because many poor countries need this economy in order to survive."}

People living in metropolises might not need cars, but people living in rural areas have to use cars to live. They live far away from grocery stores, malls, and their workplaces. Needless to say, we need individual cars. We cannot use public transportation systems such as buses and trains because it may be faster to transport ourselves than to use public transportation. In addition, most of us will keep using individual cars.\n\nI think that there are not enough reasons to reduce car usage because we do not care about the environment; we care only about ourselves.

First, you can share and exchange your opinions and feelings on the sites you visit with your groupmates. It is often very enjoyable and refreshing to listen to other people's feedback.\n\nSecond, the tour guide takes you only to locations that matter the most or that are the most representative of the country visited. Therefore, you avoid wasting time deciding where to go and whether the designated location is worth visiting. The guide is often a great source of important information about the visited site. He can turn the visit into a very interactive way, something you couldn't get from a book.\n\nFinally, the tour and the guide make the travel much more enjoyable as everything is already planned. There is no need to bother with organization details and unexpected events. Everything is handled by the guide and the tour company.\n\nHowever, travelling in a group and with a tour guide may also have some disadvantages. In my eyes, being in a group means that you no longer master your time. Unless you are selfish and impose your ideas on others, you cannot do what you want. You have to stay within the bounds and respect other people's wishes. And listening to someone whining the whole day because the schedule does not please them is indeed extremely annoying.\n\nBesides this, a tour means everything is already planned. There is therefore no room for sudden changes of schedule or unexpected locations to visit. The excitement might be undermined. If the tour company provides poor services or the guide lacks knowledge about the location, then your experience may turn out to be very disappointing and frustrating. Another very bad habit of touring companies and guides is the fact that they often take you to locations, restaurants, museums with which they have a partnership, a deal, so you are invited to purchase items in those locations and not others. Personally, I dislike very much those practices as I have the feeling of being a kind of toy in their hands.\n\nMy best advice is to choose carefully the tour company. To rely on other people's feedback, friends, in order to determine which tour company suits our wishes and needs best. About the group, my suggestion is to welcome things as they come and always focus on what pleases you the most, and to sweep away any little annoying detail."}

These young people believe they do not need to help out their community, as they think others will do it instead of them, or it is simply a waste of time. I believe they do not understand the moral of helping the community in need. Furthermore, young people nowadays are a lot lazier than they used to be, and so they lack the motive, as they consider helping the community to be 'work', and, as we all know, young people tend to dislike work as it is not enjoyable. This motive is probably influenced by school work, which is more of a requirement rather than a choice.\n\nSecondly, the fact that the world is becoming more competitive and also a lot more interesting, youngsters are becoming more involved in other activities and their studies rather than contributing towards their communities. These young people may have objectives such as going to the best universities or simply enjoying life by relaxing, and, in my personal experience, I have never come across a young individual who actually wants to give their time to help their communities. As a result, as young people prefer to spend their time in a different way, there are very few who feel they should help out their communities.\n\nIn conclusion, as young people are not tempted to help the community, as it is not enjoyable, and the fact that they have better, perhaps more important things that must be done, young people nowadays do not give enough time nor effort to helping their communities."}

To my mind, most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.\n\nIndeed, the aim of an advertisement is to sell a product. That is why they are ready to say everything that can convince you to buy it. People who do advertising have no duty to say the truth; their goal is only commercial, not educative. So how can we trust advertising?\n\nTo illustrate this fact, we can take the example of McDonald's. If we look at an advertisement for this restaurant, we can learn that meals are usually very dietetic, they are not bad for the health, and pictures of meals are really teasing. But according to the experience made on McDonald's food in Supersize Me, we can see that this food is not good for the health.\n\nTo give another example, we can consider makeup advertisements. Women who play in these advertisements are models, and if we put on this makeup, we will not look like the model. Moreover, on her, the rimel seems to be something very efficient, but on us, it does not have the same effect! So the product works better on TV or in an advertisement than in real life.\n\nIt is usually the same for washing products, which wash our clothes more white than white.\n\nWe have to keep in mind that the advertising world is an imaginary world where everything is perfect. That is not supposed to reflect reality. That sells us dreams, and that is what we buy when we buy a product after having seen its advertisement. Indeed, all is fake on an advertisement; people are retouched, they always seem happy, and think everything is delicious or amazing.\n\nTo conclude, we can say that, yes, advertisements usually make products better than they really are because their main stake is to sell something and not to be true."}

And also, if you needed help, he can help you, or if you don't speak the language of that country you are in, he can help you with that. For example, if you were in Paris and you don't speak French, what can you do if you were alone? At that time, a guide would help you a lot. And to be with a group is so much fun than being alone; that's where you can meet new people, make new friends, and enjoy your time. It's also much cheaper to travel with a group rather than traveling alone, so it would save you a lot of money. For example, if you wanted to go anywhere, you will have to take a cab, but if you were with a group, you can go on the bus; it would be much cheaper.

After some years, the child will go to school, which is an institution, and from there, he will learn some things. Afterward, when he reaches a certain position, he will be enjoying with his friends, and they will be close to each other as well. They will help each other, and it is important for every person.\n\nHence, it is a must because when he will be in a problem, friends will only help sometimes, and parents will not do so at that time. And hence, it happens when it is true friendship. When there will be any occasion, all the friends will meet, they will enjoy with parties, and all will celebrate and enjoy. That is the age to enjoy life and do whatever he wants because the past never comes, and in such a way, all should enjoy.\n\nWhenever there is a holiday, people will go to the cinema, which will be full entertainment, as well as games like cricket; all will play if they have holidays. It is a nice and interesting game, and going to the picture with friends is a nice enjoyment. All will be happy at that moment, and they will dance in theaters, and it is a nice enjoyment. Hence, in every festival, all the friends will meet, and they will spend their day at that place.\n\nWhile in college, there will be competitions, sports, entertainment, and we can participate and enjoy. We can go to tours with college or with our own way for a week, therefore, we can enjoy the climate in the same while enjoying, and we should also study.\n\nWhile the exam date will come near, we should prepare for exams, and also, we should prepare well for the exams. If we don't know anything, our friends will be helpful in such a way that we can write exams successfully.\n\nWhereas older people cannot do this, which means that when they come to an older age, they should not eat every item, and they should take medicine daily.

And there are no factors prospected that could change the need of cars during the next twenty years.\n\nFirst of all, cars are necessary for many people to reach their place of work. Both of my parents can only get to work by car since the ways are too individual and partly too wide to make use of public transportation.\n\nIf you consider big cities, you cannot always make use of public transportation. Especially in smaller cities, where public transportation may only exist in small or even does not exist at all, and taking a bike is not possible either, you really need a car.\n\nFurthermore, I cannot see any reason why this state of being should change during the next twenty years.\n\nThere will be no doubt. Having a car to get from one place to another is - with few exceptions - the fastest and therefore most comfortable way. Since people desire gaining all amenities possible, they supposedly will not give them up voluntarily.\n\nEveryone who once had the comfort of owning a car appreciates it. So I can see no reason in the future why this would change, either.\n\nLastly, we lack an alternative. There is no more convenient way to travel, and there are so many jobs in the car business. A decrease in consumption would help to kill many thousand jobs. Worldwide, car-producing industries hold so many jobs. Their falling apart would be fatal. Furthermore, the world inhabits a very strong lobby concerning the oil business, which will be interested in a further need and consumption of their oil.\n\nHere, another job-giving area exists that many people depend on. I cannot see that the influence politicians might change that.\n\nStill, a lot of cars are sold, and, in my opinion, will be sold. The world population does decrease in the industrial states slightly, but it will not have the effect that less cars will be in use in twenty years.\n\nConsidering the facts, it may be a good thing if there were fewer cars, for this would help our environment get healthier again.

There are two major points related to this issue.\n\nFirstly, as mentioned above, the accumulation of knowledge in a single area has increased so much that it is impossible to have some discovery on top of it without having a grasp of all prior information. For instance, while most people still have difficulties understanding Einstein and his Relativity Theory, scientists are introducing theories that even extend it, having given a lifetime of study in that subject only. Specialization in a specific topic seems to be the only way of studying science professionally.\n\nSecondly, one can say that it is required to have a broad knowledge of many fields to be able to work on a specific topic since scientific fields are highly interconnected and interdependent. This is, of course, true to some extent. There are many general topics to cover until one has the capacity of advancing to a specialized topic, but that does not stand against the fact that academic subjects are now so complex that one cannot afford distributing his effort among various subjects. In fact, the current education system in most countries in the world is so designed: an introductory undergraduate program covering all the required subjects as a baseline, and then graduate studies specializing in a specific subject with the purpose of academic research.\n\nIn conclusion, whether to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects or to specialize in one specific subject is an important question. While each one has advantages over the other, it seems that specialization is nearly an obligation of modern science regarding its depth and complexity. Specialization is inevitable and must be pursued by every academician, but also not ignoring the background knowledge of the prerequisite subjects."}
{"file_id": "1114825.txt", "output_essay": "An increasing number of students realize that it is more important for them to understand ideas and concepts. Unfortunately, there is a growing opposition among other students who maintain that learning facts is the most important factor in their studies. However, in the final analysis, I conclude that the former one does make sense.\n\nIn the following discussion, I would like to present some points to support my statement.\n\nIn the first place, the key point for my view is that understanding ideas and concepts undoubtedly allows students to cultivate their ability of self-study, which plays the most important role in their studies. Actually, the final aim of students studying in the university is to promote their sense of independent thinking. For example, in their beginning studies, they need a teacher to guide them. But in their future studies, they must deal with problems by themselves. Of course, they need to practice their capability to solve problems when they understand ideas and concepts in class.\n\nIn addition, students can understand ideas and concepts by themselves to check out what they have learned in class. It is beneficial for them to build up their self-confidence.\n\nFurthermore, it is the best way to supervise students. If they cannot understand ideas and concepts, they would fail the exam in the end.\n\nGiven the reasons above, which sometimes intertwine to form an organic whole and thus become more persuasive, we can arrive at the conclusion that inspiring students to master the ability to understand ideas and concepts in class must be undertaken by teachers. Only by this way can we implement quality education; only by this way can we enhance the self-confidence of students, and only by this way can we supervise students' study in an efficient way."}
{"file_id": "1114595.txt", "output_essay": "I fully agree with the statement because of the following reasons. \n\nFirst, an already successful person will accept a higher risk because they have a larger security net if they fail. When the new thing produces a loss, they still have the gains from the successful actions they took before. So, they have a lower risk than a person who could lose everything by experimenting with new things.\n\nSecondly, the hunger for success grows with the success one has. A successful person knows that there has to be more than what they have already achieved. The known old patterns will only provide the known old amount of success. But to increase it, there have to be found new, unknown, and maybe also unfamiliar kinds of ways, which mostly have a higher risk but also a higher possible gain than the conventional ones. If someone has a risky character, they will not stop at the first success but look for more throughout their life.\n\nThe third, and I think most important, argument deals with experience and the fear of the future. If a person has been successful at least once in their life by taking a risk, they have made an important step. By crossing the border in one's own mind once, the next time it will be easier because you get a kind of imagination of what is waiting for you on the other side. Of course, there is no possible calculation with all risks; there will always be some that one did not think about. Despite that, the person knows how to deal with developments that cannot be foreseen, so they have no or at least less fear of them.\n\nThese arguments show why success on a high level is not possible without risks at a high level, and therefore, I agree with the given statement."}
{"file_id": "1113573.txt", "output_essay": "My instant reaction on reading the statement was to get defensive and write about how there are several shining examples of youngsters helping their communities. However, I was forced to change my mind as the more I pondered over the statement, the more I realised that it is sad, but true.\n\nYoung people are often so caught up in their own lives that it has become increasingly difficult to pull them away from their own agenda and try to get them interested in activities that they do not consider 'fun' or 'cool'.\n\nThis can be clearly seen even by the amount of time that young people spend with their own families. We find ourselves resorting to using fast but impersonal modes of communication like email and instant messaging even with our parents and siblings. The amount of human interaction has surely decreased. So, where's the question of helping out one's community?\n\nHowever, I think that the main problem is that most young people do not really know how to help their communities. They might also be hesitant as they feel they have nothing special that they can contribute to the community. Once this myth is dispelled, I think that more youngsters might find joy and pride in being part of something bigger than themselves, their community.\n\nYoung people, with their natural energy and enthusiasm, can come up with bright and innovative ways of helping their community. This can be done in simple but useful ways, such as tutoring some of the younger kids in the neighbourhood, or making a little old lady's day by visiting her in the old-age home, or even going all out and organising an event for the whole community to take part in.\n\nTherefore, while I do agree with the statement, I also have faith in younger people that they can and they will put their iPods down for a while and devote enough time to help their communities. Since no amount of compelling or nagging young people to help out will work, it would be more effective to teach by doing. I feel this can be achieved by getting the whole community involved in a project that everyone finds interesting and can take pride in."}
{"file_id": "1115147.txt", "output_essay": "I agree only partially with the statement that broad knowledge in many academic subjects is better than specializing in one specific subject. In my opinion, it is not enough to have a vast knowledge in one subject. People tend to be narrow-minded if they do not know about any subject but their specific one. A mathematician, for example, can make up a theoretical statistic about the spread of a disease, but they will have to conclude certain irregularities to show the real process.\n\nFurthermore, a certain amount of basic knowledge is important for everyone to participate in daily discussions or to build up a political attitude, for instance. And every employer expects basic knowledge from their potential employees, for example, about the current political and economic situations.\n\nTherefore, it is definitely important to be familiar with more than one single topic. Nevertheless, it is obvious that students have to concentrate on one academic topic if they want to compete with others in a job. They have to know as much as possible about this one specific subject and they have to pay attention to learn about the newest changes and innovations in this subject.\n\nAnd apart from the competitiveness, in some situations, it could also be very dangerous if someone has only broad knowledge of a subject. A doctor with broad knowledge of medicine, for example, is the worst imaginable danger.\n\nApart from that, the whole service sector is based on the fact that people know about one single topic in detail while others know about another. Nobody can learn enough about every subject; professionals would be superfluous.\n\nTo draw a conclusion, students should specialize in one specific subject and, apart from that, they should learn as much as possible about other subjects. Everybody should use their talent to the greatest extent."}

It can be shown in a TV ad by featuring a reputed person, such as a sports personality, film actor, or model.\n\nThe play must be for 30 seconds only, and in that time, we must show all types of things, like what oats contain and how it is useful for daily users, by performing and adding within 30 seconds, showing the emblem of the product.\n\nThe advertisement should be shown globally to people.\n\nGiving an advertisement for a product gives a complete picture or use of the product, which should be seen by people.\n\nA product should have import and export value based on its demand.\n\nThe product should gain demand by showing proper advertisements.\n\nPeople should have a proper idea about the product, and they should believe it by seeing a proper advertisement.\n\nThis means that the advertisement should impress the demanders.\n\nAdvertisements should be shown globally, where we can find the demand.\n\nAdvertisements should have a proper theme that impresses consumers, and they should be attracted by seeing that.

This means it indicates true but not real.\n\nOne good example is that cigar sales are shown on TV advertisements, but on packets, it will return 'SMOKING IS INJURIOUS TO HEALTH.'\n\nThis is the best example of how advertisements make products seem much better than they really are."}
{"file_id": "1114229.txt", "output_essay": "Yes, I am totally in agreement with the notion that it is better to travel in a group instead of traveling alone led by a guide. Actually, in today's materialistic world, there are more safety concerns than ever before. So, it is a wise decision to travel in a group. \n\nFor example, if a person travels to a new town or country and does not know anything about the new place. Then, it is better for him to travel in a group because it lessens his chances of being confused in an unknown place. A person could face a lot of difficulties in a new place, like where to stay, have food, and sometimes he may encounter language problems. So, traveling in a group with a guide will be a helpful option. \n\nTraveling in a group led by a guide is a very good choice, because the guide is familiar with the local language and culture, which helps a lot. Actually, traveling with a guide enhances your joy of the trip because he can tell you a lot about the places you are touring. Further, it is also cheaper and more economical to travel with many people. Because in a group, everybody is contributing to the whole cost, which is mostly less than the cost of traveling alone. \n\nExploring an exotic place alone is not a good option because sometimes there are few minor problems regarding security, which may be encountered by a single traveler. For instance, like a person is going to catch a train in a railway station and someone steals his purse, then he feels that he is in a critical dilemma. Actually, there are a few thieves who attack alone and new travelers. But if you are traveling in a group, they cannot dare to steal your things, or you can complain to your group members. \n\nBasically, traveling alone in a new and unknown place is always a risky task; one should have to be very careful about himself as well as his luggage too. On the other hand, traveling in a group secures a person from these minor problems. \n\nIn conclusion, it is a good and intelligent idea to travel in a group with a guide. It makes you safer and allows you to enjoy your journey."}
{"file_id": "1113915.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people. Young people generally have great verve and energy. Whereas older people cannot enjoy life with such an attitude. Young people normally enjoy their life while doing their mundane jobs. But old people will do their jobs by creating unwanted stress around them. Health is wealth. If you are fit and fine, then only can you live your life in the most hilarious manner. But old people are often surrounded by such kinds of ailments pertinent to age, which restrict them from enjoying.\n\nI have great respect for my grand aunt, who is an inhabitant of our street. I have been watching her since I was in the 5th class. She was very active and alert at that time. She had a little problem because of diabetes, but she had overcome any kind of stress and problem at that time. Now, the conditions have changed. Most of the time, she is not even able to walk properly. She is suffering from such kinds of ailments which are very painful. Whenever I watch her, I can easily understand the savour of young life. Young people readily overcome most of the ailments because of the proper physiological function of their body.\n\nThe other factor that makes old people lethargic towards life is 'Pessimism'. Old people do not prefer to work after the age of 55 or 60, which causes these people to become sluggish and prone to various dreadful diseases. Young people are always ambitious about their career and goals, which motivate them to enjoy life rather than take it as a burden.\n\nYoung people prefer to socialize and make friends with whom they can go to dance bars, hotels, etc. Old people like loneliness. My grand aunt previously was fond of parties and get-togethers. But now, she disdains such kinds of crowds and prefers to live in disgruntled conditions. Young people emancipate themselves from all kinds of bondages and live life with a vivacious attitude. In short, the normal functioning of the body and the optimistic attitude of young people make them so that they can enjoy their life."}
{"file_id": "1109974.txt", "output_essay": "I personally believe that experience and practice are what make a person perfect, according to the proverb 'Practice makes perfect.'\n\nOne needs to have some sort of experience in an area to be successful; for example, a previous mistake or a wrong decision that has been made.\n\nTo begin with, I would like to give an example of my personal experience. In the summer of 2007, I had dislocated my knee during a physical education class at school. We were playing kickball, and it was my turn to kick the ball and run. Due to the slippery floor of the court, I had slipped and almost broke my left leg. It took me a large amount of time to start walking, running, and even sitting again, and the doctor had forbidden me from playing any sorts of sports again, as there was a big risk that the same accident would happen again. However, I did not listen to the doctor's words and started playing basketball, my favorite sport, as soon as I was able to run again. I even joined the Varsity Girls Basketball Team of my school. Now the season is over, and I am glad that I took the risk. However, if I hurt myself again, I would never regret what I did, because I would take a lesson out of it: not to disobey my parents and my doctor again.\n\nAnother example of taking risks and trying new things would be joining the chess club of my school. I had never played chess in my entire life, but as soon as I joined the club, my knowledge of logical thinking has flourished. I enjoy playing the game, even outside of the club, and I am proud that I took the risk and joined the club, even though I was nervous and shy at the beginning.\n\nSome people tend to hate seafood, while others cannot live without it. I believe this is a matter of choice and sometimes a matter of experience. Disregarding people who have allergies, an ordinary human being would enjoy eating something if they were raised eating it. I am a seafood fanatic and therefore adore eating Japanese food. Sushi, the most common type, is something I eat every week. Some of my friends, however, highly dislike sushi. My best friend at school had never tried eating sushi in her life, but she told me about her hunger for seafood several times. Therefore, I took her to a Japanese restaurant once, trying to convince her to eat sushi. She did not want to eat it at first; however, when she tried it, she absolutely loved it. Now, every week, my friend and I go to our favorite destination, the Japanese Restaurant.\n\nExperience is something that happens once in a lifetime and can be used numerous times for different things. I believe that trying new things and taking risks, such as visiting different countries and riding the fast train in an amusement park, will expand a person's overall knowledge and turn them into an open-minded person."}
{"file_id": "1116877.txt", "output_essay": "I believe that most advertisements make products seem better than they really are. This is because the kind of things shown in advertisements do not take into account real-life conditions, and to differentiate products from other competitors, they are hyped for their goodness.\n\nFirstly, advertisements make products seem better than they really are because when an advertisement is made, it does not account for real-life conditions. For example, when an advertisement for a bike is shown, the advertisers do not take into account the braking, stopping, and idling of the bike when they show the mileage of the bike, which most of the time never turns out to be actually achievable at all. With the hyped mileage quoted in the advertisement, the product, in this case the bike, seems to be better than it really is, as it cannot deliver the quoted mileage of the advertisement.\n\nSecondly, companies intentionally make good advertisements of their products that are better than they really are to differentiate their product from the other products available from other companies. By doing this, they try to create a branding and a niche for their product, which is very similar to the other product. Take, for example, laptop companies like Acer and HP, which show the ease of work and graphics display that would not cause eye strain. But in actuality, it does, and is very similar to the other product.\n\nUltimately, advertisements make products seem much better than they really are."}

Learning the facts without understanding the bottom line of it doesn't make sense. It doesn't help people to improve themselves and derive the point from the facts.

They have to know the reasons, factors, consequences, and developments about the facts. Only knowing the fact doesn't stand for much. There is something before the fact and something after the fact. If they know both parts, it makes sense and draws a picture in their mind. It will fly and never be stable in mind without it.\n\nAlso, it is really necessary for students to know the concepts behind the facts to make it easier for them to understand easily. Think about it. When they are learning about gravity, if you don't explain the factors, reasons, and just tell them the ground is pulling us, what would they understand?

{"file_id": "1115860.txt", "output_essay": "Nowadays, there is a discussion about youngsters. It is about whether young people give enough time to helping their communities. In my opinion, young people do not give enough time to helping their communities, as it was in the past. At our time, there are lots of things that youngsters can waste their time with.\n\nFirstly, most young people are wasting time with computers. Computers were made for people's good at first, but then they started to become a toy or a game machine, and no one tried to stop it, because games are a seriously large economic resource for the people working in this sector. For example, young people can try using computers and the internet for searching for information about their country's place in the world and feature predictions about their country. Furthermore, this interest would make young people more interested in their communities.\n\nSecondly, I think that young people are not taking the lessons at their schools seriously enough. There are important lessons given to students at school about their communities, like history and geography. In my opinion, every person related to a community should know their country's history. Also, geography is an important factor for a person to help their community. These are just two factors for a person to help their community that the education of them is given at school. Moreover, school gives the education of loving your country, after your family. These are all well known by people, but, however, still people are not taking it seriously and thinking of schools as game fields.\n\nYoung people are like diamonds. You should shape them; otherwise, you cannot expect anything from them. They have to be shaped if they are wanted to be the saviors of the community. So if a youngster does not give enough time to help their community, it is also their family's fault."}
{"file_id": "1114626.txt", "output_essay": "The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide, a statement I can totally agree with, and my opinion is based on several factors.\n\nFirst off, the main reason for traveling usually is to explore the place visited and see the beautiful attractions in it. That's why it is necessary to find a professional and experienced local to guide you to the places, because he knows his job and he knows what he's doing, so he would, with no doubt, take you to the places often admired by tourists, like beautiful scenes and natural beauties.\n\nFor example, I remember when I went with my family to Egypt. I remember we met this young woman who was appointed to meet us as our tour guide. I can't find words to describe how excellent her choices were and how greatly we were satisfied with the places we saw and the activities we took part in, since we saw most of the breathtaking attractions in Giza, like the Pyramids, Sphinx, and the national museums in that area, where we had a short lesson about hieroglyphs. Also, getting a tour guide who's also local can make a splendid combination, because you can't find someone who'd try hard to show you places in his town to make you love the place like a local.\n\nSecondly, by getting a touring guide, you can avoid a great deal of trouble you may face if you were all alone. Touring guides are often accompanied by security guards who are common and familiar with situations that can cause some tourists unhappiness, or make them uncomfortable, or, in worst cases, be in danger, such as getting caught in overwhelming traffic, being lost, getting a great deal of disturbance from beggars, or even, in worst cases, being endangered by tourist-targeting criminals.\n\nSo that's why I do think that tour guides are a must, instead of going solo, getting unsatisfied with what you see, and giving the place you visit a bad name as a result of that choice you've taken."}

If students only learn one specific area, that will lead to misunderstandings of some parts of academic subjects.

Otherwise, they could not totally understand its meaning or how to figure out the answer. For example, students have to know mathematics first and then they can use it in an accounting class. On the other hand, if people have broad knowledge, they can understand what the newspaper is talking about. They also can join any kind of topic to share their opinion. If people only concentrate on their area, they will lose many chances to know new friends.\n\nPeople specializing in one area is good for their careers in the future because they can deeply understand their professional knowledge. As a matter of fact, after graduation, people can gain more specific knowledge when they work. It would be better than learning specific knowledge in school, so they don't need to focus on it.

{"file_id": "1115221.txt", "output_essay": "I do not agree with the following statement: 'Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.' I think that the correct statement will be the exact opposite. I'm going to defend my point of view first by proving that to succeed, people need to study, then success needs to be built step by step, and finally, success comes from others' trust.\n\nFirst of all, I personally think that to succeed, studying is needed. Going to college is not a risk but the opposite, an insurance in life. It's an investment in life for a better future and a secure one. Of course, going to college can be seen as something new at the beginning, but it's not exactly like that. It's more like a continuation of a reach to knowledge. By having a degree, people learn how to do something well.\n\nThe second reason why I disagree with this statement is that I think that success is something which needs to be built. It's not coming easily and fast. It's a long daily work, and to increase the chance to achieve it, stability is required. Running and rushing from one plan to another one won't lead anywhere.\n\nFinally, I think that to succeed in life, trust from folks is a must-have. Without trust, there is no possible real success. And taking risks is the worst way to reach that trust from people around. Again, trust is something to build day after day. And to get it, knowledge in the activity is also required; nobody is going to trust somebody new in a realm who doesn't know what they are talking about.\n\nOf course, success can come to someone who is taking risks, but it's like the lottery - it happens to one in a million. I think that knowledge, stability, and trust are the keys to success."}
{"file_id": "1111103.txt", "output_essay": "I totally agree with the statement that 'it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.' \n\nAccording to me, understanding ideas and concepts is more important for a student than learning facts. \n\nFirstly, to understand a topic, for example, any topic related to physical science like light, we should know the basic concepts to deal with it and basic ideas like thinking for ourselves where it is actually coming from. I think that's enough to understand the topic. Concepts should be more clear, like various laws of reflection and refraction, to use them for further study, not about the facts of where they originated, etc. \n\nFrom a student's perspective, we should be clear with the concepts first and the basic ideas, like, for example, taking the 'brain where it has never been before' about the topic. These generated thoughts are called ideas. Generating ideas is a really brainstorming technique that helps to increase a student's morale. \n\nSimilarly, if a student goes in search of a fact, there are 9 out of 10 times they will fail. This failure will lead to a lower morale of a student, through which feelings of negativity can come into their mind. This will lead to the buildup of a negative attitude, which can hamper their future also. Facts are those that we go and try to find after completing our bachelor's or even after our master's. Therefore, at a student's age, we should only learn the concepts involved. \n\nOne more thing I would like to add to make my assumption stronger is that when we appear in any subjective class at the school/college level, what is our teacher's main aim or where they put more stress? They stress more on concept-building systems than going in search of a fact. I agree that facts are also required; we should know, but the major focusing point should be concepts and developing students to think beyond the limit. \n\nAt the end, in a nutshell, I would like to say that concepts are the ones that make students more clear about the topic, able to judge it properly. These concepts are the major supported elements in a student's life, which help them to think more, to create/generate ideas, to be able to get things done in a more fruitful way, which are basically needed academically and in professional life too."}

You have a week or two and you plan to go somewhere. First of all, most people want comfort in such cases and they would want to go to the major sightseeings. In such cases, an organized tour led by a guide is the best option: the tourist company will arrange everything for you - all you have to do is enjoy. The guide will tell you what most travelers would like to know, and you don't have to refer to a book to find out about the sightseeing you're at. You are free of all the uncertainties and risks involved in traveling alone and being responsible for yourself.\n\nBut traveling in a group led by a tour guide has several restrictions, and they are even frustrating if you are seeking adventures or totally personal experiences. I felt it personally when I went to a Turkic tombstone in rural Mongolia with a group of tourists. The tombstone was awesome, at least for me, for I was interested in Turkic history. It had an inscription on it, and I was badly wanting to try to read it on my own (I once spent some time trying to learn the old letters). But the group had only two hours to spend there, and I had to leave the tombstone with them too because other members of the group did not share the same interest, and the schedule said that we should be at the tourist camp by 4 o'clock. I felt so frustrated that I decided then that I will go there alone sometime afterwards. So this example of mine illustrates the bad point of guided travel - you're not free to decide where to go or where to stay for how long. You can't actually, if I can put it this way, 'taste' the activity and the place because the experience is not all yours: it rather turns out to be a group experience, and it does not give you that feeling when you find, do, think about, or experience something on your own without being distracted.\n\nPersonally, therefore, I prefer to travel alone if I have enough time, but at the same time, I agree that organized travel can be a useful and enjoyable experience if you do not have enough time or if you are not really into the destination of your travel."}

Although I had been a salesperson for five years, I tried the production field of a computer company. I did well because I knew what the client wanted from our products. If I had not tried a new field, I would not have succeeded in the job.\n\nTherefore, I definitely agree with the statement that trying new things and taking risks rather than doing what people know well makes people successful."}

Trying new things makes people realize their new sides.\n\nWhen I was in South Korea, I was a successful student. I studied really hard to get good grades in middle school. I was always making A's in Korean classes. I loved to study Korean literature, and I was successful in writing creative stories and poems.\n\nOne day, my dad suggested that I study in America. He thought I could experience a new culture and learn a new language. I was really concerned when I heard about my father's suggestion. I thought I was only capable of learning Korean. Moving to America seemed really difficult for me. For a long time, I thought about the advantages that I could get from America. I had an opportunity to learn a new language, and I could experience Western culture.\n\nAfter three months, I decided to leave South Korea. I took a risk to go to America, and I was ready to challenge myself. When I first arrived at Dallas, I was amazed by the size of my high school. There were so many great students and teachers. It was difficult for me to follow the classes, but I didn't give up. I always studied after school and tried to speak with students from different countries. This helped me develop my English skills.\n\nI studied really hard, and now I am very satisfied with myself. I am making good grades at school, and I made a lot of friends. Also, I am learning Spanish in my school. The things that seemed impossible are happening now. The risks and changes developed me into a more skilled and better person. I think I made a good decision. Coming to America gave me opportunities for my future.\n\nI am not going to stop from here. I am planning to learn about journalism and photography. These are things that I have never studied before. I think taking risks and trying new things made me develop. I learned a lot from new experiences, and I am pleased with it. I will keep learning, and I am confident that this will make me a successful person in the future."}

I have three reasons to support my answer.\n\nFirstly, taking risks is a way of finding new chances. I think the bigger the risk is, the bigger the chance you have. And to make that chance your own, you will need hard work, and that will make you a strong person.\n\nSecondly, taking a risk and trying new things can give you a new perspective and can make you have a bigger knowledge that can help you to become more successful. For example, for me to start cheerleading in my high school was a big risk for me. Because I used to be a very shy person and did not like to do things in front of everyone else, but for me to start cheerleading gave me the courage to let myself out in front of the crowd. The practices were very hard, and that made me a stronger person than I was before.\n\nThirdly, trying new things gives us an opportunity to meet different people and know their thoughts, and gives us a new perspective.\n\nThese are the reasons I agree with this statement."}

One is for the benefit of human beings, and the other is towards destroying them.\n\nWell, talking about the one that is harming us. The increase in the number of cars nowadays is actually making our lives more complicated and difficult. For example, in Dubai, it takes a person around two hours to reach their office during rush hours!\n\nSo, the governments thought seriously about that issue and are now constructing a subway that can let you reach any place in the city within a few minutes! At that time, I think many cars will be sold because they will be of no use.\n\nAnd I think one of the most crowded cities in terms of cars is London. By the 2020s, people might get rid of their cars and go buy bicycles. Science, after 20 years from now, will be rapidly and increasingly progressed. And scientists might develop some kinds of cars that can fly with their own tracks, which they can build over each other, so as to make use of space!!\n\nThere might also be some kinds of motorcycles that are so sophisticated and secured that they can alternate the use of cars.

Maybe young people are not supposed to give a helping hand to their communities and should focus on their education or on having fun instead? I would like to argue that this is not the case, that there are many benefits in young people doing community work, and thus that young people ought to invest more of their time in these activities.\n\nObviously, there are many direct benefits for the communities. If many young people are engaged in helping the elderly, giving free tuition to younger school kids, clearing public places from rubbish, the community can save on these activities and put the money to some other beneficial use.\n\nMoreover, the communities gain indirectly from stronger youth participation. Accomplishing meaningful tasks together with their peers will keep many young people from doing things that would do damage to their communities. Think about petty crimes and vandalism.\n\nFinally, it is not only the community as a whole that benefits, but there is also something in for the young people who engage in community work. I may not have appreciated it from the very beginning, but after a while of doing community service, I realized how talking to and helping elderly and disabled people made me see the world with different eyes.

{"file_id": "1117740.txt", "output_essay": "Someone might say that young people enjoy life more than older people do. I personally agree with this statement. I know that there are many examples that seem to prove the contrary, but I think that they are absolutely not the norm. A young person is far more athletic and healthy than an older one. And, not to undervalue, they have fewer responsibilities. When you get rid of all the things you have to worry about, life becomes instantaneously more enjoyable. So, fewer responsibilities mean fewer things to worry about. Another reason is obviously the athletic state of the body. At a certain age, there are just a lot of movements you have difficulties doing, so even a simple action, like, for example, riding a bike or running, becomes hard to do. And when you cannot do such basic movements, you cannot accomplish more complicated tasks. Health is another important factor. Who enjoys going to the pharmacy or, worse, to the hospital? Older people have to take care of their body continuously, maybe taking pills or other medical treatments of some sort. And when you are not at that point, you know that sooner or later you will. But the body is nothing without the mind. It's scientifically proven that at a certain age, the mental abilities of an individual start to decrease dramatically. This has consequences on the whole body's activity, but let's just concentrate on the mind aspect. Even those activities that don't involve physical activity are precluded. A chess match, crosswords, and any other kind of that stuff. These problems listed here are all problems that a normal person wouldn't have if they are young. So, the conclusion is that when you are in the middle of your youth (and don't have any serious problems of other sorts), you have all the doors open, and these doors keep closing while the years pass by."}

I believe it is more preferable to first have vast knowledge.\n\nFirst, knowledge is good for my children. If I have more knowledge, I will be able to educate my children better. My father used to teach me things that I did not learn at school. For example, my school did not teach why water is formed around a glass of cold water. I was always curious about it, and it was my father who told me the answer. As my father taught me, I want to do the same thing to my children.\n\nIn addition, the chances of getting a job increase. Let's say that I took geometry, biology, and psychology in college. Although I did not specialize in one subject, I still have a lot of information in each subject. I can be a math teacher, a worker in a biological museum, or a guidance counselor at middle school. What will happen if I specialized only in geometry? Once I can no longer be a geometry teacher, I will have nothing to do but wait.\n\nFinally, I can pick a subject and specialize in it later. I will experience and evaluate the subjects while I learn many subjects. After the education, I will have a pretty good idea which subjects fit my interests. Using the same example as before, let's assume that I became very interested in biology. People say there is no end to learning; I will not hesitate to take biology again and go deeper into it.\n\nIn conclusion, I think learning a variety of subjects is important, because it allows me to teach my children, get a job, and specialize in a subject that is suitable for me."}

If it is not known what 'plus' means, it cannot be said that one plus one equals two.\n\nSecond, knowing the reason or reasons shows the paths that the facts follow.

{"file_id": "1116071.txt", "output_essay": "Personally, I agree with the statement 'Young people enjoy life more than older people do.' There will be many people disagreeing with this, but there are three major reasons to convince. Those three are health, knowledge, and transportation.\n\nFirstly, I think this way because younger people have better health than older people. I was playing on the beach with my relatives. My cousins and I were running, splashing, swimming, and surfing. It was a lot of fun for us, as everyone agrees. Suddenly, my aunt called us to come out. It was a big surprise for us. She called us because my grandfather had fainted. As a result, old people have bad health to enjoy their life.\n\nSecondly, younger people have different knowledge than that of older people. Most people my age (14) know a lot of entertaining places and fun places. Eventually, older people can't go out broadly because they don't know many places to go. This was my friend's grandparents' story. It was a hot sunny day, and they were retired from their work, so they had a lot of time to go out. So, they wanted to go out somewhere, but they couldn't. They phoned my friend and asked her where to go. I was a little bit surprised at first, but I understand that they had a different lifestyle than us back when they were young like us.\n\nLastly, the reason I agreed with the statement is that we have better transportation. Although grandparents have lots of time, some of them cannot drive because they had totally different lives compared to us. Nowadays, most university students can drive because it's widely used, but old people didn't have a chance to learn driving. Also, younger ones can ride buses, subways, and skytrains. Unfortunately, older people can't go by standing; they have to sit down somewhere, but sometimes public transportation doesn't have enough spots for them to sit down.\n\nIn conclusion, young people can enjoy life better than older people. It doesn't mean that every elder is like this, but a lot of proportion of them are like this. I think enjoying life when we are young and enjoying a more quieter and relaxing life is better for elders."}

If a product is launched without ads, no one knows what it is, and they do not buy it either. Advertisements are given for products and released into the market so that at least people recognize it. It may appeal to some people, and if it is good, they will use it regularly.\n\nAll the popular brands in the world are investing at least a quarter of their money in ads. This shows how important it is for a product to be launched. Advertisements are not a new idea; it has been a practice since ancient times. In ancient times, ads were in the form of carvings on stones.\n\nTo know whether a product is good, one cannot say for sure until after using it. Even though a lot of campaigns are done for products, if it is not worthy, the results will be that no one will afford to buy it. The product itself has to have substance; otherwise, no ads can promote its sale. For example, my father bought a Daewoo Motors Matiz car after seeing the ads, but later it had a lot of faults. Then, my father told his colleagues not to buy that one. The feedback for that company was not good. As a result, it flopped in India.\n\nNowadays, advertisements are one of the good markets in the world. All products hire celebrities to be their brand ambassadors. Kids are influenced by it; if their favorite star advertises for it, they will want to buy it. Every field requires ads to promote its product. For example, movie stars campaign before the premiere to promote their movies, and models are launched to popularize brands of cars. Similarly, inaugurations of malls, etc., create hype for their product, even to the extent that some of them talk about their product. Thus, it shows that their product reaches the people.\n\nWhether a product is good or not can only be said after using it. All the above reasons show that one can only buy when they know about the product, and this can be done through advertisements."}

When I was a high school student, I visited Kyoto in a group with my school. Then, I wanted to go to Sanjusangen temple. However, the plan of the tour did not include the temple. Therefore, I couldn't visit there.\n\nSecond, although the time to look around the place is usually limited in a group tour, you can spend as much time as possible looking around. You wouldn't be able to understand the history of the place if the time for sightseeing is limited. When I went to Todaiji temple on my school trip, I couldn't check carefully the explanation of the temple or the statues of gods because I didn't have enough time. Furthermore, when you walk around the place or the town, you may notice good things that you couldn't find in a group tour, for example, the kindness of people there or delicious foods.

I don't think so. I think successful people are the ones who are topmost in their field. If he or she can do one thing best, he or she will be a successful person. For this point of view, successful people do not always have to try new things and take risks.\n\nWe see someone who does something new and succeeds, so that we say successful people \"always\" try new things and take risks. I think it's too abrupt. We will say that because we only see the successful ones. We have little chance to see the failed ones. Trying new things and taking risks also means a high probability of failure. Therefore, many people prefer to spend their time on what is already known, and they work hard so that they can outbeat their rivals.\n\nAlso, only the \"try\" is not enough. We have to spend more time and energy to improve the invention. And the improvement part is more annoying and complicated. If he or she is one who is only willing to spend their time to find or invent something new, but too lazy to improve it, he or she will not succeed. On the other hand, if there is one who is willing to work hard to find the improving ways, one is more likely to succeed than the original inventor or finder.\n\nTake Japan for example. The Americans invented cars, but they didn't spend time to improve cars. And the Japanese spent a lot of time and money to improve cars. Now, Japan becomes the biggest country producing cars.\n\nTherefore, I think the key point of success is not trying new things, but being willing to work hard or not."}

With a tour guide, we see our decisions being influenced by the guide, and we get to see places the guide wants us to see rather than what we want to see. It was on my school trip that my classmates and I had a pretty bad experience with the guide appointed to us. The guide would take us to places we didn't want to see, and, being a local, got us into a hotel that was quite expensive, because by doing so, he would get a commission from the hotel authorities for getting them customers. Other than that, we had some other bad experiences only because of the reason that the guide was a local and was looking for grabbing commissions wherever we went.\n\nThe best advantage in traveling alone would be that we could find out about a place by interacting with the locals or getting a copy of the local travel guide to guide us to the best places to visit. In today's advanced world, we get to have the information of a place at our fingertips through the internet. We also have amazing travel guide books that come in various languages and help us in getting a feel of the local culture.\n\nI would like to end the topic on the point that I took this decision based on my personal experience and the other travel experiences that were great just because of the fact that we didn't take a guide along."}

If his conclusions are right and matched, he is successful in his research, but he doesn't stop until he will research on another species, and his life goes on.If he is confined to one particular research in his lifetime, that would not be as effective, as things go on changing, and the species can adapt to different environments, so he had to succeed further.\n\nThe same is the case of a business manager or a owner of a business.A businessman is successful in the corporate world with his product, and once he earns a lot of profit with this product, but he will not be restricted to making that particular product only; he would certainly do experiments and launch new products. If the product clicks, he is successful, but if the product doesn't click, still he would be successful and would try to make implications on that.\n\nAnother thing is that success does not lie in doing a routine job; everyone should experiment and do different things, as there is a lot in the world to still learn, and we can come through them.If we are not successful in any of the experiments we did, it doesn't matter; we get through the subject, and we can then finally have a pool of knowledge on different fields."}

In that sense, not all but many travels with tour guides miss the chance to enjoy the travel.\n\nFirst, generally, the trip with a tour guide is easier to get information or knowledge of the country you visit. You don't have to buy a guidebook nor collect the information from the internet before you leave. Even though you haven't done those things, the tour guide will tell you all you want to know, such as good restaurants, exciting amusement parks, or beautiful sites. Without a tour guide, you have to do all of these things by yourself, so you can get a well-rounded understanding through this action.\n\nSecond, feeling and knowing different ways can be achieved by knowing the native people. But there are fewer chances to get along with them on a tour trip. There is less free time on a tour because the guide schedules most of the time.

During our school and college years, we have all had the chance to experience many teaching methods throughout our professors. When some teachers believe that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts, others believe that what matters is learning the facts.\n\nDuring lectures, professors try to pass along a certain idea or concept to their students. Undoubtedly, lectures are too theoretical and not too exciting, but they remain essential. What will the student remember on the day of his exam from his lectures? What is he supposed to remember? I believe that part of making studying an enjoyable experience is understanding the material we are studying. Once we have understood the material, it is printed logically in our heads.\n\nUnderstanding a lesson begins with understanding the ideas and concepts, as they form the essence of the material. But to understand the ideas and concepts, especially when it comes to complex ideas and concepts, it seems useful to start by learning the facts.\n\nLearning the facts makes you understand the ideas and concepts more easily.\n\nFor example, if a student wants to understand Einstein's concept of relativity, a revolutionary concept in physics, it would be better to start with the facts. Once the student would have understood the facts about the relativity concept, he could be more capable of understanding the concept as a whole.\n\nTherefore, I believe that it is as important to understand ideas and concepts as it is to learn facts: the two being linked to one another, leading to a better understanding of the material."}

The space development is typical of trying new things and overcoming risks.\n\nSecondly, if you do the same thing ordinarily, it is impossible to grow. For example, although you learned something in school, if you don't take in the information, the information becomes vain.

A distance of ten kilometers would usually take about ten minutes to cross twenty years ago; however, nowadays that same distance would take about forty minutes to cross. People are beginning to wonder if a person walked a certain distance or drove in a car, does the walking individual reach the designated point faster? Such issues are becoming a serious concern to our world. Yet every problem must have a solution, and Earth has a trait that when a human creates a problem, eventually he will find a solution. Yet that solution would cause another problem.\n\nI personally agree with the statement since already certain protocols are being done in order to deal with such a problem. Mass transit has been extremely subsidized, and an incentive to carpool is being stressed upon. Subway rails, trains, and monorails are being created in order to draw away all the individuals found on the roads. In twenty years, there will be definitely fewer cars than what is present today, since individuals would no longer depend on a biased form of transport. Certain cities in our world today can prove how mass transit is an effective way of reducing the number of cars.\n\nLondon, England is a perfect example to be used as a city who uses all its transportation methods and incentives to the max. A person who lives in London does not necessarily need to be stuck in rush hour when he is tired from work and just wants to go home. Such an individual can just enter the tube station and ride the subway to the nearest station to his residence. This type of transportation, when people began to adapt to it, greatly affected the roads of London, as year by year the streets began to clear up. Countries would probably follow the footsteps of London in the near future.\n\nTokyo, Japan is another example of a country that enforces mass transit; however, poorly executed. Underground stations are present within the city, yet the transit system does not support such a mass amount of individuals. Such a situation might solve the problem of fewer cars on the road, but it causes the problem of more people crowded at underground stations.\n\nThe examples presented support the theory behind this argument, which is yes, there will be fewer cars in twenty years than there is today; however, that does not solve the main problem. Cars on their own do not cause a crowding effect; people driving the cars cause the crowding effect. When mass transits are used efficiently, then that certain amount of individuals will be evenly distributed among different routes of transport. Yet if mass transit is provoked, then that mass of individuals would just yield to another route, transferring the same problem from point A to point B. Fewer cars will be present in twenty years, but it's up to each individual country to distribute the main problem."}

The product is always displayed in a way that seems appealing to the viewer. Sometimes the company advertising the product tends to exaggerate in advertising.

{"file_id": "1119334.txt", "output_essay": "It is debatable whether traveling alone is the best way to travel compared to traveling with a tour guide. Some people might recommend traveling alone at least once in order to have alone time to sort out their thoughts and relieve stress by having peace away from their heavy load of tasks. However, I firmly believe that going on a trip alone is not the best way to travel because there are many dangerous vacation spots, and it is time-consuming.\n\nFirst of all, traveling in a group of people with a tour guide is much safer. It is a tour guide who knows well about the vacation spots based on their previous experience by living in the place for a long time. We not only obtain accurate information about the places we should not go but also are protected by being with a group of people. Therefore, by traveling with a group of people led by a tour guide, people are not likely to face unexpected situations, including losing their money to robbers, meeting gangsters, and getting lost. For example, when I traveled to Hong Kong alone two years ago, I went in the opposite direction to the park that I had planned to go. I could not speak Chinese, so I could not ask anything to the people around me. I felt scared and cried all the way.\n\nIn addition, traveling with a tour guide in a group is much time-saving. This is because people do not have to make a schedule by researching the information about famous places by combing through all the books and calling all the hotels to reserve. People just follow the guided direction without worrying to check the time schedule of transportation, whether the hotel reservation is available or not. Without worrying about those things, people can spend more enjoyable time with a group of people by talking about their feelings and sharing impressions with each other. To demonstrate, according to the research conducted by the Labor of Korea in 2007, 75% of people felt more memorable and enjoyable trips when they traveled with a group of people by tour guide. In addition, they answered that the reason why they felt happy with the trip was that they did not have to worry about the information making the trip.\n\nFor these reasons, traveling with a group of people is more advantageous to make their trip more fun because of the time and feeling of safety. I believe that people should take into account those things before they go on the trip alone."}
{"file_id": "1119584.txt", "output_essay": "Everyone has one day dreamed of inventing something new, which would make him rich and successful. I must say I believe in people's intelligence. I mean that we are all capable of inventing something that will make us rich. So, I do agree with this statement because being successful is only the last thing you get when you try new things.\n\nWhen you try new things, you do it because you think that what you are trying is worth the energy you are spending to do it. You are ready to do whatever it takes to accomplish what you began. You are over-motivated, and that's why you succeed in your attempt. This motivation shows your ambition, and that's how you are going to make it. For example, the film Beatrix Potter shows why she became famous - that's because she knew her idea was good, and she had enough motivation to get refusals and to be disapproved by her father.\n\nAnd once you have succeeded, you always want to have this feeling again. The feeling that nothing can stop you, like Leonardo DiCaprio in Titanic, you think you are the king of the world. If you try something new or invent something, it is because you don't like to do always the same thing, even if you can do it very well. It is a lot more exciting to invent something, to think day and night on how you can develop an idea and make it real.\n\nFinally, you try new things because it makes you successful. You don't like to be like everyone else; you want to be apart from the others. And even if you are doing something very well, you have to try new things or a new way to do it because it will show that you don't rely on your knowledge. It will show that you really want to improve yourself. Mozart is considered a genius because he not only knew how to play an instrument very young but also because he created symphonies at a very young age.\n\nAs a conclusion, I would say that everyone should try new things; it is not interesting to rely on what someone else created for us. We have to try something new as well."}
{"file_id": "1120555.txt", "output_essay": "In today's world, nearly every product offered to consumers is being marketed with advertisements. These advertisements introduce the product to its buyers and demand that they buy it. Although these advertisements are good in terms of marketing and introducing new products, it is also clear that they could result in wrong, over-rated assumptions about the product in question because of three major reasons: the fact that the advertisement is a marketing technique, the varying expectations of people, and the influence of professional techniques on our emotions.\n\nFirstly, the definition of today's advertising is 'making people want something', but the introducing part of the advertising is being ignored. For instance, advertisements are being prepared by marketing departments to sell more and more to make profits, not just to declare that the product is made. The increasing number of advertisement offices and the money in this job also indicate that everything about advertisement is about making more money. Because of these factors, the happiness of the consumer is usually being ignored.\n\nSecondly, people often expect different things from a product; one may want durability, but the other may want a more reasonable price. However, an advertisement should be prepared for every potential buyer. Plus, a negative feature that people may want to know would not be emphasized because of this thinking. This, again, would result in the disappointment of the buyer.\n\nThe third thing that would make buyers uncomfortable is the fact that advertising has been used for a long time, and there have been clear ways to make you buy things. For example, when I saw a person who drinks or eats something, I immediately feel a bit thirsty or hungry because my mind thinks of an opportunity to eat something. This fact will affect me to buy the stuff that is being advertised, but probably I would be disappointed because I would have bought the thing without thinking.\n\nAdvertising has become a great part of producing and marketing new goods; every company is using it for nearly every good it produces. It is clear that this thing makes people buy things, otherwise, profit-centered companies wouldn't use them. But making people buy something directly increases the expectations, and therefore, as people expect more from the thing they buy, they become more disappointed."}
{"file_id": "1122810.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.\n\nFor one example, when you think about business, a company has to make new products or explore new techniques to make a difference from other companies. If the company can do this, it can appeal to customers with the difference of their products or services from others, and it can profit itself monopolistically.\n\nFor another example, when you think about a baseball team, every player should try new things, because we don't need the same player so much. It makes no sense to have nine powerful hitters. It makes no sense to have fast runners. To constitute a strong team, the important point is the balance that can infer the best outcome. So every player has to get skills that are different from others and new.\n\nFor a final example, if you are an investor, it makes no sense to invest like others. If you want to have an advantage, you have to invest differently. Of course, I have to admit it is a risky action. You may get a loss sometimes. So you have to recognize that there is a risk in investing differently from others.\n\nFrom these reasons, I conclude that as long as recognizing the risk of an action, we have to try new things and take risks."}
{"file_id": "1122978.txt", "output_essay": "The knowledge about various academic subjects is good for every person because we can familiarize ourselves with all the subjects and share our ideas with people from different backgrounds. But specialization is also good because we can delve deeper into the subject. When I consider these two options carefully, I prefer specialization in one specific subject.\n\nFirst, in specialization, we can reach the bottom levels of a subject, which means we have a chance to discover new things from important information. This will only come if we have reached the bottom levels. When I was in BTech, I found a new program about colors in Java. I studied the entire subject in the summer, and that's why I found the new program. My college staff appreciated me a lot.\n\nSecond, in specialization, we can find out the drawbacks of a subject, which is why we can find solutions to prevent them. Moreover, we can reduce them if possible. If we look at scientists, they try to reduce the harm to the ozone layer. They are specialists in related subjects and try to reduce harm to the ozone layer because they know the merits and drawbacks of the subjects.\n\nThird, only a specialist knows all the information about a subject. In this case, I have a bitter experience: a few months back, I met with an accident to my leg. At that time, I went to a hospital, but the doctor was not a specialist in bones. He said that there was no injury to my leg, but..."}
{"file_id": "1115678.txt", "output_essay": "How does someone enjoy life at all? What do you need in order to enjoy life? Young people usually have fewer problems. Especially when they are very young, they don't have much to worry about. Everything they should worry about has already been taken care of by their parents. And they don't even have a sense or a feeling yet for issues that are uncertain and one could worry about. Since worrying is a stopper and is something that slows down enjoyment, very young people enjoy life more than older people in that respect.\n\nBut to really enjoy something, you have to be not only free of worries but also appreciate the action that you are performing, the situation that you are in, and so on. Young people, having less experience in life and, due to good parents, less experience in unhappy and unsatisfied times of life, cannot appreciate things to the extent that adults do. Someone once said, 'You don't know that sugar is worth unless you have tasted salt.' Older people have tasted salt. So they know how to appreciate when tasting sugar.\n\nEnjoying life can also mean accomplishing the dreams that you have. This can be a certain style of life, having a wife and children, a good job, or something materialistic. First of all, young people do not have access to certain areas like a good job; they are not able to drive a car yet, and when they are able to, they mostly cannot afford their dream car due to a lack of financial means. Again, if they are really young, they might not even think of these things, and so they won't miss them. But as soon as they get older, they have all kinds of dreams, and many of them are not fulfilled in the near past since young people don't have the money, age, or knowledge for it. Older people, however, had a fairly good time in their lives to work towards their dreams. They are more likely to be in a stage where they at least could accomplish the most urgent dream, the one that was really important to them for all of their lives.\n\nThis enjoyment, however, can again be stopped. This is the case when older people look back and remember the things they didn't achieve rather than the ones they did. Young people do not often look back that way. They remember the good things first.\n\nIn addition to that, in an unsatisfied situation, young people are happy again with so little. For example, when a child drops his ice cream, it will start to cry. But as soon as he gets a new one, it will not only stop crying but be happy again and smile. An adult might be thinking about wasting money all day long, about his goofiness, and let the bad occasion erase the good one that he finally has a new ice cream.\n\nI cannot agree or disagree with the statement as a whole. For me, it depends on the attitude of the person. But when it is someone who is looking forward and recognizing his achievements, then he enjoys his life more than anyone else."}
{"file_id": "1118709.txt", "output_essay": "In these days, colleges have many programs to offer for students. Each student has a different opinion about having broad knowledge of many academic subjects versus specializing in one specific subject. Personally, I think that specializing in one specific subject can lead to much achievement for the goal.\n\nFirstly, if you learn many things in academic subjects, you cannot learn deeply. For instance, when I was a high school student, I learned a lot of things during the three years. I could not concentrate on one subject because there were too many topics, so I could not find relationships between each subject. Therefore, it did not help me to learn many subjects, so I prefer to learn just one subject. It can be more concentrated for me.\n\nSecondly, in these days, we have specialized persons for each division part. When you know broad things and do not know specifics about their subject, you cannot do anything in our society. Many people do their best in their own subject and become special persons who know really well about their own department. If you concentrate on just one subject and learn lots of things, you can help people who need you. However, if you learned lots of subjects, you did not get specific lessons from those subjects.\n\nLastly, we do not have lots of time to learn everything during life. We have lots of subjects around us, and if you choose one subject, you should concentrate on that because we do not have much time to learn just one subject too. For example, I am a nursing student, so I always think about caring for patients and learned lots of things for patients. I do not have much time to learn lots of subjects because I am not perfect in learning a whole subject. One subject has lots of things, so I decided to learn only one thing. When I am all in nursing, I can improve my care skills. Therefore, I will be a better nurse when I graduate. I think that concentrating on one subject can make one more specialized in their own position.\n\nTo conclude, there are many subjects in our life. Everyone wants to learn everything, but we cannot learn everything because each subject has lots of material. In my opinion, learning to specialize in one specific subject is better than having broad knowledge of many academic subjects because, if you concentrate on just one subject, you can learn lots of things deeply."}
{"file_id": "1122432.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.\n\nThe first reason why I agree with this statement is that young people have changed. In old days in Korea, young people were very helpful. They helped to build houses and fix things, which were dangerous and hard. This work was for young people, and they did it without hesitation. However, these days, young people do not care about their communities. Young people nowadays have different attitudes.\n\nAnother reason I think is that young people are not connected with their communities. In Korea, young people, who assume the role of students, are very busy studying. They go to school at 7 in the morning and come back at midnight. They have no time to participate in their communities. Whereas, in old days in Korea, there were more people who were not students, and also, school work was not as hard.\n\nLast but not least, some young people want to help their communities. For example, helping and taking care of elderly people or children. However, I am not sure about other countries, but in Korea, parents usually do not want their children, who are students, to help their communities. The reason is obvious: they want their children to study for their future university rather than caring about their communities.\n\nTaking into account all factors, people are becoming more egoistic, not only young people but also their parents and adults. Anyhow, we may reach the conclusion that the statement is correct."}

It's only because people nowadays are engaged with many things about themselves that they don't have time to think about the community.\n\nYoung people, considering from school age to a person who is working or into a business, have got their own tensions. Once when he is back from his daily routine work, he is tired and wants to spend some time in front of the TV or relax for some time. But he hardly thinks about his community or rather about himself.\n\nComparing to the past, our ancestors and grandparents were always concerned about their family as well as their community. Though they had very limited facilities available, they made the best out of it. With their communication and interaction with people in the society, whereas a person of today doesn't have time to go and meet his old friends or his relatives, at least.\n\nI think people should be taught to learn about their society and other people who are living with them in the society, so that he can directly look at the people who are not having any facilities and sleeping on the roads, so that they make out a little of their time and money to protect them and care for them.\n\nI would like to share one of my experiences, when I was in my college, I saw a man who met with an accident lying on the road with blood flowing, none of them showed any concern to take him to the hospital... as they were busy tied up with their own works and that they cannot spend little time for that old man because of which we all had to see him dead on the road. I think such things should not be repeated. Every person should involve in community help, the community in one way or the other, as much as he can. This shows his concern for the people and helping nature.\n\nRight from the scratch, they should be taught about morals and about society, patriotic people, one who learns morals never tries to neglect his society. And every person should take their time in helping the communities.\n\nI have seen many old age people who do a lot for the community. The place where I live, we don't have medical services for us, for which our area people, who were all 55 years old, grouped together and made a request to that area head that we are in need of a hospital which can help us in odd times for children and people living in this area. They have taken the risk for the community, but people who are young were least bothered about this issue as they were much worried about their careers and settlement rather than others; they were selfish with their behavior.\n\nI think every individual should take part in doing something for the society; this gives him nothing but self-satisfaction, which is more than anything for a human."}

There are several good reasons why I agree with having a tour guide during travel. First of all, when you decide to go to a foreign country that you have never visited, you will face some difficulties and a little bit of fear. All of these troubles that you will be faced are because of the worry and anxiety for this trip. Also, maybe because you don't have enough required information about that country. So, you need someone to help you about the places, shopping malls, good restaurants, locations of some hotels, and so on. According to these challenges, the best way to keep away from these troubles is to travel in a group led by a tour guide who has enough information about the country more than what you have. Second, I personally prefer this because I think it is safer for you and your family. I remember when I and my family traveled to Italy, we encountered some criminals and drug people who we didn't know how to deal with. However, although my father had solved this problem, I think if we had a guide with us, it would have been more easy for us. The third and last reason is that we choose to travel to have some relaxation and have a rest away from our works, duties, and responsibilities. Actually, if you want to do that, you should be away from all these troubles that, of course, you will be facing, such as asking some citizen people to have some information about, as I said in the beginning, 'Where can I find this hotel?', 'Where are the recreation centers?', 'What is the best restaurant do you have here?' and lots of these dumb questions. You may also not know how to speak their language since you are not a native speaker. In short, personally, I prefer to travel with a tour guide to keep away all of these headaches."}

{"file_id": "1121638.txt", "output_essay": "During almost 18 years, I have studied many courses and I know the best way to learn. So, what I am sure about is that the idea is the most important thing to understand than the facts. I will explain this in two general parts: the first part will be about the idea that a fact is one example of the idea; and the second one will deal with the fact that we can understand an idea more easily than a fact.\n\nSo, first, it is obvious that the idea is the most important thing to understand because the facts are just some cases of the main idea. Usually, during classes, the teachers try to explain to us an example that permits us to understand the idea. For example, to better understand the idea that people are calm when they listen to music, it's to give the example that in many medical rooms, we can hear some classical or jazz music. But it is not the point expected to learn. Thus, this is something we can use to better understand something else.\n\nWhen we try to make our own opinion, we use the ideas memorized to think. In this important case, we can see why it is so much more important to learn the ideas than the facts. If we continue with our previous example, what do we think about the importance of music in the world? To answer, we could select the idea that music calms people and we could use it to conclude that without music, there might be more wars in the world, and so, most of the population of the Earth will be sad. It is in this way I see the importance of the ideas.\n\nAs I have proved in this response, to better learn, we have to concentrate more on the ideas than on the facts. But the facts are needed to understand the ideas. So, in the perfect case, we would care about ideas as well as facts."}

At the same time, the question of whether it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects or to specialize in one specific subject arises. What do you think of the issue? As far as I am concerned, I agree with the idea that it is better to specialize in one specific subject than to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects. In the following paragraphs, I will provide some examples and details to support my point of view.\n\nIn the first place, specializing in one specific subject has advantages in various ways, the most significant of which is that it saves our time and energy. We have to point out the essential fact that we do not have enough time to finish every task well, which means that we cannot excel in many academic subjects. If we focus on one subject, we are able to spend enough time on that subject. Therefore, we will have more chances to be successful in the subject we concentrate on. For instance, if a student whose major is computer science studies art to broaden their horizons, they will not have much time to study their major, which will influence their grades and credits. As a result, there will be negative effects on their study. In consequence, we will make good use of our limited time to study if we concentrate on one subject.\n\nIn the second place, what is also worth noticing is that specializing in one specific subject will bring benefits to our future job. As we all know, in the future, we will find a job that we are interested in. In that case, we should focus on one subject that attracts us a lot. Then we will find a good job after graduation because of our professional knowledge. For instance, if we study biology, we are able to learn more in the subject, which means that we can gain knowledge related to biology. Therefore, when we have an interview, we will have a lot of academic knowledge to discuss, which will leave a good impression on the manager. We will get the job we want easily.\n\nAdmittedly, if we have broad knowledge of many academic subjects, we will become knowledgeable. However, if we have knowledge in a variety of aspects and do not know much about each subject, it will cause negative influences on our future life, which is not good. Therefore, I tend to hold the opinion that it is better to specialize in one subject that we have a lot of interest in and will get benefits from it.\n\nTo sum up, taking into account what has been discussed above, I can draw the conclusion that specializing in one specific subject is better than having broad knowledge of many academic subjects. I wish that there will be an increasing number of people who can get benefits from the one subject they specialize in."}

Taking risks will help open their minds and open new doors. The more one tries, the more they become experienced and qualified.\n\nSecond, successful people try new things and take risks because that will help them to improve their knowledge and develop their personality.

{"file_id": "1122148.txt", "output_essay": "I believe everybody cannot know everything, and it's not so good to be a 'Jack of all trades and master of none.' Specific knowledge is very much desired in both professional and academic fields.\n\nSpecialized knowledge of the subject is many times indispensable. One good example would be from the field of medicine, where general physicians are valued, but specialists like cardiologists or neurologists are indispensable and are the final option for particular kinds of treatments.\n\nToo much generalized knowledge may become very superficial and will not be of much help in solving complex problems in specific subjects. For instance, if we look at the field of science, say biology, a generalized understanding of all its branches is required, but a taxonomist and a biophysicist have very little to do with each other and cannot help each other in solving their specific problems.\n\nHowever, all this discussion is not meant to diminish the value of general knowledge, as the application of knowledge from one subject into another requires understanding of both. For example, if principles of mathematics are to be applied to biology, then general knowledge of both subjects is required. However, it will be done more appropriately if two specialists, i.e., a biologist and a mathematician, interact with each other.\n\nAlso, I believe that human memory has its limitations, and one should use it judiciously. We should confine and focus our brains towards solving problems related to specific subjects. Too much unnecessary knowledge will occupy space in one's memory and will not be put to use very often.\n\nTherefore, having general knowledge in moderation is good, but having only general knowledge is of no use. To apply knowledge for a useful purpose, one has to specialize in a particular subject."}

So, for us, becoming old means adapting to the rules that civil society, good manners, and behavior require.\n\nThis passage has always been seen as the increasing awareness of what surrounds us, with all the problems and responsibilities. Probably for that reason, old people are considered more serious, understanding, but also sedate compared to the brave and spontaneous behavior of young people.\n\nAnyway, my personal opinion is that times have changed, and today our world offers a lot of opportunities and means to old people in order to maintain a reactive body and mind. There are many cases of no longer young people who are considered examples of our society, and I think that this shows the change now explained.\n\nI know many people older than me who enjoy and love life as much as I do, because they love their work or they have started some interesting activities that enable them to be active and positive.\n\nIn conclusion, I can resume my essay by saying that in the past, I would probably agree with the statement, but today, both young and old people know how to enjoy their lives, even if they differ."}

There are a lot of people who like to travel as a group. Maybe because they are going to a new place and no one knows about it, then they decide to have a tour guide. I agree with having a tour guide for three reasons.\n\nFirst of all, you can find very good tourism places. For example, if you go to any city and you don't know anything about it, if you have a tour guide, he will show you everything. In addition, he has more experience than you because he knows his city.

On the other hand, if we had a tour guide, we wouldn't have lost all that time.\n\nThird, you can get yourself away from dangerous places. Every huge city has dangerous places, if you don't know where they are, you will put yourself in danger. For instance, there are many crimes these days, you have to be careful if you go to a city that is not your city, but if you are with a group and you have a tour guide, maybe it is better for you.\n\nIn summary, I suggest that everyone who wants to travel should have a tour guide."}
{"file_id": "1122932.txt", "output_essay": "Youngsters and Community Aid\n\nI believe the implication of young people in helping their community will vary from one country to another. Focusing on my home country, Spain, I must say that I do agree in general terms with the statement proposed.\n\nThe decline in social concern that Western countries like Spain are experiencing is due, in my opinion, to two main factors: the improvement in the quality of life of middle-class families and the reduction in the size of families.\n\nSpain has changed a lot in the past thirty-five years. While some decades ago we still had a considerable proportion of our population living in conditions of poverty, that is not the case anymore. The middle class has boosted in Spain, and nowadays it is one of the countries with the most dispersed distribution of wealth. In this new situation, there are fewer class differences, and therefore the need to help the community is not so evident to young people.\n\nAnother important social change in Spain has been the dramatic reduction of average family size. Thirty years ago, there were very seldom one-child families in Spain. Today, this is the most common situation of families. One-child families usually tend to over-protect the lonely child, and these children become less concerned about social aspects of life. Therefore, they do not spot the need to help the community afterwards when they grow up and become youngsters.\n\nThese two reasons just express my opinion and must be taken in general terms. I am sure there are a lot of other reasons why young people do not give time to helping the community, but I consider these two as the most important ones. It is also important to take into account that there are exceptions; I know young people who devote a lot of time to help their communities, and even some who work full-time in fields related to community aid, but I just feel this is not the general behavior of this generation."}
{"file_id": "1123748.txt", "output_essay": "Getting success is not an easy job in any field. You need to work hard and struggle for what you wish to achieve. People who have succeeded in their work try to make new things and take risks, as success gives them a boost to excel in their field.\n\nOnce a person is successful in achieving their target, they will try out new things and would like to explore more and more in the same field and apply it in various other fields. Consider an example of Sir Isaac Newton. If Sir Isaac Newton had just stopped his theory of gravity after its discovery, then many things would have been undiscovered till now. He applied his theory in the fields of mathematics, physics, and science, to name a few. Just think if Sir Isaac Newton had stopped taking risks and searching for new principles and theories; then advancement would not have been possible. The laws would have been at the receiving end.\n\nOne more great scientist to name is Einstein. He proposed the theory E = mc\u00b2, the theory of relativity. He started using the concepts in his surroundings, which stunned the entire world. These great men did not stop after achieving their targets but used their success as a tool to find out various new things.\n\nIf a person who is successful does not wish to explore the field of their interest, then the success will be of not much importance. Doing what is known can be done by others too, but implementing it can be done only by a few who assume their success as the strength to discover what is not known. Being wise is good by applying your theory in a different manner, but to get success, you need to implement your theory in various fields.\n\nSuccessful people will always make an attempt to make new things and take risks. They will never make their success the ending point of research or work. Success is not the end. Keep on trying and taking risks will surely benefit, even though you might not get success on each and every step you choose to take."}

But in my opinion, old people enjoy life more than young ones because of several reasons, so I disagree with this statement.\n\nFirst, old people have a long experience in life, so they know exactly how they enjoy. In contrast, young people don't have enough experiences.\n\nFor example, maybe a young person tried to enjoy something which is harmful, but they didn't know, and after some time, they injured themselves. But an old one may have had an experience with that thing, so they will not try it again.\n\nSecond, even though young people have a lot of choices to enjoy, at the same time, they have several things to worry about. For example, their jobs, their business, their family, their health, and other things that life now requires to worry about.\n\nOn the other hand, old people don't have anything to worry about except their health.\n\nFor example, a young person goes to the gym to enjoy, and while they exercise, they remember something that makes them go out from the gym and lose that enjoyable time. But the old one will not care about any other thing than their enjoyment and their health.\n\nFinally, everyone has their own enjoyable time."}

They have the health and capability to enjoy different programs for entertainment, have the chance of getting new friends and relationships, and keeping them.\n\nBut do they have enough support or backup to help them achieve what they like to do? For example, a young couple may like to go on a vacation from work to travel to a new country to enjoy their love and life, but they do not have enough money as they are in the beginning of their employment life. Moreover, vacations may affect their promotions. On the other hand, they are responsible for other people, for example, they have to take care of their parents or kids.\n\nA lot of young people have a shortage of entertainment facilities for financial reasons or they have to obey other persons who are sponsoring them.\n\nThe young are under tension and pressure of life and do not have enough experience to take over problems. On the other hand, older people have a lot of relationships with friends, colleagues, family members as sons or grandsons who support them and take care of them, in addition to gaining properties through life and financial independence.\n\nBut some of them might get health problems, which most of them are controllable now. Older couples, for example, can enjoy themselves with no worry about somebody else; a lot of them believe that what is going to happen, let it happen, or let go. So, they do not care much about the future.\n\nAn old man once said that life is composed of three sections: the first thirty years of life, a man has health and enjoys his job as he has something to do in life, but not too much responsibility, and he has enough time to spend on leisure and entertainment, but he does not have money to achieve his wishes.\n\nThe second thirty years, a man has health and money, but he has to work hard to carry on his success, but he does not have enough time.

{"file_id": "1123424.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with the fact that most advertisements make products seem much better than they in fact are. In my opinion, many times ads fail to meet the expectations created when you finally get or check what is advertised. Ads have many times very little to do with reality because of several reasons. I will discuss some of them from my point of view.\n\nFirst of all, the current tough competition for almost every product in the economy makes companies exaggerate the benefits or characteristics of their products. Every company shows their products in ads as the best and far away better than the others made by competitors. When I was a child, many times I got disappointed with most of the toys I received as gifts at birthdays; those toys seemed to be much bigger on TV than in my hands.\n\nAnother point has to do with quality. Many times the quality you get is much worse than what is offered or suggested in ads. For example, the sport shoes never last as long as I expect from the ads, considering the price I pay for them.\n\nMoreover, another issue is the customer service or service given to customers once they have bought something. In ads, most companies focus on their quality and responsibility. Unfortunately, most of the times you cannot get easily a satisfactory reply to one question or complaint raised. I have faced bad experiences with the call centers of telecom companies, wasting a lot of time and money in useless reclamations.\n\nAnother trick used by ads is the way they are shown. Normally on TV, you can see gorgeous people or aggressive music, so you rather pay attention to the person or music announcing the item than the announced item itself. Linked to this is when famous people, such as actors, actresses, filmmakers, sportsmen, or sportswomen, are used in the ads.\n\nTo sum up, I do not believe what is shown in the ads, since they make the products be more attractive than they really are. Ads are not factual most of the times."}
{"file_id": "1122260.txt", "output_essay": "I think that it is a common opinion that young people enjoy life more than older people do. In my opinion, this is not so far from the real situation, but it can depend on what you mean by 'enjoy.' There are many different aspects to this statement, so I think that it is difficult to give a unique and clear opinion.\n\nFor instance, if you like to play football, you will not probably enjoy yourself if you are an old man. A young boy is more powerful and can play for a long period of time, while an old man will probably lose his energy in a few minutes, not enough time for a good and amusing match.\n\nOn the other hand, if you like to play your guitar, your age will not be a real problem. Even if you are ten years old or seventy years old, you can enjoy yourself as you want.\n\nMaybe we can say that a young boy may have fewer problematic thoughts than an older person, so his innocence can let him have the possibility of enjoying his life much more.\n\nFor example, an adult man has many more things to do than his son. He may have no free time, so the young child can do anything he wants to enjoy himself, while his father has a life full of problems, so he cannot enjoy as his child.\n\nThere is another aspect in this discussion that is of relevant importance. Older people are often richer than young people are. So they can do anything they want because they have much more money. For example, if you are a twenty-year-old boy and you like yachting, you may have some problems buying one yacht. Maybe you will buy it in your adulthood.\n\nAt the end, I think that the fundamental aspect of the topic is the possibility of being sick when you become an old man. This is a big problem and makes me think that if you are a young person, you will enjoy your life much more."}
{"file_id": "1122215.txt", "output_essay": "As our topic is about the best way to travel being in a group led by a tour guide, I strongly agree with the notion, as it has advantages over traveling without a guide.\n\nFirst, we discuss traveling without a guide. As everyone is interested in going to new places according to their knowledge, they want to know each and every thing present there. Before going, everyone will do research about that, and the information we get is very little when compared to what we encounter. Sometimes, it misses out on good places surrounded by that area; no one is ready to explain the history of cultures and history of that place, and also how the importance came to that place. All these pieces of information are known to the people who stay over there or people who visit often to those places.\n\nNow, let's come to traveling with a guide, as they have the best information. Now, I will give my personal experience so that it elevates the advantages of traveling with a guide. During my college days, we went to the northern part of India, which included a few places. When we went to the Taj Mahal, there we found a very beautiful monument ever built. The guide explained when it was built, who started it, and the cultures followed at that time, and some important things he told. After listening to the lecture he made about the Taj Mahal, we came to know that we had very little information about it. We were very much excited about the information; we really felt like we were viewing that construction and art.\n\nAs we thought the Taj Mahal was the only place to visit, but the guide showed another beautiful monument just away from the Taj Mahal. We didn't know about that before; that was also a good piece too. After that, we faced some problems regarding our trip, just a lack of enough time. In that time, our guide was so helpful; he planned accordingly, so our timings were not lost, and we didn't miss even a single location. As the guide was a local guy, he provided good food too.\n\nThroughout the journey we made with the guide was very interesting and very helpful. After the tour, we heard and learned good things like history information about the places, etc.\n\nFinally, my conclusion was that it's not possible to know the things that really happened at the historical places. Few things we can read or listen about those places, but some we may not. So, taking a guide is really helpful and informative, so that we can get more information than when we went to travel without a guide."}

But whether to follow a group led by a tour guide remains a controversial question for travelers at the planning stage of their tour. In my opinion, the best way to travel has little to do with following a large group.\n\nPeople tend to rely on a group and stick to it for security or consensus or whatever they need, but when it comes to traveling, things might fall on the opposite side. The assertion of unity means the denial of freedom, which is especially true when, with the guidance of a tour guide, one cannot indulge themselves in the freedom of choosing what travel sites to visit or what time to start. There is a greater chance that the true meaning of traveling, relaxation being my definition, might be ruined by arguments and complaints.\n\nSome people would contradict my point by saying that a tour guide offers valuable and well-informed suggestions that would make a better trip. But isn't there enough news of tourists being cheated or made use of for the sake of tour guides' benefits? By saying this, I am not saying that tourists are more skilled at escaping tricks when traveling by themselves, nor am I judging the moral standard of all tour guides. It's just that isn't it even sadder to be fooled when certain investment and trust have already been placed on the tour guide?\n\nIn addition, traveling fulfills different purposes for different people. Some want to escape the hustles and bustles of the city, some wish to explore the unknown world, some aspire to adventure through exciting places, and none of these seem attainable by following the lead of a tour guide whose job is to keep everyone in sight and control.\n\nGood or bad, there is no absolute truth; however, we always have the right to chase what we want when traveling."}

I see lots of advertisements on television or in newspapers that describe the product as a perfect solution to customers' problems, but in reality, it is not. I believe that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.\n\nIn all sectors, we can see this type of advertisement. Automotive, Information Technology, or Consumption sectors - no matter which sector it is. All use advertisement ways to convince consumers to buy the product by emphasizing some points generally, but not giving details about some unknown things that can influence the final decision to buy it. To illustrate, a MP3 player is usually announced in a newspaper as a product that is 1 GB and has a radio. However, many people do not know that their radio does not work well everywhere, and they even do not know how many songs can be saved to that wonderful device. Without thinking, some of them buy it, while others learn the reality when they go to buy it by asking questions to the sales representative.\n\nAnother example is that some advertisement tricks are implemented in prices. Prices are shown by excluding taxes, and when you are very happy since you have found your favorite product and you go to buy it. Usually, it is too late to change your view, and thus, you buy it.\n\nIn this sense, it is certain that most advertisements make products seem much better than they are.

{"file_id": "1126329.txt", "output_essay": "I agree because the advertisement exaggerates the efficiency or quality of the product, sounding like a salesman in a shop. The marketing of some many brands is aggressive because they want to compete with others and show how their brand is better than the others. For example, the Walt Disney Company: over the years, we have seen many commercial announcements on television, the internet, in movies, and in mailing letters. They bombard us with these promotions over and over again, but in many ways, they sell a 'dream come true' that is not true when you decide to start a vacation at Walt Disney. They do not tell you about the long lines in the sun, waiting for the attractions or waiting to eat in restaurants. This is a huge mistake when the advertisement captures our attention and becomes more attractive than reality. This is an example of how people are enchanted by some advertisements, and the reality is different when they arrive at Walt Disney. Other advertisements, like food or diets, show specific people achieving their goals when entering this plan, but the reality is different because they never tell you how much it costs when you become interested in that program. The reality is that they manipulate statistics and sell dreams, stealing money from customers who fail to achieve that goal. In my opinion, people need to be wiser when they are attracted and impressed by an advertisement, just because they want your money and not your needs or satisfaction. That is why they call it marketing."}

This is not only a logical assumption, but it is also supported by evidence that is true on a global scale. Some of the richest people in the world were ordinary people with very good ideas. An example of this is Bill Gates. Instead of improving existing tools, he decided to project and invent a new instrument, the personal computer, which would cause a revolution in work and entertainment activities. He risked wasting many years of work on something uncertain that could just be a failure. It is now clear that he had employed his time in a very fruitful manner and that he will be remembered as a genius.\n\nOn the other hand, some people succeeded in exporting good ideas to other countries with different cultural backgrounds. A good example is Starbucks coffee, which is now sold all over the world, even in China. It must have been a very controversial decision for the managers to take. But, although Chinese society is traditionally used to tea instead of coffee, now many young Chinese people drink Starbucks coffee to identify with American models.\n\nOn a smaller scale, we can all experiment that if we take some risks, we will have more chances to fulfill our desires and be more happy. For example, you can decide to go and study in the United States. At the beginning, it will be difficult because of the language constraints and the distance from family and friends. But if you hold on and overcome difficulties, you will get a valuable degree from an excellent university that will allow you to access better job and income opportunities.\n\nIn conclusion, I think it is always worth trying new things and taking risks. We need to remember that we are given only one opportunity in this world, and we should do our best to be happy and make other people happy."}
{"file_id": "1127909.txt", "output_essay": "I agree that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are due to several factors. \n\nFirst and foremost, advertisements are designed to sell products, so they only highlight the advantages of the products and never mention the disadvantages or side effects. As a result, people can only see the good side of the product and are more likely to buy it.\n\nSecond, there are products developed by multiple companies, which sparks competition between them. Since advertisements play a significant role in the selling process, these companies try to make their products look better than those of their competitors. To win the competition, they may exaggerate some minor advantages that do not really exist in the product, although big companies with established reputations are less likely to do so.\n\nThird, companies will not pay to advertise their products unless they are sure it will generate more profits. If the advertisement does not make the product fit with the customers' needs, the companies will not create an advertisement for their products.\n\nLast, the art of advertisement has a concept of making a product look much better than it really is. For example, film and game trailers are always made in a way that encourages people to watch the film or buy the game after seeing the trailer.

The man is doing very good work at a very reasonable price. It is nothing special, but the quality of his work is known in the town, and he always has clients.

They try to achieve their goals and dreams. They are always looking for new things and never take a rest. They are always running for their goals. Successful people are different from others. Maybe their environment is not as good as others', and their situation is not ideal. They have to spend time to achieve their goals. They have to read and read books, acquiring lots of knowledge.

{"file_id": "1124369.txt", "output_essay": "Students understand ideas and concepts. Students also understand form and learn facts. In my opinion, it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts before going to learn from facts because there are many reasons, which will be explained with examples below.\n\nLearning ideas and concepts of a topic is very important before going to learn facts. For example, take an experiment from a Chemistry lab. Without knowing the idea and concept of the experiment, what would you do in the lab? If possible, someone does the experiment without knowing the ideas and concepts, definitely some explosions will occur in the lab because in a chemical lab, we do experiments with care. Without care, if we do the experiment in the lab, it will definitely go wrong. For example, H2SO4 is a highly acidic substance. I remember in my classroom in my college studies, some students without knowing the experiment details and ideas wanted to do the lab. He put some water into the H2SO4, and a big explosion took place. Then, my teacher scolded that boy, which is another matter. Without knowing the knowledge and details, he did the experiment, which would give some bad conclusions.\n\nTake another example: some nuclear experiments are done in some countries. If we do something wrong, with or without knowing, there will be a big explosion. In that place, definitely we know the ideas and concepts; without knowing the concept and idea, we cannot do anything in such places because nuclear weapons give big energy than any other. Even the sun also gives energy based on nuclear energy.\n\nFurthermore, it gives safety and full detailed information about what students want to learn. If students learn about concepts and ideas, they know the entire point about what they want to learn from facts. This gives no loss of anything around the place where the application is done.\n\nMoreover, some facts are known by without knowing the idea and concepts, which is another matter. In my opinion, we must know the ideas and concepts before attempting to learn the facts."}

In detail, in the case of paper advertisements or Internet advertisements, the products can seem much better in terms of color, size, shape, etc. For example, a week ago, I ordered clothes on an Internet site because the clothes were beautiful pink, which I like. I was so excited and expected. Yesterday, the clothes were finally delivered, but when I saw the clothes, I was quite disappointed because the clothes were an ugly, dense pink that I loathe. So, following this example, the visual aspect of advertisements makes products seem much better than they really are.\n\nSecond, in the case of home shopping, the cast introduces the product. To illustrate, my aunt called my mother a few days ago, and my mother told me about the story of my aunt. I will tell this story. A few days ago, my aunt watched a TV home shopping channel about kimchi. The cast ate the kimchi so deliciously and said that kimchi was so yummy. Furthermore, all the guests ate kimchi so deliciously, and in my aunt's opinion, it looked so delicious because of the spiced color of the kimchi and the eater's attitude. So, my aunt ordered the kimchi, but when my aunt ate the kimchi, the taste was very bad and disgusting.\n\nOn top of that, most companies apply their products' prizes and prestige in contests in advertisements, so we believe and buy the products, but these may not be true.\n\nTo sum up, by the above reasons and examples, I think that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are."}
{"file_id": "1123293.txt", "output_essay": "From a recent article, I heard about a successful person who tried new things and took risks. It told me that one of the good ways to succeed in our major is to use our imagination for new things and try risks. Also, I agree with this opinion and want to discuss it in more detail.\n\nFirst, I want to talk about new things. When I grew up, I heard many successful people's stories, such as Edison and Nobel. Those people accomplished their dreams by using their imagination to try new things. In addition, it is based on our civilization's development because people always want to have good, interesting, and convenient things, so from the invention of new things, they will buy them and be satisfied. In other words, the invention of new things can bring in more money, and sometimes we can gain fame. As a result, it is a good way to be a successful person.\n\nThe second reason is based on taking risks. Risks are dangerous in our lives. For example, if we fail to create some good new things, we will lose everything, such as our house, family, and other things. However, if we prepare beforehand, we can reduce the risks. In addition, there are no risks involved in creating new things, because new things are always related to some risks, which are dangerous in our lives. Although sometimes we can figure out risks for our success, we try to create new things. Moreover, we have to take care of ourselves and always prepare for bad situations. For preparing for bad situations, we can reduce the damage when some risks occur.\n\nIn our lives, we always demand new things more than before. Even if it can take risks to the person who tries new things, it is a shortcut to becoming a successful person. Sometimes, from overcoming bad situations, we can become important people. For these reasons, I would like to say that trying new things and taking risks help us to become successful people. Moreover, these behaviors make us positive and considerate people."}
{"file_id": "1126636.txt", "output_essay": "Generally, people who are remembered are those who leave a trace of their life in history. Nobody remembers or notices a person whose life has been carried out in an anonymous pattern. We notice what stems out from daily life, something exceptional, new. The key to success is risk. Oscar Wilde used to say that an idea which is not risky cannot be considered as an idea. To give evidence to this statement, we are going to outline some main points and then summarize with conclusions and caveats.\n\nFirst of all, nowadays we consider successful people who occupy certain social positions due to their efforts in seeking their place. This successful social position varies depending on cultures. Nevertheless, this position is regarded as successful when the position itself is exceptional. Nobody would consider successful someone who works in a normal or standard position. This means that success depends on extraordinary situations carried out in particular conditions: it is finding a new solution, a new idea to obtain something.\n\nSecondly, people will recognize success only when it is visible. If nothing could lead us to distinguish something from normality, we would not be able to determine the difference between the two. We will not thus be capable of recognizing the new into the normal. Hence, this will not be differentiable. Success is also difference, uniqueness. In other words, new things.\n\nThird, stated that success is based on difference and new ideas, it is also to be said that news find their root in risk. Elaborating something new, it is not possible to understand whether it will be regarded as something really new and meet the taste of the others or will just fail to communicate its difference. This uncertainty has to deal with risk. To be noticed as different, one idea has to be new, thus risky.\n\nTo conclude, we demonstrated that success comes from difference from normality; exceptionality and risk. The last factor is perhaps the essential key for success. As Oscar Wilde said."}
{"file_id": "1128202.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with the idea that most advertisements are better than the products themselves. For example, when I read fashion magazines, I find many attractive pages that appeal to various products such as cosmetics, dresses, watches, and perfumes. Whenever I look at these kinds of pages, I actually feel like buying them immediately.\n\nOne reason why people have an interest in advertisements when looking at them is that they usually use female models whose style is good, and it always looks very enjoyable to use the products. It attracts people and urges them to buy and wear them. Sometimes, people tend to forget that they do not have the same face, style, and atmosphere as the model. It's a fault. After obtaining products, people feel it's not better than expected because people do not really need them.\n\nAnother reason why most advertisements are nice-looking for people is their quality. To compete with other companies and get a big share of the market, companies make efforts in various ways, particularly for advertisements. A recent research shows that 90 percent of companies in the fashion field consider they should spend money and time to produce an advertisement. For example, to hire a famous designer costs 10 times higher than the salary of one employee per month.\n\nConsequently, the quality of advertisements sometimes wins over the real product itself. For these reasons, I support the position of considering that most advertisements seem much better than the products themselves."}

I disagree with this theme and I raise four reasons for this.\n\nFirst of all, I'd like to go wherever I can go. It is very useful to go with a tour guide, especially to a place that I've never been to, because I have little knowledge of the dangerous places to visit. But in a guided tour, there are some places that I don't want to go to. Also, planning for the places that I want to go is also precious time. Time to travel is limited, and from planning to travel, it is a starting point!\n\nSecondly, traveling is expanding our eyes. I traveled to Brazil a lot and I was capable of knowing foreign people. To know what they do, think, and like was a very interesting chance. I like foreigners, including Brazilians, and also want to communicate with foreign people. Traveling is knowing and expanding friends, but this will happen only when going abroad alone, and I would have never had such an experience with traveling by myself.\n\nAt last, traveling is a chance of thinking about what I am and what I am going to be. In a place where we live, I can't be stimulated, and there aren't good things for my health, but in a new place, I can be fresh in my mind, and I want to know about this.\n\nI know that traveling with a group, for example with friends or family, but it is not interesting largely because I can't see, think alone. It is a chance to go, think, enjoy by myself, not for others.\n\nI want to go every year alone traveling wherever I want, and expand my ability."}
{"file_id": "1124099.txt", "output_essay": "It is often believed that young people enjoy life more than old people due to several reasons, which, in my opinion, are related to the availability of time and other physical and mental resources, such as enthusiasm.\n\nI believe that this view is, in some way, incomplete, although not entirely wrong.\n\nThe incompleteness of the view is given by the fact that old people are people with experience. This means that they can assess values to certain actions on the basis of their past experience. They know what to do in order to enjoy certain positive feelings, as well as they know what to avoid. This means that people, once they become old, have all the necessary resources in order to exploit their knowledge on themselves, and hence collect the fruits of their lives as young people.\n\nIn addition, although some people believe that money does not make happiness, old people are more likely to have money to spend on themselves, making them enjoy life in more ways. This would imply that you start to enjoy life only at a certain age.\n\nHowever, there is the opposite point of view, which is the one of the statement. Young people, or at least most of them, do not have many things to worry about. It is up to their parents to control and administer the so-called 'dirty work,' whilst they are free to grow up. This shows that people, during the early stages of life, have plenty of time to dedicate to themselves, to the discovery of new things.\n\nIf it is true that old people know what things they like and what they don't, with the advantage of not having to experiment anymore, it is also true that youngsters have the possibility of going through the process of discovering, which is probably the most interesting and fulfilling of all, as it gives you the opportunity of knowing new things and experiencing new feelings, which were previously unknown. For example, people usually remember their first kiss rather than their last.\n\nIn conclusion, I would say that life can be enjoyed at every stage, when you are young and when you are old, although in different ways. The first period of life should be dedicated to discovering what you like and enjoy, whilst the last should be dedicated to the exploitation of such discoveries."}

{"file_id": "1127395.txt", "output_essay": "Humans have created this sense of going out of home called traveling. Traveling is a very fun option for you to take. However, it is not always the way you want it to be. On the one hand, you have the opportunity to travel in a group with a tour guide or in a group but without a tour guide. With these in mind, I personally prefer to travel in a group with a tour guide because you have the opportunity to learn more and also because you have your schedule done.\n\nThe first reason I prefer to travel in a group led by a tour guide is that I can learn better about the other culture. You have a guide who gives you and tells you lots of information about the new place you are visiting. For instance, if you decide to travel to South Africa, you would not only understand even a word but also would not learn anything about this new country, completely different from yours.\n\nThe other reason I prefer traveling with a tour guide is that the schedule is already programmed by my tour guide. I would not have any minute to waste time. I would take advantage of it in every single opportunity. In fact, if you traveled without a tour guide, you may not be able to wake up at seven in the morning. A few years ago, I went to Cuzco in Peru, and I did not contact a tour guide. I did not learn anything about that incredible monument; you can not imagine how I regret it now. It was a waste of time traveling there without a tour guide.\n\nTherefore, whether you choose to travel in a group or by yourself, try to be led by a tour guide and try always to prepare your trip very carefully in order for you to enjoy it."}
{"file_id": "1127260.txt", "output_essay": "Everybody could tell you this: young people enjoy life, whereas older people don't. To me, it can't be absolute, for several reasons. First, we know that young people know how to have fun. They always go out with friends, they always laugh (most of the time for nothing)... Older people don't know it. They used to know, but now they are adults and adults have a lot of responsibilities. Adults always think about their work, adults always worry about everything, and when they are older, they worry about death and always talk about when they were young, when they knew how to enjoy life!\n\nWe also could say that young people enjoy life because they don't think about the future; they seize the day. That's true, but older people, if they like to plan everything, can seize the day too. Don't we say that the better time of your life is when you don't work anymore?\n\nWhat about these grandfathers and these grandmothers who travel a lot and begin to live the life they want? That's why I think middle-aged people are the ones who enjoy life the least. They have too many things not to forget, too many things to do, too many things to care about. Young people enjoy life because they have nothing to think about! They go to school, go out with their friends, have complicated relationships with their boyfriends and girlfriends, and that's all. OK, they have to do some homework, but that's not a horrible life. They enjoy life because their life is perfect!\n\nTo finish, I would say that although they have a perfect life, most young people don't really enjoy life. Adolescents are always in a bad mood, they complain every time, they always disagree with you, but what they do best is 'not care.' But older people, even if they have a quite more difficult life, know the value of life."}
{"file_id": "1127473.txt", "output_essay": "On the one hand, I think young people enjoy life more than older people do. Young people are more active; they can make journeys and participate in sports. They go to parties, spend much time with friends, and have few responsibilities.\n\nOlder people often have problems with their health. Some older people need permanent medical care and are not able to leave their homes. Furthermore, they know that most of their life is over. I think this is not an amusing thought. So, one can say that many older people do not have the possibilities to enjoy life, but there are also older people who do not want to enjoy life. I know some older people who are healthy and well-off, but nevertheless, they do not go out; instead, they sit in their houses and are sad.\n\nOn the other hand, young people are just at the beginning of their lives and therefore they have to fight for their place in society. This struggle is not only fun, too. In school, they have to work hard because they want to rise their job opportunities, and in university, this situation is continued. When young people have leisure time, many of them waste their time playing video games at the computer. Other young people are unsatisfied with society and lead lives as outcasts.\n\nIn contrast to that, there are many healthy older people who earn a comfortable income or are even retired. They often afford luxurious trips and do not have so much pressure to be successful. Instead of stress in school, in university, or at the beginning of a career, older people can play with their grandchildren or go for a walk with other older persons. I think this is a great perspective.\n\nOlder people can look back and see what they have achieved over the years. That can also be great pleasure. Resuming all those reasons, I think both young and older people can enjoy life, but I am convinced that older people more often do so."}

I agree with successful people, because if people are successful in what they are, then they can think of new things. \n\nObviously, while trying new things, risks may take place, but if we are worrying about the risks, then no one can be successful in their life. For example, scientists produce new things by taking many risks. If they thought that this work was very risky to do, then now we couldn't get this light, radio, TV, and satellites, and many more which we are using in our daily life. So, for every achievement, there are many risks taken for the things to do. \n\nSo, successful people can only think of the future; for every achievement, there are many risks taken by many persons for those achievements. For example, if we are not trying for a better future and being happy with what we have, then we will never succeed in our life. \n\nFinally, my opinion is to agree with the hardworking people, i.e., successful people. Because if people are not successful, then they can't think of their further future. So, for every success, there are many risks that have been taken to achieve it.

{"file_id": "1127304.txt", "output_essay": "I think that this statement can summarize an important problem of actual society. In my opinion, we live in a society of appearance, where exterior aspects are sometimes considered more than the substance of things. I think it is evident in a million situations. Let's think, for instance, about our markets, which are full of colored boxes and bottles. I am sure that everyone of us, at least once in our lives, has bought a kind of food or beverage just because of how well it was displayed on the box that contained it. We can also think about the ads on TV, which introduce us to so many kinds of things that seem to be the new and perfect solutions to many of our problems (and most of the time, they solve just one 'problem': how to spend our money!). Another example comes from the fashion world, which is a little different from the previous ones, but I think that in a different key, it can reflect the same problem. How many times have we seen perfectly slim models who seemed to be healthy and, of course, satisfied with their own bodies? And how many times have we heard (some time later) that they had a lot of problems with anorexia, their everyday lunch was a carrot, and their lives were unhappy? It has happened a lot of times, I guess. Now, the point is that society presents to us some patterns that are almost never real, or better, it shows us, thanks to some advertisements or something else, what it wants to show us, but not all the truth. I think that it is not easy today to not be impressed by the external side of the things that are around us, but I also think that to avoid going into a lot of delusions in our lives, we should start to look behind the appearance of the things that are presented to us to understand what they really are."}

Understanding ideas is more important for every student in the classroom.

This type of skill will improve the ability to study and the ability to remember. These skills are also reducing study time. Students can learn more information quickly.\n\nLearning facts is good, but every time we don't want to study. We don't want to spare much time on learning facts. At that time, these skills are very helpful. It is a very time-consuming process. Understanding ideas and concepts will be helpful anytime. For example, I want to go to an exam; first, I will go through the topic, then understand the main idea of that topic and the concept of that one. I regularly follow this rule of studying. So, in this way, I get more information within time, and I save my time also. In this way of studying, I got good marks in my exams.\n\nFor example, when we read a passage, first of all, we skim the passage, then get the main idea of the passage. At this time, reading is easy; otherwise, it will be tough. In this way of getting ideas, students get a lot of exposure, and their thinking ability will also increase.

It seems to be more important to know how to use the internet than what was the last book that they read.\n\nSecondly, in these communities, they should try to attract teenagers by offering them different kinds of activities that could make them interested in going to these communities and participating. For example, organizing concerts (all types of music: classical, pop, rock...), football games or other kinds of sports, creating a library that would include internet, books, CDs, DVDs; also, trying to perform some plays or going to the theatre.\n\nAlso, knowing much more about the place that they live and the environment in general, not just the group or the city that they live in.\n\nAt last, when young people can enjoy this environment, they will be very excited and very decided to collaborate in any kind of activity or help that the community can create or organize.\n\nMy conclusion is that if the community presents a good range of attractive and new activities, any young people will be so happy to collaborate in the well-being of the community."}

I have always thought that you have to understand everything that you are taught.\n\nThis is a very controversial topic, but I think I have a clear panorama of what I think.\n\nThe first reason for which I incline to this decision is that learning facts doesn't give you an internal satisfaction of a certain topic. There is a famous quote stated by Ignatius of Loyola S.J., which is: \"The knowing doesn't satisfy the soul, but the interpretation and likeness of the things internally does.\" This is a very reflective quote, because when you learn a fact, you don't acquire its concept completely; you have, like, an empty space. For example, in philosophy, you can know the point of view from every philosopher, but if you don't understand them, you could never know what they really meant.\n\nThe second reason is that the human brain tends to forget easily things learned but not interpreted. For example, the things that you learned in 9th grade, sometimes you forget them when you are in 10th or 11th, because you don't really get the concept completely. On the other hand, if you learn something and you understand it well, you will remember it forever, or if you forget it, with a little thinking, you will remember it and could use it right for other aspects in your daily life.\n\nFinally, I would like to say that people who always memorize facts and don't understand them completely usually have fewer resources for having success in life, because of their lack of understanding and interpretation in essential matters. However, people who really understand all the things that they are taught usually develop an ability to solve problems faster or be more original in their thinking."}

Turn on your TV, and it will show you advertisements mainly with certain gaps, which are called programs. You turn on your PC, cross a busy road, or do whatever; you cannot get rid of an ad. Now comes the business aspect. Why is there a need for so many advertisements? Two words have the answer: 'Purchase' and 'Profit'. All advertisements are the brainchild of some unsuccessful products that the creator wants to make successful.\n\nSo, why does one person need to advertise his product? To make it famous? Yes, maybe, but the most dominant reason is to sell and to make a profit. Why do you need an ad if your product is so good? I witnessed the same situation when I was young. I loved one chocolate of a particular brand. I never saw its advertisement on TV or in any journal. Now, suddenly one day, I saw its ad, which told me that it had changed. Joyfully, I went to a shop, I bought one, only to discover that the price had increased, and the cover pack became more glossy. That's the magic of an ad: when the product is right, you don't need to advertise it.\n\nAdvertisements are very lucrative because of their 'free' offer. I have seen thousands gather in front of malls to get a free offer with a particular product. So, what is the motive of the free offer? Nothing comes for free. 'Free' is the word that is seen by all; we need to see some invisible information, such as a decrease in quality, in place of 'free'. Once, my mom bought vegetable oil after seeing a wonderful new ad of the reduced-price product. Later, she discovered that the expiry date was already over.\n\nIn some cases, what an ad tells are completely lies. Our favorite actors and actresses don't bathe with that particular soap, which they advertise.

These people do not think when they do that; they do it because they like it.\n\nI wish that young people were more careful and thought before doing anything. They have to know that the worst of society is bad for them. I like that politicians would do more programs for young people because this would help to envelop the troubles of society.\n\nAnd I believe that with the help of the whole community, our own community will become better!"}

I do not prefer to travel alone as I believe that when you travel with friends, you can take the utmost pleasure and information from the travel, as there will be many questions for the tour guide, and there will be many brains, not one. I just want to emphasize this by using an example from my travel with my friends.\n\nI am a history student by profession. In the last year of my college, I had a thesis to be submitted on the Great monument, Taj Mahal. It was a tour where a group of four, including me, went to New Delhi, in India, where Taj Mahal is located. It is one of the ancient cities in India with great history and also the capital of the country. There, we hired a tour guide who is believed to be the best in the place. While looking at the monument and hearing the information from the guide, we were astonished about the history, beauty, and the efforts required for its construction. There were many areas in the monument whose names were not even heard by us before; i.e., none of the books contained these details, which are very important for our observations and thesis. There were many questions that were asked by our group to the guide. I think my share of questions would be only one-tenth of the total. Then, I realized the importance of traveling together. I felt that if I had come to the place alone, I would have learned only one-tenth of the information for the thesis, which would have reduced my scores.\n\nAfter coming back from New Delhi to our place, we checked our share of expenditures for the travel, and it was only 40% when compared to expenditures if one travels alone. With the above-mentioned example, I believe that traveling in a group with a tour guide not only helps in getting more information about the place you visit but also helps in reducing your expenditure for the travel. It reinforces your relation with your friends. You will remember and recollect your experiences and incidents in the travel throughout your life."}

Today, this period is reversed. In my opinion, young people do not give enough time to helping their communities. With several examples, it will be easier to explain the reason for this phenomenon.\n\nFirst, young people study longer than before. On average, a student stays at the university for around four or five years, which is huge compared to the 1960s or 1970s. Young people always pretext that they do not have time to help anybody. Even at 20 years old, we, young people, always have the feeling of being overbusy. We have personal work, group projects, sports, etc., but in our planning, no time for anything else. Well, I say that, but we can find time to go to the cinema or meet friends. For example, we will prefer going on three weeks' holiday than staying one week to help a charitable cause. There should be another reason for young people's carelessness.\n\nSecondly, as I said previously, we are living in an individualistic and egoistic society. Everyone thinks about him or herself. Young people believe less in God than before, which could also be a good reason. There are not a lot of religious events. But religion is an efficient way to gather people around a good cause in order to help other communities. And all of it is just the consequence of the environment of a society or a lack of values and education.\n\nNowadays, parents do not teach their children to share.\n\nIn brief, I think it is not fair, but it is a reality: young people do not give enough time to helping their communities, but I am sure..."}

Anyway, I agree with the idea that it's better to have a broad knowledge of several different subjects, and that for several reasons.\n\nFirst of all, a person with a variety of interests and knowledge in different fields is probably a person with an open mind who shows a strong intellectual curiosity. Famous intellectuals of the past, like Leonardo da Vinci, just to name one of the most well-known, had an incredible variety of knowledge and curiosities. Then, having a broad knowledge of the world in general might help people in their career and professional life. Also, having a good knowledge in a variety of subjects doesn't necessarily mean that a person can't have a special field of interest in which he or she is more competent.\n\nAn open mind and a broad culture can be a great advantage in a fast-changing world like the one we live in today. In fact, we must be ready and able to adapt to different situations and conditions.\n\nOn the contrary, if we are too rigid, if we are overspecialized in a very particular field, we might be unable to get the whole picture, so to speak, and we might be less flexible, less able to cope with any change we can have to deal with in our lives. Of course, there's nothing wrong with being very good in a particular subject we like more. I think that only overspecialization is wrong. If someone is competent and interested only in a very special field, he or she might be very good in his or her job, but might not be able to adapt or to react to situations that require a more general approach.\n\nSometimes you read in papers about terrible mistakes doctors make in their work, as not understanding exactly a patient's disease or simply confusing symptoms described by patients. That can be due to the fact that some doctors are extremely well-prepared in their field, but are sometimes unable to analyze the whole situation, and they might miss the fact that they are dealing with people and not just with sick kidneys or livers, to give an example.\n\nFor all said reasons, I do believe that having a broad knowledge of many subjects and keeping the curiosity and passion for learning all our life is definitely better than limiting our knowledge only to a specific field of study."}

For these reasons, in many cities, you could not drive all days of the week; for example, on Monday in Bologna, from 8:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m., it is not permitted to drive.\n\nIt is a very huge problem to drive, particularly at certain times, because you spend a lot of time in traffic jams; for example, when you go to work, and maybe after a long time spent in your car, you have to spend more time looking for parking.\n\nI hope that for all these reasons, everything will change in twenty years.

{"file_id": "1132072.txt", "output_essay": "I agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do. My first point, which is most important, is that they are young. Since they are young, they have lots of energy to enjoy life in the ways they want. For example, if someone thinks they enjoy their life by playing some outdoor games, when they have plenty of time. Now, if the thinker is a young person, they can just grab their stuff to play and go on. But suppose this comes to the mind of an old person; that's not possible easily because they have to remind themselves quickly of the kind of restrictions their doctor has made on them. Also, another point is the lack of energy. They may not be able to perform that task even if they will enjoy outdoor games. They have to compromise with things like just watching TV or having family dinner parties, an easy way of enjoyment that all older people prefer.\n\nAlso, a second thing that supports my agreement is traveling or taking a trip, which lots of people like and is a good way of enjoyment. When all the friends come together and make a plan for a long trip, it is easy for youngsters because they are able to face all kinds of problems, starting from weather changes to walking miles away by foot when their car is out of fuel. But in the case of older people, they need support in such kind of situations. They cannot face problems as youngsters can. They need their medicines ready while weather changes happen, and even though they are prepared, they are not sure that their body can respond well.\n\nSo, basically, young people can enjoy their life more than older people as they have enough energy to enjoy life in the way they want. But older people also have many ways to enjoy the rest of their life. As, at one time, when they were young, they also had fun."}

While some people argue that advertisements do not give the real quality of a product, others think that they know what they buy. So, advertisements cannot influence their choice.\n\nBoth perspectives are important, but overall, I disagree with the statement that advertising influences my choice.\n\nMy point of view is important because we overall know the different products we use for ourselves. As an example, when you want to buy a car, you use specific information about the type of car you want and do not necessarily follow the advertising provided by any car company.\n\nSecondly, advertisements are not primarily directed to influence the choice of customers. It is highly used by companies to settle their leadership (best selling). This can be illustrated by the fact that when someone wants a specific car, they have the choice between sometimes more than one company.\n\nSome people can object that young boys are mostly influenced by advertising. This objection can be countered by the fact that they are not responsible for their purchases. When they want something, they ask their parents to buy it for them. And overall, the parents do not follow the desires of their children because they know what is important for them or not.\n\nWhile the issue of quality of products must be considered carefully, the fact that we know what we want, compounded with the object of the company to settle at a leadership place, produces convincing reasons why I disagree with the following statement: **Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are**."}

{"file_id": "1133961.txt", "output_essay": "In my opinion, most advertisements deceive people by making products seem better. There are two specific cases of examples of tricks to present products as much better: changing the look of the product by changing its cover color and changing its name to make it look like high-quality.\n\nFirst of all, advertisements change the color of the product's cover to attract customers. Generally, faded colors will make the customer think that the product is made with old technology, whereas bright colors deceive the consumer into thinking it is made with high technology. For example, brighter pencils are generally preferred to faded-colored pencils in Turkey. That's why many advertisers force manufacturers to produce bright-looking pencils to increase sales.\n\nSecondly, advertisers force manufacturers to change the product names of a specific product to increase the amount of products sold. In Turkey, that is usually done by giving a foreign name to the product instead of a Turkish name to trick the consumer. In this way, the consumer may think that the product is a high-quality product because some of the goods manufactured by the Turkish industry lack quality. There is a real case for this in Turkey. A spaghetti-producing company changed its product name a couple of years ago and gave an Italian name to its product to deceive the consumer that it is an Italian product. Hence, they have increased their product sales. This is the way to present their products as much better, although it is the same quality as before.\n\nTo sum up, most advertisers make products seem much better according to some techniques listed above. Unfortunately, these techniques are becoming so widespread that consumers will unlikely encounter a product revealing its real quality."}

{"file_id": "1127832.txt", "output_essay": "Although the basic concept of advertising is itself to promote a product or a service, I do agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they actually are.\n\nAdvertising for products is essentially the process used to convince potential buyers that the product in question is fit and suitable, and the best in the market. However, most advertisements blow this definition completely out of proportion by marketing a product that ends up being radically different when finally used. The degree of exaggeration used in advertisements to convince the buyer is at times ridiculous.\n\nAdvertisements in the fast-moving consumer goods domain, especially, strictly adhere to the policy of displaying a completely wrong image of the products, which make them seem much better than they actually are. An example that comes to mind is a commercial for a leading shampoo product that claims to not only put hair back on the heads of its balding users but also rejuvenate them to the extent that they will be able to compete with the best drivers in the world on a Formula One car racing track.\n\nAdvertisements in various other sectors also mislead users to believe that the product will offer qualities that it was never designed to provide in the first place. Although one of the selling points of a good advertisement is, in some cases, to provide a tinge of humor to go with the product, certain advertisements and brands use this to the extent that makes their products seem too good to be true.\n\nVarious mail-order catalogs for exercising systems are also a clear example of how the end product differs vastly from the advertised one.\n\nEspecially in today's world, where common opinion has it that media overpowers print, people look to advertisements, especially on television, to help them make informed choices about which product suits their needs better. This dependency may not be large when it comes to everyday products, but in cases of products that are highly expensive and involve large investments, some advertisements can often mislead people's decisions.\n\nAn example to illustrate this is the advertisements for real estate projects or finance and tax-saving instruments, and more recently, even in job searching portals. Some of the advertisements have caused people to make incorrect decisions due to their assured but unrealistic claims.\n\nAll in all, my belief is that advertisements should help people make informed choices and should make people aware of the product. A certain degree of humor and make-believe is alright, but the core functionality of the product itself should not be made a fantasy, as is the case with many of the advertisements in today's world.\n\nI therefore ardently agree with the fact that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are."}

In many countries, the gap between generations is growing due to demographic as well as sociological developments.\n\nUnemployment among young people is a huge problem in many European countries. In many cases, young people are not able to get a good education because of their immigration background or their social environment. Also, many young people are not able to find proper jobs although they have a good education because, after massive job cuts in many multinational companies, no youngsters are being hired at the moment due to slow economic growth and the consequences of globalization, which often causes outsourcing and transferring of jobs from expensive first-world countries to areas where production is cheaper.\n\nOn the other hand, older people are also affected by these job cuts. At the same time, European welfare states have to raise the retirement age in order to keep their social systems functioning and financeable.\n\nOf course, this development sometimes causes frustration on both sides. When older people who either have the will to work but don't find a job or who have worked for decades and are now retired see young people in the streets, hanging out, doing nothing (except skateboarding, listening to music, playing computer games, and shopping), they might get the impression that young people enjoy life more than they do or than they did when they were their age. And that impression, in my opinion, is probably correct.\n\nWhen today's old generations were young, in the forties and fifties, there was not a lot of fun stuff to do in Europe. They experienced the cruelty of World War II and the hard work that was necessary to rebuild the countries afterwards.\n\nYoung people in Europe are lucky to grow up in a safe and often wealthy environment. They have the chance to do things older people were not able to: they can travel, they can communicate with strangers and friends around the world, they can get to know the world in a totally different way their parents, grandparents, and great-grandparents were able to. They have the time and possibility to do sports and other fun activities and to enjoy their life - maybe more, or at least in a different way, than many older people do.\n\nMaybe this way of lifestyle many young people have, containing traveling, extreme sports, and other ways to test their personal limits, are a way to cope with their \"Zukunftsangst,\" with the scary feeling many youngsters have, that they have to be flexible all the time, they often don't know what tomorrow brings them, and they are not sure if and how long they will have a job (and if they are lucky to have a job, they have to pay for the older people's retirement, probably without being ever able to profit from this system themselves).\n\nI think young people have all the rights to enjoy their life as long as they can - sooner or later it will get tough anyway. Older people shouldn't complain about this but rather try to understand the situation teenagers and twens are in.

For this reason, someone can affirm that young people don't give much time to help their communities. Because I'm a young person, I can explain my opinion and support my disagreed opinion with some examples. The first example I support is that young people have not so much time to help their communities because they don't want to help them, not because they haven't got such time: in fact, I can help my friends if they ask for my hand, even if I have to study for myself. If I am devoted to a friend, I help them in every way.

In fact, helping each other can make it easier to pass exams and live university life without fear. Also, in families, young people help fairly well (and more than sometimes or seldom): in fact, as a young person grows, their responsibility grows itself, and they recognize that helping parents is important. They can do it in different ways: working part-time to earn money to spend on their personal objects, and they don't ask money from their parents, or cleaning the house or their own room. Naturally, there exist many young people who don't help in any of these ways their family, but I can't generalize. As the man who said that sentence cannot generalize."}

By knowing about many subjects, one is more comfortable in interacting with all kinds of people because it will not be difficult to have a healthy conversation, as we will not be totally unaware of what the other person is talking to us about.\n\nAnother important reason why we should have knowledge about different subjects is that we never know what bad phase in life we might go through. To be able to stay put in all situations and to be able to work our way through all difficult times, we should have at least the bare minimum knowledge required in every field. This broadens our horizon to work and not be stranded in various situations in life.\n\nIf we have only specific knowledge about one field, it is not always necessary that we may have enough luck in our fate to make it big in that field. To keep that door of opportunity open for us at all times, we should have knowledge about a variety of things in life. Let's take the example of a simple clerk who has been used to entering data into a register manually all his life. With the development of science and technology, there will come a time in his professional life where his company might install computers to manage the data. The clerk would now be required to work on this new marvelous invention. If the clerk had always been satisfied throughout his life with his manual labor and would not have updated himself in this new technology, he would have been blank as to the knowledge of computers, and this would in turn lead to him losing his job, where someone who is computer-savvy might get the job; but having been updated with happenings in different fields, the clerk would find it simple to navigate through the system, in turn making his work easier for himself.\n\nThis was a very small but very effective example as to why we should be in touch with things that are going on around us.

As we know, one of the Seven Wonders, the Taj Mahal, is also located in that city. I was touched by listening to the history of that Wonder. Not only me but the whole group was touched by what all he told us about it.\n\nI think if I were not in that group with that guide, I would have never enjoyed my trip to Agra. As I would not have come to know all that he told the whole group - the history of the great Taj Mahal.\n\nSince then, I love to travel in a group that is led by a tour guide. Actually, what I think is that one should must visit new places in a group led by a tour guide. I'm saying so mainly because you come to know about the places of that town and everything about that town. If you like it, then you can come again on your own without a tourist guide. But if you are visiting a new place for the first time, then you have to travel in a group that is led by a tour guide. If you have a tour guide, then you need not have to take any tension for accommodation, traveling from one place to another. All these tasks are done by a tour guide only. We don't even have to buy tickets again and again. In all, when we are traveling in a group led by a tour guide, we are in a full mood of enjoying. No work tension, nothing. Only enjoyment and enjoyment.\n\nSo, I think the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide."}
{"file_id": "1131180.txt", "output_essay": "I think that both understanding ideas and learning facts are equally important for a student, but if I were forced to choose between the options, I would say that understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning a list of facts.\n\nThe comprehension of the idea that gives meaning to a fact will enable the student to understand all the facts that are based on that same idea. For example, teachers teach children how to add numbers by explaining how addition works, not by telling them that 2 + 2 = 4, that 2 + 3 = 5, and so on. When a child has understood the idea and concept of addition, they will be able to make all sorts of additions.\n\nWhat I really mean to say is that the understanding of a concept will lead you to the full comprehension of several facts of the same kind.\n\nOn the other hand, I cannot avoid noticing that we face a big risk in focusing too much on ideas and concepts: the risk of leaving out reality. Reality is very important because it's the point we tend towards; all ideas and concepts are studied to give reasons for things we've seen in our experience. If we do not refer to reality, we would be just speaking about nothing, and our talking would be only speculation, which is not useful to us.\n\nI would say that we need a balance between the two things, because they are both important to the student. I think that a good method of making them understand a theory or a concept would be giving them examples, because talking about experience is effective in making them realize what concept we are dealing with.\n\nOn the other hand, I think that when a teacher talks about a specific fact, they should always say what idea stays behind that fact, so that they would obtain two important results: firstly, the student would fully understand the fact in its implications, causes, and consequences (for example, why a war was declared, what consequences it had...); and secondly, the students would be able to understand many facts of the same kind because they may recognize the same ideas behind other facts."}
{"file_id": "1134015.txt", "output_essay": "I do agree with the statement: 'it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.'\n\nTo understand ideas and concepts is not very easy, but once you understand, knowing the facts is an easy job, I think.\n\nI would like to talk about this based on my experience. When I was studying, I used to learn facts first and then try to understand ideas. That was a huge mistake for me; I thought I understood what I had learned, but it was not. I understood it in a totally different way, so I had to study again, which took much more time. Also, when we had group work, I was the one who always gave wrong suggestions, and it was very embarrassing in front of my friends.\n\nSo, from that point, I decided to change my approach, which was to understand ideas first and learn facts. It was a little hard for me at first, but as time went by, it was much easier for me to learn facts after understanding ideas. Well, not only that, but after I understood ideas and concepts, I had a lot of questions to ask and opinions to suggest. Also, the time I spent on understanding became much shorter, so I could study other things as well.\n\nIn class, I was the one who never asked questions and suggested my opinions, but I changed. How? I became the one who was most talkative in class because, to understand what I had learned, I had so many things to ask and wanted to know. So, I knew from that time that because I didn't understand the concept, I had no questions to ask and no interest in thinking about that topic.\n\nFrom my experience, I do strongly agree with the statement.\n\nTo do easy work or better work, to understand what the idea and concepts are is the first thing to do, and then learning facts will be the faster way to learn, in my opinion."}
{"file_id": "1133965.txt", "output_essay": "It is absolutely true that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. But how does this happen? That is not an easy question to answer, but I think this is also the only question to ask in order to understand why advertisements have this particular effect.\n\nI believe that the main strategy used by market analysts is simply to influence people by touching their weaknesses. Everyone, or at least most of us, wants to be accepted by society (our group of friends or our colleagues). It is an unconscious process, but it is like that, and we can do nothing against it. As a consequence of this process, we tend to buy the products that we feel could change the conception that others have of us in a better way; any object that could improve our social image is certainly to be bought.\n\nI will try to make an example. If I know that David Beckham shaves with a particular aftershave, I might think that by using that specific product, I will achieve the same social approval he has.\n\nThat is why most advertisements use famous people to sponsor a product: because we unconsciously want to be like them. Anyway, the question is whether there is a solution to this kind of problem. It is, in fact, a problem we are talking about, because it is linked to a weakness of modern social communities.\n\nI simply think that, considering that we cannot change the entire customs of our society, the starting point is being aware of this fact. This way of reasoning will make us more critical of advertisements, whose products will seem no more attractive than we thought they were before."}

They are all between 20 and around 30 years old. While they perform at theaters to make money, they also perform for children and elderly people at daycare centers. They say that they just really like to see the audience laughing.\n\nI know a group called the 'Guardian Angels.' The group consists of about 50 young people. The members of the group patrol around downtown, and if they find someone who needs help, they help or advise them. For example, when they find girls who are under 18 or younger after midnight in the street, they convince them to go home earlier.\n\nAnother example is that of a young woman who helped her community develop their sightseeing industry. She works at a travel agency in her small town. Because she wanted to make her town well-known, she decided to appeal to her town. She planned to have a festival and carried it out. People in the town cooperated with her and brought a lot of food, crafts, and souvenirs to the festival. As a result, a lot of people came to visit her town, and the town has improved its sightseeing industry.\n\nThus, a lot of young people are associated with their communities and contribute to them.

{"file_id": "1135708.txt", "output_essay": "All students around the world must learn numerous things and sometimes write reports, organize ideas, take examinations, and demonstrate their understanding.\n\nEvery time, we must know facts and specific information to present our ideas correctly. So, we must learn facts correctly because if we do not know the facts, we cannot truly understand an idea or concept, and we may misunderstand different things about the concept.\n\nThe first idea is that we must learn facts more than concepts for a correct understanding of an idea. For example, if we do not know the facts about the modern world, we cannot understand why we must learn history. We learn history to contrast the modern and old types or to learn how the historical world was. And if we understand facts, we can understand concepts more easily.\n\nThe second idea is that we must understand facts to understand concepts. It means that if we learn about concepts and some tips of facts in our brain, the ideas will mix and confuse us. For example, in history, if we learn only about the damage each country suffered during World War II, it is a fact of history, but it is too specific, and we may become confused about whether we are learning about the situation of each country's damage or World War II. In this situation, we are learning about World War II, so to avoid confusion, we must learn about facts first.\n\nThat is my opinion: we must learn facts before ideas and concepts because understanding what the important things and main idea are is crucial. Every time we study about the main topic of our major, we must understand the features. However, the most important thing is to understand the features and use them to understand the main idea."}

They might not give enough time to helping their communities, but this could be due to a lack of time and different targets.\n\nNowadays, young people are individualistic because we live in a society that focuses on individuals rather than on communities. By the same token, young people focus on themselves and prefer to invest their time in selfish activities instead of community services.\n\nI consider myself a young person, and out of my experience, I can say that I am not interested in communities at all. Furthermore, I have lived in several countries, and what really strikes me is the fact that young people behave completely differently depending on the country they live in. For instance, in Sweden, guys are extremely independent, whereas in Spain, they are much less independent; likewise, Spanish guys might care more about communities than Swedish guys do. So, in order to understand the question, it is necessary to place it in a specific context.\n\nThe responsibility for such a situation lies with society, because society is constructed around individuals; rules are made according to what is best for individuals, thus they become the most important thing. Nonetheless, it is possible to notice strong nationalistic movements in Europe that emphasize on communities. If European communities become strong, it would be a change regarding young people's attitude, hence they would give enough time to helping their communities.\n\nTo conclude, I agree with the statement, but some aspects need to be considered before talking about young people and their attitude. Young people behave completely differently depending on the country they live in and their culture; however, all in all, it can be said that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities."}

Obviously, they know better than we do. Being taken by a tour guide, you can make your trip worthwhile, and you won't waste your money, which you spend on this trip.\n\nThirdly, if you go to a foreign country where the people speak a foreign language that you can't understand, it will be very difficult for you to communicate with others when you want to buy something or ask for directions.

{"file_id": "1129532.txt", "output_essay": "Most people think that enjoyment comes from experience, but in my opinion, when we first experience something, we enjoy it more. There is a saying that a thing is attractive until you get it, in other words, when you wish for something and do not get it easily, you are more keen to get it. After getting that thing, you lose your interest in it. This is human nature. So, the meaning is that younger people enjoy their life more than older people, because they experience things for the very first time. I also agree with this opinion that young people enjoy life more than older people.\n\nTo support my opinion, firstly, I would like to discuss the tendency or nature of youngsters. First of all, they are very curious about new things. They want to explore everything, regardless of the danger associated with it. For example, when I was a kid, I was always curious about parachutes, and one day, what happened, I just jumped from my rooftop with an umbrella. At that time, I did not know what fear was. So, the meaning is that you cannot expect this kind of absurd behavior from an older person. Even if an old person does not know the harm associated with the task, he/she might not take the risk.\n\nSecondly, youth do not care for moral values, whereas old people do follow them strictly. From their experience of life, senior people know the value of ethics and would like to follow them always. On the other hand, teenagers are unlikely to follow moral values, or they follow reluctantly.\n\nThirdly, in my opinion, you can enjoy life if you don't have restrictions on your activities. Old people have responsibilities towards society, as well as towards their own family. While youngsters are free to do whatever they want. For instance, I like to dance publicly, and I do whenever I get a chance to do it. But I know some older people cannot do it because first, they think about others' opinions, such as what would the society think, or what would be the impact on children.\n\nLast but not least, young people are always open to new ideas or cultures, while older people have a narrow mind. It is easy for a younger person to adapt to a new culture in order to learn it. On the other hand, senior persons are rigid to their own culture in order to preserve it.\n\nIn conclusion, although it is true that older people enjoy life based on their own lifetime experiences, I strongly hold the view that youngsters enjoy life more than them. The main reasons are the will to explore new things, no responsibility, less regard for values or ethics, and more energy to enjoy life."}
{"file_id": "1135415.txt", "output_essay": "The influence of advertisements on customers is worth commending. The advertisers are projecting their goods to customers in a 'larger than real' manner. I would like to agree with the statement that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.\n\nAs an example, consider the advertisements of washing powders, under whichever brand name it may be. The advertisements claim that they can remove different kinds of stains, make the clothes shiny, and maintain the color of the cloth for long, etc. Most of these statements are projected ones. Take another example of washing soaps, which help to make people beautiful, according to the advertisements. Some washing soaps claim that they can make people healthy also. As far as my knowledge is concerned, I have never heard of things like this happening anywhere in real life.\n\nIn the same manner, as in the case of washing powder and bathing soap mentioned above, the advertisements of clothing, motor vehicles, food items, etc. are all claiming things that are a little bit exaggerated. The manufacturers of motor vehicles claim that they have the latest technology, about which the consumer has never heard before, and the food products claim that they have all the vitamins and proteins necessary for human beings.\n\nIn short, the statement makes it clear that the advertisements are claiming things that are not exaggerated to a great extent.

The guide comes in handy, as they know the most economical places to stay in, and these days, we see guides getting into contracts with local drivers to help travelers have the option of having their own transport to see the various places of visit. I have recently come across a travel arrangement company that has its own dedicated staff as guides for helping travelers have a memorable experience. \n\nThe guides, being local to the place, have a good knowledge of the local places of visit and would help us get a good feel of the local culture by showing us the places that showcase the true local culture. Even there are places of eating where we can experience the real taste of the place. These can only be visited if we have a person guiding us to these places. Often, a guide is like a local friend, helping us stay at the best hotels at an economical price, eating the best food, and visiting the best places. \n\nI would like to conclude the topic by stating that the guide is the best person who can make our visit exciting and help us plan the trip with only a little monetary cost."}

The statement stated by the author seems to be correct in some situations and proves to be wrong in others, making this statement debatable. I will provide some examples to prove my point in this essay.\n\nThe author's statement mentions 'enjoyment of life.' This term is very relative in respect to people. Every person tries to live their life colorfully in their own way. If 'enjoy' means partying, then it may be possible that young people are doing it more frequently than older people, but when it comes to celebrating, older people are not stepping back from the younger generations.\n\nI do agree sometimes because younger generations are having better and more suitable conditions to enjoy their time. Young people are enthusiastic, active, and have the energy to enjoy sports events by playing and cheering; they are very eager to explore new places. Young people have an interest in movies and go to see them whenever they get the time. They go on picnics to have a change, and one thing that many young people enjoy is dancing continuously for hours. They enjoy various foods of different tastes at many times. This can be termed as enjoyment.\n\nIf we accept the author's statement, then it would be like saying that older people are not enjoying but are only carrying their life ahead. The things that are done by the younger generation were being done by the older generation earlier, and thus they lost the charm in those things and do not have enough strength to do the same thing continuously. But they are enjoying in a different manner, sitting on a chair, taking a sunbath, reading the newspaper, and giving advice to younger generations. They are not able to taste various foods because of their physical conditions, but even take that food by hiding from other people. They are the leaders of the house and have certain responsibilities to take care of. This can also be termed as enjoyment, but of a different kind.\n\nIn summary, we can say that this point is quite debatable and needs sampling of people and other techniques to reach some conclusion."}

I didn't care to understand them, just learned them to have a good grade.

Moreover, I think that good advertisements should enhance the appearance of efficiency to maximize their influence on the consumer.\n\nAdvertisements for skin care products are especially good at twisting reality. They usually employ models who have immaculate skin, regardless of the product. Then, they follow the usual recipe by showing the model using the product and telling the audience how big of a change it made on her. It doesn't take long for the audience to react to this display of cause and effect. The problem is that the product probably didn't have any impact on the model whatsoever: she had perfect skin beforehand. And that's not even mentioning the computer enhancements...\n\nHowever, I think one thing must be realized: the advertisement that I described previously did its job. It implanted a seed in the consumer's mind, and the sales will happen. That's exactly the purpose of marketing: generating sales. I think it's largely the consumer's responsibility to train themselves to mostly ignore advertisements. We know that they are fake, so why do we believe them anyway?\n\nDon't get me wrong: advertising is a regulated business and, as such, should limit itself to what has been ruled acceptable by society. Laws exist that forbid telling lies or deceiving the customer in an advertisement. Building on my previous example, if the skin care product has a real potential for reasonably improving the appearance of skin, then it is the consumer's task to discern what is real and what is embellishment. As long as the advertisement doesn't guarantee the same exact results on everyone, the marketing firm is on pretty safe ground.\n\nI'll conclude by attacking the other point of view: how could anyone disagree with the original statement that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are? That's the way it is. To anyone who believes advertisements display the whole truth unmodified, I have a bridge I'd like to sell to you..."}

By doing so, he improvises his ideas and comes up with better ideas than the other person. So, I agree with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. I would like to support this statement for the following reasons.\n\nFirst, by understanding the ideas and concepts, we get a clear image of the aspect. For example, if we are studying a particular subject, it is important for us to identify the main idea of the topic and the concept involved in that particular topic. By simply learning the subject without understanding the concepts, then it will be a mystery for us, even if we spend a lot of time on it.\n\nSecond, by understanding the ideas and concepts, we are able to know how to live in society. That means we are capable of knowing how to deal with problems and our colleagues. For example, if we want to ride a car, we must first understand the ideas and concepts, which means how to start the car, how to accelerate, and how to move through gears. By understanding all these, and if we practice, then it will be easy for us to ride the car; not only does just learning help us.\n\nThird, when we encounter new software or subjects, it will be better for us if we have understood the main idea and what are the improvements over the previous one; then these software will be useful for us.\n\nConsequently, the conclusion is that we must learn facts, and we must also understand the ideas and concepts of what we learn; then only will it be useful for us.

{"file_id": "1137207.txt", "output_essay": "There are different attitudes toward taking trips. Some people prefer to act individually and take trips by themselves or with a couple of close friends. On the other hand, some people are defenders of tour packages and rely on tour guides. I personally think that taking trips, especially to strange and unknown places, needs a great deal of information about such regions.\n\nFirst of all, there are many unpredictable conditions which at first may seem so interesting, but practically, it could turn into an unwanted disaster. For instance, consider you want to go to a place that you have heard a lot about its breathtaking and spectacular view. You are tempted to take a trip and visit that region. While trekking, you feel that you are attached to the earth and could not move. Suddenly, you know that you are in the marshland. In such a situation, there is no remedy, while you could visit there by a group.\n\nFurthermore, in a group, most people could take more responsibility, and all work is done more organized in comparison with individual actions. By sharing different responsibilities and tasks, no person will feel exhausted, and consequently, the journey will be more enjoyable for all. For instance, in a climbing trip, one could prepare the food or one could carry the stuff.\n\nMoreover, generally speaking, group collaborative actions increase individual's sense of responsibility, and consequently, from a social aspect, these people could become good team players and act effectively in other social actions.\n\nTo sum up, there are many virtues in group travels. Firstly, decreasing the possibility of occurring some dangerous and unpredictable events. In addition, sharing responsibilities among group members will make travelers relaxed. Finally, being in groups stimulates people's sense of responsibility for other social actions in the future."}
{"file_id": "1135299.txt", "output_essay": "I completely agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do. Enjoyment in itself is symbolic of freshness. Age certainly is a big factor in determining the freshness at heart to enjoy life to the fullest.\n\nThe most important factor that supports this idea is that young people are away from responsibilities and day-to-day life woes. They are either dependent on their parents or have some support for themselves. This kind of independence enthuses them to feel free, thereby adding to the fun in their life. Older people are experienced and have families to look upon. Their domain starts and finishes with their families. So, their enjoyment is limited to families, colleagues, and near-ones. Moreover, with the passage of time, the feeling of being satisfied with life increases. The needs shrink to a bare minimum, and emotional support dominates over feelings of enjoyment. Especially those who enjoyed a lot at a younger age tend to get away from enjoyment in older age. Take, for instance, in countries like India and Sri Lanka, older people find pleasure in spiritual activities and become more inclined towards leading an ascetic life, refraining themselves from enjoyment altogether.\n\nAnother factor that helps young people to enjoy life more is the state of their health, which certainly is better than that of older people. As age advances, the body does not allow all activities to be done that could be done during young age. For example, young people can have no limits on eating, say, chocolates, but older people can't do so.\n\nYoung people, being adventurous at heart, tend to take challenges, make new friends, and thus expand their social circle and broaden their horizon. On the other hand, older ones do not mix up so easily and rely on already built-up relations. Another argument that favors the statement is that since older people have already enjoyed at some point in their lives, so they feel filled and complete in themselves and are left practically with no desire to enjoy. Thus, it is quite convincing to believe that young people enjoy more than older ones."}

For example, if you have a fear of heights, you might take a big decision in your life and go try bungee jumping. You might wonder how this will affect my life for the better. This experience will enforce your self-confidence and self-esteem. It will change you to a person who is strong and not afraid of facing his/her fears.\n\nAnother example is that if you work at home and you do your work manually, but at the same time, you are good at it and know how to do it well. This might be good in some way, but on the other hand, it is boring and might make you depressed. If, for example, you decide to introduce a computer to your work, but you fear anything that is new and has to deal with technology; this might stress you out. You should take the risk and attend a course that teaches you computer skills. By facing this fear in your life, you and your business will turn out successfully. It will also help you flourish your work and save time, and at the same time, face your fears and build your confidence.\n\nIn order to be a successful person, you have got to try new things and take risks in life rather than doing what you already know how to do. This will increase your self-esteem and spice up your life."}

So, to learn a lot of facts or experiences from the past is important.\n\nAs a first example, my company provides seminars about the business process periodically. This seminar introduces the methods and processes about the business that is relational to our industry. In this seminar, we use presentation documents. The concepts are written in these documents. After the seminar, we collect questionnaires from the participants. They often say that ``Please introduce examples or facts using business methods more''.\n\nSecond, when we do a project, we explain the process to our team members. They can't understand how to do it with only an explanation of the concepts. If we explain using examples, they understand what they should do sooner.\n\nFor doing it ourselves, we need to know many examples or facts."}

Older people are mostly retired and have much more time and money to go on trips and travel to other countries. Younger people, on the other hand, have to learn often and do not have that much money to travel a lot. But they are more interested in discovering new countries and making new experiences. In comparison, older people already have a lot of experience and they often just want to visit places where they have been before rather than go on exciting trips.\n\nHowever, older people often have problems with their health and therefore they are not as flexible as young people are. Young people can do whatever they want without thinking about their health. Older people, therefore, are more interested in their own family, which is often the most important topic in their lives. And, to my opinion, it is far better to see your own grandchildren growing up than going into discos and staying up all night, what a lot of younger people do.\n\nTo sum up the main points, I do not think that younger people enjoy their life more than older people do, because there are so many things that older people can do which younger people cannot do. To my opinion, older people enjoy their lives differently than younger people do, but there is no better way."}

The first point I would like to make is that young people nowadays are very busy with their own engagements, which do not leave them with enough spare time. I think this is the main motive behind why young people do not give enough time to helping their communities.\n\nAs for me, I am a student at a university, and I never have spare time. I am always busy working at the university. Many times, I do not have time to see my boyfriend and my friends; also, I feel like helping my community, but I do not have time to make it happen.\n\nTherefore, last year I succeeded in organizing a big party in my country to gather money to help poor children. In addition, sometimes I help the children of my country with their homework. These events seldom happen because I do not have enough spare time. My situation is similar to that of my friends. In conclusion, I think that today, young people do not give enough time to helping their communities. In addition, I think that the main reason for this type of behavior is that young people do not have enough time."}

Older people are not that much aware of these technologies. Because technology is developing rapidly in daily life, younger ones are more energetic than older people, and they can go and do whatever they want. They make friends as a part of enjoying life in most public places, they usually attend parties and meetings, and have the capability to think and improve by adapting to new technologies, which enables them to enjoy more.\n\nOlder people mostly feel that they enjoyed in their younger stages, and let us allow their children, who are in younger stages, to enjoy, because most of their life has come to an end. While coming to old age, people think that they cannot enjoy because they usually suffer from most health problems, such as heart attacks, blood pressure, sugar, and bone problems. Today, the development of industries and factories, as well as increasing pollution, affects people's lives, making them prone to many diseases, which makes most older people think that they cannot enjoy the rest of their life.\n\nIn most of my experiences, older people allow themselves to enjoy more, as well as to get awareness of social life."}

Some solutions are there, but they are too expensive. However, when we find an appropriate and non-pollutant fuel, it will come out with new automobiles, and it will be a revolution.\n\nNowadays, cars release too much carbon into the atmosphere, and it's very bad for our planet. Cars pollute too much, and we can't keep on polluting as if nothing will happen. People will realize how bad cars are for the atmosphere, and everybody will prefer to have a bike or a non-pollutant automotive vehicle.\n\nThe technology allows us to build these kinds of cars, but the reason why car builders aren't generalizing this kind of car is that governments and people don't really see how fast carbon damages our planet. However, if we keep on polluting with our cars as if there are no consequences, in something like 10 years, the effects will be more violent and will happen more frequently, and that will make everybody want to stop polluting before it's too late.\n\nCars are being banned everywhere in the world. For example, in Paris, the mayor closed many of the city roads to cars and opened them to buses in order to force people to take public transportation and leave their cars at home. In Mexico City, it's worse because there you can use your car only once a week. The government did that to decrease air pollution because Mexico is one of the most polluted cities in the whole world.\n\nCars are too much polluting, and it's going to get more and more expensive just to put gas in it.

According to me, a person who changes with time and tries new things can be successful. Some people just want to play it safe and do not want to take any risks in life. They want to stay in the same place, work in the same company, and even like to eat the same kind of food. These people have very few chances to be successful.\n\nI think it is very important to have the courage to take risks in life. But at the same time, a person should also be intelligent enough to analyze their plan of action. For example, if a person wishes to start a company, they should plan and work on a lot of things. Firstly, they should analyze the market and see what effect their product has on the market. Then, they should take care of the finances. Starting a company or business or any enterprise requires a lot of courage because it might work, and it might not.\n\nSo one should have the confidence and courage to go out in this competitive world and give their best shot. If you fail once, it does not mean that you will fail every time. One should keep trying until they succeed. But it is also important to learn from your mistakes and try not to repeat them. Failing once should not stop you from trying new things."}
{"file_id": "1141936.txt", "output_essay": "I disagree with the idea that understanding ideas and concepts is more important for students than learning facts. There are two reasons: the step of study and correct ideas. The first reason is that it is necessary to learn basic knowledge for understanding ideas and concepts. If students lack basic knowledge, they cannot understand all of it. For example, students in Japanese universities primarily learn basic facts. Then, they begin to study applications. This is derived from the evidence during a long educational history in Japan. So, it is an important step of study for students. The second reason is that learning facts is essential for correct ideas. It is doubtful that students truly understand ideas and concepts unless they learn facts. For instance, in nutritional studies, students who do not know nutrients cannot understand the metabolism of their body and cannot find new ideas and pathways of the body system. For these reasons, I disagree with the idea that understanding ideas and concepts is more important for students than learning facts."}

In addition, today there are more and more problems, unlike in the past, because society has become more industrialized and people are always in a hurry.

However, I do think that young people are still more willing to afford life in a more enjoyable manner than older people do. So, I do agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do. In my essay, I will provide some reasons that make me agree with that statement.\n\nThe first reason why young people are able to enjoy life more than older people are is that, as they are young, they have a lot of experiences to do. Young people may wish to experience emotions that they have never tried before because of their age. They might like to have a family, and so they try all they can to find a good partner, enjoying any occasion they will have in order to reach that aim. Moreover, they would like to experience work. They would like to enjoy the jobs that they eventually find and they will try to appreciate all the aspects of them, as they represent their first experience in the labor market.\n\nYounger people might enjoy life more than the elderly, because, as they are young, they have more energy to afford life itself. On the contrary of old people, young people enjoy sports, such as football or basketball, which are an essential part of life, and which require a lot of energy that older people, in general, do not have. Furthermore, thanks to the energy that young people have because of their age, they have more opportunities than older people to make funny and relaxing things, such as trips or parties, which are so helpful in order to enjoy life.\n\nTo conclude, I do think that young people enjoy life more than old people do, because of the experiences they would like to try in their future, and because of the energy they allow them to exploit the most enjoyable aspects of life."}
{"file_id": "1136540.txt", "output_essay": "Will there be fewer cars in twenty years from now? My instant reply is no, and mainly because I realize how our technology is rapidly advancing, and cars will change, changing only to make people love them more, satisfying urges for beautiful car models, creating more desires to own one.\n\nLooking back into the past since cars were first invented, there's a huge difference in how many cars are owned. Compared to before, when only the rich owned cars, cars nowadays are getting cheaper in price, considering the amount of second-hand cars being sold and how cheap it is to buy one. As time passes, the rich will continue to buy more cars and sell their old ones, and at the same time, the lower class will buy these used cars for a cheaper price. With this cycle going on, more and more people will be owning cars rather than selling them.\n\nAnd why are the rich buying more and more cars? Generally, it's because of the constant change in car technology; the desire for speed and unique designs. A stereotypical view of rich people is that they buy cars just because of their looks. Car companies, looking at this, will exploit this point by coming up with more and more uniquely designed cars. There's a rare chance that rich people will disappear and their interest in buying these cars will decrease. On the other hand, there'll always be lower-class people who are ready to buy these used cars at a lower price.\n\nMost people want to own a car, and in my opinion, this is a psychological desire - jealousy. When a person sees another person with something they do not have, that person will also want a car. When a rich guy sees his friend with a really cool car, he will also want a unique car of his own. There are always more generations joining us, and with this cycle of jealousy and how the car price falls, it'll be easier for people to own cars.\n\nIn conclusion, I'd say that in twenty years, or even fifty years, the amount of car usage will only increase but not decrease. Unless something better than cars joins this market and successfully grabs car buyers' attention."}
{"file_id": "1140280.txt", "output_essay": "Students encounter many kinds of information in their courses or lectures. It can be regarded as an information overload on students. The lectures usually include ideas, concepts, and facts that students should learn and use. I assert that students should try to understand ideas and concepts instead of facts in the lessons in order to be successful. Understanding ideas and concepts rather than facts offers knowledge that is more lasting and provides students with a deep and total understanding of topics.\n\nFirst of all, a student has two choices when studying a lesson: memorizing the facts included in the subject or understanding the main concepts and ideas covered in the subject. If they prefer memorizing to understanding, their knowledge will be lost after a few days. Because of this reason, covering ideas and concepts is more useful and helpful than learning facts.\n\nThe other important advantage of understanding ideas and concepts is a deep and total understanding of the subject. Ideas and concepts have more meaning than facts. In other words, they are more valuable in terms of meaning. On the other hand, facts may be just a case or specific situation. It is narrow and has a general meaning about itself. It seems that ideas and concepts should take precedence over facts for students.\n\nTo conclude, it is the student's preference whether they pay more attention to ideas and concepts in the subject or not. The other choice is memorizing facts in the subjects. Understanding ideas and concepts is more lasting and provides students with a deep and total understanding. After considering the two advantages of ideas and concepts mentioned before, they are enough to prove their importance."}
{"file_id": "1138427.txt", "output_essay": "Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. I agree with the above statement that young people do not give enough time to help their communities. There are many reasons to support this.\n\nFirstly, in this competitive world, young people are much concerned with their careers, goals, and their aims, so they are more involved in their studies. As a purpose, they go to college regularly and study their day-to-day lessons regularly. The subject has become so vast that they have to refer to many books, and it takes much time for them. So, they do not have much time for other activities, such as helping their communities.\n\nSecondly, people nowadays show much interest in enjoying themselves with their friends. They either go to the movies or restaurants or pubs or to the playgrounds with their friends. They are always in a mood to enjoy themselves. They do not help the communities because they do not spare their time to work on good things and helping their communities.\n\nThirdly, the people these days have become very selfish, and they do their own work, which is helpful to that particular individual. They do not want to help their communities, which is beneficial to all. That is why they concentrate mainly on their work rather than helping the community.\n\nFinally, nowadays people are more attracted to media, such as television, newspapers, magazines, weeklies, etc. People are more concentrated on these, knowing about the world through newspapers and news on televisions and other means. There is also a rapid growth of importance for computers and the internet, and it draws the attention of young people towards it. Young people are much attracted to finding new things, and they browse the internet, spending most of their time finding out the information that is useful to them.\n\nDue to these above-stated reasons, nowadays people, mainly youngsters, do not spend enough time to help their communities."}

On the other hand, there are people who do what they already know how to do well. \n\nSuch two different types of handling risk will reach final success. People have different kinds of meanings about their own ability to take risks. If I think about such differences, I will talk about two friends of mine. \n\nThe one boy is about 35 years old. He reached one of the best school examination grades with a score of 1.2 during his school period. He began studying law and finished university after less than the regular studying time of 4 years with a very good grade. His first contact with the economic or, in general, with business had taken place for him at the age of 26 in a big company as an assistant for law-specific questions for consulting contracts. He was very resistant against risk, maybe because of his first contact with the business world. He had been in such an office and position for almost 9 years without a lot of experiences, but also without trying any higher risk than going home 10 minutes before the regular business closing time.\n\nMy second example is a boy who is 28 years old. He finished school with a grade around 2.5, which had been the middle field in his final examination year. He started his own business idea after his examination. His business was about offering IT solutions for small and middle-sized companies. In the time of the new market economy, a lot of companies used the consulting work of his company. He had a lot of fixed customers, which needed his help regularly. During such a period, he had the idea to export the concept to other countries, which he started in 1999 with Austria. \n\nBanks helped him to fulfill such a target by offering a lot of money. After two years, he had 4 offices outside Germany and a sum of 4,500,000 Euros as a negative deposit on the bank. \n\nThe concept failed due to the crash of the new market, and he lost almost all his life standards in 2 months and would not be able to pay the whole deposit to the bank in his lifetime.\n\nAs a conclusion of my two examples, the level of risk cannot be argued by the level of school education, meaning the final examination grade, and the university status. \n\nMoreover, people with an ability to try risks will have faster success and will stay there if they control themselves regularly. The risk of falling down due to uncontrolled mistakes is more realistic in comparison to the risk-averse people. \n\nHowever, every human being has to know for themselves which goals and objectives they want to reach and how fast to get there. In addition, such factors will bring the level of risk ability and the success."}

There are two reasons. First, it's more freeing. Second, backpacking is more exciting.\n\nThe first reason is that I have much more free time than in a group. To be specific, I can go wherever I want and spend a lot of time in some places without any resistance. If I want to go shopping, I don't care about other people's opinions. So I can go to small shops and explore where I'm interested. That means I have freedom in a trip.\n\nSecondly, it is more exciting. For example, when I visited Italy last year, I stayed in a youth hostel. There, I made friends who came from other countries. So, we went to popular spaces, restaurants, parks, and rivers together.

{"file_id": "1138108.txt", "output_essay": "Advertising was created to make people buy things. Nowadays, competition is very significant between brands, and each brand has to struggle to convince people to buy their products. Marketing departments deal with that.\n\nAs for me, I do agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.\n\nBecause of globalization, we can nowadays find almost whatever we want in each country, and more particularly in developed countries. This implies that competition is very fierce since there are so many products available for customers. The choice is huge, and how can we decide which product to buy when we do not know them?\n\nAs a consequence, brands launch many advertising campaigns. They do their best to create the best campaign. Thanks to advertising techniques, they enhance their products as much as they can. Because they need to have the product that would most catch people's attention.\n\nUsually, when someone looks at a billboard or watches a commercial on TV about a new food product, it is so well promoted that we are most of the time very interested in the product and very excited to go and test it. But we are unfortunately often disappointed. Indeed, if I take the example of a new burger launched by McDonald's, the burger will seem very good in the picture. However, when I go and try it, the bread will be too dry, the cheese will not have the same aspects... And once again, I will wonder why things are almost never the same as in the advertising.\n\nAdvertising agencies usually deal with significant budgets and use amazing techniques sometimes to enhance the product.\n\nNot only are the aspects not the same, but also the features are not what they tend to be. Actually, some products ensure that they can do this or that, and when you try them, the result is not the one you were expecting.\n\nFinally, I would like to add that this does not only occur for products but also happens for famous people. Most of the stars you see in magazines are gorgeous, but in real life, they are not the same; you can be very surprised. All this is due to the marketing that makes everything or everyone seem perfect."}

Many different people hold different opinions from their respective angles. In this topic, I need to say I agree that success belongs to people who like new things and are not afraid to take risks. There are two reasons to support my idea.\n\nFirst, I think the most important quality is adaptability. The people who like to explore new ways can always find a solution when they meet problems. In contrast, if you just rely on traditional ways to solve the problem, you are limiting your situation and may not overcome it. In other words, if you are not afraid of the problem and face it, you can find it is not a problem for you easily. For example, when I was a child, I needed to wait for my mom to pick me up and take me back home after school. One day, my mom couldn't pick me up because my grandmother was sick and she needed to go to the hospital. At that time, there was no mobile phone to be the contact access. My mom was very nervous that she couldn't find me. In the meantime, I tried to find something to do and went to the library. In there, I met my brother who was studying, and he took me back home finally.\n\nSecond, another quality is bravery. People will succeed because they are not afraid to try any ways to accomplish their goals. Generally, many ways mean many chances. That is also meant to increase your chances when you are trying new things.\n\nIn conclusion, because of the above reasons, I strongly believe that people who like new things and adventures will be successful more easily."}

Commercials on TV, huge wallpapers, and other kinds of advertisements influence and manipulate people to make them buy products. Are these advertisements really truthful, though? Or do they promise some things that don't even exist?\n\nI personally think that most advertisements make products seem a lot better than they really are. We just have to look at TV commercials to realize that they often promise more than the products actually offer.\n\nLet's look at the pharmaceutical industry, for example. Every day, we get to hear about new cosmetic products for beautiful skin or pills that help to lose weight. I tried many of these products, and I was never pleased with them.\n\nAnother example of false advertising is food commercials. Specific products we see on TV often seem to be a lot larger than they actually are. With the help of computer programs, people are able to make their products look better on TV or on paper. They use specific technical methods to convince their customers of their items.\n\nA third example of the lack of truth in advertisements is the methods of politicians to get more votes. They often promise great achievements and advertise with big headlines on wallpapers that they are going to improve the country's situation. I have gained the experience that they usually don't keep their promises.\n\nI come to the conclusion that we should be really careful about believing what advertisements promise us. Many of them don't tell the truth about their products. I personally think that these false promises are even the essential element of advertisements. We know that their only purpose is to convince people. Therefore, advertisements do always only show positive aspects of their products. Besides, our economy puts a great amount of pressure on firms who try to sell products. There is a huge competition between companies, and everyone has to sell as many products as possible in order to survive. This forces people to create advertisements that are convincing and persuasive, even if that means they have to hide the truth and be unrealistic."}

In fact, it is the older generation who enjoy life more.\n\nYouth has many advantages. It is perceived that young people enjoy more because they have more energy, enthusiasm, and time. However, what they do not account for is the society and its demands. With time, our society has been evolving; it has become more demanding, more particular, and much younger. Even though the younger generation does have more energy, enthusiasm, etc., it does not have the time to enjoy.\n\n'I wish the week had eight days' - this is a common phrase heard from all young people across the globe. Youthsters are pushing themselves to become responsible and successful citizens every day. They are always wanting to do more in less time. Their life has peer pressure, study pressure, exam pressure, job pressure, personal pressure. Added to this are various family, friends, and other social obligations. There is too much to achieve in such less time. Thus, the attributes which should have assisted them in enjoying life more become the reason for them to work and achieve more. Time is always short.

I do agree that most of the advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.\n\nAdvertisements, in fact, in today's world do not only mean the disposition of the product's essential features and its looks. Instead, they are supposed to be a glorified display of the product with the fake promise that it is and will prove to be a very valuable product, which will indeed provide enough customer satisfaction. In some cases, the promise may turn out to be true, as it totally depends on the company and the 'product', the real one.\n\nAdvertisements are supposed to be, in some cases, only heart winners! I say only because the products of that same field, competitive products, are all but equal in terms of quality or quantity they provide. It's only upon the marketing and advertising faculties of the organization if it can make it look 'much better than it really is'. And only when it makes a place in the customers' heart would it be sold, and the profits for the company would flourish.\n\nIn a world of competition, the manufacturer is compelled to make the product perceived as the best it can be. And indeed, as supported by the studies of the current markets, the products that are well advertised are the most sought after by the particular segment of customers. Indeed, if you add a bit of sheen to your product or make it look bigger, better, 'tasty', or tempting to the public on TV, magazines, or any other means of media, chances are that the customers, in and except your clientele, would be at least somewhat lured to the product. And though they might buy it only after careful examination of the product and considerable reviews from their friends, they are at least ushered to go to the markets and check out how and what it really is.\n\nNow, the actual sales of a product would obviously depend partially on how well it really resembles the advertisement 'glorification' and partially on the competition it faces.\n\nSo, in my opinion, the advertisement in today's world is a necessary part of the marketing process. As real as it can be kept, it should be. But I would consider it compulsory to give a bit of weight to the product and its features."}

It will be very important to understand the reason why a certain natural event happens, for example, and not learn the events alone.\n\nIn conclusion, I think that if a person wants to understand facts very well and not learn them because of school or because someone says they must learn them, they must question themselves about the basic ideas and concepts that are linked to those events. Also, if, for example, the event they must learn is not a good event, they must try to do it in a different way."}
{"file_id": "1140473.txt", "output_essay": "Nowadays, advertisement is one of the most important aspects to sell their products. I fully agree with this statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.\n\nAdvertisements of products can make their goods more beautiful or attractive. It is necessary for people to notice their products more impressive. There are many types of advertisements, one could be television advertisements, another one could be supporting entertainers, and so on. And showing some specific advertisements many times, people can get accustomed to the product.\n\nFor example, the iPod, which I bought by seeing many advertisements and seeing my favorite entertainer who has an iPod, can be a good example. iPod is the most popular item. Many Hollywood stars have this item. Many people bought this item. We can see iPod advertisements everywhere. And we can see the goods in the movie or drama. It seems to us many times, not only through direct advertisements but also indirect ones, such as supports.\n\nOne of my friends has this iPod. She told me why she bought that product, that's because it just looks good, and she was attracted to iPod's advertisement. And she saw many of her favorite Hollywood stars with this item, so she felt the item more attractive. I also purchased an iPod because I saw their advertisements many times more than other products, and I saw my favorite actor, Jung Il-woo, has the product. I think I chose the product because I saw the advertisement both directly and indirectly many times more than other products which have similar functions.\n\nIn conclusion, advertisement is necessary to make their products seem much better than they really are. It makes products more attractive."}

However, young people are helping, but not necessarily in their neighborhood.\n\nAs communities achieve a better living standard, less is required to do if you are part of these communities, and efforts to help are redirected to people in real need, either because of natural disaster or structural poverty.\n\nThere is a growing number of non-government organizations (NGOs) that raise funds to help poor people in less-developed countries. Entities such as the Red Cross, Oxfam, among others, are present with projects in those regions to help provide access to water, health, education, and food.\n\nMost of the volunteers working for these NGOs are young people who prefer to give a hand wherever it is most required. The reason for having this outside-focus help is the improvement of communication and information systems. Today, people are aware of what is happening worldwide and where the need is more required.\n\nEverybody is aware of the need to help others, regardless of the economic-oriented situation of companies. One example of this is that companies are more concerned about how others perceive their role in society. Social corporate responsibility has become a very important element in the decisions of companies that want to have a good reputation. They increase it by donating funds to NGOs so they can send people to help out there, not necessarily in their own neighborhood."}

One of the reasons is that they do not have time to spend on those things. They must spend most of their time studying in order to get good grades and go to a well-known university.\n\nAlso, young people nowadays are not good at communicating with others and are hesitant to meet new people. It occurs because people no longer talk with their neighbors as much as we did before. There is one example in my community. There was an opportunity to visit a house, which was for elderly people to live in, in the community. It was an opportunity only for children, but there were only two people who attended. The reason why the rest didn't come was that they were afraid to meet and talk with new people.\n\nThe other reason is that young people nowadays are not interested in helping communities. School does not teach how important it is to help the communities and join the activities; they only teach things that the students need for the exam. Adults should encourage young people to give more time to helping communities."}

If you stay in your comfort zone, you will never improve and grow to become a successful person.\n\nWe are all born with no knowledge; we don't even know how to walk, which is one of the first challenges we face in life, to learn a new thing. If we were to start life staying safe and not exploring, we would not even know how to walk.\n\nLater in life, we have to push ourselves to go to school and become part of a class, and keep trying new things like reading, writing, improving, and getting smarter.\n\nBy the time we take that first job, we have already done a lot of things out of that comfort zone, new things, and there are people who, at that point in their life, are comfortable with where they are.\n\nIn my opinion, you have to keep going. Trying to innovate, change, and grow, learning new skills that can make you successful in what you really want to do. Becoming successful means something different for everybody; to me, a successful person is one who knows what they are looking to get from life and is not afraid to try new things in order to do what makes them happy.\n\nI think everybody should take the risk of doing new things in order to become successful and happy people.\n\nThe last time I took a risk doing something I did not know how to do well was learning to surf.

This trend can be attributed to different factors, such as the world's population growth or the lower cost of vehicles, which leads to higher affordability for the demand.\n\nThe population keeps growing, as I mentioned, and for this reason, more people are willing to buy cars. Also, as mentioned above, the low cost of production, given by modern technologies and new materials, allows more people to buy a car.\n\nAnother reason that makes more people willing to get a car is given by the improvement of the transportation system pretty much all over the world. We see big highways and roads being built every day, so that more places in the world become better connected to each other.\n\nThere are many countries, such as Italy, for example, where the public transport system is not fully developed, and for this reason, a growing number of people prefer to have their own car rather than rely on a way to travel that is not as efficient.\n\nA psychological reason also explains why more cars will be seen in twenty years from now than today; the society tends to be very individualistic and less social than it used to be. For this reason, more people prefer to be independent when they get around, and the car becomes their own shell.\n\nCars cannot be replaced simply because people need them to go to work, to travel, to see places in complete freedom; sometimes people just want to get the pleasure of driving them and feel a sort of freedom.\n\nBecause of all the above reasons, I believe more cars will be produced and sold in the future, therefore, in twenty years from now, we will see more cars than today, not fewer."}

I come from an Egyptian background. In my culture, they believe certain things that they call 'facts,' but I do not believe most of the 'facts' that they believe in.\n\nI was born in the United States, but my parents sent me back and forth from Egypt to America, so I have lived here and there. One of the 'facts' that they believe in is that a young woman should not move out of her parents' apartment if she is not married. They also believe this concept, which they call a 'fact,' even though she may be going to live on campus so she can continue her education. This idea is not a fact, even though some people believe that it is, including my parents.\n\nWhen I tried talking to them about it, they told me how it's a fact and how it's not an idea or a concept because it has been going on for past years.\n\nAnother thing that I believe is an idea, and my Egyptian culture calls it a 'fact,' is that an Egyptian cannot marry a non-Egyptian; they have to marry an Egyptian. When I ask why, they respond with an answer like this: 'That is how it is.' When they respond with an answer like that, why should I believe it is a fact, not a concept?\n\nWhen I lived in Egypt, they used to tell me that a man can marry a non-Egyptian, but a woman cannot, and when I asked why, they told me because when you have kids, then they become what their dad is. For example, if their dad is Ethiopian, then they become that; if he is Christian, then the kids become that. But I do not believe that because you become who you are, not who your parents are."}
{"file_id": "1141177.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with the fact that it is essential for students to understand ideas and concepts rather than to learn facts. Ideas and concepts are two essential factors for learning. Ideas are the way by which one would learn about something through their past knowledge, past experience, or imagination. Concepts are the ones that provide you with the fundamentals of learning things.\n\nTake, for example, a car and an aircraft. Both are different objects for transportation. The idea behind developing them was to develop different means of transportation, fulfilling the different needs of humans. The basic concepts involved in developing them are the different laws of motion and pure sciences. The fact is that a car is used for transport on land, whereas an aircraft is used as a means of transport in air. It is important for a student to understand the ideas and concepts rather than learning the facts first. The facts can be learned once you are proficient with the ideas and concepts. If they only know the facts and not the concept, their learning would be limited. If they continue to learn things this way (by knowing facts), they would not be able to apply the knowledge of their learning.\n\nEmphasizing further, it would be important for the students to learn the ideas and concepts first, which, when combined, would give rise to facts. Thus, a student who has learned the basic idea and concept of laws of motion could automatically understand the facts involved with that.\n\nIdeas and concepts, and facts are different ways of learning things. But ideas and concepts are the foundation pillars of your knowledge. Your building (knowledge) strength lies in your foundation and not on our aesthetic view (in this case, facts learning), which just gives a shallow knowledge about the strength of your building's foundation."}
{"file_id": "1138106.txt", "output_essay": "Some people might say that it's better to be a master of one than being a jack of all. But in my personal opinion, it's better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in just one. Life is made up of not just one thing, but a variety of things and subjects. It is important for any individual to know at least the basics of almost all, if not all, subjects. Life is integrated with various issues.\n\nThe main reason for me to support the idea that experience and knowledge are needed in various aspects of life is to survive in this constantly changing world. The world can take any turn at any time of life. It is hard to predict the twists in the market. The market in one field can drop down suddenly one day, and all businesses in that field will close. So, it's better to have knowledge of other fields, at least the preliminary knowledge and skills, so that the person can think of starting up a new business if one doesn't work.\n\nSecondly, recreation is another point. If a person knows a few more things to do in life other than his regular routine work, it will be like a change for him, which he can enjoy and have fun. You get to know more people around you when you interact, and it will help to build relationships between them.\n\nIt's a part of our duty to maintain a balance of everything in life. Let us consider one example: currently, it's the trend of computers and technology, and many people will only take up subjects in Computer Science and neglect other aspects like Ecology, Sociology, and Economics. Who should care for the betterment and preservation of nature and nation if no person is knowledgeable about at least the basics of ecology? Everyone should be aware of things taking place in and around his place, his society, and nation as a whole.\n\nGeneral knowledge is required to be successful in life. Every business tycoon in this country has varied fields of experience and knowledge. If we consider the owner of McDonald's, who is not just a hotelier but a realtor too. Only because of this, he is able to start up millions of McDonald's centers in every busy commercial corner of the world. He integrated his knowledge of marketing and real estates into the knowledge of the food industry.\n\nThus, to conclude, in my view, I feel that to lead an independent and successful life, it's necessary to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects, and I strongly agree with the statement."}

So many scientists trying differently and facing so many problems create a wonderful life for us. For example, Thomas Edison invented the fluorescent light bulb, which changed our lives a lot. After that, several changes occurred due to the trying of new things.

I don't think tools, such as airplanes, ships, or any other, can easily replace cars in twenty years.\n\nCars nowadays need petrol as fuel, which has become a great problem because the amount of petrol we can gain access to is limited on our planet. Lots of scientists say that as long as we don't find other effective fuels for cars, we wouldn't be able to drive in a few decades. However, corporations such as Toyota, Ford, Hyundai, and many others have developed their technology to use hydrogen and electricity as the main power source of cars. These cars do not require petrol, and therefore, we will not need to find a substitute for cars in twenty years.\n\nThe world has grown rapidly during the past century. Cities have expanded their sizes, and population has seen growth in most cities. This growth has brought new needs to people, a fast and cheap transport. Cities have grown enormously; places that we can go in 30 minutes by car would take us a few hours or more on foot. Cars have become a necessary element in modern society. The world is still growing, cities are becoming even larger, and population is still growing, especially in India and China. The growth the world will see in twenty years will bring more and more needs for cars. Also, cars will become cheaper over time, as it did for the past decades, and it will allow people who couldn't afford cars to buy them. Cars will become more necessary over time.\n\nDuring the growth in the past few decades, our cities have developed in a way that allows cars to transport most efficiently. Cars were always taken into consideration; we have roads, underground passages, bridges, parking lots, and all kinds of systems for cars. This system has laid its roots deeply into our cities, and unless we change this whole system during the next twenty years in our cities, cars will still be the most efficient way of transporting, and people will not stop using them.\n\nCars have been by our side for half a century; it has made transport much easier and faster, and it is also becoming cheaper, which allows more people to afford them.

The more we use cars in large numbers, there will be more demand for resources for car fuel. By the next few years, the fuel we are using now for cars may be in scarcity. So, the world will have to abandon the use of cars as they are running out of fuel. So, people will certainly look for other fuel vehicles. Thus, the number of cars used may be reduced in the next twenty years.\n\nThere has always been a new thing replacing the old one in this world. People are always hungry for new technology. As cars are the fastest transport medium within the city and also a comfortable means, people are using them in large numbers. If a new car with new technology and better speed is brought to the market, people will rush to buy it. In fulfilling the requirements of the people, there might be a new vehicle, which may be a small aircraft, in the market that attracts people. Then, people will obviously keep cars in the back.

There are so many examples in which we can observe this difficult part of life. One of these situations is when people decide to marry. Nobody knows exactly if the person they are dating will be the best or the right one to share the rest of their life with; therefore, when you decide to take this kind of decision, there is always a great risk involved, unless you don't want to risk anything and remain single for the rest of your life. But if the person who decides to do this just because the fear of marriage is more powerful than the decision to take risks, then some problems might arise, and this person could spend the rest of their life in loneliness.\n\nTalking about another field, profession to be exact, this is an important part of every individual's life, and it is very important to decide what kind of job you want to do in the future. You may feel attracted to a career but feel inside that you are not smart enough to accomplish all the responsibilities that this kind of profession implies; therefore, you decide to stay where you are or choose another field that looks much easier for you, or probably you will be doing something that you already have an idea of what to do, even though you feel that you really would like to try something different. When this happens, it is not a good idea to close your mind to the world of possibilities and give the 'highly complicated' career a try. And after trying, then it becomes acceptable to fail, but I absolutely disagree with giving up on situations that can change your status in life.

Trying new things and taking risks are worth doing.\n\nFirst of all, success comes from innovation and risk. History shows that only brave and creative people have made an impact on human life. For instance, Thomas Edison invented light bulbs. During his work, he tried thousands of kinds of materials. He did not succeed until he found the last one. In fact, he was not sure if he would find the right material all the way through. He took more risks than others could bear to. As a result, his courage and perseverance have changed our life.\n\nSecondly, people are scared to try because they are afraid to fail. Nevertheless, failure is the mother of success. Even though, after all the hard work, they may fail, the experience they acquire is invaluable. The new gained precious experience will, in turn, lead them toward their destiny. This is a common process to success. Without trying, this process will never happen.\n\nThirdly, staying where one is will eventually make him fall behind. In the 21st century, everyone is trying to overcome any adversity to achieve their goals. If someone stops progressing and does what he already knows how to do, he will be left behind. Therefore, taking risks and breaking the mold is the only way to survive in this competitive society.\n\nOverall, in one's success and victory, trying new things and taking risks are the two vital factors. As people try to advance, the ones who stay the same are determined to be the last ones in the race of life. Only improvement brings eternal success to a person."}

I think students have to have enough time to help their communities. It is because, during the time they are helping their communities, they can get lots of life experiences that give them more important knowledge than studying in their school. Sometimes, life experiences bring really important things to people to know for their life. Also, the communities are important, just like life experiences.

For example, if we study with others, we can get much information that is very useful than studying by ourselves. Nowadays, our life is changing, and people cannot get their own time anymore.

They don't think about what will happen when the petrol runs out! The petrol dug from the earth's crust is decreasing every day very rapidly due to the huge number of cars present on earth and the factories using petrol as a source of energy.

Let me briefly state why I have chosen to emphasize ambiguity instead of an exact answer.\n\nFirstly, the population of the world is growing rapidly, which might create the impression that there would be more cars in use as there would be more people living on earth. It is true in the case of Turkey, for example. I came to observe that automobile galleries in Turkey are the best profit makers, and the number of cars sold increases dramatically each year. But, taken from another aspect, it could quite be the opposite. The rapid growth of population is observed more in underdeveloped or developing countries whose gross national product or income per capita is very low. Then it would be more likely for the citizens of such countries to tend to use buses or trains, which would be a much cheaper way of transportation. In India, for instance, one can easily notice this situation.\n\nSecondly, the increase in the number of people living in a city might push its dwellers to make use of public transportation. Not because these people cannot afford to buy cars, but because they do not want to lose their valuable time on roads, stuck in the middle of a never-ending traffic jam. Let's take the example of New York City. Even the mayor of this city is said to be using the subway in order to evade the traffic and promote the use of subways. Yet there is also the case of California, where we can see anyone at any age owning and driving a car. Because of its geographical characteristics, it is almost impossible to live one's life without a car in Los Angeles. Not that the city is overcrowded, such as New York. But because there are miles between any two destinations.\n\nAs to my personal observations, there are a body of reasons both to agree and disagree with the statement. In the end, whatever the signs and predilections are, we live in a world of unpredictability and surprises.

Old people may not have the patience or interest in particular things, so many old people prefer spending their life in their home or in their guest houses, playing with their grandchildren.\n\nThough going to school, colleges might not be interesting to a few youngsters, but in my point of view, it is still an interesting part of our life, which if we miss, we cannot get it back ever.\n\nStudying new things is very interesting rather than sitting at home, chatting with the neighbor, and watching TV.And I guess most old people spend their time chatting with another old person and even watching TV.Old people might not enjoy the new technologies and new inventions, which a youth might be enjoying.I guess that even old people in those days might not have had good education than this generation and might have missed many facts and details that this generation knows about it.\n\nI hope that the advantages I have listed above are also a part of enjoyment in everyone's life.I hope that youth in today's generation are in better working conditions than the people in the past.Even that is too an enjoyment that the old people miss out because people in those days must have worked hard and toiled a lot, but now we have machines for everything, which makes our job a lot more easier.Thus, I conclude that young people enjoy life more than older people do."}
{"file_id": "1142749.txt", "output_essay": "Nowadays, students have lost their interest in the provenance of ideas and concepts. As time goes on, there are fewer students interested in answering questions such as 'How was Newton's law conceived and what is its mathematical basis?' or 'How was steel first created from its natural constituents?'\n\nStudents are losing that curiosity in how facts are conceived due to a lack of interest in things they think already exist and do not need to be studied again by them because it was already clarified centuries ago by someone else. Instead, they would rather learn and understand the final results obtained years ago, which have been put under evaluation several times through all these years.\n\nTo explain this point further, let us take a look at the two examples mentioned at the beginning of this essay: Newton's law. Back in Isaac Newton's time, it was surely important to prove his second law of motion by measuring the time a body lasts in free-falling motion from a determined height. Nowadays, students do not care about proving this theory by implementing their own experiments; they would rather study the formula developed by Newton and apply it in a physics problem with only one purpose: to get a good degree at the end of the course.\n\nNow, let us take a look at the second example: the manufacture of steel. There is a big theory in this field, and research is still being carried out on it. Many cultures were involved in the early years of the Iron Era, and a lot of experiments were carried out to study how iron reacted with air to produce steel; many manufacturing techniques were studied to come up with the idea of using high-temperature furnaces to produce steel. This last result is the one that matters for students; they are only interested in understanding how steel is formed in a chemical reaction in order to get a good grade once again. They do not care about proving to themselves that steel can be manufactured in such ways.\n\nThe reason why students act this way has already been mentioned: they are told to worry only about a degree, and they are not allowed to let their minds think about what they really like. It would be better if students were allowed to study what they really like. In this way, a student who really likes chemistry and physics will surely be wondering about the facts, while a student who wants to develop an artistic talent such as painting does not have to worry about things they do not really care about."}
{"file_id": "1145300.txt", "output_essay": "Advertising is the art of convincing customers to buy specific products. It is obvious that advertisements do not provide complete information to customers. That is not their original purpose, even if they sometimes provide useful information, and other ways exist for customers to get information about the products they want to buy. For example, a lot of independent websites compare all the models of the same product available in the market.\n\nBut even if advertisements are not supposed to provide complete information, they often describe some features of the product. Doing that, they cannot lie about objective characteristics because it is not legal, and the advertisement would be forbidden by the competent authority.\n\nThen, how can advertisements lie to customers? The way to describe a product can be very subjective, and it is obviously the case for advertisements. For example, if you present a car with a very beautiful girl or boy driving it, you don't lie, but you give the illusion that the car is better than it would be with a normal driver. That is seduction. An advertisement is seduction. When you are interested in someone and you have a date, you do not wear your everyday clothes. You take more time to appear 'much better than you really are.' That is seduction too, and nobody seems to be against this kind of 'subjective lies.'\n\nIn my opinion, the statement 'most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are' is true, but that is not a problem because everybody knows that advertisements are subjective. There is a game of seduction between companies and customers. We have to know the rules and take part in the game. I think that life would be less interesting without this kind of subjective communication, beyond technical descriptions."}

Young people most of the time are not interested in helping and developing the community in which they live. Just a small part of them is really interested in the topic. Often, this new generation is selfish and worried about satisfying their needs instead of opening their minds to the community. I can say that many things have changed during these years; in the past, people's commitment was much more developed and felt compared to these days. My parents, my grandparents really believed in the possibility of creating a better place to live; moreover, they tried with a lot of effort to improve activities that could let the community be a better place. There was the trust that something could change if you were really interested in what was around you.\n\nNowadays, I think that the responsibility to take care of the community has disappeared altogether - young people think that it is not their problem to be worried about community enhancement, thus the common belief is that just the government has to promote and support it. Furthermore, young people are not interested in this aim because there is no clear return in terms of money or materialistic benefits. This generation has lost the beauty of believing in the power of ideas. They do not fight anymore for an idea but just for themselves.\n\nAn example of the difference between the past and the current days could be provided by a short story told to me by my grandfather. In 1940, my grandfather was very interested in the problems of our town. He was a person who tried to improve the economic condition of our city and to develop the spirit for the community. In that period, in my small city, there was no cinema. The citizens of that time complained most of the time about this kind of lack, even because in that period the cinema was something new and it appealed to most people. My grandfather was the one who invested money and finally bought the first cinema of my town. Everybody can remember him firstly as a good person and then as someone who did at least some efforts to take care of the community."}
{"file_id": "1147163.txt", "output_essay": "In the last century, a large number of people pursued education to have a good situation in their own lives. I am inclined to believe that students must understand the reasons and abilities of their educated lives. Students who receive lessons from a professor want to acquire a lot of information that the professor has, and it depends on the understanding of the ideas and concepts of the professor. Regardless of saying that students during their educational lives should understand the ideas and concepts of the information they get from their professors.\n\nFirst of all, students who receive lessons from a famous professor should acquire information about him, and they can get their surveys and experiments. After that, they understand what he did in his own experimental life and his ideas and expectations of their work. So, in the lesson, they can acquire a lot of information from him.\n\nSecondly, students who want to work in a survey must think about the concept of the survey. A survey depends on a long time, and it is very difficult for some people because of their character. Although people who want to create an experiment must be able to wait for a long time. When students want to work in a survey, they must learn about the system they use, and after that, they can become experimental people from these kinds of surveys.\n\nTaking everything into account, in the light of the above-stated reasons, understanding of the ideas and concepts of an information is very significant for the students, and when they get the ideas and concepts, they can earn a lot of benefits that can be used for their own lives."}
{"file_id": "1143274.txt", "output_essay": "\"Mom, I don't want to study these theories again and again,\" said my little child. So many questions about this crossed my mind, like: what is really more important for a student to know, understanding ideas and clear perceptions or taking facts as they are printed in their textbooks?\n\nThis issue, which describes the types of learning, is really a controversial issue for plenty of reasons. As learning is concerned, I wish to see changes in the learning ways at many levels and angles. I personally strongly believe that a person, in general, should be given the opportunity to understand the ideas and concepts first, because that is what shapes a person's personality. Let us take young children as an example; most of these children have their personalities shaped when they turn ten years old, because all the abundant perceptions, knowledge, ideas, and even things which they like and things which they dislike have already been configured. A soldier is another example; this fighter learned the concept of loving his country when he was a kid, didn't he?!\n\nAnother thing I would really do, if I had the chance to change something in how our young students should be taught, is that I would build a whole city of learning, and I would make it unique in its given courses. It would be built based on the concepts of loyalty, love, teamwork, and encouraging individual talents. Moreover, no normal test would be given, because they would be taught that the concept of examination is not always the right concept. Also, they would have weekly debates about larger concepts like enthusiasm, ethics, aesthetics, and racism to have these young generations prepared to involve in real-life life.\n\nIn conclusion, learning concepts is the best way for someone to have a balanced family, community, and even country, because it is a circle of wise ideas, which never fails. In my opinion, no wars, no violence would exist if evaluating our concepts and respecting other concepts were everybody's dream to fulfill."}

They have a vigorous body and therefore a vigorous mind. Mix these with a good moral education and a spirit for adventure, and the result can be a young adult who truly and deeply enjoys his life.\n\nOn the other hand, older people tend to be limited by their deteriorating body and have to deal with a limited diet and activity plan. They can have the moral base and the unbreakable spirit of a young person, but their bodies will not keep up with these for a long time. It is obvious that the range of physical activities available to young people in life is much greater than that available to old people. Sky diving, snowboarding, rock climbing are some examples of activities off-limits to older persons.\n\nThe second advantage young people possess is their fresh outlook on life. This view of their lives has not been tarnished by mistakes, torn relationships, or failed attempts. Their emotions are strong, and every new detail life brings to them is embraced with passion.\n\nOlder people tend to carry around old memories of lost loved ones, of failed attempts, torn relationships, mixed feelings, which in turn drain spiritual energy that would otherwise be used in more effective ways to enjoy life. A younger person has a better chance of accomplishing his life goals because he doesn't waste valuable energy in regrets or remorse.\n\nIn conclusion, young people have a better chance than older people to enjoy life at its fullest, because of physical and emotional advantages."}

She said she felt most comfortable with painting and liked to challenge herself by doing hard things. She has been successful by challenging herself. However, what brought her to the most successful stage was challenging herself by doing easy things.\n\nThere is a project called 'Concentration' that all AP Art 12 students have to do. Anna chose to use teabags to symbolize the memory of our lives. She believed that used teabags have a memory for each person, depending on why that person drank that tea, when they drank it, and where they drank it. Her first idea was to make a canvas out of those teabags and paint on it. As I mentioned before, she feels most comfortable with painting.\n\nHer subject matter was very interesting, but her idea of painting on it bothered my art teacher. My teacher suggested that she not paint on it but find a way to make it interesting by using the teabag itself. Anna said, 'But... that is going to be too easy.' She thought that making some art project in an easy way would result in low-quality work. No drawing or painting was a big challenge for Anna. However, she decided to take my teacher's advice.\n\nAnna tried new things by making it simple and by using the teabag itself. Once she told me that it is so hard to do something so simple, and she is not used to it. Later, she found her way to make those teabags seem interesting. She laid out those teabags and made a mobile; quilted with different kinds of teabags; and other different experimentation. Anna is now making a dress out of her teabags that she collected from people, and she is achieving a very high stage as an artist. She is not only receiving a high mark in AP Art 12 class but also having the opportunity to try new things. She is successful by experimenting with new things."}
{"file_id": "1146060.txt", "output_essay": "I definitely agree with the statement that it would be more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it would be for them to learn facts.\n\nTo support my opinion, I will give three reasons in favour of the latter.\n\nFirstly, I surely agree with the opinion that students have to learn some facts. It is obviously important to know certain things, but it cannot be the main objective. As I have experienced, the things you remember in the end are not the ones hardly learned and memorised, but the ideas and concepts transmitted by a book or a professor. To be capable of memorising, you need to connect the facts and transform them into bigger pieces, into concepts.\n\nSecondly, it is not just important to know things, but to understand them. By memorising numbers and numbers of facts, you do not automatically also understand them, and you are not necessarily able to see them in relation to other factors. You may not be able to see the overall meaning of all the factors learned.\n\nThirdly, when actually using the knowledge learned, you need concepts and ideas rather than pure facts. For example, if you are a doctor, it does not help you to just know where the knee is, but also to be aware of all the different parts of the body that can influence and affect the knee. Experiencing pain in the knee is not necessarily caused by the knee itself. It can also originate in another part of the body.\n\nSummarising, I think there should be both, the learning of facts - serving as a basis of knowledge - and the understanding of concepts and ideas, to be able to get the meaning of the knowledge learned and memorised. What counts in the end is the ability to use the knowledge, and this is just possible when having a profound understanding of the facts learned."}
{"file_id": "1146557.txt", "output_essay": "In a rapidly changing world, it is clear that those who do not understand ideas and concepts are unlikely to succeed. Some argue that it is ideal to learn facts. However, I agree that it is unrealistic to learn facts.\n\nBecause doing so prevents them from developing their knowledge and finding more rational facts.\n\nFirst, learning facts does not increase their knowledge. This is because if people learn facts, they become weary of the facts, which makes it difficult to develop their creative knowledge. For example, a recent study shows that students who learn facts produce knowledge 30 percent less than students who understand ideas and concepts.\n\nThis is because students become fed up with simply learning facts. It makes them dull. As a result, learning facts prevents students from developing their knowledge.\n\nSecond, understanding ideas and concepts helps students find more rational facts. This is because they can find more rational facts from experience to understand. For instance, my son has learned from learning facts to understanding ideas. I was disappointed whenever he did not understand the principle of something. However, after he changed the method of learning to understanding ideas, he found more rational facts. If he had chosen to learn facts, he would not have been able to find more rational facts.\n\nIn short, it is impractical for students to learn facts, since it leads to lower knowledge. Furthermore, experience to understand ideas and concepts helps them find rational facts. Although it's easy to learn facts, it prevents them from growing in their professional lives."}
{"file_id": "1145791.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with this statement. In my opinion, being successful requires you to be uncommon. You need to have some unique qualities in order to be recognized and acknowledged by the public. Repeating the same things in which you have acquired perfection might earn you attractive results initially, but in the long run, they are not much fruitful. The competition in all fields of life is very tough these days. So, to overtake others, you need to possess some distinguishing characteristics. Working on the same project again and again is not going to solve your purpose. Because gradually, other people also acquire mastery over them and may even surpass you. Though trying to do new things, say, for example, starting a new business, may ultimately turn out to be a disaster, and in that context, the other view appears to be more appropriate, but as we all know, 'failures are the stepping stones to success.' History is full of instances that support the idea of endeavouring new things. One common example is of scientists. It's well known that only those who have tried to innovate have been able to register their names in the books and are remembered even after hundreds of years. What if Einstein had accepted the already running theories? The concept of relativity would have never arisen, and of course, Einstein could not have been able to get the Nobel Prize. There are numerous other examples of various leaders, businessmen, researchers who became successful only because they tried to introduce new concepts. To name a few, Mahatma Gandhi, who pioneered the Indian freedom movement, businessmen like Bill Gates, who introduced Windows and revolutionized the computer industry, and now he stands as the richest man on earth. So, based on the above-mentioned examples and facts, I am of the opinion that only those succeed who do new things and take risks."}

The public needs to know which products exist and what their characteristics and quality are. For this reason, advertisements are playing an important role, giving us, the consumers, the possibility to know about what we are going to buy. But the advertisements need to offer a good product for sale, and then they can give people a false valuation of them.\n\nThe advertisements always express a partial opinion about the product: the owner's consideration. First, he needs to create the idea that you need it. Later, he will convince the public that what he is offering is the best. In all cases, he will try to give you the best opinion. Even without seeing the thing or tasting it first, a person can think that this product is wonderful and buy it. In addition, a product may not be very important for you, but if you see it in commercials, you can think of buying it and create a reason for this purchase. In many cases, this product will remain in the garage or in some place in the house that you cannot remember later.\n\nThe advertisements are going to express every time acceptance and good opinion about the product because they pretend to catch the consumer's attention and make it enter the market in a competitive way. When a new thing arrives in the market, it must show sufficient quality and presence to compete with the other products of the same kind that already exist and win customers. For this reason, many products only have a good presence, and there are not as well as they must be, according to the commercials.\n\nI agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are and they lie to the public with business purposes. Customers must be careful of their purchases and try to warranty them too."}

Keeping this in view, I would like to agree with the statement that successful people try newer things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. This may include many aspects, like inventing many things, knowing the other side of the coin, or finding another solution to a problem.\n\nFirstly, take the point of inventing new things. The inventors who would discover a new thing couldn't either know what the result is going to be; it's a sort of risk that is taken by them. But what if they succeed in inventing that? Then, there will be added glory to them instead of just sitting quietly, simply because they already have done well and fearing about the risk they have to take.\n\nAfter all, 'failures are stepping stones to success.' They may learn a new thing by failure, which will be definitely useful again.\n\nSecondly, take the point of finding another solution to an existing problem. If the Indian President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam could not have risked the launch of a rocket into space, people could not know the information about what actually happens in other planets or the interesting points about space that we know now. Though it was a failure for the first time, he did not stop there and followed the saying 'try and try until you succeed,' which brought him great fame.\n\nThirdly, consider the case of the invention of many metals by scientists, which was invented by experiments that risked their lives themselves. But those people are more successful in life because they had the fame and importance even after their period.\n\nThese people did not do what they already know how to do well. In fact, they risked their lives for the discoveries they have done.\n\nFinally, I conclude by saying that each and every individual should always risk doing new things, which will definitely yield better results."}

Furthermore, I will go a step further and say that I am sure that almost everyone has bought a product because they remembered an advertisement about it. Advertisements are tempting and play with the customer's emotions. In addition, the way they are put together appeals to the viewers' eyes; it makes them want to have whatever is displayed on the advertisement. In the center of advertisements is usually a woman with a perfect body, few clothes, and a big smile. Moreover, this kind of advertisement makes women want to be her and men want to get her. At this point, the product being sold is not as important as the emotion involved in the advertisement. For example, an advertisement for a cigarette company sells a cancerous stick to people by presenting a tan, attractive, and good-looking woman with a glowing cigarette in her hand on a huge billboard. Do people really want to start smoking, or rather be as good-looking as the woman? Now, this supports the fact that the advertisement makes the product seem much better than it really is.\n\nAnother point to be made in this commentary about the statement is that even if people do not try to be influenced by the products sold on advertisements, they are still influenced by them. As soon as people leave their house, they are surrounded by advertisements on huge billboards, on trucks driving by, on school blackboards, or in magazines and newspapers. These advertisements will store subconsciously. If people then go to the grocery store to make their weekly supplies, they will remember what they saw on the billboards. They might buy those products and recognize that what they bought was not as good as they thought it would be. They are surprised by the fact that the advertisements sold them this product and, more importantly, made it look better than it actually was.\n\nIn conclusion, it seems that in today's world, we are surrounded and enclosed by advertisements and people who try to sell things. This is the reason why it is hard to distinguish whether the product being sold is actually worth buying or if it is just trying to trick our eyes. It is important for people to recognize that not everything advertised will have exactly the same effect on everybody or will taste the same way to everyone. But also, I had to make the experience first before I recognized that 'advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.'"}

Not saying that knowing a lot is a bad idea, but specializing in a particular area is the step of leaving your name in a history book. The depth of which a particular area of knowledge is explored is far more beneficial than having a broad knowledge of every academic subject. Therefore, I strongly disagree with the statement, since it only guides you more into being a normal person.\n\nFrom not only historical evidence but also personal experiences, specializing in a certain area of knowledge would surely make you special from all the rest, not only so, it is the best way of leading to success in future life.\n\nTo begin with, a famous English plant scientist, a biologist, has made the most remarkable achievement in the area of biology. But when you ask what he differs from the rest of the biologist scientists, it is because of his consistency and specialized work in the observation of pea plants; he studied the same plants for over 20 years and thus finally got a Nobel Prize for his achievements. Not only will he be remembered, but his work of investment and achievement to the grounds of genetic coding will also do great benefits to the rest of society.\n\nFurthermore, a famous French writer called 'Silva Plath' is famous for the poems that she wrote, the sadness and emotions through her poems; by reading her poems, emotions and a sense of sadness would soon arise. She is not any different from any other poets, but only one aspect which is different would make her so famous, is the fact that her use of metaphor and the descriptions of surroundings is known to be so precise and carry a sense of shady cloud through reading her work. This made her work still popular, and it is now what many modern poets are looking to achieve and trying to copy her style.\n\nLastly, not only people in the academic area are famous, but also one of the most famous persons, which most people would know, is 'The Great Michael Jordan.' He is known for his basketball skills. However, many do not know that even though he may seem to be the best basketball player at that time, it was once said by his college professor and his college coach that 'It seems like basketball and Michael have a strong bond; he seems to only know how to play good basketball.' And sure, the world has proved him right; he had won himself billions and billions of dollars and fame, just simply by playing good basketball.\n\nIn conclusion, from these examples, we can clearly see that specializing in a specific area would not only make one famous but also it would surely leave one's name in the history book. By this, I strongly disagree with the statement."}

If I try to picture the why of a tour guide or its purpose, actually, I can really go further to illustrate that.\n\nAs I guess we all know, nobody wants to be unsecure or not well protected, or not well guided. Why am I led to talk about people? For the simple reason that travel is made and basically has to do a lot with people.\n\nFor instance, if I have to talk more about the security aspect of the thing. When we see today, in the most technologically advanced century or age, the way people want to be secured; be it political leaders who are guided or secured, even countries. It really shows the longing or the desire at the maximum of anyone wanting to be secured.\n\nSo from this point of view, I can really see that traveling in a group led by a tour guide is one of the good ways of traveling in connection with some of the reasons that I have announced previously.\n\nBut I can also say that it is not always necessary the only best way to travel. As I said formerly, it can be relative, I mean by also depending on people's point of views of what is the best way of traveling. Because for some people, during their travels, they use means of transportation which do not have a tour guide, and all the same, they qualify their travels as always being the best.\n\nSo from this angle, we really see the restriction of what is called the best way of traveling, which is connected to being led by a tour guide."}
{"file_id": "1147675.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with the statement that ``Most advertisement products seem much better than they really are''. For two main reasons, first, the main goal of advertisement is to sell, and the seller would try to show their product in the best possible light. On the other hand, advertisement campaigns can make the consumer think that owning the product can make them feel or be a certain way.\n\nAs stated in the introduction, the main goal of advertisement is to sell and make the product likable and attractive to the consumer. These may result in distorting the real product, for example, food products, to be able to transmit a flavor, which is a sensation, on visual images. The advertiser needs to over-show all the visual characteristics of the product, which may result in a distortion of the real sizes and appearance of a food product.\n\nAs a second argument, the advertisement can make the consumer understand that by acquiring the product, they can feel or be a certain way. For example, women's shampoo campaigns always show a prototype of a woman's hair. The consumer may assume that the type of hair that the person in the advertisement has would be the same as that she would acquire if she uses the product. That does not necessarily mean that the product seems much better than it is, just that the consumer is making assumptions about the product, but this is a direct consequence of the advertisement.\n\nThe wish of the producers to sell their product to the consumer may end up in distorting the product by making them seem much better than they are, basically because of the assumptions of the consumers drawn to by the visual images of the advertisement."}

The market was getting bigger and bigger. He got married to a pretty woman and he opened another market. He opened four markets until he died. In conclusion, I think it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific."}
{"file_id": "1147187.txt", "output_essay": "I partly agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities because of a lack of time and a lack of awareness. It also depends on the individual attitudes of the people.\n\nMost young people have a busy schedule and do not find time to help their communities. Again, it depends on their individual attitudes. I have seen many people who willingly neglect.\n\nThey willingly neglect and think helping communities is a waste of time, even though they have ample time. Young people always try to find fun and act reluctantly when asked to help. It is because they are not aware of the benefits and the happiness they get out of it. Studies alone do not count; you should also have a helping nature.\n\nOn the other side, there are many youth organizations that specifically aim at helping their communities and people in need. We have many blood banks where many young people come and register every day. They collect blood and send it to hospitals when needed, for free. They organize events and give prizes to those who donate blood to inspire young people. We also have organizations that go around and collect money and send it to people affected by environmental disasters. When the tsunami catastrophe left many people homeless, these youth organizations collected huge amounts of money and handed it over to them, winning their hearts.\n\nSo, it is not that young people do not help; it is that they do not spend time due to a lack of awareness. It is only possible by young people because they are energetic and dynamic in whatever they do. All we need to do is motivate them and tell them about the importance of helping. Elders should teach young people about helping others and spending some of their time on those activities.\n\nSo, I conclude that young people do not give enough time for helping, but they are not so cruel that they do not extend a helping hand when needed."}
{"file_id": "1148903.txt", "output_essay": "The real clich\u00e9 advertisement is the one in which a beautiful young woman is eating a great yoghurt in a terrific place, such as a nice desert island. Indeed, very often the advertisement makes the product seem much better than it actually is.\n\nThis is really true when we talk about advertisements for goods such as food, cars, and clothes. However, it is not really the product that is shown as much better than it is, but rather what is around the product. Apparently, you always need a cute girl, a handsome guy, or a vast, shiny house to make a sausage or a T-shirt sell. So, it is more the stuff unconsciously linked to the product than the product itself that is shown as better than it really is.\n\nNevertheless, in some cases, the product is not shown as better than it is. In particular, when it is an advertisement not on goods but on services. For example, the advertisements sensitizing on road security, or the ads concerning lending money in a bank or concerning insurances. In those cases, the advertisement is more serious, and there are fewer lies.\n\nAll things considered, I agree that very often, but it is not the least surprising, and most people are aware of it. The goal is to create a need and to increase sales.\n\nIn a nutshell, I would say that an advertisement is trying to make products seem much better than in reality, but it is often true for goods and less for services."}

Therefore, I definitely agree with this statement: brain exercises are more useful and important than memory exercises.\n\nThe first step in the education of any human brain is to learn how to study and understand a new idea. Learning by memorizing new facts is only a mechanical exercise that cannot increase our intelligence. Therefore, if we can understand a concept, we will be able to remember it, and it will be part of our knowledge forever.\n\nSometimes students try to learn facts because they think that it is an easier way to learn; but this idea is completely wrong. Only by understanding the real and essential meaning of a new concept will the student be confident and able to use it in their future.\n\nIn addition, it's important to underline that the role of teachers is to encourage students to analyze and study new ideas. For example, I remember in my high school the support of my favorite teacher, who was trying to teach me how important it is to study deeper into any subject instead of learning facts.\n\nIn conclusion, I want to emphasize again the importance of understanding ideas and concepts because it is the best way to increase our knowledge and our intelligence: that is the real exercise for the human brain."}
{"file_id": "1148250.txt", "output_essay": "Everybody can notice that nowadays the mass media is the most powerful thing that can leave a massive influence on us, especially on teenagers and children. Actually, I agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are, and that is because of two reasons.\n\nThe first reason is that they do all the advertising about something in a wonderful way that shows you it is the best thing for you, and you can't live without it. Then, you discover that all these advertisements are for nothing really worth it. For example, once I watched on TV an advertisement about a straightener for hair to make it straight, so they made it in a way that all the people would think it's really cool and you will have healthy hair. Next, I bought it, and guess what? It was really bad; it destroyed and burned my hair. Another example: my boyfriend was walking in the street and he saw posters about a rain party; you could see from the posters that everything would be included in the ticket, but when he reached there, everything in the poster was a lie.\n\nThe second reason is that there is no sensor for the advertisements, especially on the internet, which makes a lot of companies and shops do whatever they want and laugh at people. Once I met a friend who was really angry, so I asked her what's going on? She told me that she booked an address through the internet and she paid for it, but when she went there to take it, they told her that she had to pay more because she didn't come on the same day.\n\nIn short, we must take care of these kinds of advertisements; also, you have to be sure with who you are dealing. In my opinion, the government should put a sensor on all advertisements in the mass media. At the end, don't forget to watch out and to think in a critical way when you communicate with these stuff."}

But I have to say that it only seems that way. As a twenty-year-old, I'm young, and therefore, I'm part of the young people. From my point of view, I believe there are things about this fact that need to be considered.\n\nAt first, I would like to focus on the fact that young people want to help. They want society to ask for their help; they have the necessity of knowing that they are part of something useful and that society needs them. Young people want society to ask for their help!\n\nAnd that is where I want to arrive: nowadays, society shows an image of young people as if they are lazy, as if they only want to have fun and be with their friends. And at least, as if society doesn't expect any positive reaction from them.\n\nA lot of young people travel abroad to underdeveloped countries to help as volunteers. The fact is, they can be volunteers in their own countries, taking care of people around them, helping in projects of beneficence in their countries,...\n\nBut what happens? Most of the time, their own communities don't ask for their help; they don't know they can help in their own communities and build a better society.\n\nIn conclusion, I can state that society does not encourage young people to help, and that is because young people act in these two ways: they get relaxed because they believe society doesn't expect anything of them; or they travel abroad, to underdeveloped countries where young people believe that they really need their help.\n\nFrom my point of view, and apart from what I have said, there are people who are responsible with their communities and have the necessity and the aim to help in their own community. They also view their community's necessities and want to help and satisfy them as far as they can."}
{"file_id": "1147734.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. Here are the reasons why. First, advertisements tend to overexaggerate the effect of the product. For example, many cosmetics claim in their advertisements that they have special elements that make your skin white within just two weeks or make your face look better. When you see the advertisement, you will be attracted by the slogans or marvel at its magical effect, and you will buy it. There's no solid evidence or medical reports that prove that the product is that useful, but the advertisements often use beautiful models and exaggerated speech to convince you to buy the product.\n\nSecond, the advertisement is a work being thoroughly and specially designed. Through the lighting and computer adjustments, the product can be seen as perfect in the advertisements. Take the shampoo advertisement as an example; the model's hair always looks so shining and smooth in the ads after they use the shampoo. However, the hair is very artificial. There is no way people's hair can be that perfect, but the company that produces the shampoo spends a huge amount of money on the filming to make you believe that their shampoo is really that good.\n\nFinally, the advertisement is often selling a concept of lifestyle, not the product itself. It is not the product that is appealing, but the ideal lifestyle beneath it that attracts you. The product can be bad, but as long as you want to have the lifestyle that the advertisement promotes, you will buy the product. For instance, in a house ad that emphasizes the idea that a single woman can live alone happily, the house itself is not that important. It is the wish to live as a happy single noble that makes you want to buy the house.\n\nTo conclude, the advertisement is a carefully designed work that promotes a concept and often exaggerates the product. Thus, it makes the products seem much better than they really are."}
{"file_id": "1148468.txt", "output_essay": "I disagree with this statement. First, we can approve of this kind of opinion because we often hear about successful people whose success was a response to a new idea. For instance, people who developed the chain-work in the automobile industry used to take a lot of risks. They didn't know if the demand was big enough to develop this kind of mass production, but they chose to take the risk and they were successful. That's why the statement we discuss is not totally wrong, but I think it's not true.\n\nMy point is that I think trying new things and taking risks are two of the key factors to be successful, but they are not characteristics of successful people. There are other factors to run a business well, like good opportunities. Sometimes, you have a real good opportunity and you choose to try, and that's the key to your success. Moreover, there are a lot of successful people who had a good idea at the beginning, but who don't take new risks for years. For instance, Bill Gates is a really successful person, but he doesn't take risks or try new things. He developed the most famous firm in computer engineering, but he didn't try to diversify his activities.\n\nMoreover, a lot of successful people based their success on a very particular field. They choose to become the best in what they do, and they don't want to change their image by trying new activities. So, they don't try new things, they don't take risks, but they are successful because they know exactly how to do well what they do. This is exactly the opposite of the statement we have to discuss. And I don't think it's wrong.\n\nTo conclude, I think that there are not only one way to act when you are successful, and that's why it's really difficult to run a successful business. Every successful business manager is different, and takes different decisions than another manager in the same situation."}

The purpose of the advertisements is to convince people to buy the products in a short time. In the modern world, there are so many messages trying to catch the attention of people that reaching this goal is not easy. The advertisement has to be really effective in order to be read and to drive purchasing behavior. Overstating the functionalities of the product can be a means to reach this goal.\n\nIf we think about some advertisements and the related products, it's easy to find the differences between the picture and the description of the product and the product itself. That means that we are aware of the 'overstating technique' used by the advertisers and that we don't fully believe in the messages that they convey. I never expect the kitchen's cleaning soaps to clean my kitchen as they do in the advertisements! And I never expect the breakfast biscuits to have the perfect shape they are showing on every paper page and during every commercial! We are all used to adopting a certain 'discount ratio' while evaluating the advertisements' messages. The difficult thing for advertisers is to balance reality with overstatement in their advertisements because if the messages are too distant from reality, the risk is losing the client after the first try of the product."}
{"file_id": "1143676.txt", "output_essay": "The issue of whether one should have broad knowledge of many subjects or specialize in one specific subject has aroused heated debates in the modern era. Advocates for the broad knowledge concept say that this approach will help in widening the outlook of the person. Contrary to this approach, some people say that this is the world of specialization and it is very important to be a master in one subject to be successful in life. I personally feel that there should be a balance between the two approaches. I would present the pros and cons of each of the approaches and then illustrate why I emphasize on the balanced approach.\n\nIn today's dynamic world, it is imperative for a person to have a broad knowledge of various academic subjects. This will not only help to acquire a broader perspective but also increase the efficiency in decision-making of a person. Say, for example, a marketing manager of a Fast-Moving Consumer Goods company decides to launch a promotional campaign for a product. The knowledge about the financial issues related to the campaign can be really helpful in the decision-making. If he does not have knowledge about finance, then he can make an expensive plan which can be finally rejected due to the financial constraints of the company. Knowledge about other subjects such as finance, strategy, and human behavior can help the manager in making better-informed decisions. This example clearly shows the importance of having broad knowledge of many academic subjects.\n\nOn the other hand, there is no denial to the fact that this is a highly competitive world. The most prominent successful people today are the ones who are specialists in their respective fields. A very obvious example are the successful doctors. Not only do these doctors have to specialize in fields such as dentistry, pathology, etc., but also they have to acquire higher postgraduate degrees in the specialist fields. Very few people today would prefer going to a general doctor for their medical problems.\n\nI would support a balanced approach as I feel this can make a person a balanced individual who has enough broad perspective to make effective decisions and is a specialist in his own field. If the marketing manager in the above example is a person with broad knowledge about many academic subjects, then he might find it difficult to devise a marketing strategy, which needs core and in-depth study about marketing-related policies. Similarly, if he is just a typical marketing specialist, he may ignore other vital information related to different subjects and end up giving a poor solution. If he takes a balanced approach where he is a specialist in his area but also knows about other subjects, he will make better decisions and will succeed in life."}
{"file_id": "1148681.txt", "output_essay": "Some people think it is not necessary to learn many academic subjects and obtain broad knowledge from them. However, I think it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects. Because we can use our broad knowledge in our real lives.\n\nFirstly, some people think it is not necessary to have broad knowledge. Because they think it is a waste of time and not necessary. Moreover, it is really hard to learn a variety of subjects. For example, in Korea, Korean middle schools force students to learn about 12 subjects. But it became a serious problem in that the education program does not consider students' abilities or interests. So, recent research showed that more than 50% of Korean middle school students are dissatisfied with their academic program and feel it is a waste of time. And, on average, 30 students are going to study abroad every day.\n\nHowever, I think the broad knowledge that we have learned is very valuable in that we can use it someday. For example, I learned Home Economics and Technology in school. At first, I was suspicious about why I had to learn about things that I was not interested in and did not seem valuable. But one day, I had to cook food by myself because my parents were not at home. I couldn't think of anything. And then, I could remember that I learned how to make a Korean traditional food called \"Bulgogi\". So, I could realize the importance of broad knowledge.\n\nOverall, I think it is better to learn various academic subjects and obtain broad knowledge in that it will be helpful for our lives. Even though it is not related to one's personal interest. In my opinion, even though people do not feel the necessity of learning various subjects, it does not mean that they wasted time. It has its meaning that they had tried."}

Indeed, if you have broad knowledge of many academic subjects, you will be more successful in your personal life and in your practical career.\n\nFirst of all, just imagine yourself having a huge variety of knowledge. That, in fact, will make your personal life easier. It will also assist you in facing many problems in your daily life. As we all know, you may face many challenges in your life, and without being broadly knowledgeable, you cannot control all matters.

Now, I can see the huge difference in my mind and in my life.\n\nSecondly, being broadly knowledgeable will make your practical career more successful.

The number of cars is in frequent increase. I do not see, in the future or the next twenty years, that the number of cars will drop. As a machine, the car has proven to be invincible. It is very hard to imagine our lives without cars. Thus, with the increase in the world population and the idea that everybody needs a car, then I do not see that in the next twenty years there would be a drop in the number of cars.\n\nCar pollution is a subject being discussed everywhere in the world. It is very essential to decrease the number of cars on the streets. This will eventually make the flow of cars in the streets smoother and easier.

Now, there is a heated concern over whether the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide. Some people think that traveling in a group led by a tour guide is the best choice. From their point of view, the guide will give you a plan and arrange your traveling route. Well, this might be good if the place you want to go is in the tour guide's plan. However, as far as I am concerned, traveling in a group led by a tour guide is not the best choice. I prefer traveling alone.\n\nFirst and foremost, traveling by oneself can do whatever one wants to. You can go on the internet, search for the place you admire, learn more about it, and find the way to get there. The next thing is to find some time, pick up your bag, take some food, and go directly to the place you want. You do not need to go to places you are not interested in or have already been to.\n\nEqually important is that the time for traveling by oneself is flexible. You can travel at any time in any season. If you appreciate some places of interest, you can just stay a little longer and look around more. It does not matter what others think. While in a group, you have to respect the opinions of others.\n\nIn the end, another point that we should not forget is that some tour guides will take travelers to places they do not want to visit. Guides may take travelers to some local markets where the prices are very high, and the goods are inferior.\n\nAll in all, I disagree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide. Traveling by oneself will be much happier."}

I disagree with the given statement that 'in twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today'.\n\nIn the olden days, man used to travel from place to place by walking. The invention of the wheel changed the evolution greatly. After the invention of the wheel, man introduced many new vehicles for transportation. He initially used bullock carts and tongas, which were pulled by animals. Later, he introduced bicycles, which served him in traveling. Later, he introduced motorcycles in order to reach quickly with less effort. In this process, man thought of a luxurious way of traveling and started to introduce vehicles run by fuel. He designed some of them for the transportation of goods and some for humans, such as trucks and buses, respectively.\n\nAnd he later thought about luxury and privacy, then brought cars. Cars were luxurious means of transportation in the earlier days, but it is a compulsory now. This change had occurred because of globalization and necessities. In the initial stages, there were very few cars, and people used to see them very interestingly. But nowadays, in developed countries, many are having more than one car.\n\nThe main problem with cars is that they create a lot of traffic problems and also pollution. For this reason, many governments are trying to decrease cars by demanding more tax and parking amounts. But people are ready to pay that because they are very much addicted to it. The question is that there will be fewer cars within 20 years than now, but I think it will not happen. The people possessing cars will not throw them out.\n\nThere will be many technologies that will come, which will reduce pollution. Already, some are using cars run by solar power. The other reason is that the population is increasing day by day.\n\nAnd I conclude from the above reasons that after twenty years, the number of cars will not decrease; instead, it will go on increasing."}

These were full of advertisements, actually. There was so much car information in the magazine that it was next to impossible to select three or four candidates. One day, after I managed to do so, I went to the car dealer in person to see one of the cars itself. At the sight of the car itself, I was a little confused because the car didn't look as good as it did in the magazine.\n\nSecondly, when I made uniforms for the baseball team in my company, I again checked the catalogue in depth. In the catalogue, almost every uniform design looked cool, but when we ordered one type from the catalogue and finally saw the real uniforms, we were a little disappointed to see the difference between the ones in the catalogue and the real ones.\n\nFurthermore, I have made a company recruiting website for college/university students. This was like an advertisement of our company, our workplaces. We tried hard so that our company would seem excellent. Of course, we didn't make false statements or images using pictures and CGs. But what we tried to do was to collect the best pictures of our company and workplaces. So, in this sense, our company's website should have been the very best image of our company.\n\nIn conclusion, for the reasons stated above, I totally agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. On the other hand, I seem to have to learn that products in the advertisement are not as good as they really are when I do the shopping."}
{"file_id": "1150906.txt", "output_essay": "Although some people, perhaps marketing majors, may argue that a product consists of both its physical form and the good advertisements that present it, even if they are not entirely correct, I do not agree with this view at all.\n\nIn my opinion, a product must be judged as good and, of course, bought according to its quality, and advertisements should be based on the quality of the product and should not make the product seem better than it really is.\n\nThe main concern of this marketing habit is that low-quality products are actually invading the market, and consumers cannot distinguish between a good item and an item that is only well presented. Furthermore, in spite of its low quality, a product of the latter kind is often much more expensive.\n\nAs an example, we can take Timberland shoes. In my country, I see a lot of people buying them only because they have been influenced by the advertisements. Moreover, the shoes with that brand cost nearly three times the price of a high-quality pair of shoes you can usually find in a shop; the difference between the two is the misleading advertisements. However, I do not mean that Timberland shoes are a low-quality product, but, of course, the sole difference between these and the ones that are not presented in the same way is the price.\n\nI could also have brought more meaningful examples, but the problem would remain the same: we should care more about quality and the quality-price ratio."}
{"file_id": "1149147.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with the fact that if you want to be successful, you have to take risks sometimes. I want to stress that it does depend on the individual's situation.\n\nFor example, if a creative director of an advertising agency has had lots of success with using one certain method in creating an ad, it is smart to stick with that method. At some point, as time changes, people's interests change, and the creative director needs to consider a different method in creating an ad. If the director won't consider doing so, he might lose his clients. This is when I would say that it is important to take a risk and do something different with your ad.\n\nBased on my own experiences, I have to say that I had more success with taking risks at times. For example, I have a great passion for the arts, and therefore, I have taken quite a few drawing and painting classes in the past. At some point, one of my teachers graded me down on one of my projects because apparently, I always used the same method in drawing, and I never tried something new.\n\nThis is when I decided to try pastel paint instead of the good old charcoal. My teacher was impressed by the color composition, which was a change from just black and white drawings. My teacher gave me a better grade, not necessarily because the picture was better than my other pictures, but rather because of the fact that I was able to deal with something new, such as pastel.\n\nTrying new things gives you exposure to different perspectives, which makes you a more open person to new things. If you constantly stick with the same old thing, you show a lack of flexibility. It also shows that you can only be successful in the same area.\n\nIf you try and practice different things, it gives you the opportunity to show more expertise in different areas. If you don't take the risk of trying something new, you never know whether you could be more successful or not."}

The communities can prosper only when everyone gets along and makes the community better in many ways. These may be due to various reasons.\n\nOne reason is that today, people have become so busy that they hardly have time to spend with their communities. They are so preoccupied with other matters that they don't give much preference to what's going on in the community. They hardly have enough time to spend with the community, let alone help it.\n\nBecause of their complex lifestyles, people generally prefer to have time to spend on other interesting things rather than going to the community and helping others. Even though it is important to help communities, one cannot be forced into taking up the cause. People cannot be forced into doing community services without their willingness. The people who do not do community service do not know what it is all about and imagine it as one of the boring things in life.\n\nAnother thing that takes people away from helping communities is their hectic schedule. People usually work on weekdays and want to relax during the weekends. They consider helping service as a job, which makes them think whether they should get involved or relax and get ready for the next week.\n\nDue to their poor knowledge regarding what is meant by 'helping their community,' it is also a big factor that forces people away from participating in community service. People should be made aware of the effects that helping can make on society; it is for their betterment that this type of service is being conducted. The people are more concerned about themselves and do not give much attention to the happenings in society. For example, lack of awareness means people don't even know what's going on in their surroundings.\n\nTo conclude, people are getting away from their duties. They tend to forget their responsibilities towards the community, which indeed is a larger family. Helping the community will only give satisfaction that he or she has contributed to society in one way or another. Thus, people should try and make some time for helping others in the community, which can only make the community better to live in."}

These young people are a good choice, because they use part of their time or their holiday time to bring help to those in need.\n\nMore young people help their communities with voluntary work at the Red Cross or 118, while others work at an oratory, summer center, help center for children with problems, or care homes for handicapped or elderly people.\n\nI know many friends who spend their time on this kind of work, enjoying the company of like-minded people. These young people are a hope for those in need, and they can bring a smile. They spend their time with people who need it, and that's enough.\n\nI agree with this choice made by these young people, because I use my holidays to help children with problems, not in Italy, but in other countries, where help is needed. I prefer working with children because they are fantastic, and I learn more from them.\n\nBut I don't agree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities, because, as always, there are those who help others or their communities, and those who prefer to spend their time in other ways.\n\nAs in all things, there is good and bad.

I believe that trying new things can help you in thinking and using your mind, and that can be the start of creating new things. When you try new things, you can feel excited, not like when you do routine things, which give you the feeling that you are like a machine.\n\nSometimes, starting to do something without experience of it makes you think a lot before doing it. That is a normal way of thinking, but as a person with a mind to think about it, you should do the right balance about starting new things or using a usual method. Really, it is difficult, or let me say it depends on the situation. If I am trying new things that do not affect health, and there is no danger in doing it, why not? Specially, if it can help me in discovering new things and using my mind to think about the best way. One of the most important points is that if everyone does the same thing that has already been done in any field, who can discover new methods or ways in work or life practice? So, successful people are always taking risks, which may help in discovering or improving their life.\n\nLife is like school; you should learn from it, and how you learn is by trying by yourself. You should always keep in mind that there are no limits to knowledge, and the way to learn is by doing and making mistakes. Be sure that when you make a mistake or go through the risk of a new trial, whatever it is, you should learn something, even if you did not know it at the same time. You may get the benefit later. In conclusion, I believe that trying new things could help in making you a creative person, and it can be the best way to learn in your life.\n\nWithout trying new things, I think we destroy the future and control knowledge, which will be the major reason for stopping our future life."}
{"file_id": "1149918.txt", "output_essay": "Advertisement is the product of highly sophisticated marketing techniques combined with knowledge of human psychology. Knowing how to advertise under these references makes it easy for companies to sell products that look very appealing but, in actual fact, are not worth their money. Throughout the history of industries, stores, and products, there have been unthinkable numbers of faulty and bad products that have consumed the markets and their customers in a raid.\n\nFor the famous company Apple, who have produced and advertised an array of incredible products, there have been some along the way that were purely insignificant in contrast to their price. The first release of their iPod was one of these products. When the iPod was primarily released, the sales numbers hit a continuous high that has not ended till today, but these 'first-year' iPods were full of technical errors. The iPod batteries (concealed inside the iPod) broke after two weeks and lasted for an hour when they were maximum charged. Since the iPod is one of the highest-produced gadgets in the world, this problem occurred with every iPod within a few weeks of its purchase.\n\nSecond, the iPod headphones that came with it blew out after listening to music at maximum volume on your own iPod. This was a big issue, since it showed that the headphones were not designed accordingly. Although all of these faults were known, the iPod sales did not decrease because it was the most prestigious gadget to own at the time. The design and marketing strategies led by Steve Jobs (Apple's CEO) have influenced such immense groups of customers, from all ages to all places, that the sales did not decrease. The fantastic and sleek design contributed to this. The iPod was three to four hundred dollars at the time, and compared to other MP3 players that were less expensive, it was not of higher standards and therefore not worth the money.\n\nThe marketing strategies that evolve around the advertisements of new products exceed the basic knowledge we have about a product and make it look of higher standards than it is. The products are therefore sold at prices that they are not worthy of, and therefore corrupt the average customer's payments. It is unfair, but at the same time, the customer's fault for not researching the products enough before they purchase them."}
{"file_id": "1156395.txt", "output_essay": "I totally agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. I have two specific reasons. First, it attracts people through their desires, and finally, they want a product, which makes people go out and buy them. Of course, it's the most important thing for a company as a process of business; they must need to make more profit. So, they should be able to do their best to ornament the product in the advertisement. Generally, it has many problems for the following reasons. Almost all advertisements on TV, in magazines, and so on, are designed to introduce a product to consumers, but they only show the bright side of it. Furthermore, according to those ads, every product doesn't have any drawbacks and is definitely perfect. However, it's not real, and that's why many advertisements are a problem. The biggest problem is that many people who see the advertisements believe them. It makes people spend their money to buy them. In my case, when I saw an ad for a cell phone and bought it, I realized it didn't need to be better. In this sense, I agree with the statement."}
{"file_id": "1150823.txt", "output_essay": "I completely agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. There are mainly three reasons for my opinion. First, the advertisement agencies over-publicize a product. This is particularly done in the case of the launch of a new product in a market. Since no one has ever consumed the product, the companies have an added advantage of referring to their product as the best in the market, without the need for any facts to prove it. It is after the product launch that consumers read reviews about the new product and realize its exact worth.\n\nAnother reason is that most advertisements include creative ideas, which entice various fantasies in consumers. The consumers start to believe that they might come true if they started consuming that product. Sheer curiosity of the consumer for that product forces him to buy and consume it. It is shortly after that the consumer realizes that he is not in any supernatural state, which he thought to be in while consuming that product. This results in a loss of trust of consumers in the brand.\n\nThird, nowadays there is an increasing participation of renowned personalities in advertisements for various products. For example, a new range of Nike sport shoes is being endorsed by a leading soccer player, or a complete range of clothes being supported by a famous celebrity. As these famous personalities have a very large fan base over the world, it leads to the incorporation of blind trust in these brands by their followers. Who want to be like their on-screen idols in their lives. People do not even search for reviews on these products or at least consider the use of these products in their lives.\n\nAdvertisements should display appropriate contents in them, so that the consumer is not mis-guided by their curiosity. Products should consider this, so that it may not result in losing their brand name."}
{"file_id": "1152713.txt", "output_essay": "Today, we live in a world where everything is fast and in motion. To attract the consumer's attention, often the advertisement made by the producer or a company is better than the product itself. I totally agree with this statement because we can have examples of it every day; it is sufficient to go to a supermarket and take a tour to see that it is full of similar products, and the only difference between one and another is made by its advertisement.\n\nAnother example can be taken from television: there are a lot of advertisements made only to catch the consumer's attention. There are a lot of ways to catch the consumer's attention: some products, and obviously their advertisements, look to the history of the company who made it, like a 'design' object, while others tend to be new and innovative.\n\nI think that an advertisement should show the real potential of a product, without exaggerations, in order to prevent unhappy cases of recriminations and also a bad reputation. The failure of a product must not be a stimulus to create false advertising in order to sell it: it must be a motivation to improve it. Because now, for the most part of our life, is in motion, advertisement has begun to be greater and greater. When we are stuck in city traffic, big advertisements try to catch our attention with provocations and funny phrases. But not every time what is shown is as good as its advertisement.\n\nIn conclusion, I think that whoever makes an advertisement should be sure of what they want to sell and what is the real potential of the product."}
{"file_id": "1152615.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with the statement that most advertisements show more facts about the products than they really have and make it much easier to be sold.\n\nThis phenomenon is shown almost all over the world, and I think it is reasonable to be accepted.\n\nThe first reason is that the advertisement is meant to show the good effects of the products and appeal to people to buy them. It is the use of advertising. People who make advertisements always study the merchandise carefully and make it more useful and more worthwhile to buy. They, of course, will show a lot of unconvincing facts to be convinced. Just even a piece of paper can be described to have the capability to make users more healthy than using other kinds of papers. You may think it is ridiculous, but advertisements often make those problems.\n\nSecond, the company paying for the advertisement is focused on the profits of it. The company does this just because it wants to increase its sales and make more money back. Input and output are the first things to a company. So, the management people want to make the products more attractive to the market. And the advertisement will be as good as it could be. No concern about the facts. There are many illegal advertisements in China that mislead people and make terrible effects on society.\n\nThe last reason is that sometimes people are like to see some amazing things in the advertisement, though they do not believe it. For example, a woman who is not so fit may want to see some medicines that can help people lose weight. And she may dream that she could be as beautiful as the figure shown in the advertisement. She does not want a real product, but just a dream.\n\nSo, the advertisement often seems much better than it really is and acceptable to society."}
{"file_id": "1152202.txt", "output_essay": "Advertisements often tease the prospective customer with the newest, most advanced, and simply coolest goods or services. To be unique in a diverse market environment, it is literally inevitable to cheat the buyer.\n\nAdvertisements have to have a short and strong message. Due to this briefness, it is impossible to present the product in an appropriate and honest way. Consumers who bought a product that was advertised as reliable or easy to use often are unsatisfied with what they finally hold in their hands. But who is to blame? Of course, the companies are presenting the products in the best possible way; that's what I would do too. On the other hand, we, the customers, do not want to hear lengthy advertisements in which products are explained in detail.\n\nThe phenomenon of wrongly advertised products is not a new one. In my opinion, people should be clever enough to know that companies say whatever it takes to sell a product.\n\nFor example, when a cellphone is advertised, the commercial could say: The best cellphone ever built. This statement, of course, cannot be proved by anyone. Therefore, we have an exaggeration and probably even a false statement.\n\nAnother example is food and drinks. How can a commercial seriously say: The most delicious burger ever? A customer who buys and tries it ultimately has the expectation of a great burger. But what if he doesn't like it? This means the advertisement industry is neither able to shape our taste nor to advertise products in a proper way.\n\nSo far, I have been describing the black sheep among the advertising companies. Nonetheless, there are companies who present their products honestly without exaggerations or even lies. Especially when comparisons are made, the customer can be sure to watch a good advertisement.\n\nIn the end, it's all up to the prospective customer whether a commercial is believed or not."}
{"file_id": "1152681.txt", "output_essay": "I completely agree with the idea that successful people are those who are more curious than others to do and learn new things. People who are still and do not feel the need to keep improving their abilities and are not ready to change and adapt to different situations and environments will hardly become important. For instance, people who think that they can keep living in today's world without \n\nSuccessful people in everyday life are those who are innovative, take risks, and as soon as they have learned something, they are already oriented to another thing.\n\nCapable managers in the field of industry consider research and development as a priority activity and a tremendous key factor in order to make a business successful. Let's consider a very typical Italian example, a person who reached a lot of success in his life: Silvio Berlusconi. He started his career in the real estate, constructing and selling residential buildings; even though this market was successful, he invested his first money buying a small television network. Year after year, this business grew, and he managed to buy other networks in Italy and in other countries as well. It was still not enough. With the money he gained from this business, he bought a football team that was completely unknown, AC Milan. He became president, and in 15 years of presidency, he made it one of the most popular teams in the world. But he did not stop even at this point! He started getting interested in politics, and in 1994, he became the Italian prime minister.\n\nI think that this is one of the best examples to understand how curiosity, capabilities, and inclination to try new things can make someone very successful."}
{"file_id": "1147775.txt", "output_essay": "A world with fewer cars! Sounds preposterous now. But I think this is going to be a reality in twenty years from today. There are various reasons why I hold this opinion. These include population growth, fuel crisis, and popular consciousness about the environment.\n\nThe population of the world is only growing by the day. Naturally, we would expect more cars to roll on the roads. But we do not realize that land is not growing in proportion to people. With limited land, there will come a time when we will not be able to find more space for our cars. Then the recourse is a mass rapid transport system, which discourages car use. This has already been seen in Delhi, India's capital city, where the Delhi Metro Rail system has been created to deal with the stress that the increasing vehicular population was creating. Now, we see that the number of cars has indeed come down on the roads because people find it more convenient to take a train to office at a negligible price rather than maintain their own car.\n\nAnother reason why the number of cars might go down is the shortage of fuel. The oil crisis is here for real. It is becoming increasingly difficult to satisfy the energy needs of the world. Very soon, the prices of oil are going to increase very highly. Early signs can already be seen. In such a case, running a car can be very expensive. Research on alternative fuels, like biofuels or solar power, is still in its nascent stage. Thus, it will be very difficult for the common man to buy fuel for his car. In India, the price of petrol has been increasing steadily, and my family now goes out in a car only when it is really necessary or when all four of us have to go out together. Otherwise, we use bikes or, simply, the public transport system.\n\nThe last reason why I think that cars are going to be fewer is popular sentiment against environmental pollution. Cars use fuel, which increases environmental pollution. Therefore, some countries, like those in the Nordic region, encourage their citizens to use bicycles, which are more eco-friendly. They are also a healthier option in comparison to cars as they keep the rider fit. Thus, conscious citizens support such ideas. This trend seems to be catching up, which makes me believe that it will, in the future, become very popular. In that case, the prospects for cars look bleak.\n\nTo conclude, I believe that cars are going to become rarer in the years to come because of a variety of factors. These include the shortage of two resources: land and oil. These are going to be scarce because of the growing population, in which case cars will not be viable. Finally, when people become more eco-friendly, they would look for options other than cars, which will affect the prospects of these automobiles."}
{"file_id": "1153733.txt", "output_essay": "Some people might say that learning lots of facts is more important than understanding ideas and concepts. However, I think understanding ideas and concepts are more essential. There are two major reasons: to be confident and to be logical.\n\nTo begin with, students can gain confidence through understanding ideas and concepts. You might say that learning many things can make people more confident. However, you may not deny that without understanding them, nobody can use them confidently. Moreover, facts are usually so common. By contrast, although ideas and concepts are not perfect, people can gain deeper knowledge by following the idea and concept. As society is getting more complex, the competition is getting fiercer. Therefore, the meaning of education has changed. It was to know many facts; now it is to understand whole ideas and concepts.\n\nMoreover, as far as thinking logically is concerned, understanding ideas and concepts are more important. I took a history class when I was a freshman. I learned many important facts in the class and I got a great score on it. However, I forgot most of them immediately after the final exam. In comparison, when I took a physics class, although it was challenging to me to understand the idea and concept, but through that process I could learn the way of thinking logically. This logical approach helped me to get better grades in other courses, too.\n\nIn summary, to understand ideas and concepts is necessary for students to gain confidence and a way of logical thinking."}
{"file_id": "1151827.txt", "output_essay": "Although many people tend to avoid trying new things and taking risks, I oppose that attitude because, to me, it seems boring to always do the same. \n\nOn the one hand, if you take risks, there is always the danger of failing. Depending on how great the risk is, you may lose nearly everything you possess. Admittedly, this is an even harder decision if you are responsible for a family. I remember a time in my childhood when my father thought of expanding his local drug store. Certainly, it had been a great chance, but after several sleepless nights, he decided not to take the risk due to his concern about his family. \n\nIn addition, trying something new always comes with a lot of hard work. Why should you do it if you can hold your status with a job you know how to do well? \n\nIn my opinion, you do it because you will get rewarded if you try something new. I find that trying out new things is fun and interesting. In other words, when I try something new, I have the wonderful chance to broaden my horizons. If you never give it a try, you will never experience if there is something you would like better. I, for example, invested all my money during my studies to open a small copy shop for co-eds. What I received back from this little business was not only the money to finance my studies but also the invaluable experience of applying my theoretical knowledge from university to the real business world. This helped me a lot to succeed. \n\nIn a nutshell, I agree that it is more comfortable to do only the things you know well. However, risking something improves our experience and provokes innovation, the latter being one of the key factors that drive our economy."}

It is really important to understand everything about the subject, which helps to earn time to study for all subjects.\n\nA clear example I had was in Chemistry, a class in which you have to understand what the teacher is explaining because it has some exercises that even if you study, you can't figure out easily. So, every time I did not understand, I asked my teacher. And I successfully got a good grade.\n\nMany times, students are too shy and are afraid to ask somebody to help them in a different subject, or even the teacher doesn't like to help students. So, we as students need to have a positive mind and fight for what we want, doing our best at school and being obedient by following directions.\n\nAnother example I have is that I am really proud of my sister; she is really smart. In her tests, she always got good grades, and I asked her if she could give me some clues. The answer I received from her was that I have to understand what I am reading or studying, so I try to understand. Now, I am successful in my subjects and in my own life.\n\nFinally, I can encourage all students to have a positive mind and put their hearts in God; He is the only person we can trust."}

A community is a group of people living in a place with similar customs, and helping each other in need.\n\nEven though you may be busy with your work, studies, or something else, as a member of your community, you need to help in the development of your community. But the present youth are not helping their community; rather, they are wasting their time by spending time in internet cafes, watching movies, or roaming around the city. They could help their community by doing some volunteer work.\n\nMainly, the youth are getting distracted into unnecessary things, like wasting time on browsing, chatting rubbish with somebody. What the youth think is enjoyment, for that they are drinking in the pubs, spending the whole evening in the pubs or roads. Rather, they could do something in the evening or at any time when they are free, by participating in programmes which were planned for community development.\n\nIn addition, they don't listen to their parents about their involvement in the development of their community.\n\nOn the whole, I can conclude one main thing: as a part of your community, youth should help their community by spending some daily time doing something which is useful to their community."}

For me, it is clear that people have to take risks in order to achieve their goals, especially if they start a new business. Pushing one's own company to success is not just related to hard work, but also with the ability to take risks. Going new ways has many advantages. For instance, the company has less competition. In addition, customers are usually open to new ideas and products. Thus, going a new way in combination with hard work could lead to the desired goal.\n\nMoreover, one can imagine an entrepreneur who is willing to achieve success in a business just by hard work and an old idea. It is clear that he will stand against huge competition. On the other hand, if the person is employed, it could be more efficient to just concentrate on the things which he can do well and what is required in his position. In fact, people who concentrate on their abilities and push them further are more likely to become promoted than employees who are often trying new things. However, since promotion is not the most important thing in an employee's life, I disagree with the above-mentioned statement.\n\nIn addition, people who want to get into power, even in a multinational company, would do better if they learn the structure of the company well, instead of creating it anew.\n\nIn summary, it could be said that success is different for different people. Nevertheless, to be successful, people have to be aware of many aspects. In addition, they must have a variety of abilities, but for each business, there are other rules."}
{"file_id": "1156164.txt", "output_essay": "First of all, I agree with the statement that 'The best way to travel is in a group led by a few guides.'\n\nMy first reason is that, as we go to a new place, we may not know how the place will be, how the behavior of the people will be, what their culture is, what their customs are, what their tradition is, etc. If we go to some American countries, we may find some difficulty understanding their language, and also, we cannot understand their accent, even though they speak English. For example, suppose you planned to go to France. The language the people speak there is French. You may not understand French. Here, you need a guide.\n\nMy second reason is that, if the place you planned to tour is a historic place without a guide, you will finally end up with the rocky structures you saw there. As each historic place has a history behind it, the main purpose of visiting is to know its history. As we are not familiar with the place and its history, a guide is the right person to explain it. For example, take an instance of visiting Mahabalipuram, a famous historic site in India. It's all filled with temples made of rock, carvings on stone, etc. We need a guide to explain what the rocky structures are.\n\nAnd lastly, the important thing is fulfilling the purpose for which we have spent the money. Let's suppose you have planned an Europe tour. But you did not have a proper person with you to explain what the purpose of visiting is, not knowing anything."}

Then, we will give the excuse to the young that they are not doing like the parents used to do for their communities, and I agree that they do not.\n\nFirst, the society has changed as there is no plenty of time like the old generation had. For example, the traffic and communication nowadays require more time and effort to go from place to place than in the past with the parents. So, the young man does not have the time to finish his own needs and does not have the time to care for others. Also, if we are taking into account the same point of communication, it has become more expensive to go from one place to another, and the young do not have enough money to go and help in other places.\n\nSecond, young people have a lot of kinds of entertainment in life more than the last generation had. For example, young people have a lot of movies they can go to watch, and there are a lot of places they can go with their friends. So, in their free time, they will prefer to go for dinner or movies instead of going to help in community fields like their parents did.\n\nThird, I think that the system of education is also responsible for this case, as they did not teach the youth in schools the meaning and loving to help others in the community and how to be a member. So, when they grow and graduate, they do not try to help as they did not learn how to do.\n\nAnd to sum up, with all the statements suggested above, I think that we are all responsible for this case of the youth. The parents in the house did not teach them how to love their community and how to help it, and also the school, the media - we are all responsible. If we did not care for this problem, we will not gain in the future the good results we all aim from those young people."}

People, such as old persons or young persons, work together to make great nations and provide a good life.\n\nIn my opinion, I don't agree with the following statement: 'Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.' Because the most important role in creating any powerful nation is its young people. Because they have powerful and young minds to keep developing it. A nation that gives a hand and support to its young people is found to be proud of its achievements. Young people participate in different sides of the community. They work in teaching, engineering, medicine, and handicrafts to provide a good environment for raising new generations of young people. These new generations will continue carrying the future of the nation and its development. As we see today, in Lebanon, where the war is killing all people and destroying buildings. Young people stand there to help their nation in hospitals and in places where war arrives. And to share with them their pain and fear. While other young people are standing to defend their lands from this war and its results. Young people give their lives for the community, and the nation should be the examples and the leaders for all young people around the world.\n\nFinally, nations and communities are measured by their young people and their achievements. More powerful young people, more powerful nation - it is an easy equation with just two variables. And the young people who are raised on old people's hands continue to carry the message for all generations to come after."}

Since good education is becoming more and more accessible, universities and companies now require an even higher level of education. In my opinion, that is why some people now work harder than before.\n\nOn the other hand, the invention of computers, video games, and all the other different accessories have made the young people of today much busier.\n\nThese reasons are why I agree with this statement in most cases.

I also think that these young people are not to blame; modern society is.\n\nIf I talk about my personal experience, I can say that I do not give enough time to helping my community. One of the reasons why I do not is that nobody encourages me to do it. People around me are becoming less and less aware of the problems in their communities and are becoming more selfish.\n\nI think it is also important to say that it is not 100% true that all young people do not give enough time to helping their communities.

Indeed, any fact can't be known only by learning. It is no secret that it is better to do something at once than to look at something ten times. It is also true that it is easily mine.

Because ideas and concepts are fundamental values. They must know these values so that they can apply them in various settings. The values help students to extend their knowledge and skills too.\n\nI am a nursing major. When I was a practitioner, I focused on learning facts. In this situation, the word 'facts' means some daily routine activities, such as the way to clean wounds or the skill of checking blood samples, etc. But since medical technology is improving and most of the things are done easily with some equipment, I don't use these techniques these days. But we still use our knowledge to analyze the data. Ideas and concepts last long.\n\nThen, if I have an understanding of the concept, I can apply the idea to different situations. If I understand the theory that cultural background affects people's behavior, I can understand how to care for a foreign patient. If students have enough knowledge about the fundamentals of the area, they can apply it to other situations. It will help them to solve problems they would face.\n\nMoreover, fundamental knowledge helps students to extend their study. If a student wishes to study in a postgraduate course, the basic knowledge of the related theories is required. If I had learned only daily routines in one ward of one hospital and neglected to study the concept or ideas, I couldn't continue my study for a master's degree.\n\nTherefore, I support the opinion that students should make a higher priority to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts. They are basic values that last long, can be applied to different scenes, and can be used for brushing up the level of study for students."}
{"file_id": "1154048.txt", "output_essay": "I don't really agree with this statement that 'most advertisements make products much better than they really are.' Because it always happens in the other way, that they will not be much better than they really are or they really seem to be. Here comes the difference: they will advertise the product by showing its good qualities and the way it works, and so on, but they will not show its defects; they will not count on those. Perhaps they seem much better when they advertise them, and they will convince us to buy it; it's after that, all happens, that we will come to know about the actual performance of it, which is really worse.\n\nBut sometimes it happens that the products seem much better than they really are, but note it, sometimes only; it's just very rare. I will give you a live example, which has been experienced by me in the past. Once I bought a video-CD player, convinced by the product's advertisement, in which it was shown all its good qualities and said it performs better than the remaining ones in the market. So I bought it, thinking that it will be a better option to buy the product of that company. But I was completely wrong in my choice, because it was always subject to repairs and it was not working properly. I went wrong in selecting, by seeing the advertisement.\n\nAnother example is an experience of my friend with a cosmetic product, which promises to glow your skin; bought it by seeing the advertisement and thinking it will make her skin glow, instead it left itching of the skin and an allergy of skin. So, I strongly stick to my opinion that they are not as much better as they seem to be. I conclude by saying that I disagree with the statement."}
{"file_id": "1152153.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with the statement 'successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do.'\n\nThe reason I agree is because I think you cannot make success if they did what they already know how to do. If you know how to do it, then other people would know as well.\n\nYou try new things, and that gives us the impact; maybe this is the way to be successful.\n\nHowever, I do not think you can succeed by randomly making new ideas. You do need to search for them, you need reason and proof to come up with the idea. Also, you may need some help from other people who have been through and experienced it.\n\nFor example, the president of the clothes shop called UNIQLO. I think it is one of the most famous clothes shops in Japan nowadays. He made so many new projects, and he actually tried. But failed so many times too. He presented to us mass producing. First of all, they started to make simple designed clothes and sold them with very cheap prices. Before UNIQLO did this way of selling clothes, everyone would have thought it was not a very good idea of producing so many same designed, cheap, simple clothes. Because they thought that customers want to buy something more individual and good quality.\n\nHowever, UNIQLO succeeded by selling products this way. But I have also seen them failing quite badly, that was when they started to selling vegetables and fries at the shop. It was a very big impact on us too, like the last time. What kind of clothes shop sells vegetables at the shop? But it did not make a successful ending. They stopped selling it after a few months. It made such a loss for the company. But the president of UNIQLO still does not stop producing new ideas and projects. That is why the company is still growing and making a lot of money.\n\nI have come to the conclusion that I think even other people think you will not succeed with it and stop you, they can be wrong sometimes. You might fail a lot of times before you actually become a successful person. But that is the way to success, so you should not be afraid; you need to take risks and try."}

The successful people try new things, starting with established knowledge and beliefs. In order to be considered successful, one needs to practice beyond what is perceived as ordinary and common. By experimenting with new things based on common knowledge and beliefs, one can be able to find new ways to reach or meet what is demanding beyond the common practice.\n\nThe successful people also do not fear taking risks. They are further braver than ordinary people. They try new things that enable them to find a solution that others have not yet found by doing things in common ways.\n\nTo be considered successful, one needs to have a creative perspective and an exceptional mindset in viewing a society. Such a character can only be built by trying new things, despite making errors and taking risks. Without adventuring risks and trials, one is only considered to be ordinary and common."}
{"file_id": "1156452.txt", "output_essay": "It is very hard to understand many facts if they are not related by ideas, concepts, and examples. I think both attach to each other because without the facts, there are no ideas. For example, in the context of war, why does it not stop? It has been since the old century that we have had war, and everyone knows the bad results of war: hunger, poverty, too many people going away, frustration, people with psychological problems, kids who lost their parents, and families who lost their own homes.\n\nBut, in my opinion, students understand all the ideas and concepts in the history of all wars throughout history. However, if they can learn from the facts, this will not happen again.\n\nAnother example, more relatable, is when a teacher explains a psychological problem in class. If he simply states the fact that people still have psychological problems, every student will wonder why. When he explains that many people who have emotional hunger (their mother did not really offer much love to their kids) and did not teach their kids the right and wrong, these people love to still not because they need it, but sometimes to satisfy their emotional needs.\n\nIn a business class, when the professor says, 'The customers are always right.' When he continues explaining his idea, we understand what he means: a business without customers does not work. It does not matter what the company thinks, but the customers who consume this product.\n\nFor example, when the customer is treated well, he will be your door to another customer (friends, neighbors, cousins, family...). But if he is not satisfied, he will tell everyone, and it will be a very bad reputation. Everywhere, not only in class but also at home with our kids and family, I think it is hard to learn facts if there are no ideas and concepts to understand."}

Albert Einstein quotes, 'Try to be a man of value and not a man of success.' Success follows people who are innovative in their ideas and are expressive in presenting them freely. Albert Einstein never set out to come up with the 'Theory of Relativity.' It was his desire to explore and question every aspect of everyday life, which brought him the fame of being the inventor of the 'Theory of Relativity.' \n\nConstant change is human nature. And the people who bring about this change in an evident manner are the ones who are ready to think out-of-the-box. Centuries ago, everything was done on paper, from stories to accounts, medicine to religion, etc. Today, everything is written on tape drives and stored electronically. Thanks to mankind, who was constantly looking for options to change. We went from pen to typewriter and then to computer and to supercomputers today. The numerous inventions made in every field of life are all because someone somewhere was thinking beyond the ways they knew how to do well. It was the quest to do things better and add value to what is being done today, which led to new discoveries.\n\nTake, for example, Bill Gates, who is successful today because he started Microsoft, a Windows operating system that sits in almost every household today. His desire to do something new brought him this fame. And his quest to constantly bring about change to the world is keeping his success intact.\n\nIn summary, it is seen all around that people who have taken the risk to do something new are the ones who have got success and fame."}
{"file_id": "1155387.txt", "output_essay": "In our studies, we often have the choice between learning many academic subjects and specializing in one in particular. It can be quite a dilemma. In my opinion, specializing, at least by the end of our studies, is more interesting. I will explain the advantages and disadvantages of each solution and express my feelings.\n\nBroad knowledge of academic subjects is appealing at first. You don't have to make a choice between the themes you like, and learning from one can improve our understanding of another. For instance, learning about the lives of species in biology class can help in ecology class. Switching between subjects often also helps in not getting bored. On the contrary, you don't have enough time for each class, and that can be really frustrating to learn only the basics in the one you enjoy the most.\n\nThe other choice that is offered to us is specializing. The great thing about it is learning more and more information about a subject you like (or at least you should like) and getting more and more confident about it. Furthermore, you make fewer mistakes. The major drawback is that when you need knowledge (even basic) on other academic subjects, you don't have them, and probably don't have the time to learn them, and need to ask for help. This will result in a huge loss of time. Another negative aspect about specializing is that sometimes you are too concentrated on your subject, and you can't see by yourself the mistakes you are making.\n\nFinally, I prefer to specialize in a topic rather than to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects. The main reason is that you can be good in a topic only if you practice often, and I don't mind asking for help if I need knowledge about another subject in order to fulfill my work. Moreover, in order to begin in professional life, you need to be good at least in one thing."}
{"file_id": "1156687.txt", "output_essay": "I do agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. The people who develop an advertisement usually try to communicate a certain message that is supposed to make the product attractive to the customer. Everything that does not comply with this message is simply left out. Most of the time, the producers don't care about being truthful in that matter. Let's take cigarettes as an example. If the producers want to make cigarettes attractive to the customer, they will not talk about all the negative side effects, but instead, they will focus on the advantages. They simply keep important information to themselves, even though it might hurt the person who is going to buy the cigarettes. This way, the customer will be blinded by the positive attitude of the advertisement and will be led to believe that it would be good if he bought cigarettes.\n\nThis kind of commercial strategy is actually widely used in the promotion of food. Many companies want to make their products look healthy because nowadays many people try to stay slim. The advertisement producers answer to that need by developing the commercials in a way that will make the product seem healthy and good for fitness-oriented customers. Usually, they exaggerate certain ingredients, which actually only make up a minor part of the product. Some commercials, for example, promote chocolate bars that include 'a great deal of milk' even though there are merely traces of milk found in the product.\n\nAnother way to make customers buy a product is to appeal to certain images they have of themselves. Commercials for beer, for example, usually try to convey a sense of manliness to the watcher. Men usually feel that this kind of beer will make them seem more rough and therefore more attractive to women, even though the brand is not special in any way and does not differ much from other beer brands.\n\nAll those means are used by the companies in order to make more profit, regardless of the effects it might have on the customers."}
{"file_id": "1155160.txt", "output_essay": "People start the cycle of learning and understanding from the moment we are born. During this cycle, we discover many things in different ways. While understanding of ideas and concepts can provide us with a basic knowledge of the nature and society that surround us, on the other hand, learning facts gives us the opportunity to feel and experience things that might happen in our life. Both of these ideas are important, but for students, it is more important to learn facts rather than understand ideas and concepts of a subject.\n\nFirstly, learning facts is more accurate and reliable in many fields of different posts. We can find the answer in crime scene investigation; we do not know the exact cause of the death of the victim until we open the body and examine it thoroughly. A single substance in the artery may have a vital influence on human life, but in textbooks, we cannot find them. The same theory applies to the teaching of students in school, especially biology; only through a real experiment can they understand the concepts more clearly and correctly.\n\nSecondly, through learning from facts, students can remember things more efficiently. The vivid image of the process of how organs work and respond to each other may leave a strong impression on students, which are easier for them to remember rather than the boring contents of the concepts or the textbook. As a high school student myself, my classmates and I both prefer the classes in labs rather than classrooms; they are both exciting and impressive.\n\nThirdly, in terms of emotional development, learning facts can make one's life more colorful by experiencing and thinking about the connections and consequences of how things are organized. Because at the early years of our life, we learn things through facts and experiences. The knowledge we attain at this period is original and pure; it is just the fact, which is more realistic. The more experiences we have, the more calm and objective attitude we can have when faced with an emergency.\n\nAs a conclusion, despite the fact that we can get a cut through by learning the concepts that are already proven and given to us, we should still try to find the answers by ourselves."}

If we do everything in the trip following someone, it just looks like working as usual. When I take a trip by myself or with my friends, we could go everywhere we want, we could eat everything we like. We talk and laugh loudly, and we enjoy ourselves.\n\nSecondly, in the journey, the time we spend in the places we love is dependent on how much we like. If we find some place beautiful, we can have a good time there for long. Once we feel tired during some part of a trip, we can stop and have a rest; we can have a drink in a caf\u00e9 on the way, too. No one could stop you.\n\nThirdly, it is said that the tour guide may show you many things, so you would learn more in the trip; however, in my opinion, it is not necessary for me to know much by hearing the guide say, also, it makes me tired. During the holiday, we should enjoy and learn things by trying and seeing by ourselves. We will find more while we take a try in everything.\n\nThe best way to travel is to travel yourself or with your few good friends. It will give you a hard-to-forget time, and your friendship would be deeper. I am not here to say the other choice is bad, but I think, not as good as mine, you know, traveling in a group may make you tired.

{"file_id": "1155868.txt", "output_essay": "Successful people have different ways and strategies to be unique and successful among others. The main ways to be successful are either by taking risks or by doing and applying what they already know or plan for. The two types of people might consider different factors in their living environment that will guide them to the best succeeding path or way.\n\nPeople who like to take risks are often forced or encouraged by their surrounding environment to do so. Their environment might be poor, tough, or have a lot of shortages, which will lead them to search for new and creative ways to satisfy their needs, and these ways are mostly risky because no one has ever tried them before. For example, inventors take the risk to try risky or unfamiliar procedures to come up with a unique, new, and usable invention that turns their life into a successful one. Another example is a company owner who will take a risky decision to solve unwanted or sudden market conditions.\n\nPeople who like to do what they planned for usually have a stable life and environment. They go through a regular path, just like anyone else, but they put in more effort and plan wisely to achieve their predetermined goals. Most people from this type do not like to take risks before making an intensive analysis of all the consecutive results of taking any risk. As a result, they will end up not changing their plans. For example, people who do not like to change their career, or those who take the same path as their fathers or mothers, such as being a doctor or professor in college, just like their parents.\n\nIn my opinion, I prefer to do what I already planned for without taking risks. Because it is safer for my career and social position, and I do not have the strong ability to find alternative solutions in case of failure of any risky action. Moreover, it is more convenient for me to live in the same pattern throughout my life with a reasonable improvement, just like the average people. I also strongly consider my stable life, which does not force me to take any risks."}
{"file_id": "1157923.txt", "output_essay": "Different ways of learning can be taught by a professor or lecturer in order to make it easier for their students to memorize certain study matters. Some believe that trying to help their students understand ideas and concepts is more important than just learning facts.\n\nTo begin with, encouraging students to develop their own ideas and concepts about a certain topic and, in the end, to draw a conclusion is very likely to have a positive impact on the student's memory. For example, if a student in a history class has the task of thinking about the way the German people must have felt at the end of the Second World War, and they work out their feelings of desperation and hopelessness, they have learned through experience.\n\nMoreover, through having understood certain ideas and concepts, a student can basically transfer them to nowadays situations and, as well, to another subject or theme. For instance, having learned the concept of social behavior on a specific example and having understood the idea of it, the student will be easily able to observe the social behavior, its causes and consequences, in their own environment and to compare them to other unsocial behavior and the way it differs in every country and continent.\n\nLearning facts surely has its disadvantages in specific exam situations. For example, if a student is asked about when certain historical events took place. Especially in the subject of history, learning dates by heart is rather important, mostly in order to avoid getting mixed up with situations that happened before another event and to receive a basic overview of certain periods of time.\n\nAll things considered, there are more benefits for students, not only in school but for the entire life, to be able to use learned ideas and concepts in a variety of fields than to learn facts that can be easily forgotten just after the exam has finished."}

One of the answers that can be given is that he did, at a certain moment, something no one did before, and because no one did that before, it was risky. Is that the key to success in general? Maybe not, but it can certainly explain the success of several businessmen within an economic context. Taking risks and trying new things are two factors favoring one's success in business because of having the advantages of being the first and consequently the best.\n\nTrying new things, first, means that the actor taking the action is the only one in the area. For instance, if I draw a new picture, it means that no one did it before me, and I am the first to act in this manner. Being the first can give several advantages. If, for instance, you create a new product that you protect by copyright and that everyone wants to have, you will have a monopoly on it that will benefit your company. However, a new idea, product, or drawing is not only good and does not always work. That is why successful people are also considered as people who take risks.\n\nSecondly, taking calculated risks in a specialized area makes you the only one to benefit from it.

There is a gradual increase in the number of cars everywhere. I don't think that the number of cars will be reduced after some years. Instead, there will be more seen than what we see today. They are playing a major role in transportation.\n\nFirstly, cars are regarded as a status symbol for many people. They buy them just to show their status rather than using them for some genuine reason. Cars seem to have a drastic impact on every class of people, starting from the lower middle class to the upper class. So, nowadays, a car cannot be disappeared.\n\nSecondly, they are considered to be more comfortable. A car is preferred because it is easy to reach our destination rather than waiting for some public transportation. It doesn't give much stress and makes people get relaxed when compared to other means of transportation.\n\nAt any time, it can be used and make our work done in a cool way instead of rushing for other ways. Finally, nowadays, the prices of cars are also declining due to some reasons. So, they are affordable by even a middle-class person, which again symbolizes a rise in the car population.\n\nBeing a car owner, any person can make a plan spontaneously and even implement it. Like planning for a picnic. An example of why anyone goes for a car is that it may be used for all purposes, both for official and personal things. And a car doesn't release much gas, and it is not a victim of pollution too. Cars not only serve as personal vehicles but are even used as public transportation, like taxis. So, a car has its effect on every walk of man's life, to reach the destination and to enjoy luxuries too.\n\nI conclude that I can't imagine a road without a car, as it carries many advantages."}

I recently read a book about McDonald's. The founders of McDonald's were two brothers in the southern United States. They were selling hamburgers at a store that offered drive-through service, where customers could buy food without leaving their cars. This was a major innovation in the restaurant industry at the time. However, they changed their approach. They revolutionized the entire process of making hamburgers by assigning each person a single task, such as baking the meat. Previously, one person would perform every step to make a hamburger. This new approach enabled them to serve food more quickly. Due to their efforts, McDonald's became the largest hamburger company in the world.\n\nTrying new things always involves some risks. It would be great if new endeavors brought success. However, if they fail, it would be a nightmare. I think challenging new things is a kind of lottery. We cannot know if a new thing will be successful.\n\nAnother example of successful people is the person who created the iPod. This product is one of the most hit products of Apple Company, which used to produce Apple computers. The idea of making the iPod the lightest and having a big capacity for music was a fashionable idea. Apple Company was the first to create products like the iPod. The attitude of challenging new things would make Apple accomplish success.\n\nBecause of these reasons, I agree with the idea that successful people try new things and take risks rather than doing what they already know how to do well."}

The issue, which does need attention and analysis, is that many young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.\n\nAlthough it is not the case that the whole young crowd has become indifferent to helping their communities, I certainly believe that, looking at it wholly, young people nowadays do not devote enough time to helping their communities.\n\nThere are several reasons for my acceptance of this statement, and I would like to state them in the following paragraphs.\n\nThe main reason I feel this way is that today's youngsters have become too narcissistic. They are all self-centered and bothered about their personal progress. This is due to the ever-increasing competitiveness. In this competitive world, to catch up with the pace, each youngster is busy polishing themselves for the contest. And in this course, they remiss the community. They are too worried about their own progress and achievements to look into community matters. Each of them wants to be the best, and they don't want to afford wasting time on others.\n\nThe other reason that makes me accept the statement is the prevalence of corruption, violence, robbery, murder, and a whole lot of crimes taking place. If the youngsters gave enough time to the well-being of the community, wouldn't the scenario be different? All those murderers, robbers, rapists constitute of whom? Aren't the major chunk of them the youths of the community? Instead of being helpful to their community, they are becoming the cause of all sorts of sufferings and traumas to the community, I must say.\n\nFurther, I feel that youngsters are not contributing to help the community because they are getting away from moral values and disciplines of society. Today's youngsters want to be more independent and do not want to be taught all those lessons of helping others. What they learn from the growing technological world is how to make themselves modernize and how to cope up with the rest of the competitors. Amidst this, they do not care for the community. For example, today, most young people spend half of their time on the internet. Now, by exploiting the internet, what are the possibilities of them using it for others' sake or to help someone compared to the possibilities of chatting, browsing, looking for job opportunities, searching for institutes for further education, etc.? Certainly, the probabilities of utilizing it for personal benefits are quite higher.\n\nAll these reasons and examples make me accept the statement that nowadays, youngsters are not much interested and hence not devoting much time to help the community.

Also, thanks to developing technology, public transportation has become much more convenient now, so this could be one of the reasons that people use cars less in the future.\n\nNowadays, many people are concerned that the population might decrease in the future. According to investigations, the population rate is focused on the elderly class. One of the reasons is the development of medical technology. Moreover, more women are going out to work, and recently, they usually refuse to have babies because they will not be able to avoid quitting their work.

Moreover, a tour guide taught me a lot of things about Australia. Before I traveled to Australia, I knew few things about Australia, but thanks to a tour guide, I learned a lot of things about Australia, for instance, the history of Australia and the Aboriginal people. When I was a junior high school student, I read a book whose main location is Australia, and the man in the book climbs Uluru, so I wanted to climb there. However, a tour guide told me that Uluru is a special place for the Aboriginal people and they do not want us to climb. I did not know such a thing.\n\nThat is why, thanks to a trip in a group and a tour guide, I had a very good time during my trip, so I agree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide."}
{"file_id": "1158753.txt", "output_essay": "I quite agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do.\n\nBeing young means a lot of energy. Young people have more energy compared to any older person. More energy helps them to take part in more activities. Though this could be only true if these energies are spent towards positive activities.\n\nWhen a person is young, he is always in a learning stage. So many times they may come across new places and new things, they will enjoy knowing about it, because it would be their first interaction with it. For example, simple driving - young people may find it more joyful than older ones. Because driving would be relatively a new activity for them compared with older ones, who could be frustrated with daily traffic and other issues related to it.\n\nIf you ask this same question to a school child during their exams, it can be expected what their answers could be. But during their vacation time, it may be opposite. This lets us know how immature a human being is when he is in his young ages. An immature human being means they don't understand responsibilities towards their life as much as an older person could understand. In short, a young person could have fewer responsibilities in his life compared with an older person, which puts an older person into a more stressed life.\n\nSaid all these, life is great. It's better we understand our different stages of life and enjoy each stage as it comes. Each stage of a life has its own beauty, to lead a happy life, one should understand this and should enjoy his or her life to the most, no matter in what age he or she is."}

My main reasoning is that it depends on the path one wants to follow, whether an academic specialization makes sense or not. My aim is to explain this argument in the following sentences by looking at the broad academic field of business.\n\nIn Switzerland, a master's student can choose whether they want to specialize in one specific subject, such as finance, or to keep their focus on a broad approach, which includes subjects such as marketing, human resources, finance, strategic management, risk management, and leadership.\n\nTo illustrate my hypothesis mentioned above, I will now take a look at two different jobs within a company.\n\nA general manager and their management team do not need to be specialized in one specific subject, as they have to address problems from many different fields, such as leadership issues, marketing decisions, and financial topics. An important aspect in the job of a manager is the need to quickly decide on many different issues. Thus, a broad education is actually an advantage.\n\nAn employee in the financial sector, such as in a bank, does not need to have such broad knowledge. Rather, it is essential that they possess in-depth knowledge of the transactions within the sector and of the sector itself. The job requirement is much more focused. Rather than just knowing a little about everything, it is advisable to have a solid knowledge of this special topic - and finance, for example, is actually still a rather broad subject.\n\nBut, of course, it is needless to say that knowledge is always an added asset. However, one has to decide first which path will be chosen in order to be able to make a sound decision whether an academic specialization makes sense."}

We often use cars to go to work or to school; we use them in order to be somewhere else in the least time possible. We also use cars, and maybe first of all, for going out in the evening, when buses and tubes are maybe full of undesirable people and things like that. \n\nOn one hand, the car is for sure our best way of transportation because it is easy to use and does not require queuing for tickets, for example. However, I think that the real question is: Is the car really the best solution, the best urban solution to reach a place, to go somewhere? Or maybe would the car be one day a real problem in our everyday lives, instead? I think that the answer is that in a few years, the car will be the worst way of transportation because of the increasing number of drivers in the streets, and most of all because of the incoming problem of pollution!\n\nAccording to me, in the end, in twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today as a natural consequence of the improvement of our own lives. I also think that my opinion is supported by all those experiments that scientists and engineers are doing in order to convert our way of moving in a city with alternative ways of transportation and also with alternative fuels, maybe less harmful. For example, I think that in the future, our cities will support much more transportation by train than by car in order to move many more people at a time, eliminating problems connected with traffic and pollution."}
{"file_id": "1160675.txt", "output_essay": "It is always better to understand facts.\n\nAs a student, I really think it is easier for us to understand a topic by using examples and learning facts. When students just see the concept in class or the definition about something, it's difficult for them to remember it just as they saw it in class. However, if they see a specific case about the same concept, it will be easier to keep it in mind, because they can relate it to real life.\n\nFor example, last semester in my human resources class, I had a teacher who always helped us to relate the theory with the practice. I remember one class where we saw what an interview was and what it consisted of, and she took a classmate to make him undergo an interview, explaining all the steps we needed to take to make it right, and showing the most common mistakes that we could commit.\n\nI recall it was so enriching for everybody in class, and after that, when I entered my first job, I could remember everything I had learned and I took it to reality.\n\nWhen we learn facts, it also helps us to convey them with our own experiences.\n\nOn the other hand, I have had classes where we get full of concepts and definitions of some subjects, but we really don't know how to put them into practice, and I do think all this information goes away.\n\nIn conclusion, to learn in a classroom or out of it will always be better to understand facts and relate them to reality, and also it will be easier for us to explain and to teach somebody else, because we have already absorbed this information, and professors should do this with the students since they are kids to provide them with an important tool to learn better."}

When we look around, we can easily see that the type of advertisement has developed because technology has developed very quickly. When I open the TV, I can see many different and interesting advertisements. If one person wants to be successful, they must make a good advertisement. On the other hand, they must pay a lot of money. Therefore, we should prepare an advertisement for making a good product.\n\nThe first reason is curiosity. Generally, everybody watches television every night. The advertisement gives many opinions about the product, and on television, we can make many changeable points, such as shape, color, or size. For example, when I watch an advertisement, I want to use the product because, on TV, the shape and color are very attractive.\n\nThe second reason is that in the advertisement, we can see famous people. I believe that it is very important because many people like to watch famous people. This type of advertisement is expensive, but I believe that it is not important because, in the future, we will gain much money. For example, last week, my sister wanted to buy Coca-Cola because she saw the famous people in the advertisement. So, emotional intelligence is very important in the advertisement. Advertisers should find many different types of advertisements when they prepare the project.\n\nAs a result, there are many reasons for making a good advertisement. When we read the examples in the passage, we can easily see that the advertisement is very important for the product. If we give many importance to the advertisement, I believe that the product will become popular."}

In fact, they tend to think young people do the opposite. This assumption is not entirely a fabrication. There are countless children who are willing to give up their time to help the community. These occurrences can be observed anywhere, especially in school. Several schools offer a myriad of student activities that help their communities, which students volunteer for generously.\n\nThe most popular program among the students is orphanage or retirement home visits. Students voluntarily sacrifice their time after school to take the hike to an orphanage or retirement home nearby. During these visits, students play with the children, exchange conversations with the elderly, help clean up trash around the area, all in all, promoting warmth and happiness to the community. Undoubtedly, these generous acts promote a better environment.\n\nAnother program includes Amnesty International, which takes helping communities to an international level. Students organize themselves into groups and become aware of social and political injustice around the world. With knowledge, they promote social awareness and facilitate active political participation to fellow students by writing letters to governments. Being future leaders of the world, not only are they aggregating interests to governments for the community, they are influencing others to become equally aware of the world around them.\n\nUndeniably, sometimes young people do become lazy and not help the community. They would rather enjoy luxurious times in front of the television or playing video games. Sometimes young people just need their relaxation time and enjoy themselves as kids. A childhood must also be dominantly characterized by exuberance. Furthermore, there will always be other more responsible kids doing more helpful work for the community to counterbalance the laziness of others.\n\nBenevolence and sacrifice are indications of maturity. Countless young people already help the community voluntarily, as seen in the various successful school activities. However, young people are still growing and adapting. If they are not, we should not hinder the process and let them enjoy their childhood."}

Whereas old people enjoyed at that age, but not now.\n\nBut nowadays, young people enjoy more than old people enjoyed. The reasons are: young people are in good health and they are very flexible to any kind of environment. As they are younger, naturally they are in a position to do anything like playing, dancing, drinking. Whereas old people cannot do all these things; it is not possible.\n\nYoung people will enjoy with friends, going with friends, and spending time with friends in chatting, etc., roaming here and there. Enjoying holidays in other countries with friends, parties. Whereas, coming to old people, they cannot move anywhere because, as they become old, their health will not support moving to other places or the environment does not suit their health. They could not enjoy at this age.\n\nComing to the young people, they can adjust anywhere, they can do anything because until their body permits. Young people will enjoy a lot compared to old people because there are many changes in present days compared to previous days. Keeping present days in view, we can say that young people will enjoy many things.\n\nYoung people will enjoy by attending parties and coming late nights to the house or going for a long ride, going with friends for a picnic. Enjoying weekend parties with friends or official parties, etc., enjoying all the tastes and entering into each and every corner to taste the thing or to know about the place.

{"file_id": "1159224.txt", "output_essay": "In today's world of cutthroat competition, advertising plays a major role in increasing the sale of any product. There is a large variety of products available in the market today. Similar products are manufactured by many companies. Hence, the customer today has a variety of choices.\n\nThe differences in these similar products may be very minute. The advertising helps in exaggerating these differences. Take cars, for example. One car manufacturer may exaggerate about the spaciousness in the car by comparing it to a lounge ambiance in its advertisement. Another car manufacturer in the same category may emphasize on the outer design of the car, comparing it with the aerodynamics of a spaceship. Thus, both the manufacturers have a selling point to be emphasized.\n\nBut, as the saying goes, looks can be deceiving because all that glitters is not gold. There are so many instances in which the customer is fooled into buying a product because of the glamour created around it through advertising. These instances are coming to life almost every day. There are many letters in the 'letter to the Editor' columns of newspapers that highlight this point. Let us consider a simple example of buying an apartment. One of my close friends wanted to buy a new apartment. He collected many brochures and visited many incomplete sites of construction. He decided to finalize on the basis of the brochure comparison. The brochure of the apartment he zeroed on spoke about the spacious rooms, facilities like a gym, sauna, play park, and many more amenities. After actually shifting to the apartment, he was surprised to see big spacious rooms accompanied by a lot of plumbing problems, no gym, the sauna without water in the pipes, and so on. But if the advertisement hoardings were to be followed, this was a dream apartment. This is a common case for a large variety of products.\n\nGoing from the advertising point of view, the advertisers are paid to make the products look good even if they actually aren't. Take an example of a popular razor that shows leading sports personalities using it. This razor actually caused skin problems to a customer, according to a newspaper. But the company that made this ad made a profit and successfully helped in selling the product.\n\nThere are many more instances that help in supporting the statement that advertisements do make products look much better than they actually are, and I completely agree with this notion."}

There are a lot of techniques that make a product irresistible to consumers. But is it always true that all advertised products are as good as they seem to be? I think it's not: they seem much better than they really are. Last week, I bought an apple pie that I saw on a television spot. In the images reported on TV, it seemed really tasty and healthy, but when I ate it, it was not so good, and I got sick. I couldn't sleep all night long. \n\nIn my opinion, it would be better for food or dress companies to spend their budget improving the quality of their products or decreasing the prices instead of investing it on advertisement. \n\nThe problem is that business rules are different from what is better for the people. But something has to be done. I think that certifications of quality are a very good investment for the companies to show the real value of their product and, at the same time, a good way for consumers to verify the quality of what they are buying and choose better between different brands."}

They have enough time to do all other work, but when it comes to helping their communities, they will run away. These are the people who, after some time, are the ones living in the same community. They should remember only one thing: if today they don't help their community, there will be a day when they need some help from them, and on that day, nobody will be there to help them. If we are not ready to help ourselves, no one will help us.\n\nWhen we are living in a common place, we have to learn to help each other; by doing this, we can live without any troubles. If we live like this, one day will come when there wouldn't be any problems in the world. By this, we could live as a complete family, which is what we all need to do - at least try to help each other. I think this is happening, for example, if we take globalization as the medium through which we are coming to one place, and all rich countries are helping the poor countries in a way they could; this is an example of people who are willing to help.\n\nWe cannot also say that young people are not helping their community; there are some young people who are creating awareness among different sectors of people about the importance of helping one another. They are forming groups and communities for those who are in need of help.\n\nSo, this suggests that there is a section of young people who are willing to help other people and communities, but the percentage of these people is less, and we need to increase this habit and make sure that everybody inculcates this practice."}

Some people think that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. I agree with this statement.\n\nThe reason why advertisements were invented is to increase the level of sales. Therefore, advertisements promote products and must convince the buyer that he needs the promoted products. To this aim, the products are presented as the best product ever invented, even though it is often false. Advertisements are created to attract customers, to make them buy the proposed products.\n\nFor instance, it is common to see on television advertisements that explain that the presented product has been tested by a certain number of customers who expressed their satisfaction when they used the product. However, there is no proof of such a study, and those results cannot be ascertained.\n\nThe promoted product must appeal to the customer, and therefore, lots of technological means are used in order to improve the picture of products. Indeed, nowadays, lots of software are invented in order to fix pictures, to erase some elements of the pictures. To some extent, advertisements are often diffused on television; the best way to attract customers is to show a beautiful product, with nice colors and a nice shape.\n\nFor example, advertisements often concern food products. When a cake is promoted, the nice color of the cake will obviously attract the customer. In the same vein, the nice shape of the cake will also appeal to the customer. Therefore, the customer will buy the product, thinking that he will get the same article as the one exposed in the advertisement, and he will be disappointed because the cake cannot have, in reality, the same color as the one obtained thanks to informatic software used for pictures.\n\nAs a conclusion, advertisements are always using false information, and it is difficult to put boundaries between well-conducted advertisements and false information."}
{"file_id": "1159249.txt", "output_essay": "When it comes to learning facts, some people argue that it is an easy way to understand some methods. Personally, I think that students need to understand ideas and concepts rather than to learn facts. This is because understanding ideas and concepts widens people's intellectual horizons, and people can use these ideas in more practical ways.\n\nFirst of all, students can broaden their intellectual horizons by understanding ideas and concepts. In the case of learning facts, it is obvious that it helps people recognize some physical things. However, these factual and physical things only allow students to learn those facts. This would limit people's imagination, so they cannot understand things above that, such as using other fields. For example, one of the most famous scientists in Korea, Ho Jin Moon, once said that when he was young, he was taught by teachers who just conveyed factual information to students. His parents thought that these methods would restrict their son's understanding, so they moved to America. There, he could take more idea-based education, and when he grew up, he returned to his mother nation and had eagerness to dispute ideas and concept-based educations. He argues that by taking this education, students can understand more in-depth knowledge.\n\nOn top of that, people can use their knowledge in practical ways. In today's society, people are bound and driven by hectic schedules, which make people only focus on the facts, so they cannot use their knowledge only in a few fields. However, the basic ideas and concepts in education are linked to each other. Especially in science, if they understand these basic concepts, learning scientific concepts is more easy. To demonstrate, according to a study released by the Korean National Research Center, more than two-thirds of surveyed scientists responded that understanding ideas and concepts is more important because, by doing this, students can link their knowledge not only to their major fields but also to other similar scientific fields. They said that electronic science can be useful in manufacturing engineering, so students who major in engineering need to understand electronic science basically.\n\nIn conclusion, I strongly believe that students should focus on understanding ideas and concepts because they can widen their intellectual horizons and use their knowledge in more practical ways."}

Therefore, I believe that if they fail at something, they can think that failure is only an experience for more approaching life.\n\nOn top of that, everybody knows that one of the big companies is Samsung. The company owner said that success is for prepared people. It means that everyone has to try other things when they finish their work in their own parts. Then, you will be successful.

{"file_id": "1160892.txt", "output_essay": "You often hear that in the future, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. I also agree with this statement. There are several reasons why I think so.\n\nThe first is that the costs to drive and possess a car would be much higher than today. Because the price of oil would get higher. Also, today you can see this, because in the last few years, the price of oil has exploded. Additionally, the taxes for cars would raise because the government cares about the environment and needs money. So, not every person will have the money to use a car.\n\nAnother reason why cars will be fewer is that there will be a lot of other options to get from point A to point B in the future. For example, a transrapid will be built in Munich in the next few years. So, many people would not use a car if they have the possibility to go by the transrapid. And today, many people are researching new ways of transporting people that are not as bad for the environment as cars are.\n\nA third reason is that more and more people are moving into the big cities to get a job. So, there will be more people in the bigger cities of the country. And in big cities, you normally don't need a car. I think so because with a car, you need so much longer than if you use other possibilities because there are many traffic jams in bigger cities. For example, a friend of mine studies in Munich, and he needs an hour to get from his home to the university by car. With a bike or the subway, he only needs half an hour. So, I think many people will then use a bike or go by subway.\n\nIn conclusion, you can say that there are a lot of good reasons why in twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than today."}

Some of those tourists travel independently, while others are led by tour guides.\n\nIn my opinion, the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide because by this way I will be sure that I will visit the most interesting places in the country to which I traveled. I remember, for instance, my first trip to Egypt and how the tour guide ensured that I and the other group members saw the most fascinating archaeological sights there. Moreover, I believe that being led by a tour guide is more secure than exploring a foreign country alone.\n\nHowever, being led by a tour guide would not be a happy experience for a tourist who wants to wander around the real cities and discover the other lively sides of a country.\n\nFurthermore, there are other methods that can provide the same capability as a tourist guide. For example, books that include useful information about the places that can be enjoyable for tourists to visit, maps, and illustrated books.\n\nAnother important reason makes me prefer traveling with a group: being with a group of someone's country or culture would make them feel more secure and safe rather than knowing no one.\n\nIn conclusion, I would prefer to be guided by a local person who knows more than me about their country."}
{"file_id": "1157984.txt", "output_essay": "I disagree that traveling in a group led by a tour guide is better than traveling on our own. From personal experiences, I've learned that touring on our own gives more opportunities to be more knowledgeable about the place we're traveling, more time to travel unknown places, and more chances to communicate with locals.\n\nAs a personal example, when I went to Cambodia last winter, I went with a tour group led by a guide. Before I went, I knew I had to study about the places I would go, but I postponed such duties because I was expecting the guide to explain everything. Just as I expected, when I went to ancient sites in Cambodia, the tour guide explained every little detail, leaving no space for me to further find out. However, when I went to Europe by myself this winter, I felt obliged to study about the background information or about the European history because there was no guide to answer my questions. The fact that I was planning all the journey on my own gave me more responsibility to study about the place I would go to.\n\nSuch cases are not merely limited to my personal examples. Also, when we travel with a group led by a guide, we have to follow the tour company's tight schedule. Our itinerary is often scheduled, and we merely follow where the guide takes us. We don't have much free time to ramble around new places other than the famous tour cites. However, when we're on our own, we don't have to move according to a fixed schedule. We are free to go anywhere we'd like. Other than famous tour cites, we could simply go to local markets or take a walk down the streets -- places that are ordinary but also places where we can smell the local's custom and culture.\n\nFurthermore, when we're traveling with a guide, we're too busy following the tight schedules to actually communicate with the locals. Touring with a guide often ends with visiting famous cites and taking pictures. But when traveling on your own, we have more chances to actually be friends with the locals. Although there might be some language barrier, we can use body language and talk with locals about their lifestyle, custom, and culture. Traveling on a group led by a guide lacks the precious moment to learn about a country in a first-hand experience.\n\nTraveling in a group led by a tour guide surely does have some benefits. We don't have to plan all our schedules, and we don't need to worry about not knowing something because the guide is there for you to explain everything. However, so far from all my journeys, the most memorable and long-lasting experiences were those that I traveled by myself. Starting from scheduling my itinerary, studying about the country, exploring new places, and meeting people from walks of street is truly the valuable and the real journey I never forget."}

It will be difficult to live without cars, especially here in Italy, where most of the trade and traveling is made by cars. I believe that we will all benefit from the lack of cars, but we need to get used to other means of transport. First of all, people should start using public transport. In this way, companies will improve their means, and they will be ready to sustain the changed habit in twenty years. Secondly, we should invest more in research and development for alternative means of transport and to lower the prices of transportation, such as those of airplanes, trains, and ferries. The government should also improve infrastructures for these means of transport, as often airports, railway stations, and harbors are not enough efficient. As nowadays cars are the biggest source of pollution, it will be positive for the environment and for all of us. Scientists are already working to find alternative sources to make our cars run, as in twenty years' time, we might run out of petroleum, and this will probably be the main cause for fewer cars. Despite this, we will need to discover alternative sources to make our cars run. New cars are already on the market, which work with hydrogen, electricity, or solar panels. However, they are just prototypes, and we are not sure about their benefits to private transport.

I personally don't agree with the statement, as I feel that young people still play their part in helping their communities. The issue comes up again and again because people just take the actions of these young people to heart without actually understanding the situations they face and seeing how things have changed for these young people over the years.\n\nFirst, I have always noticed that it takes a thousand good deeds to be appreciated and just one bad deed to be cursed. Very often, the actions of one person are taken as the trait of a group of people without actually knowing what these other individuals are like. A few bad examples have helped promote the idea that young people nowadays don't care.\n\nSecondly, a lot has changed in the life of young people. The world is a great deal more competitive today than it was ten years earlier. Everything from an education to an occupation demands much more. Time cannot be taken for granted anymore, and young people find themselves more and more time-bound every day. I don't think this aspect is completely understood. Yet, you see these young people doing the best they can to help their communities. A simple example of this is how, at the time of someone's death, everyone is there to lend a helping hand to the family that has suffered the loss, and at such occasions, if you try to think about it, it's usually the young people who run around to help all the time.\n\nMoreover, there are so many young people who have dedicated almost all their time to serve and help their communities. There are so many young people either involved with or running NGOs or organizations that deal with serious issues like education or ample food and shelter for their communities. These people have devoted all their time and energy for the betterment of their communities.\n\nIn the end, I would just like to say that there might never be a common agreement on this subject, but I firmly feel that the young people are doing their part.

However, sometimes they have to choose whether to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects or to specialize in one specific subject. For myself, I will choose the latter, but will try to get some balance as well.\n\nNowadays, knowledge is exploding every day, as a result, it is rather difficult for one to learn broadly and deeply at the same time. Having broad knowledge seems attractive, but actually, it is not practical after the second thought. In the academic circle, there are experts and authorities in almost every field, all of whom hold some specific research interests and accomplishments of their own. If one just spends most of the time on learning knowledge of many subjects, he or she may not have the time to do related research. Besides, since it is quite easy to gain information currently, it is not necessary to know all, for if you want, you can look up the needed information soon.\n\nHowever, if one specializes in one specific subject, things will be quite different, especially when he or she chooses a valuable but rarely-touched field. Under this situation, he or she will become the expert in this field and it is possible to do some quite profound research on it, which will be more beneficial if one knows a lot but really knows little on each subject. As long as the researchers are willing to share their results, communicate with each other, and do teamwork when it is necessary, it does not matter whether all these researchers are able to have broad knowledge.\n\nAt the same time, to keep some balance, it is also important for a researcher to know some basic knowledge on related subjects, which could broaden the eyesight and inspire him or her with fresh ideas. Besides, this will not waste too much time.\n\nTo sum up, generally, I think it is better for one to specialize in a certain subject, but it will be good to know some concerning knowledge at the same time, which can make the work most effective."}

It is because of my thoughts, surveys, polls, and experiments.\n\nFirstly, famous people usually make most advertisements. It appeals to people enough. Most people want to be like actors, singers, and actresses. Maybe the product that is advertised by a superstar is more attractive to people.\n\nSecondly, the survey, conducted by Chosun Daily, one of the best newspapers in Korea, shows that three-fourths of overall candidates surveyed feel that advertised products are more qualified. Also, the poll, conducted by the same company, shows that people think that advertised products are safer.\n\nThirdly, when I was a high school student, my friend bought a product that was not advertised. It was an expensive tape player. It was disordered the next day. My friend wanted to get guarantee service. He did not get it. So, he had to buy again, and he bought an advertised product, Sony, because of its services.\n\nLastly, when I was young, I had two toys. I did not have discrimination between the two toys. However, I was perfectly changed in my mind after the advertisement of Superman, my hero in the past. Although the toy was much cheaper than the other, I always took Superman's toy because I had pride in myself.\n\nIn conclusion, given several reasons, I think that most advertisements make the products seem much better than they really are. It seems that advertisements make us attracted to the product."}

Each day, you can read somewhere in the newspapers how the prices of petrol increase from day to day. Petrol has reached its highest price, and there might be no decrease in the next years. As well as the limited oil reserves, which begin to reduce every hour, it will be difficult to drive a car. Perhaps people will wake up and use public transport, like the bus or train. That would lead to a better environment, because pollution and noise would reduce. As we could also see with the Transrapid, public transportation development is great.\n\nOn the other hand, we all see that there is no end to new car production. Nearly each inhabitant over 18 years old has once driven a car. Unfortunately, for a lot of people, cars are a symbol of status and lifestyle. They like to express their position in society. Some also don't want to give up driving a car, because it is a comfortable way of getting somewhere quickly and easily. For a lot of people, especially men, cars are more than just a thing to transport them. It is a plaything, which they like to show and compare with others.\n\nConclusively, I think there will be fewer cars in twenty years because some people in the future will have to stop driving their own cars. Insurance and petrol will become too expensive when the prices further increase."}

Many older people think and say that young people have freedom and can do whatever they want. However, that is not true for young people because there are many things they must do before they become adults.\n\nAs a young person, I feel like I have a very limited life. Teens go to school every day, they have to do their homework and projects, and they also have to prepare to go to college. Preparing for college gives a lot of stress to young people because most students want to go to good colleges. In order to go to a good college, they need to work hard in school and also do many extracurricular activities. Even though they have something they want to do, either there is no free time for them or there are things that are not allowed to young people. Also, in order to achieve their goals in the future, it seems necessary to go to college and study in the field they want to study. Without that education, it is hard to get a job in a high position or to earn a lot of money.\n\nNot only that, but also they need to listen to their parents because they are not adults yet. If the parents do not agree with something that you want to achieve, you need to either give up or change your mind. There is actually no freedom for teens at school or at home. Older people are more able to do whatever they want because they have freedom and do not have financial problems because most of them work. Basically, they can buy anything they want without asking or getting permission from their parents, and they can also do whatever they want without being pressured by their parents.\n\nWe do not exactly know when a young person becomes an older person, but what we know is that when a person becomes old enough, they can enjoy their life doing whatever they want and they have more freedom than young people."}

For example, ten years ago, while most people did not know the values and benefits of computers, Bill Gates knew it. Because he went ahead and tried new things (computers), he made a real big fortune from doing the latest technology.\n\nOn the contrary, to those persons who only do what they know, successful persons are always trying new things. They usually have an open mind to absorb all the latest concepts, and they often take risks. For instance, if a businessman adopts an idea that he has never heard before, it must be very risky to use it if the idea is not practical to operate.\n\nThere will be two different ways for using new thoughts: success or failure. Most people will not dare to adopt new things because they are afraid that they may lose everything. In this way, they gradually develop the idea that they do not want to learn new things and take advantage of them.\n\nIn contrast, this idea is seldom formed in the heart of successful people. They, of course, know the risks might be, but they are not afraid. Successful people usually have a positive mind to keep them going ahead.\n\nIn conclusion, I think that I truly agree with the opinion that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well."}

Because today, at every school, every student only learns facts. Even they do not understand what the teacher is talking about. I think it is not good for young students. If the teacher reads and teaches what is in the book, they would think about the same thing. In addition, it would suppress children's free imagination. Getting high scores is one of the big problems in the world, especially in Japan. I heard on television that there is no student who often reads a book, does not like to learn new things, and they do not know why it is so important to study.\n\nI think all teachers must teach children to get interested in knowing new ideas, not only facts. Children should think about their own ideas. It will make them more intelligent and interested persons. Another big problem is that most Japanese cannot speak English. And I saw the graph on the news; they said Japan was the worst. In high school, students will learn English from teachers who are not native speakers. They study such as grammar and how to talk. I think it is not very useful for students. They have to learn listening, writing, and need a chance to talk to people who speak English. It will also make students interested and easy to understand in class. I do not think that only learning facts is bad, but I guess if students learn that, they would lose their individual ideas and sense of imagination. That's why I think understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning real facts."}

They might serve one's purposes for a short term, but in the longer run, they usually reveal their shortcomings.\n\nThe very same rule can be applied in this case.\n\nAt first glance, the advantages of specified knowledge seem to be overwhelming. Nearly every modern company or even scientists in universities serve as good examples. To be successful in your part of business, you have to know everything about it, and additional knowledge only serves as a distraction. Since the times of big breakthrough inventions are all gone, everybody specializes in a very narrow field. On a small subject, we now have an absolute expert, knowing nearly everything about it. To a certain extent, this is absolutely necessary. Who else can deal with nano-composites, for example, except someone who has studied this subject for many years? But as soon as a wider overview is needed, this type of scientist very often fails. How can he know about new methods in medicine that might well be adopted within the field of nano-composites if all they ever studied are nano-composites? It is therefore possible that lacking interdisciplinary skills often result in disadvantages.\n\nFurthermore, a person with a tremendous amount of knowledge on only one field most definitely lacks interest in other things and therefore misses so many things in life.\n\nThe other extreme would be people who know something about everything but nothing of importance about any specific field. While these scientists might have the interdisciplinary skills, they would certainly lack the knowledge they need to combine anything of real use and importance. There is simply no need for these persons in academia, since a certain understanding of specific problems is always needed.\n\nI therefore strongly support the idea of a combination of these two types. Of course, I am aware of the fact that we can never gain specific knowledge on all academic subjects. This will remain an illusion.\n\nI favor the humanistic approach. Specialize on one or two subjects, but never lose your ability to overview a wider field. If you are a mechanical engineer, don't lose your interest in theatre."}

You should know the basic facts in different academic subjects. This way of thinking can be found in schools. At school, pupils are expected to be good in every subject. They should be good at maths, languages, biology, chemistry, and sports. So, a pupil has to concentrate on every subject to achieve good results after school.\n\nOn the other hand, critical people would ask, 'Why should a pupil who is good and very interested in maths also be good and interested in sports?' This would be the other way of thinking. Some parents, for example, think that it is enough when pupils are talented in certain subjects, because after school they go to a university, where they also concentrate just on a special subject, which they choose to study.\n\nI am of the opinion that a mix of two ways is the best solution. I think people, especially children, should have a basic education in every subject. It makes no sense to send a child very early to a school that is based on a special subject, like a science school, for example, or a sports school. Pupils should learn the basic information in politics or in geography and other important subjects. I think it is a good way to send children firstly to a normal school, and after graduating, pupils have to decide on their own where they want to go and which university mostly agrees with their own interests. So, the pupils would have a basic knowledge that you need in society, and after this, they can concentrate on a special subject."}

Thus, I am trying not to be affected by such group thinking.\n\nI would say that, in the overall majority of our society, people are enjoying their life, although older people do it more. Surely, one could say the young are lazy and the only thing they have in mind is making party. But I think that relates to their younger and more active body and mind. And I am convinced that the relatively short time young people party cannot be compared to the long periods the older people sit around watching TV, playing poker, or spending their free time in female chatting clubs. Of course, there may be several older people who use their time efficiently by working, keeping the front yard nice, or being active in a sports club. There are also people who are ill and cannot do what they have in mind. But in summary, I want to make a statement about the mean, the normal, older person.\n\nYoung people are simply doing much more, in both fields, enjoying and working, than older ones. I do not know of any of my friends or study mates who think of life as only joy. They are all working hard and learning in schools, universities, or learning a handworker's profession to provide the best possible opportunity to get a job and earn money to run a family. Especially in today's time of mass unemployment, the younger generation must perform more not to be one of the workless. That was different in the last decades, when getting work was no problem and there existed a shortage of factory workers. Today, workers must have a profession and be well-prepared for their job.\n\nThe older generation is now enjoying their dusk of life in a financially saved situation.

{"file_id": "1165600.txt", "output_essay": "I agree that in twenty years, advancements in the convenience of public transport and/or concerns for the environment will decrease the number of cars in use compared to today.\n\nPublic transportation will prove to be more efficient than owning a private car. Not only does it save money, but it also saves time. Using public transportation will save money in two ways. Firstly, the expenses on fuel would be cut to zero. Secondly, one no longer has to spend money on car maintenance. Adding to that, using public transportation will also save time because there will be less traffic. This is especially true in subways.\n\nBecause of these increased benefits in using public transportation as technology advances, the population who would prefer owning a car would dwindle.\n\nAnother reason that the number of cars is going to decrease is that there are growing concerns for the environment. Environmentalists have been active in promoting the conservation of nature through the media. They have successfully managed to alert the world about the seriousness of global warming and have also educated society on ways to prevent a serious disaster. These same environmentalists have convinced many that the preservation of nature is highly urgent. Also, they have stated that the earth will run dry of fuel in a few years. Thus, increasing amounts of people who abide by such beliefs will result in the decrease of car usage.\n\nIn conclusion, because of the effectiveness of public transportation and concerns for preserving nature, fewer and fewer people would be willing to own cars. When public transportation saves money and time compared to owning a personal car, and when the earth can be subject to serious catastrophe because of your use of cars, could you possibly purchase a car?"}

They can also meet other people from different ethnic backgrounds or religions in order to exchange new ideas and form opinions from all that, or simply take a short period of time to relax, and that is called a 'vacation'.\n\nIn fact, when we decide to travel, we usually need someone to lead us; otherwise, we'll get lost and be deceived. Moreover, we might also find it really tiring and fruitless since everything is new to us, and we need some time to get accustomed to that new country. On the one hand, we can buy guiding books and maps, and on the other hand, we can hire a tour guide. Which one of the above means is effective?\n\nIn my opinion, a tour guide is necessary because he can be really helpful by making us visit the most interesting spots or the famous ones, and it's easier, of course, as we won't need to rent a car or look for taxis every time we need to visit a new place. Moreover, he'll be well acquainted with his native country and tell us additional things that sometimes aren't revealed in books, and we can ask him all the questions we would like to ask, whereas by using a book, we don't get really satisfied with the results, and it doesn't provide all that huge amount of information given by that guide. Another interesting point is the reason why people prefer travelling by groups instead of travelling alone is because they just want to enjoy their time and leave some souvenirs of that trip.\n\nAt last, according to my experiences, I would suggest that the best way of travelling would be in groups and guided by a tour."}

There are several ways to support the statement that it is more important to understand ideas and concepts than to acquire knowledge of facts. Science requires students to think constantly and develop a critical way of thinking. For example, for a lawyer, it is more important to learn how to think logically than to learn a set of laws in order to be successful in their career. A set of laws can change within one period of Congress; this will leave the given lawyer who just learned a set of laws obsolete. They will need to go to university to learn again the set of laws to be useful in their field. Fortunately, this is not the way that lawyers learn about their career; most of the knowledge acquired at a law school is to think logically. Even with a change of legislation, a lawyer still remains a lawyer. However, there is always the requirement to be updated with technology and new research to be successful in any given career. For a historian, there is no discussion that it is required to learn facts. The same concept does not apply for a doctor. \n\nThere is always the necessity to improve processes to evolve with society. This is the reason that universities develop research departments. If society does not make research, there will be no progress in many industries. In order to achieve progress, students make research to understand ideas and concepts. If their knowledge is based just on facts, they would not be able to discover new theories. For example, all the improvements in telecommunications. Thanks to the understanding of ideas and concepts, students have improved internet telephony, making it possible to call long distance. \n\nFinally, it will be impossible for society to progress if we just waste time learning facts.

When you travel with a group, if a tour guide plans to see places where you planned to see, it is a problem. In addition to this, you can be bored with the place, but because of the group, you must be there. So, it is not a good situation.\n\nSecondly, tour guides generally take you to historical places. Sometimes it is good, but for a person who is not interested in history or art, it is also a bad situation.\n\nIn conclusion, there are many reasons like these to prefer travelling on my own.

The reason for this is the simple fact that the tour guide would take you to a set of places that the city is famous for, and these places might not necessarily interest me in particular.\n\nI would like to cite a simple example. Last year, for New Year's, I had to go to Goa (which happens to be a major tourist destination in India). Goa is known for a lot of things: great beaches, brilliant churches (Goa was under Portuguese control for over 200 years, so there is a lot of European influence in the architecture), and a pretty rocking nightlife.\n\nMy friends and I decided against having a tour guide because 'Goan Music,' in other words, 'Psy Trance,' interests us more than the churches or the beautiful beaches out there. The tour guide would have charged us a bomb for showing us the churches, talking a bit about the local culture, and walking us down the beaches! We went to Goa for the simple fact that it happens to be the hub for some great electronic music, and since everyone in my group was inclined towards the same objective, all of us started exploring the city all by ourselves!\n\nWe bought some local maps, hired a couple of bikes, bugged people for directions, and it all added to the experience! I wouldn't have enjoyed it to this extent had I gone for a tour operator.\n\nGuides are only out there to make money, and in today's world, guides aren't a necessity while going on a trip because you have enough information available in the form of books, the internet, etc.\n\nSo, I would strongly recommend going alone and doing away with a tour guide, just because it would add to the whole experience of travel."}

They, the would-be Baby-boom generation, were good at various forms of entertainment and were exposed to splendid media, such as Hollywood movies or Broadway musical shows. There are a few reasons why young people are better at having a great time than older people.\n\nFirst, young people know well how to play whenever they want eagerly. They know where the best bar is, what trend is going on, or who the most famous actor is these days. Of course, older people have no time to have fun in order to earn enough money for their family, like a daughter who is interested in an expensive jewelry brand. However, young people do not need too much money because they have no one to provide for. They just maintain their living costs, which include money to go to the best club in Soho.\n\nSecond, young people are healthier than older people because they have young and strong bodies that older people do not have. Old people have to pay for their medical care and medicines in order to maintain their bodies. In contrast, young people are not required to make any medical payments at all.\n\nFinally, young people tend to be curious about all the strange things they have never seen before. When older people avoid a stranger from another country, young people try to get closer with positive activity. For example, in a small town, a tourist visits for academic research, such as modern agriculture from a strange country, and young people or children will try to talk to him or her.\n\nThese reasons are why I think that young people are more enjoyable than older people."}

They have to adapt to new situations and be more flexible. They have to pay attention to changes in markets and adapt to their environment. It can also be assumed that people who seek new challenges are more motivated than people who do the same things every day, because they will not get bored by daily routine.\n\nNot only do new challenges lead to new opportunities for success, but I also think that having and gaining knowledge in more than one field, rather than being a specialist on one certain topic, provides a lot more options for success. Being able to follow and take part in discussions on a variety of fields might earn the respect of other people. It is a lot easier to give an objective opinion if one can verify this opinion through solid experiences in a variety of fields.

They are searching for ways to solve this problem, but every person has a different idea for solving it.\n\nIn my opinion, I think every person must give themselves free time because sometimes people need it for relaxing or other things. But I don't know why some people just think about work and making money, but they don't think about themselves or helping their communities. Additionally, after time passes, these people get tired and every day becomes boring, and they don't want to work, etc. However, I think working is good, but it's not everything; people shouldn't think about work all the time. Work and helping communities complement each other when a person has free time and helps their community; they can work well.\n\nTo conclude, I like working together with helping communities and enjoying it because every person only lives for two days."}
{"file_id": "1167274.txt", "output_essay": "Nowadays, advertisements have a big impact on our lives. They can be very influential on our decisions and choices related to the shops we visit. We can find them everywhere, on television while we are watching a movie or a show, in newspapers, on the internet, and also on the streets. Sometimes, when we open our mailbox, we find a lot of advertisements, for example, about restaurants and shops.\n\nNot always do they describe the real qualities of a product. In fact, I think that often they make products seem much better than they are. Sometimes, for example, we buy a product because we have heard so much about it and its incredible properties, but later, when we use it, we realize that we have been stupid.\n\nIn fact, the product quality does not correspond with the description in the advertisement, and furthermore, we have probably spent more buying it instead of a similar product that was not advertised.\n\nIn particular, I believe that these advertisements are more powerful with children. In fact, they usually ask their parents to buy a game or a pair of shoes because they have seen them on television, they have been attracted by the presentation of this product, and they really believe that they can reproduce what is shown on these advertisements.\n\nIn conclusion, I think that it is better to be a little doubtful when we see these advertisements. When we buy a product, we have to be careful because sometimes a common product that we have never seen before can show the same properties and qualities as the one that is advertised. We will probably save money."}
{"file_id": "1162960.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than sticking to what they already know how to do well. There is risk involved in many things people do. That doesn't stop successful people from doing them. An intelligent person takes calculated risks, which would make him/her successful.\n\nImagine how the world would have been if Bill Gates hadn't dropped out of school to pursue his passion. We wouldn't have had the luxury of using the Windows operating system! He took a risk that could have ruined his life, but he believed in his dreams.\n\nAll the missions to space are risky; there is a huge risk of money and, more importantly, life. Since some brave people have risked their lives for their dreams, ambitions, and for mankind to a large extent, we know lots of things about the planets, the satellites, and the space. Astronauts, despite having doubts about their return to Earth, have traveled into space. If it weren't for their efforts, we would have remained ignorant of the universe and its miracles.\n\nBusiness is a field in which a lot of risk is involved. Nothing is guaranteed in business. There could be a huge loss incurred from the businesses that are undertaken. But still, risks are taken to achieve greater heights. It's the same with the stock market. The path to success in business is full of traps, and they need to be avoided to reach success. That is what many successful people do.\n\nBe it any field, many successful persons have taken calculated risks to reach where they are today. The elegant cricket player Kevin Pietersen, who is originally from South Africa, has moved to England to keep his passion alive. The reason for this was stated to be discrimination and politics in sports. Hadn't Kevin Pietersen taken the risk of leaving South Africa, despite being warned by the officials that he wouldn't be eligible to play for his country again, the cricket world would have missed a great sportsman. He was also honored by the British government. He is now addressed as Kevin Pietersen MBE.\n\nThe legendary mountaineer Sir Edmund Hillary, along with Tenzing Norgay, climbed Mount Everest. The risk involved in it is of the size of a mammoth. They risked their lives to climb the tallest peak in the world with sheer hard work and now they have a place in history. The information gathered by them is a giant leap in geological studies.\n\nThese few examples clearly indicate that success comes at a price, and risks have to be taken calculatedly."}
{"file_id": "1166105.txt", "output_essay": "So different are the personal experiences and emotions among people with diverse cultures that thousands of individuals might hold thousands of opinions.\n\nAs far as I am concerned, I generally agree with the assertion that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.\n\nFirst of all, one of the central reasons that can be presented to support my position is that the things achieved by successful people take a long time of experiences to make them better. Examples can easily be found to support my view. The most famous inventor, Edison, invented the light in a very early period. However, he didn't spend time on how to improve his invention well. After a long time of life experiences, others improved the light better, such as the color and the usage time. Under these circumstances, successful people trying new things and taking risks is much better. In addition, another equally crucial aspect is that a new thing's emergence can increase the possibility of others' related new products' inventions. This example can tell it right. The light came out soon after the discovery of electricity, because these two inventions have something in common or relation. As a result, successful people always succeeded in making lists of new things after they made one. This can demonstrate beyond any doubt that successful people should keep on going, but not stay behind.\n\nHowever, I don't want to overstate the advantage of my agreement, since it also still suffers from some comparative merits in some specific cases. Firstly, when people try to invent new things, it takes a long time to reach the achievement. Secondly,... (this sentence seems incomplete, but I left it as it was since I didn't want to change the original meaning)\n\nTo sum up, according to the above-mentioned reasons and examples, successful people should try new things and take risks becomes more convincing to me, although it has some own negative aspects which we cannot deny."}
{"file_id": "1168494.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with this statement. The publicities and advertisements find ways to convince people in every way about their products, even though these are often false. This is not wrong on the part of the people, because the effects of the products can also be dangerous, even if the products are portrayed as the most beautiful that exist in the world.\n\nThis type of advertisement is most important, specifically for medicine and cosmetics products that can cause very important problems. There are so many cases of intoxications. For example, dietetic products are more difficult to really help you, but using nice words and false tests, they can convince people to take them. Also, technology products use design and beautiful colors to distract people from the very important aspects like the processors, hardware, and RAM, etc. People are attracted by the colors they see and the nice words they listen to.\n\nStaying within people's capacity and attention to understand what is true and right can only help them. For money, all people may say and do wrong and false things. Another reason for this behavior is that success is often linked with money. We are conditioned by so many advertisements, and this is so wrong. We must learn to read the labels on the products and certify that all the things written are right, asking and doing some research, and we must research the way to convince people not to buy if they are not sure."}
{"file_id": "1166363.txt", "output_essay": "Yes, I agree with the statement 'The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.' Willing to travel along with a group of people is a good option rather than traveling alone. There are many factors that will benefit us while we are traveling in a group led by a tour guide.\n\nFirstly, by considering the security factor, which is a big task in tours, especially to foreign countries, we can feel more secure while we are along with a group of people rather than alone. Even in case of some tough situations, we will get the support of everybody in a group.\n\nSecondly, traveling in a group is economically more recommended than traveling alone. We can share the experiences and joy while we are traveling in a group, and we can benefit from most of the expenditures we will face. Many tourism departments in various countries are offering good tourism packages for people who are coming for foreign tours. They are providing discounts and valid packages, especially for people traveling in a group rather than traveling alone.\n\nThirdly, we can have a planned timetable, and we can have a lot of fun all along the tour along with our group members. We can plan more programs and events that will entertain us along with our fellow members, and even we can have a large audience. Even imagine if our group consists of various talented persons; then we can organize seminars on research-oriented topics in a foreign land.\n\nLastly, apart from the above factors, i.e., security, reducing expenditures, presenting individual talents, and joy we get while traveling in a group. We can also plan some industrial tours or join in training programs, which will enhance our skills in our job, and traveling in a group will always show up our identity wherever we tour."}
{"file_id": "1165229.txt", "output_essay": "I think the best way to travel is alone, not in a group led by a tour guide. In my country, there are a lot of tour agencies to different countries. However, traveling should definitely be done alone because there is not much time the guide gives, traveling alone is more flexible to control time and place to go, and tour information they provide can be found individually.\n\nIn my personal experience, tour guides give not enough time to see something in one site. For example, I once had a trip to Northeastern United States. I went to New York first. One amazing place was Broadway. Those musical posters, commercials, and stores attracted me. However, the guide gave me only one hour. I wanted to visit the stores and see a musical, but in one hour, all I could do was take photos and buy a souvenir. If someone is going to travel, they must have flexible time to stay and do something they want to do. A musical, a cup of coffee, or shopping is their choice.\n\nIf people travel alone or by their personal group, they are more flexible in time and deciding where to go. When I was in Cuba, I wanted to go to the beach, but that day, it was rainy, so I changed my plan to stay indoors. And in the evening, I enjoyed dinner on a cool temperature beach. If someone travels in a group with a tour guide, you cannot change plans; you may go to the beach on a rainy day. Also, you might go to somewhere you do not want to go and waste hours in a bus.\n\nPeople find tour guides because they are not good in that place. However, the invention of the internet, and so many books about that place, tell everything about it. People can find maps, places where the view is good, where to eat delicious food. Then people can choose a place to go by themselves. My parents, once went to Italy, with only a book, and enjoyed everything without problems.\n\nFor these reasons, it is fun and also very practical to travel alone or in personal groups. Flexible schedules and individual preference are the most important things when people travel indeed."}
{"file_id": "1167972.txt", "output_essay": "It is often said that a group tour is more beneficial than traveling alone. Some people might agree with this statement because a group tour is not lonely and a tour guide will guide them to the best travel attractions. However, I firmly believe that traveling alone is the best way to travel. It is far more comfortable. Also, I can do what I really want to do without any regulations.\n\nTo begin with, a single tour makes me feel very comfortable. Usually, a group tour is a little bit noisy and confusing. But individual travel will make it possible to have a calm, peaceful, and cozy tour. For example, when I went to Japan, I went with a group. Our tour group members were 15. So every time we moved to another location, I had to wait until all members were ready to move. Waiting too much made me angry. After I came back to my country, I thought that if I had gone to Japan alone, it would have been a much more memorable travel experience for me.\n\nAlso, individual travel gives a great opportunity to encourage independence and endurance. When people travel alone, there are no regulations, so people can do what they really want to do. They should plan by themselves and decide what they eat and where they stay. By deciding these things, they will learn many things that they could not learn from books. For instance, when I was a senior, I planned to go to America for four weeks. I reserved airplanes, restaurants, and hotels. At that time, it was a very hard time for me. But now, I think that through this tour, I can learn independence, improve my language skills, and broaden my social relationships."}
{"file_id": "1168447.txt", "output_essay": "I think that successful people trying new things and taking risks is a good working definition. I will write about the reasons why. I will give some experiences. In my case, when I was young, I couldn't do everything. My parents helped me with everything. But when I grew up, I wanted to try something on my own. Because I had been wondering about that problem. So I had to do it. I found the problem. I mean that I solved the problem by myself. Also, my father is the same. My father had failed in business, but he didn't give up. He tried other things, kept working. Finally, he succeeded in his business. I want to say don't give up, keep trying to work.\n\nI will write another story. Everybody knows about Thomas Edison. When he was a child, everybody said, 'stupid, foolish.' Also, his parents worried about him. One day, he brought an egg. He said, 'I can do chicken, mom, it comes with a baby.' He kept wondering about something and tried to do it. Eventually, he succeeded in his work. We know about light. He discovered it by himself. Anybody can try to do or not be scared of new things.\n\nIn conclusion, I think that successful people have exactly one reason. Those things are that they are not scared of new things and take risks. Keep trying to experience and challenge. We need to learn about their lives or lifestyles."}
{"file_id": "1166282.txt", "output_essay": "In our lives, all of us want to live in good, comfortable conditions, want to have a big house and also a nice car and money until death. But for this suitable life, it cannot be won easily. It wants success. And for success, an open mind, risk, and new trials are necessary.\n\nThere are two kinds of people. One is successful, and the other is unsuccessful in life. In my opinion, successful people are open-minded and always ready to try something new, trying to develop a process or a project or a subject. In addition to these, they like to take risks for success. But on the other hand, some people stay away from risk, new projects, and are also afraid of trials. They live according to their life rules.\n\nIf we focus on professors and scholars working, educating, and researching in universities, colleges, and also in institutes, we could determine success on their faces by investigating their reliable behaviors, talkings, smilings, etc. We know that they don't get afraid of making mistakes because they believe that if they make a mistake, it will turn to them as success. On the other hand, if other people are afraid of making mistakes, taking risks, and stay dependent on their own rules, they could not be successful. For example, if an unsuccessful student is investigated, according to the student's behavior and life, random study times that were set by themselves could be determined.\n\nIn conclusion, it could be said that successful people are the people who are not afraid of making mistakes and, in addition to these, who are not afraid to take risks. They are always ready to find out something and develop. But as compared above, to do what is wanted does not bring any success and also a comfortable life we imagine. If life is just like a stair for people having beauties, comfort, and money on the upside, in my opinion, successful people will go up easily, but the others will not."}
{"file_id": "1171645.txt", "output_essay": "I disagree. I have three opinions to support this reason. First, the way to travel with a group led by a tour guide is not free to act. They made me unhappy by putting me on just one course, where we have to go, and even scheduling when we should go there. In everywhere, maybe we could find an impression on the specific place, but I cannot stay more than a short time at the place due to such a hard schedule or with the group. \n\nSecond, it seems inexpensive on the surface, but they let me spend money little by little, as an additional price. If I traveled alone, perhaps I can be more economical in staying in the city in order to make friends.\n\nThirdly, we cannot make many local friends on the trip if I led such a group. If I traveled up to alone, I can be more close to the local tradition.\n\nTherefore, I disagree with the way that is led by a tour guide."}
{"file_id": "1168162.txt", "output_essay": "America is considered a great country because it offers opportunities to common people to gain a better life by trying something new, like pursuing a new business or getting a real, extravagant idea.\n\nThis example underlines the great importance in our culture of conquering something new and taking the risks correlated.\n\nIf we were born just to do the same life, the same job, and the same experiences as the people who lived before us, probably humanity would still live in caves.The evolution itself of human persons is strictly related to what some people discovered when they tried to go under new ways.\n\nThinking about Christopher Columbus, for example, if he didn't navigate his fleet through the ocean, putting his life in danger, the Americas wouldn't have been discovered.\n\nOf course, taking risks is the other face of the same coin.It's very rare to try new things without any costs, even the implicit ones, like losing credibility or the social status kept till that moment.For instance, in the past, a lot of people died trying to develop aircrafts.But with their persistence, we can now fly from one continent to another in just a few hours, and those who succeeded will always be remembered as pioneers and founders of our contemporary world.For me, the real issue is always to understand the trade-off between the advantages that new things or discoveries can bring and the risks related to them or to the path to discovering them.Real successful men always analyze this relationship, because otherwise the results could be catastrophic, maybe not at the beginning but in the future.Quick success without any solid analysis behind is to be avoided as much as the fear of running from your inspirations or new ideas."}
{"file_id": "1169186.txt", "output_essay": "Is the best way to travel in a group led by a tour guide? There are going to be millions of places that you may have not seen or never heard of before, new cultures to explore, new ways of learning, and doing something that probably you didn't even think existed.\n\nTraveling with a tour guide is probably a good choice if your idea is to go and see the city, to know what its history is behind it. However, if that's not your thing, then it's not a good choice traveling with a tour guide.\n\nIn my personal experience, I had always wanted to see the cities for myself. But in my case, I'm also more interested in the nightlife too. So, I think that I will not be taking the tour guide to a night out in the city, which I prefer spending with my friends.\n\nAnother thing would depend on what your perspective of viewing things is, and on your own personal way of thinking, and also in the point of life that you are living. As a student, I would prefer to go with a group of friends, and that's it. But probably in 10 more years, I would rather see the city, the history, what it consists of, than just another night out with the guys.\n\nSo what I'm saying is that there are certain points in life where you want to do certain things or you don't. Traveling with a tour guide is great to see the city for what it is, and not only as a structure, but for what people had lived before in there. So, taking a tour guide will depend, after all, on what your main idea of the trip is, and what the whole point would be after everything!"}
{"file_id": "1167264.txt", "output_essay": "I disagree with the saying that understanding ideas and concepts is more important for a student than it is to learn facts.\n\nIdeas give the student an incentive for what and how a task has to be done. Concepts are studied from earlier editions of books and from some written, or generally speaking, from an abstract of what is already done. A concept also means the basic idea of what is to be done. A concept is the general background of any subject considered. Of course, without a concept, nothing is done properly, for example, taking a major. A student does not catch up with the course if he has no idea about the concept or the basics of the course.\n\nFacts are a very lively word to listen to. A fact explains what is true, true and only true. Facts are the things to be considered in every particular task. According to me, learning facts always puts us in the place where we have to be. Learning facts sounds like something related to behavior, personal experience, something done. For example, giving a test which is really new to a student. He has to give many practice tests in order to face the experience when on the real test. If the student just goes to the test with all ideas and a fully known concept, it would not be that good a result as it would be when he takes practice tests before.\n\nAnother example is putting up a new business. A man planning to start a new business has to learn the ideas, the concept of marketing, and as well the experience. He has to observe some businessmen, how they work with the daily shares. Having an idea and the basic knowledge about the business does not just click into the market. There would be less profit in the work done without learning facts.\n\nSo, these observations conclude that half knowledge is always dangerous. Thus, I disagree with the saying that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts."}
{"file_id": "1167709.txt", "output_essay": "The society we live in is based on consumption. I agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. In contrast, nobody would buy these products.\n\nI think that nowadays, people really need to be sure of what they buy. They want to make sure that they buy the best product. So, the only way to ensure them is to create the advertisement they want to see, even if it is not true. It is the case, for example, for the solutions that make you lose weight in only two weeks. Most women know it is not true, but as the advertisement shows fake benefits of the solution, women want to try it, and so, they buy the product. Women finally notice that the product does not work.\n\nIt is also the case for children. They often see toys they have always dreamed of on television. The advertisement makes them believe that with this toy, they will be the strongest or they will be the best. As children are still unaware of the principle of this consumption society, they believe what they see and they want to buy the toy. But once they have got it, they become aware of the truth and see that their toy will never give them what they were told.\n\nSo I think that, indeed, most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. It is one of the most important rules of the consumption society. Products have to always seem better than what they really are. People only buy what they think is the best for them.\n\nAll advertisements have to lie because if they do not, the advertisement for another product would, and so, the true advertisement will not have success. It seems that there is a tendency nowadays; people prefer to be told lies to feel more confident than being aware of the truth. That is why I think that only the advertisements which make products look better than they really are are more successful."}
{"file_id": "1171007.txt", "output_essay": "Today, many advertisements are promoting numerous products. And they are making profits more than what they supposed to have. There are a couple of reasons for it. \n\nFirstly, most advertisements have some kind of bubble. The bubble I am talking about is the one that makes advertisements look more fancy and valuable. For example, they entertain themselves so they can show their appearance to people, making people think those advertisements are really good and supporting those advertisements. Another example is that they use commercial shows. Many people spend time watching commercial shows when they are watching television. And most advertisements use commercial shows and entertainment. So, most advertisements can make products seem much better than they really are.\n\nSecondly, they help each other and make more profits by sharing information or providing assistance. And they entertain each other to attract other people who do not know much about those advertisements. So, they get more people and they get more profit and products more than what they supposed to have.\n\nMany advertisements are making products much better than what they supposed to make. However, I think it is one of the skills for them. And advertisements are one of the members of the cycle of economy. So, I think those are not that bad except for some of the other things that have so many bubbles."}
{"file_id": "1165367.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.\n\nDue to advancements in technological and financial markets, access to money is easy. Because of the excess liquidity in the current economies around the world, many companies are expanding their businesses. There are a number of companies that are producing the same kind of products. They themselves know that it is extremely difficult to produce something different every now and then. But they all have realized one way of selling the same products in different packaging to customers.\n\nAdvertisements!!\n\nNow, technically, they know that they can't differentiate their own product from other products available in the market. Let's take an example of a car advertisement. It's an entry-level car, Hyundai Santro. They have Mr. Shahrukh Khan (a popular film star) as their brand ambassador for India. In their advertisement, it's shown that Mr. Shahrukh goes for a long drive with his girlfriend (who is again a big film star). Now, everyone in the world knows that Mr. Shahrukh sends a BMW to pick up his kids from school and drove a Santro in the advertisement for the first and last time in his life. But people are fascinated by this and buy cars just believing that if he uses it, it has to be a good car. Having one myself, I know it is a good car, but not because of the advertisement. They show that if you use this car, then you may get good-looking girl friends, but actually, it has nothing to do with the car.\n\nI think it is appropriate to discuss the example of an advertisement of Bournvita. It is a drink for growing children. They claim in advertisements that if children drink this, they will grow faster and healthier. Now, if that was the case, then the producer should be the richest person on planet earth. I agree with their claims regarding the content of the drink mix, calorie content, and presence of proteins, etc., but I can't believe this increase in height part.\n\nLet's take another example for a telecom service provider. In its advertisement, they claim that they provide hassle-free and customer-oriented service in their outlets. I fell into the trap and took the connection. For the first time when I went to the outlet for a complaint, I was left there to wait for half an hour. Eventually, after having a verbal argument, I took a pledge not to believe advertisements.\n\nI believe that to survive in this cutthroat world, companies will always invent ways to sell their products. Advertisements are one of them. Whatever you see on TV, you should not believe it, as nothing in this world is as simple as it appears."}

When the first Nokia portable phone that was compatible with a camera came out, advertisements all around showed that you could videotape scenes and take snapshots of friends. When people actually bought the product, what they actually saw was reality. Another example is when the iPod was released. Everyone was shocked about how a device smaller than a calculator could store more than a thousand songs. When people went and bought it, they saw how it could do it. It is not that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are; it is about the person who buys the product. Many people, when they see advertisements of new electronic devices, get so happy to see something new and something that functions in a new way. So, when they buy the product and use it every day, they get bored of it. So, when the person remembers how the product looked on billboards and newspapers and compares it with him after owning it for two months, he will think that the advertisement made the product seem much better than it really is. The reality is that the person has been using the product effectively, which leads to him getting bored of it. My opinion is that most advertisements show what the real product is, and they don't exaggerate on the product. Another problem is that many people understand the advertisement wrong. When the person goes to buy the product and finds out that it doesn't function the way he thought it did, the individual then gets unsatisfied. I think that people should understand the advertisement and what they are trying to say, and understand the message that they are trying to send."}

Teenagers have enough to do helping themselves, so they may even be the only age group who should not be blamed for being a bit selfish. But even after you reach your twenties successfully, there is a high number of really ignorant and selfish people. It goes on during every age class.\n\nIt is easy to blame the young ones, but even most middle-aged and older people are looking away if something uncomfortable happens.\n\nAnyway, this does not mean that the statement, that young people nowadays do not care enough, is wrong. If there are too many people in every age class who do not spend enough time to help their communities, the younger ones are included. But in my opinion, most times, they are at least the most helpful-oriented group, at least after they managed their teenage years. Just because there are more often more open-minded young people than older ones.\n\nWhich brings us to the word 'nowadays.' It is likely that in past times, the family bond was stronger, so there was more help within most families for each other. But the community does not mean only the people we love, but also people who are totally different, with opinions we don't share, with behaviors we don't understand. But to help the community means even to help them, if help is needed. To help some stranger on the street was way more uncommon in past times, but today. And even if most of the charity organizations have mostly older members and helpers, it doesn't mean that the younger generation doesn't care.

{"file_id": "1167441.txt", "output_essay": "The perspicacious phrase, 'On the move,' has probably been termed after much thought. Research shows that since the dawn of civilization, man has been a tourist in a crude sense. This is evident in the study of nomads, shifting agriculture, and the like. However, my purpose in highlighting this fact is not to discuss history but to merely initiate the debate whether there will be fewer cars in the coming twenty years or not. In my opinion, the number of cars produced in the future will be on the rise rather than passing a decline. I would like to support my stand with the following reasons.\n\nThe automotive industry has witnessed a manifold increase since man invented the wheel. So, to believe that this rise will ever decline is highly unlikely and improbable. Firstly, economic reviews show that living conditions will improve in the future, which means people will have greater leisure time. That goes out to suggest that people will have more time to spend with their families and go out on vacations, and using cars, people can drive to farther destinations.\n\nEven if the thought is inclined towards the rich, there is another reason to believe why car production will increase. There has always been a focus on science and technology improving the nature of things, and cars are not an exception. In fact, a lot of investment is going into making solar cars and better fuel-efficient cars. Certainly, the expenditure being done on the research is not to never make use of it in the future. This suggests that people want to have more cars in the future.\n\nLastly, necessity is being combined with luxury in the economic arena as of today. When people have a proportionate rise in income, they use less of public utility services. Taking the middle-income group as an example, I would like to illustrate that an increase in income always shifts people's preferences to personalize commodities. One would definitely want to own something when one has the money to do so, and with the economic development throughout the world, people would like to switch to owning their own cars rather than using the public transport system.\n\nTherefore, I believe that indeed there will be more cars in the years to come."}
{"file_id": "1169565.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with the statement that 'Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.' Successful people are those who continually experiment to make existing things less complicated, and they are the ones who develop new things. For example, in early times, people used to travel by carts. But nowadays, we are able to travel overseas. We use cars, airplanes, and helicopters. If man hadn't tried new things or used his innovative mind, he wouldn't have been able to design new and faster ways of transportation.\n\nMoreover, for success, taking risks and doing new things is necessary. For example, in my family, my mother is a housewife, and my grandmother was also a housewife. But I want to be a scientist, so I am going against our conventional rules and regulations. I am trying new things that nobody in my family has tried, like planning to go abroad to get a doctoral degree, as my country is a developing one. So, I personally believe in the above statement.\n\nWe should always try new things and give innovative ideas to this world. Making new technologies by taking risks is the key to success. For example, if nobody had tried going to the moon, we wouldn't be able to explore and know how the moon looks and what its properties are.\n\nBut sometimes, trying new things can be dangerous too. For example, Kalpana Chawla, a famous astronaut of NASA, died when her spacecraft was coming back to Earth after making some valuable discoveries.\n\nBut in the long run, 'Success goes to those people who keep on trying new things instead of sticking to old things.'"}

Nowadays, oil is very expensive. We also have to change something. New technologies are necessary. A new generation of car technology is a good start. It is called hybrid. These cars have two motors. One is the traditional Otto motor, and the other one is an electric one. This kind of car is very economical. They run on oil when they are in normal mode. In this mode, they load up the batteries for the electric mode. After a short ride, especially fast rides (which produce more energy), you can use the electric motor. We have to support technical research to improve inventions like this. In the future, it will be more important to allocate money for research.\n\nAnother point that underlines the theory is that there are countries in the world that are now beginning to have cars. In China, for example, it was not common to have a car. But this country is increasing so rapidly that in the future, they will have millions of cars."}

On the same lines, it can be said that success follows people who try new horizons, who extend their limit of vision and dare to take on new challenges in a world that is ever-changing. I think that successful people keep trying new things and do not get stuck on any one thing.\n\nThe world has seen many industrialists who tried different businesses. Though they succeeded in some and failed in others, on the whole, they emerged as winners. One bright example that I would like to mention is that of an Indian businessman - Tata. Tata put his first foot in the world of business with an automobile manufacturing unit. He collaborated with foreign companies to provide the best available technologies to customers. The business started with trucks but soon flourished to other classes of vehicles. Recently, Tata introduced the cheapest four-wheeler on Indian roads for the common man. This journey is amazing. But this is not the only thing that Tata did.\n\nTata started different businesses apart from automobiles. Tea, salt, information technology, telecom - he seems to be ubiquitous. He is also successful in these businesses. Now he is planning to take over the world-famous brand 'Jaguar'. Certainly, Tata took great risks when he started every new industry. But great returns demand great risks. A man with vision can handle such risks and emerge out as a winner. These are all qualities of a successful person.\n\nHad Tata been interested only in the manufacturing of trucks, he never would have had such a great impact on all other business areas. He tried out new things, and his efforts paid off. His success surely belongs to the way he conquered new opportunities of business.\n\nThus, it can surely be said that one who does the same thing that he already knows how to do well will have less chance to succeed than the one who tries different things and takes calculated risks for greater rewards."}

This is possible because the higher degree the student has, the higher wages and more power in the company they would require, but the student can only help the company's financial department. However, the other student has some background knowledge of business and financial, so this student could be able to help the company in two departments, which makes this student come across as more valuable and useful.\n\nMoreover, the student who has broad knowledge of different subjects has more opportunities to get a better job and be able to make more money. The multi-knowledge helps people make friends more easily, especially if you have some common interests with people. It is a key to making different types of friends around the world.

Rather than using creativity in the preparation process, they just exaggerate the properties of the products. After all these deceptions, the products can be perceived as much more valuable by the public.\n\nIn order to avoid these types of misleading advertisements, there should be an effective control mechanism, like a properly working group that investigates the advertisements before they are published. A second solution might be strict regulations, such as fining the misleading companies, etc.\n\nSecondly, these advertisements only emphasize the positive attributes of the product but give no information about its drawbacks. In this way, people who buy the product do not know the weak points of the products. For instance, a product that can clean only smooth surfaces might be used by the owner on a rough surface, which will probably cause deformation to the product. Here, it can be stated that this problem is caused by the advertisement, which did not include the constraints of the product.\n\nFinally, there is a great competition between the products of different companies, which causes the omission of some ethical values. Rather than stating the drawbacks, praising is a common style in the advertisements.\n\nTo conclude, the advertisements are misleading in most ways, and these faults must be corrected by means of a proper control mechanism.

It may be true that a group tour is the most convenient way to travel because a tour guide knows a lot about the place, and there seems to be no waste of time thanks to the well-prepared plan. However, I think that traveling by ourselves is more enjoyable than a group tour, and there are three reasons that support my idea.\n\nFirst, by traveling individually, you can go anywhere at any time. For example, if you go to one tourist attraction in a group and you find the place attractive, you have to just pass through and cannot see the place well because of the time limit.\n\nNext, you can meet local people. If you are in a group tour, local people are not interested in you because you already have a lot of company, and the local people see you as one of them. However, if you go to the sight alone, it draws local people's attention, and they might talk to you or at least be nice to you. Moreover, since they live there, they know where to go better than guides or guidebooks. In addition, you can know what the traditions and cultures of the region are, which guidebooks do not tell you.\n\nFinally, you can be independent. To travel alone is not always just fun.

{"file_id": "1167334.txt", "output_essay": "Everyone has different opinions, and it depends on different backgrounds. The one who agrees that travel should be led by a tour guide may think it will save more time, be much cheaper, and be efficient. The others think traveling by themselves may be a better choice, as they think they can travel according to their own plan and do whatever they want. By comparing the pros and cons, I think the former one is better and more instrumental in being led by a tour guide. I will explain it and give some concrete examples.\n\nFirstly, being led by a tour guide will save much more time. Let us imagine we are walking in a fabulous city, appreciating the amazing views, the lake is so beautiful, the weather is so nice, and we just walk and walk without stopping, finally, we cannot even move a foot, after a whole day of walking, we just see the natural view of the city. The city is big, and we are small; it is impossible for us to reach every corner of the city, as we do not know which place is famous, which way is a shortcut, or which bus we should take. However, if we have a tour guide, everything will become easy. The tour guide will lead us to the interesting places, some famous, but more importantly, some others we would never have the chance to know or find if we did not have a tour guide; the guide will also tell us how to get there and which bus we should take. Is it not a great feeling that you do not need to think about anything, but just have fun?\n\nSecondly, it will save more money. The tour guide always has some discounts from the majority of hotels and suites; they can easily book a room at a lower price. They can give us many coupons when we buy something.\n\nThirdly, it is more efficient. We can visit many more places than we would if we did not have a guide. When we arrive at the airport, there is a bus just outside waiting for us; when we go to a restaurant, the meal is ready for us; when we need to leave, someone is telling us.\n\nLast but not least, we can share our experience with other group members, and we can easily find someone to take a picture for you. In conclusion, to travel in a group led by a tour guide can save more time, save more money, and help you arrange things more efficiently."}

If we have a tour guide, then he knows all about the history of the place.\n\nWhile we have a tour guide, we have no worry about planning a schedule for where to visit. Because the tour guide knows all the places in a particular location or all. He may plan the schedule according to our requirements. Generally, he knows all places and, moreover, he has a myriad collection of historic events that we have to know. Which is the best place to see first and which is the place to see last?\n\nThe tour guide guides us on where we have to stay, an approximate budget for planning the tour. And he may know the shortcuts to visit more places and boarding and lodging facilities. He explains about the places with their people's cultures, behaviors, and historic events of those places.\n\nWe may save money while having a tour guide by his right direction about shopping, lodging, boarding, etc. Because he has a lack of experience in traveling and demonstrating different places.\n\nIf we are able to go without a guide, then some problems will occur, such as we don't know the specific location correctly.

Nowadays, advertisements are used very commonly to support the selling process of a product. There are advertisements on TV, in newspapers, etc. Advertisement is a special part of marketing, and it gives the possibility to show a new product to possible customers. Its main goal is to attract new customers for a particular product. The customer should think positively about this product and buy it.\n\nAs I mentioned before, the customer should have a positive impression of the product. To reach that goal, the advertisement will, of course, just show the strengths of this particular product.\n\nHowever, some advertisements may not really show the truth about the strengths and weaknesses of a product. I think that these advertisements are a few negative cases.\n\nAnother point is that the people from the marketing agencies, who design the advertisements, cannot tell lies about the product. People would recognize that lie just after they buy the product, and they would never buy a product from that company again.\n\nCompanies want to satisfy customers, and that wouldn't happen if they show advertisements that are not true.\n\nAs I mentioned before, I think that advertisements show the best part of a product without showing the negative parts.

Although this issue may never be resolved to everyone's satisfaction, the matter is very clear in my mind: I disagree with the statement that all advertisements successfully attract consumers. Many advertisements do not make products seem much better than they really are.\n\nIt is evident that not all advertisements succeed in attracting consumers for several reasons. To begin with, some advertisements discourage people from purchasing the products. To illustrate, in many countries, the advertisements of tobacco products have warning sentences on them. When I traveled in Australia, I detected that even the photos of lung cancers were used in the advertisements. In this case, the advertisements warn us of the possibility of danger caused by using the products. Indeed, the advertisements of tobacco products do not make the products appear better.\n\nFurthermore, some advertisements utilize a unique strategy to attract consumers. For example, Yukiguni-maitake, a Japanese food products company, uses a conspicuous strategy: its advertisement says, 'Do not buy our products.' This advertisement is unusual, and therefore, many consumers are attracted and finally buy the products. In view of this, the advertisements sometimes apply a unique strategy that does not appeal to the merits of the products.\n\nNevertheless, some critics claim that the advertisements' role is to appeal to the products. However, the fact, as detailed above, reveals that some advertisements try to prevent customers from buying their products.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that advertisements usually use different strategies to attract customers.

Although some people think that car usage will increase from nowadays. Because they think that the car is the most difficult thing to improve and it does not have side effects. But I think that there will be a decrease in car usage in the future. There are several reasons.\n\nFirst, nowadays, there is a problem that oil and gas are being reduced due to unplanned excavation. So, it causes a lack of oil to move. It means that although we have a lot of cars, we cannot drive because there is no oil to move. Therefore, we need to find other substitutes for oil or alternative methods for movement. I think that finding alternative methods for movement outweighs finding other oil sources.\n\nSecond, cars cause air pollution. Actually, cars produce CO2 and NOx, which increase the earth's temperature. So, the height of the sea is increasing. Maybe our lands will be under water. Imagine that condition - you do not have land to plant and live on. From these problems, many humans are studying to find other methods to move that do not cause air pollution.\n\nThird, cars are inconvenient.

The space allocated for vehicles will soon be insufficient. Population growth directly contributes to the increase in the number of drivers on the road. Highways, hundreds of meters tall, will anyway be fully congested with drivers. With limited space or land throughout a country, any single government would surely take the step of reducing the number of cars on the road, which also causes pollution.\n\nAs does the government here in Malaysia, they are trying their best to reduce the number of cars on the road. One move made by the Malaysian government to reduce the number of cars is by imposing taxes. By imposing a heavy percentage of taxes on imported as well as local cars, it was believed to be an incentive for drivers to find an alternative mode of transport. However, this has obviously been proven less effective. This automatically brought them to reducing the number of drivers instead. For example, an action taken by the government is by setting an older age limit for wannabe drivers to be competent on the road.\n\nThis delay of upcoming drivers is also supported by another wise move, which, like any other country, is by improving the country's public transportation. Public transportation is the one and only solution that can help curb future congestions on the road. Take, for example, the train. Easy accessibility, low and flat-priced tickets, and large-sized public transportation are the perfect characteristics of a highly effective mode of vehicle, which many governments are vying to achieve. The most obvious example of a highly effective public transport is none other than the bullet train located in Japan. Another example is the country, Australia, which I have visited. The sight of seeing only a small number of cars on the roads of Australia has clearly shown me, as a Malaysian, what my country should be like.

This all leads to an increase in population in the world.\n\nAnother aspect is that of freedom of opportunities. In our year, we do not have slavery or other criminal actions, besides war, that can lead to death. The USA and other countries provide starving African kids with food and medication. They also teach them the knowledge that is general to us, for example, using a condom to prevent the most known virus in the world, HIV.\n\nMore high-economic countries help citizens of countries with lower economies to share technical knowledge, which helps these citizens to grow their economy. Thus, the people have a longer living time.\n\nThrough all these factors, in my opinion, people will drive more cars than today.

Technology is becoming more and more advanced now. In the future, we will not use gas or petroleum to drive cars. We will use electricity to replace gas or petroleum. Thus, the air will be fresh, and the greenhouse effect will decline as well. This will make environmental groups support people driving.\n\nI do not agree with this topic because, second, when you drive a car, you can feel calm, safe, and warm. You can drive anywhere with your family, wherever they want to arrive. You can have your own space that public transportation cannot give you. You can also avoid being bothered by other people on the way to your destination. This reason is really important to people who have families or children.\n\nI do not agree with this topic because, third, you can show your status. For instance, you can drive a Benz to buy fruits or vegetables, and that will make everyone know that you are rich. Also, when you meet old friends, you can let them know that you are not the same person as before! I know this sounds arrogant, but it is practical, right?\n\nTo sum up, many people might advocate another opinion. However, according to the three main reasons I mentioned, I totally disagree with the topic that in twenty years, cars will be less."}
{"file_id": "1170027.txt", "output_essay": "I think success can be achieved in different ways, not only by taking risks and chances. In the coming paragraphs, different points will be stated and discussed in order to properly analyze the statement given.\n\nFirst of all, success can be a relative term, because for some it may mean owning a private jet and having millions of dollars, but for others, success could simply be having a good, small business that maintains their family and gives them a decent life. Not everybody wants the same things; some just want to live a quiet, normal life and nothing more. Taking a risk is a possibility, but never a sure thing.\n\nAlso, it's difficult to achieve success in life, since it requires many abilities from a person. There are many key ingredients involved in the process of maybe achieving success. It takes hard work, dedication, being fully prepared, and intelligence. Usually, people don't achieve success by accident. It takes years and years, and sometimes that is not enough. Just because a person has all those ingredients doesn't guarantee them a bright future full of riches. Most people have worked hard all their life but haven't gotten anywhere they want to go.\n\nAnother important point is the fact that success can be achieved by doing what a person already knows how to do well. Sometimes it's as simple as that. To work hard at your craft and make smart moves can equally take you towards success. For example, if a person studies economics and ends up working at the NYSE, he can achieve a fortune by just putting to work all those years of studying he did in college or university. By just applying his knowledge to the stock market and making smart choices, he can become rich, but he can also lose it all. It's not so much about risk but about making smart choices.\n\nIn conclusion, I would like to be clear that while many people have taken risks and tried new things in order to achieve success, where some have won, many more have failed. Success is never a sure thing, and even if a person achieves it, the possibility still exists that it won't last for long. Once you get to the top, the only other way to go is down, since it's not only difficult to reach the top but to be able to stay there. So, in the end, I don't agree with the statement given. Nothing in life is certain, only death and taxes."}
{"file_id": "1173560.txt", "output_essay": "I believe that it is very difficult to understand ideas and concepts, and it is simpler and faster to learn facts. In my opinion, you can understand a fact without knowing the ideas and concepts about it, but you can't understand ideas if there are no facts and practical examples that support the idea!\n\nIt is difficult to understand ideas because they are made by other people with concepts and ways of thinking different from yours. And also, people have different ideas on different arguments, so it is not possible to explain or describe something in one way or in one idea; everyone can have various and different ideas.\n\nIdeas can often be manipulated by people who want their idea to be dominant. A fact, to the contrary, can't be changed; it is the same for everybody, and its evidence proves that it cannot be changed.\n\nA fact can also be funny, scary, or interesting... it can give an emotional impression, which is easier to remember than an idea. If students learn facts, they can make connections between those facts and ideas and concepts that they already have.\n\nIn my way of thinking, for example, learning facts is very important while one is studying history: when children learn about Nazism and the Holocaust, they can't understand the meaning of these words if they don't know what happened, so they can't understand if they don't know the facts!\n\nThis could happen also in other subjects like biology: concepts and ideas are made only after a fact has been observed! Only after knowing facts is it possible to figure out the meaning of the concepts. Ideas have to be supported by facts! The first step and the most efficient way to learn is to know and learn facts."}

In other words, everybody has started to live for just their benefits. No one asks for a thing that another wants to do. And young people are the biggest example of this. They do not give enough time to helping their communities. There are several places where this thing happens.\n\nFirstly, young people ignore the important things that are related to their local place. For example, the apartment that they live in is going to be cleaned. And the older people ask for help from the young people to clean the apartment. But young people who are staying in that apartment ignore the older people.\n\nSecondly, the young people do not help their parents in their housework or house problems as well. For example, the television of the house has broken down. And on that day, the mum and the dad can be very busy because of other problems. They ask their young son to take the television to the repairer. However, even the young man does not listen to them. Instead of taking the television to the repairer, he goes to a basketball game.\n\nThus, I believe that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities. They just think of themselves."}
{"file_id": "1172944.txt", "output_essay": "Responsibility plays a big role in our lives, specifically for older people. When a young child is having fun, they don't care about money, home, and issues that happen to any person. Young people think that they still have good health, but when they get older, their health will start to decline. I agree with young people who want to have fun more than older people for a couple of reasons.\n\nFirst of all, responsibility, as I mentioned in the beginning, makes any person think about how to make their life more confident and never think about how to enjoy life except after finishing everything they wanted to do. For example, in any family, the father always thinks about how to get money for his children, and the mother looks after the children and tries to help her husband financially. If we look at the children, we can notice that they want to play every day and have fun without thinking about anything. That was a good example of showing the difference in how young and old people act.\n\nSecondly, old people always start to take care of their health, which absolutely declines as they get older. On the other hand, young people think about no responsibility and no problems with their health, so why don't they enjoy their lives before anything happens in the future? For example, if someone who is 60 years old and has retired from their job could have health problems that refuse them to enjoy their life. Another man who is 20 years old, who has just finished high school and wants to play sports and go out with his friends without any health problems, that is, if we ignore the exceptions like the handicapped.\n\nFinally, I agree with young people to have fun with their life before they get older because they will have more responsibilities than before. Also, nobody knows about their health and how good it's going to be. I hope everyone enjoys their life, whether they are old or young."}
{"file_id": "1172794.txt", "output_essay": "The students' teaching method is very controversial between the approach focused on the facts and the other more based on the concepts and the ideas.\n\nI agree with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts for three main reasons: understanding ideas can help the student to understand facts, it is easier to learn facts individually, and understanding ideas allow the student to develop its own reflection and criticism.\n\nFirstly, it seems to me that when a student understands ideas and concepts, it will help them to understand the facts. Indeed, it would not be very interesting for a student to learn a succession of facts without knowing why these facts are happening. For example, historical facts are numerous, and it is impossible to keep all of them, but if you understand the ideas of a special historical event, you can learn better all the facts that are associated with this event.\n\nSecondly, I think that it is easier to learn the facts individually than to understand ideas and concepts. As a matter of fact, the professor can give their students keys that will help them to understand the idea. On the contrary, the facts are not difficult to understand, and also the support of the professor is not indispensable. The professor can illustrate the facts with personal experiences and therefore make them more interesting, but they will not change the facts.\n\nFinally, I believe that the understanding of ideas and concepts for a student is the basis of the development of their own reflections and also to have criticism. By identifying the structure of a concept or an idea, the student can develop their own ideas and build also a thinking system. For instance, a student who understands well a special philosophy concept can do their own theory about the concept.\n\nTo conclude, I can say that the understanding of ideas and concepts is the most important part of a student's learning process, even if it is not unnecessary to learn facts, but not as the first priority."}
{"file_id": "1174083.txt", "output_essay": "I am completely positive about the statement. Here, I would like to mention some reasons why group travel is the best way to travel. I work for a travel company as a tour guide, so I guess I can confirm the advantages of group traveling.\n\nFirst of all, tourists feel secure when they are traveling with plenty of people and their guide, who is a local resident of the site. Group travelers can defend themselves in difficult times and it is more likely to attract public attention when requesting help. In some places, it is suggested to tourists not to go out alone because of the high crime rate.\n\nSecond, I prefer group travel because of the payment for the travel cost. Needless to say, it is noticeably cheaper than single travel for certain countries. Even a number of tour companies offer special programs for group tourists, not only discounts but also free-of-charge trips for group leaders or a certain amount of members.\n\nThe third reason serves our company's main goal: more people, more fun. It is much more interesting to travel with many different people in order to have a real vacation. Group tourists can attend different competitions, matches, and other attractive entertainment.\n\nTraveling is not only about traveling, but also about making friends and building relationships with them. It offers people more chances to make friends in an easier way. I know of many occasions where tourists get married after a long, exciting tour.\n\nIn conclusion, I have a strong point of view about traveling as a group. Tourists feel more secure, have more respect, and guides feel more responsibility when they are traveling as a group."}

In recent years, people have become accustomed to being relaxed. Thus, they do not want to take risks. I strongly believe that successful people should take risks and try new things rather than only doing what they already know how to do well, because they can get a better job and have a respectful situation in society.\n\nTo begin with, one of the most important reasons for trying new things and taking risks is that people can get a better job. It is obvious that if a person is successful, they struggle for gaining much money. Hence, they try to get new opportunities and are ready for new conditions. For example, a man is a police officer and does not complain about his job. However, a successful man wants to be a chef and struggles to get his goal. In addition to getting a better job, another crucial cause of trying new things and taking risks is having a good situation in society. For instance, if a man tries to be successful, everybody around him respects him.\n\nTo sum up, I firmly believe that successful people should take risks and try new things rather than only doing what they already know how to do well, because they can get a better job and have a respectful situation in society."}

Recently, this issue has been brought into focus and has aroused a fierce public debate. Many people hold the opinion that it is due to the colorful advertisements that the products look much better than they really are, while the opinion is strongly opposed by numerous people who believe that all advertisements show the reality to the customers. However, as far as I am concerned, I agree with the former, which is that most advertisements in our daily life make products seem better than they really are.\n\nTo begin with, from my point of view, damaging our health is among the drawbacks of advertisements making products look better than they really are. For instance, in order to get more profits, many medical merchants cheat the consumers by advertising their drugs extravagantly. By using this method, the merchants are likely to become rich; however, many customers who have purchased the medicine may be facing some health problems that the bad medicine brings about. That is why I said some advertisements make products seem better than they really are.\n\nOn the other hand, considerable though the benefits that advertisements result in are, they cannot compete with the drawbacks that the advertisements making products seem much better than they really are bring about, if economic issues have been taken into deliberation. For example, a number of merchants use advertisements to make their products look better in order to make more money, while the customers do not realize the fact, so they often spend large sums of money to buy a worthless product. After a period of time, they finally find out they are cheated. The example tells us that the impacts that ads have on our economic life are huge.\n\nIn conclusion, there may be some elements of truth in the thoughts of some people that advertisements do not make the products seem much better than they really are. However, in my mind, most advertisements that make products seem better than they really are really affect many people's health and possessions. In order to enjoy a healthier and happier life, some measures must be taken to manage the advertising industry to make advertisements tell the truth to the massive customers."}

In many organizations and foundations, there are a lot of young people working to help their communities. A lot of schools also require students to do community service. Sometimes, doing community service is a relaxation for us. We, young people, do want to get involved in our communities.\n\nCommunity service is required by most schools in the United States. Students are required to do a certain amount of hours, whether they like it or not. By doing community service, students help their communities and make time for them because they need to finish their community service requirement in order to pass the grade. Some schools will also give out honors to those who work over the requirement. We students will work harder and give out more hours to the communities to gain those honors. Even though some students are not willing to do the community service, they still give out a lot of time to the communities because of the requirement.\n\nA lot of young people give out their time to the communities to relax and get away from their school work. A lot of the time, students, including me, are tired of the school work and materials and want to relax. I found that helping the communities allows me to relax and not think about my work. At the same time, I'm using my relaxing time to help my community and the people who need my help. It is beneficial to both my community and myself.\n\nIn conclusion, young people nowadays do give enough time to help their communities in many ways.

{"file_id": "1175488.txt", "output_essay": "I believe that people who take risks are successful and smart as well, because life is all about taking risks, especially in today's society where it's all about competition. For example, if a college admission person sees an application with someone who has done what everyone else has done, as in requirements, they will be disappointed with the student. When they see someone who has done things that have never been done before, they will not only be impressed, but they will also take a chance. If you already know how to do an experiment, you should try to improve it by taking a risk and actually doing something much different. Also, if you want to be the owner of a restaurant and you really want it to be the best-selling restaurant, and you are deciding where to locate it, you could name it after a well-known chain of restaurants or you could take a chance and find originality by naming it something else. If you become successful that way, you will feel proud of your creativity, and if you don't become so successful, at least you will feel proud that you failed with your own idea. This is what makes you different from someone else - originality, a risk-taker is what succeeds in life. Knowing how to do something is one step closer to taking a risk and being more successful than you were when you found out you knew how to do something. The next step is making it original and being proud of the positive results or negative in some cases. Being a brain cancer survivor has taught me that taking risks in your life is the best way to live life. I took some risks in the hospital, and now here I am, being successful."}

However, I think this will take a lot of time and space, in terms of words to be written. \n\nHowever, I think that the statement reported in the left frame of this window is to be validated, as no generalization can be done about something, since what we state is just referred to our personal experience. \n\nStarting from this fundamental point that structures my idea on such a topic, I can clearly say that I do not (completely) agree with what is stated. \n\nAs a matter of fact, there are young people who give enough time - sometimes, too much time - for helping the community, and there are, on the contrary, young people who do not want to be involved in this fact. \n\nI think that nowadays the importance given to a generic 'job' (not the one we refer to as the 'money-bringer' process, but the one of something a person can do for a reason or another) depends on the social, cultural, and political environment in which that job is processed. \n\nAs a matter of fact, I think that it is true that young people have different aims in their life, but it is also true that in one way or another, those people could be helping the community even if they do not know they are. \n\nWhat I am stressing is the idea that no one can say with no doubt that a generic person P is making a positive impact on the community instead of a person Q who is not doing well. \n\nI think that this has to be referred to from situation to situation, and no generalization can be used, in any way. \n\nHowever, I can see, from my personal experience within my family, that the thing that years ago guided young people to help the community, for example, helping old people or people with some disease, etc., is no longer present nowadays: I refer to a mind condition, i.e., spiritual support, thinking of others (in Italian, we call it 'altruismo'). \n\nBut nowadays, we look at convenience, mainly (I underline another time, not always). \n\nConvenience is probably the main disease oppressing humanity because convenience makes us do something just for the 'do ut des' criterion, but this is not always the right thing to do. \n\nThis can be found in every field: at work, at school, in sports (I live in Italy...). \n\nIn conclusion, I can remark what I just read in these few lines: no matter what you work for or you work in, no matter what people say to you and what people think about you (in a rational way, obviously), just do what you did for so long, and you will help your community as much as you can."}
{"file_id": "1174410.txt", "output_essay": "The term 'successful' is related to achieving goals and dreams, but to achieve a goal means to take a risk and do new things. So, that is why successful people like to take risks, because they know they can take the opportunity and exploit it to the maximum, and that's how they go ahead. With a risk, there is always a finish line, the goal. So, when successful people see that goal in their lives, they see it and do not look back or look both sides; they keep their minds focused on what they want, and that is why they get success.\n\nNowadays, successful people take risks, try new things, and seize opportunities, opportunities that require them to try new things, opportunities that will earn them experience. They do not only do what they do best; instead, they are in search of new capacities they didn't even know they had.\n\nFor example, Bill Gates was a man who one day woke up and decided to take a risk, a new opportunity, a new thing, something that no one had thought about. Maybe at those days when Microsoft didn't exist, people thought that Bill Gates was crazy, but they didn't know what that decision would make him today.Bill Gates is successful now because he took an opportunity that anybody else wanted to grab.\n\nI agree with the statement 'Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well' because we have to go out into the world and explore new things to see if we are good at other things. There are a lot of people who have been successful just by taking risks, so that means we can do it too.

{"file_id": "1172599.txt", "output_essay": "Within the following essay, I discuss whether people trying new things and taking more risks are more successful than people using well-established practices.\n\nTo begin with, I provide a principal definition of success, because it is a question of perspective whether someone is successful or not. Secondly, I highlight several arguments on the topic before concluding with my own opinion on it.\n\nSuccess is, within a society, normally a well-constructed and established value. Every value consists normally of an imagination of distinctive goals. Instead, success itself is not adequate to a constructed goal but needs to be constructed by each community of people. Within Western countries, who share the same principles of economy and society, success can be defined as earning a lot of money, having a family, or simply being happy, whatever this would say. Now, my perspective focuses on the economic perspective by earning a lot of money, and therefore, I define success by it.\n\nBy stretching the economic face of success, I need to differentiate between new products and well-established products. New products are normally accompanied by a bigger amount of risks and also by a larger scale of innovativity than established products are. The example of franchising, which worked on earlier, fits quite well. It is relatively easy to buy the right of a huge company like Burger King and to produce its products, but it also highlights the limitations of one's own freedom to establish something own. While starting one's proper business is relatively costly for oneself and is followed by the uncertainty of acceptance of the product, it lets some room for creativity and personality. Additionally, new innovative products could be sold for a higher price.\n\nNevertheless, it could not be denied that you can earn money with both possibilities. Perhaps it's not really a question of success in this case, but of making it a special way.\n\nFor my conclusion, I emphasize on the hope of everyone to have success that leads people to start something new and innovative against all odds. This hope might be imaginative, but it leads researchers to new inventions and, at all, humanity to progress. So, it would be necessary for humanity, but not for economic success at a short range. By using well-established practices, you can succeed too, and by stretching on the example of new products, you need an established name to sell products better.\n\nTherefore, it's the mixture of both, risk and new ways as well as well-established ways that leads to overall success, for individuals, enterprises, and humanity."}
{"file_id": "1174292.txt", "output_essay": "As we know that in this world, everyone wants freedom, and no one wants to be a slave. Because they think that they were born as individuals. According to this statement, I do not agree with the following statement. Because it's not necessary to go in a group or be led by a tour guide. The main purpose of a tour guide is to lead the team and show the direction. In a group or with a tour guide, there are lots of boundaries, like we have to move with the group only. We can't move as we like to move anywhere. We have to follow all the instructions given by the group leader. Even if we like that place or not, we have to stay with them. Lots of problems can be faced at the time of travel. If we are going in a group, we can't leave that place without permission. So, nowadays, in our society, nobody wants restrictions; they want to move freely and enjoy anywhere. Like I am taking the example of college students, if they are going on a picnic for five days with the permission of the college principal. The college principal suggests that they go with a tour guide, so that in the future, they will not face any problems. But the students were not in agreement because they want to go without a guide or any faculty member. They want only freedom, because then only they can enjoy anywhere and use their time in a better way. Sometimes we need a tour guide, but not every time, and also we must keep in mind that up to a certain limit, freedom must be there; if it exceeds, it will not be good for the individual. In my opinion, the best way is to travel without any tour guide, but we have to manage all the things in a right manner and in a systematic way.

{"file_id": "1175412.txt", "output_essay": "In my personal opinion, young people do not spend enough time helping their communities when it is needed. Our personal goals focus on ourselves, whereas others' generations' goals focused on the community. There may be many reasons why this change came upon us; however, I guess the most important one is related to our new style of life. Our way of life pushes us to worry about personal things rather than global ones. We care about our personal image, our personal grants, and our personal skills. We have to. However, we must try to change and we ought to realize what is happening outside, and in fact, we should give our helping hand. Anyway, I think young people are not to blame for this kind of selfishness, but they are unaware.\n\nFirst of all, we have acquired a new way of life. We do live comfortably. Our parents usually provide us with everything we need. Everywhere, it seems as if nobody needs anything from us as long as we live. Our community is rich, and everyone can reach a good position as long as this person works. Thus, our goal is not related to our community, in which everything runs 'perfectly well,' but it is focused on ourselves. Our own complaints and artificial needs are highlighted. We have to be perfect, not just good, but perfect. We have to worry about such things in order to survive in this 'ideal community.'\n\nInasmuch as we are so worried about ourselves, we are not able to see the problems our community has; we are not aware of that.\n\nRegarding this lack of awareness, we can explain why we do not help, but we cannot avoid trying to make people realize their selfishness. We have to take a look at our reality. We must do more for our community than we are doing up to now. It is a good chance not only for the community but for us to grow."}

Yet, I am convinced that they are necessary in order to be successful. \n\nRisking can be frightening - I will not deny it. However, if you do not risk, you miss important opportunities to improve your condition. Every decision in life, from everyday to once-in-a-lifetime ones, implies some risk. If you are not able to take risks, this means that you are not able to take challenging decisions, with the obvious results. \n\nFurthermore, in certain situations, taking a risk can make the difference between someone who just accepts what he or she has (but might regret what he or she has not) and someone who is really satisfied. Just think of a recently graduated student who receives a very interesting offer that requires moving to another country: should he stay home and try to find an average job or accept it? I am convinced he should accept it and leave straight away, otherwise, he might simply regret it for the rest of his life. \n\nOn a less personal level, there are contests where trying new things is almost mandatory. This is the case, for example, of researchers: questioning the status quo, trying out different possible solutions is necessary in order to find out new things - and where would the world be without new inventions? I cannot imagine a researcher who does not want to try new things. \n\nFor all these reasons, I am convinced that successful people are those who are not afraid of risking. People who just keep doing what they are good at just miss out on opportunities - because that is what change really is."}

The effect of this phenomenon is negative. The products are not that good as shown in the advertisement. And also, it sometimes leads to a waste of money.\n\nFirst, the product that you saw through TV or the Internet and bought because it seemed really good is not that good.

But when he got it, the product's shape was not that cool as shown on TV. And also, the sound system was not really good at all. So, he really regretted the fact that he bought it.\n\nSecondly, since you buy the products that looked good on TV without checking the information about it, it's a waste of money. Often, when you turn the TV on, a lot of advertisements about movies are advertised. And it makes the movie look really good. So, when you go to see that movie, you might be disappointed.

The advertisement looked exciting with the action it got, but in the real movie, there were few actions, and the story was unacceptable to me.\n\nI think not all advertisements make the products look better than they are in real life, but most of them do.

They can do whatever they want to do, and they can experience a lot of new things that older people have never seen, such as computer video games, MSN, ICQ, and so on.\n\nOn the other hand, older people also enjoy their life. With the developments of science and technology, the condition of people's living environment becomes better and better. The older people can live longer and longer than before. The older people become more and more energetic and healthier than before. What's more, the older people can enjoy the wonderful time with their children, their grandchildren who can bring a lot of interesting and funny things to their parents or grandparents. Also, the community of people's living becomes better and better, older people can take part in lots of activities. Older people can sing with other older people, they can dance, and whatever they want to do.\n\nSweeping generalizations are impossible here. In a world where I think both young and old are enjoying their life better and better."}

I believe that most ads make people buy things without thinking clearly. They do this by making the things look better than they are. There are two main reasons why ads are made. First, ads can make products seem perfect. Often, famous people who are liked by many show these products. If we see these products over and over, we start to believe they are good. Second, companies usually don't talk about the bad parts of their products. They only focus on the good parts because it makes them more money to hide the problems."}

A person can do one thing or job well but can have many interests. Take doctors as an example. There is so much medical knowledge today. A doctor can't know everything about all medical topics. If they try, their understanding will be basic and not very helpful to their patients. That's why doctors choose to focus on areas like children's health, cancer, or heart surgery. The more you focus on a smaller area, the better you understand it. But as said before, a person can do one job well. Their interests can also help their job. So, in this time, it's very important to focus on one area to do well."}

If I only focus on one subject, it might limit where I can work in the future. Also, if I only know about one thing, I could have trouble talking to business people from other countries. In the end, I think learning about many different subjects is a good idea."}

The guide will quickly and safely show you the main spots. You'll also learn a lot about where you are. Plus, you can meet new people and share stories with them. Seeing the local culture, like food, dances, and festivals, is key when traveling. A tour guide can really help you see and understand these things. They can also tell you about the area's history, which helps you get why the local people act the way they do.\n\nBut, if you've been to the place before, especially more than once, getting a guide is not worth it. It costs a lot and takes time you could spend better. The guide will take you to spots you've seen. You could instead go to new places and do things you didn't do last time.\n\nIn the end, it all comes down to if you've been there before. I'd say yes to a guide for first-timers. But if you've visited already, I don't think you need one."}
{"file_id": "108118.txt", "output_essay": "Many things show that the number of cars will keep going up in the future. Looking at how cars have gotten more popular in the last twenty years, we shouldn't expect this to suddenly change. Cars are cheaper now, so more people can buy them, including young people. In the United States, most people have their own car by the time they are sixteen. I think another issue is how cars are making us more likely to be overweight. In rich countries, people are getting heavier and lazier, so they prefer to drive because it's easier. However, some people know that cars hurt the environment. They choose not to own a car because they don't want to harm the Earth. I recently saw a TV show talking about the world running out of oil. Without oil, we can't run our cars. This might not happen soon, but scientists are looking for new, cleaner ways to power engines. Still, I think it will be a long time before these new methods are available to everyone. So, I don't think there will be fewer cars in 20 years."}
{"file_id": "108094.txt", "output_essay": "Nowadays, people should see a tour guide as someone who helps those who are lost. I like to travel with a group that has a tour guide because it makes things easier and more comfortable for me. When my family goes to another country, we worry about how we will get to our place to stay and who will show us around. The tour guide is the person who takes us to our hotel and tells us about the city or country. He knows a lot because he is from there. Traveling with a tour guide taught us a lot. For example, in England, we saw many statues, parks, trees, trains, and rivers. The tour guide told us when and where each was made, its history, and how long it has been there. We learned a lot and got to know more about England. If we don't have a tour guide, we might get lost. A tour guide is like a bright star that helps those who are lost. Once, in Australia, we tried to go without a tour guide. We had many problems. We looked for a park from the afternoon until night and got lost when we finally got there. To sum up, it's better to have a tour guide because he helps people who are lost."}

I run a support group to keep our city park clean. I have noticed this problem too and I agree with the article. I often wonder why young people don't want to join in on things that make their community better. Not having enough time is the main reason they give. Young people are busy today. If they don't have a lot of homework from school, their parents will find other activities for them. Friends matter a lot too. Doing things with friends seems better to them than doing things for the community. Helping the community is good for the community and for the people who help. Being together is important for humans. To end, we need to do more to get young people to help their community. Schools and parents should lead this effort. They should show the good things that come from helping and not get in the way!"}
{"file_id": "112269.txt", "output_essay": "I think the idea that successful people try new things and take risks instead of just doing what they know can be argued. Curiosity has led to new inventions and discoveries over time. Humans have gone from hunting for food to using the latest technologies. In this essay, I will look at what makes a person successful and if being hopeful and brave are the only ways to succeed. I will also say why I think being hopeful is good.\n\nLooking back in history, one thing all great leaders have in common is hopefulness. They are not afraid to make brave choices and try new things. For example, George Washington, the first president of America, was always eager to try new things. Abraham Lincoln also got very far in his career by taking risks and trying new things.\n\nI agree that doing what we know lets us do tasks better and with less work. But this does not make us more efficient. Imagine the old days when our ancestors were great hunters. If they had never stopped hunting and started living like modern people, we would not be where we are today.\n\nChallenges are signs that lead us to success. By facing challenges and taking new risks, people get stronger and find new levels of success.\n\nTo end, I want to say that if you want to be very successful, get used to different risks and challenges. If you do this honestly, you will succeed."}

It's not the same to compare young people today with those from fifty years ago or a hundred years ago. Let's say we compare them to young people right after World War II. It's hard to answer because things were different then. There were fewer crowded cities, and many people lived in small towns. In a small town, you often know your neighbors. You might help your neighbor with his garden when he's away because you know him well. In big cities, people usually don't know their neighbors at all.\n\nWe also need to be clear about what 'helping their communities' means. Does it have to help everyone or just one person? It's hard for young people to do things that help everyone. They often don't think about that at their age.\n\nIn the end, I think young people today spend less time helping than their parents did. But I don't think it's because they are selfish. I think it's because our society today is more selfish."}

Being in a group means we probably won't get lost. It's good to be with others. We can talk about what we see and think. If someone gets sick, the group can help them.\n\nSecond, it's great to have a tour guide when we travel. A guide knows the place well and can tell us about its history. The guide shows us important spots we might miss on our own. He also helps us choose where to sleep and eat well.\n\nThird, people often make new friends on the tour. In a group, no one gets bored. When there's free time, everyone can have fun doing things like dancing and singing by the campfire."}
{"file_id": "109326.txt", "output_essay": "I believe it's better for someone to know a lot about one subject than to know a little about many subjects. When you focus on one subject, you understand it well and can talk about it easily and in detail. If you know a little about many subjects, you only understand a bit of each one and can't go deep into any topic. For instance, in a talk or debate, knowing a little about many things lets you chat briefly with everyone. But if you know a lot about one subject, you can have a deep and interesting talk. Also, knowing a lot about one subject can get you better jobs than if you know a little about many subjects. Companies today want people who are experts in one area. They can handle tough problems without getting scared and can fix issues. And these experts often get paid more. Plus, experts in one field are usually remembered and respected. Their names are not forgotten. People who know a little about many things are not as famous. For example, we know who the best chemistry and math experts are. This doesn't mean that people with broad knowledge are bad or less skilled. But experts in one field tend to be remembered more or leave a mark on history."}
{"file_id": "11425.txt", "output_essay": "I read, I forget. I learn, I still forget. I understand, I remember. This old Chinese saying gets to the point. Every building needs a strong foundation to stand tall. For a person, understanding is like this foundation in life. It's clearly more important to understand things than to just know facts about them. Understanding a topic or event helps a person think about what's happening around them. Let's look at some examples to make this clearer: Take an electrical engineer, for example. He knows facts about home electricity from books. But if he doesn't get how electricity gets to homes, he can't fix problems when they happen. If he tries without understanding, it could be very dangerous. Now, think about swimming. Knowing about buoyancy, a science principle, won't help someone swim. But understanding how to swim with someone teaching you will. Researchers and scientists make new things not because they remember facts, but because they understand their subjects well. They make new rules and facts from this understanding. From these examples, we see that it's better for students to understand ideas than to just learn facts. This way, they become better people and thinkers. This helps their country grow."}
{"file_id": "108625.txt", "output_essay": "I think that young people today don't spend much time helping their communities. Many things affect everyone, including the young, in ways that are different from before. These things make people act differently. In the past, people knew each other in a small area and needed each other more. This made people, including the young, work together more. But now, we know people from far away, and we don't have strong ties to those who live near us. Young people today are also pushed to be successful in everything they do. They need time to do well, so they don't have time to help their community. Also, people care more about themselves than others. They mind their own business and don't worry about people around them, even if they are from the same place. Another point is that life is more private now. People don't know their neighbors, even if they live close by. If they don't know the people around them, why would they help them? Lastly, I want to talk about family responsibility and money. In the past, families lived closer together. People thought differently about taking care of their family. Now, they don't want to look after their relatives themselves. They would rather pay someone else to do it. Today, many things are different from before, and these changes have made young people less willing to help their communities."}
{"file_id": "114219.txt", "output_essay": "I think that young people have more fun than older people. There are a few reasons why I believe this. The first reason is that young people are stronger and can do more things. They don't get tired easily. If they don't do what they want while they're young, they might not be able to do it when they're old. This is true for activities like surfing, running, soccer, and diving. I love to travel to other countries. Flying makes me very tired and I can't handle it for too long. Last winter, I flew to Orlando, Florida by myself. I had to switch planes two times. It took thirty hours! I think older people would find this even harder. The second reason is that young people bounce back faster. If they mess up, they can try something else. But if older people mess up, even a little, it's hard for them to start again. They might not get another chance. For example, if young people lose their job, they can find a new one because they are young. But it's harder for older people. They might not get hired because they are seen as too old. So, I think young people enjoy life more than older people."}
{"file_id": "102695.txt", "output_essay": "Many people think that it is more important for students to understand ideas than to learn facts. I don't agree with this. Learning facts is better for them.\n\nFirst, tests don't often check if a student can get along with others, talk well, or fit into the world. But if students learn facts, they can get these skills more easily.\n\nAlso, just knowing the ideas is not enough to do well in today's world. Learning facts helps them succeed. For example, most good jobs need some computer knowledge. If a student knows about computers, they will be more popular.\n\nFinally, learning facts helps students grow up to be better adults. If they only get the ideas, they might turn out to be unkind.\n\nIn the end, I think learning facts is more important than just understanding ideas."}
{"file_id": "11566.txt", "output_essay": "We are trying to decide if it's better to know a little about many school subjects or a lot about one subject. This matters because it shows what students like to learn about. I think it's better to know a lot about one subject than a little about many subjects. \n\nMy first reason is that when we try to learn about many subjects, we can't give each one the attention it needs. We won't do well in all of them. If you choose one subject and learn a lot about it, you can give it your full attention and do well. This is why I believe my view is better. \n\nNext, if you focus on one subject, you can learn a lot about it easily. You can pay more attention to it. By studying it a lot, you can find out new things in that area. For example, Einstein spent his life studying one subject he liked and found out many things, like the theory that mass can turn into energy. So, I think focusing on one subject is the best choice. \n\nLastly, not everyone wants to or can learn about every subject. If you make someone learn about something they don't like, they won't learn it well. It's better to learn a lot about one subject you like than a little about many subjects. \n\nBased on these reasons, I believe it's better for a student to learn a lot about one subject they are interested in than a little about many subjects."}

First, it's hard for a group to pick a place to go that makes everyone happy. Second, on a group trip, we can't do things the way we each prefer. I think this kind of trip is not fun or relaxing. We should think about what a trip is really for. Trips should not make us stressed. In a group, we often feel stressed. If that's the case, it's better not to go on a trip. But when I travel alone, I think I can make my trip worthwhile, without stress, and enjoyable. There are a few reasons for this. First, I can choose where I want to go. Second, I don't have to worry about others. In this case, I can take my time and enjoy the sights as long as I want. That's why I believe the best way to enjoy a trip is to go alone."}
{"file_id": "109910.txt", "output_essay": "Nowadays, young people are giving less and less time to helping their community. Fewer hours are spent on volunteer work. People feel less connected to their community and often ignore what they have. They think helping out is not their job. First, students have a lot of schoolwork and not much free time. They are too tired after school to think about volunteering. They also face tough competition. So, they use extra time to study or get ready for exams. If a student is not doing well, she will focus on studying more, not on volunteering. Second, when students do have free time, they might choose a paid job instead. For example, working at a coffee shop for money seems better than volunteering. Students often look for what benefits them first. Or they might just want to relax with friends, watch movies, go to concerts, or chat online. For example, after a long day at school, two friends would rather hang out at the mall than do more work. Some people volunteer to look better on a job or college application. But not everyone is like this. A few really like to help and feel good doing it. They might enjoy talking with older people in nursing homes. But, sadly, not many young people are like this. So, volunteer work is going down."}

In a family of four, there are usually two cars. This causes a lot of pollution and hurts the environment. Cars are a big part of our lives; we hardly walk, and we rarely use buses or trains. Even though cities have many buses and trains, people still like to drive and park close to their work. We could try to use buses or trains more, but they need to be on time and clean to attract more riders. \n\nHowever, I don't believe people will stop driving their cars. A car shows how successful you are. If you have a big car, it means you're doing well with money and work. Also, as technology gets better, we might stop using petrol and start using different materials. This could mean no more pollution. \n\nTo end, I wish that in twenty years, we'll use less cars because I'd like to ride a bike or take public transport. But I'm not sure this will happen.

I find it hard to choose a side because both have good and bad points. I will explain my thoughts now. On one side, I believe understanding the main idea is key in some subjects. For example, in school, I got better at math because I learned different ways to solve problems. It was tough, but it helped me understand math deeply. Also, in history class, I learned that not all past facts are needed to be smart. On the other side, some subjects don't need deep understanding. Take sports, for example. It's about doing, not the past of the sport. So, I think teachers should decide if they need to teach all the details or just the important parts, depending on the subject."}
{"file_id": "112315.txt", "output_essay": "I think that ads often make things look better than they are. Here's why. Lately, there have been a lot of ads that go too far. With the internet, we can shop whenever we want. This easy shopping can cause problems. People trust what others say, even if they don't know them. They believe ads on the internet, in magazines, and on TV because they don't have other info. So, like many others, I feel things aren't as great as ads claim. I once saw an ad online for a book that said it would help me find amazing books. It was about history, which I like. I bought and read the book. But it was dull. The ad said, 'this book will change your life with its interesting stories.' I don't like studying history, but I like reading about it. I thought the book would be like a story, but it was more like a school textbook. Since then, I don't buy books unless I can see them myself. For these reasons, I think ads make things look way better than they are. Also, companies always try to make their products look the best. This makes people think the products are good."}

Still, I think there will be fewer cars in 20 years. First, with all the new technology and changes in the world, I believe cars will go away. People change their minds fast these days. They will get tired of cars and want something different. For example, I hope we can soon move by just thinking about where we want to go. It would be easier and save energy and time. Also, even if we can't teleport, it's clear that cars will go away as fast as they came. A new, better, and more helpful way to travel will be made. Next, countries are working to cut down on harmful gases, and the Kyoto Agreement shows the kind of world we want. Some countries may not follow the rules now, but I think they will see the need and work harder. People know we must think about the future and the next generations. So, if we want people in the future to live on Earth, we must stop driving cars and polluting. In short, I'm not sure if there will be more people walking, but I am sure that cars are a thing of the past. We will find ways to travel without harming the environment too much."}
{"file_id": "111601.txt", "output_essay": "In recent years, we've noticed big changes in how people live. The 1800s had many big events like world wars, the growth of money-focused living, and fights over religion. These events changed our society in France and other places. Let's look at France. The events of May '68 made people think differently. Before that, I believe young people followed rules more and were better organized. They also thought less about themselves. Money-focused living has made people care more about their own success. This is because times are tough and they will probably get tougher. Young people feel the need to do well. They study more or work two jobs. I see this happening. They don't have much time for other things. In short, I think there are two main reasons: one, young people today think more about themselves and less about helping others; two, they're busy because of how society works now. Still, we sometimes see young people helping those in trouble. For instance, after the Tsunami, many young people gave money to the Red Cross and other groups. Some wanted to go there and help the victims. This shows that young people can support their community when there's a disaster. But this help is not regular. They do great things at times, but I also think they don't try hard enough to help others who need it."}
{"file_id": "115435.txt", "output_essay": "I definitely agree that 'The best way to travel is in a group with a tour guide.' My first reason is that when we visit a new place, we might not know what it's like, how the people act, or about their culture and traditions. For example, in some Latin American countries, we might struggle to understand their language, and even if they speak English, their accent can be hard to understand. If you go to France, you might not understand French, so you would need a guide. The second reason is that if you visit an old place without a guide, you might just look at the old stones and not learn anything. Each old place has a story, and a guide can tell you that story. For example, at the Egyptian pyramids, you might not know who built them or how. A guide can tell you these things, and knowing them can make you very happy. On the other hand, if you travel alone or with family who don't know the place, you won't enjoy it as much because you don't know the stories. You might also get lost. If you see strange writing on stones, you won't be able to understand it by yourself. Thinking about all these reasons, I strongly agree with the statement."}

I believe people should be brave enough to take risks. This way, they can create new things, improve stuff, and start businesses.\n\nTaking risks leads to new creations and discoveries. We are exploring space now because some people took big chances. Think about the first trip to space. The chance of coming back alive was low. But they took the risk, and it paid off. Now we have space stations. A scientist can't make new discoveries without trying things that might fail. Edison made electricity because he tried many times, even though he failed a lot.\n\nIn the business world, starting a company is risky. No one knows if it will make money. But many business people have started with loans or borrowed money at high interest rates. They had to make more money to pay it back. This is taking a risk. Starting and running a new company involves risks. Without taking chances, nothing new can be made.\n\nIn short, to get new things like discoveries and to start businesses, you need to be willing to take risks. We are in the space age because of these risks. And there are companies today because people had ideas and took chances."}

In this short essay, I will talk about why it's better to travel this way, with reasons and stories to show it's true.\n\nFirst, you can make a lot of friends when you travel with others. On a plane, train, boat, or bus, you can talk and have a good time. I met one of my best friends, Kim, on a bus trip to Hangzhou. He sat next to me, we chatted, and we became great friends. So, being in a group helps you meet people.\n\nNext, it's more organized with a tour guide. They can take you to famous and fun spots that many tourists like. If I go somewhere new alone, I might get lost and not know where to sleep, visit, or eat. But with a group and guide, it's different.\n\nFinally, it's more fun to travel with others. If I go somewhere alone, I might feel bored on the plane or train. But in a group, it's more exciting because we can share funny stories or talk about our lives, so we don't get bored.\n\nIn the end, I've talked about why group travel with a guide is the best.

I will say that 'young people' means teenagers, and 'older people' means anyone fifty or older. To talk about if young people have more fun in life than older people, I will look at the good and bad things for both young and old. Young people have their whole life ahead, so they have many choices for their future. Older people are closer to death and have fewer choices. Young people have the chance to grow their abilities more than older people. Young people are usually stronger and can get even stronger. It is harder for older people to get strong. Older people do have a good thing that young people don't. They have learned a lot over time and can make good choices. Young people don't have this experience and might find life harder. Young people also can't do some things because of the law. They can't drink alcohol, drive, or do some fun things until they are older. Older people can do all these things. It's different for everyone if they enjoy life or not. Both young and old have good and bad things about them. I think young people have more fun because I am young and that's all I know.

I think that nowadays, communities don't need as much help or time from people. Long ago, people in a small town or village saw themselves as a community and worked together for everyone's good. They had weekly meetings to talk about community problems. Young people, full of energy, helped solve these problems and set up festivals and events. Everyone in the community helped each other. Young people were usually the most active in doing this. But now, in many places that have modern technology, things are very different. New ways to communicate and the internet have made people focus more on computers than each other. Many systems and services work better and use computers more. So, there's less need for people, including the young, to help out. Now, people can talk about problems online or by email and chat. Town leaders have websites where anyone can report a problem. Then, the right people can handle it. So today, we don't need as much help, but we do need new ideas. And young people are still the ones who come up with a lot of these ideas. That's why I don't agree with the statement about young people and community help today."}
{"file_id": "112069.txt", "output_essay": "I don't agree with knowing a lot about many school subjects instead of just focusing on one. I think we should pick one subject to learn about instead of trying to know everything. We study to get a good job. After college, bosses want us to be really good at certain things. If we know a little about many subjects, we might not get the job we want. There's a saying, 'Jack of all trades, master of none.' That's what happens if we don't focus on one subject. We might learn more, but it's not helpful if we're not experts. I wanted to be a software engineer. There are many people who want software jobs. If I didn't focus on software in college, I wouldn't have gotten a job. Companies don't want someone who knows a little about many things but isn't an expert in software. But we should still know a little about other subjects. This helps us understand the world better. In school, we learn about math, science, geography, history, and that's enough. In college, we should focus on what we really like. This will make us happy and give us better job chances. In the end, being an expert in one subject is better than knowing a little about many subjects."}

If you keep learning about different things your whole life, you'll do well, especially because things change fast these days. When I was in middle school, I did well in many classes but wasn't the best in any one class. This worried me in high school because I had to do well on a big test to get into college. My uncle told me to change how I studied to focus on what the test would cover. He said it's better to know a little about a lot of things than to know a lot about just one thing. In 10th grade, I had a friend who was great at science but didn't care about other subjects. He thought they were boring and not useful. He got low grades and couldn't get into a public college, so he went to a private one. He might have stopped learning because he thought he knew everything in his favorite subject. This is a bad habit. He also got bored and didn't pay attention to other subjects. These experiences showed me that knowing about many things helps you talk better with others and be more social. Plus, with the world always changing, this way of thinking helps you adjust quickly and easily."}
{"file_id": "112005.txt", "output_essay": "I think that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than to just learn facts. If students only memorize facts, they won't know how to use them in real life. For instance, if a math teacher shows how to solve one problem but doesn't explain the idea behind it, like the formula or steps, students will have trouble. This is clear when they see a new problem in their book or on a test. They can't solve it because they don't get the basic idea. So, a math teacher should first explain the idea of a problem. Then, by solving a problem using that idea, the teacher helps students remember it. This way, they can solve new problems that use the same idea easily. Every problem has an idea that explains how to solve it. For example, in a physics book, each chapter has many ideas. One chapter is about 'GRAVITATION.' It talks about how Earth pulls things toward it. If we only tell students that things thrown up will come down, they only learn a fact. They don't know why it happens. This kind of learning stops students from being good engineers or experts in other areas because they don't know the ideas and how to use them. Imagine a student in civil engineering who doesn't know how to build a building or where to put it; the building will surely fall down. This is why students need to learn and understand ideas and concepts, not just facts."}
{"file_id": "102535.txt", "output_essay": "I think it's better to know a lot about one subject than a little about many subjects. This is because there is too much to know and it's very detailed. Since the 1600s, people have made many things. The knowledge needed to make these things and what we learn from them is growing so much that no one person can know it all. Take a university, for example. It has big areas like science, literature, and social studies. Each of these has smaller areas. At my university, there are parts like business, economics, and international trade under social studies. You can only study in one part, not all at once. So, knowing a lot about many subjects is hard. Also, each subject is complex. If you want to treat a sickness, like AIDS, you need to know about viruses, which cause AIDS. Learning about things like light, the mind, or books won't help cure AIDS. You learn best by doing, so focusing on one thing is better. In short, knowing a lot about one subject is better than knowing a little about many."}

Many people are scared to try unusual things because they might fail. They worry they could lose their jobs, run out of money, and be left out or turned away by others. Sometimes, I believe it's better to follow our hearts and trust in ourselves, our skills, our creativity, and our power to make things because we might do well even when there are risks. Who knows? Maybe we could do so many amazing things if we were just more courageous! On the other hand, I think that someone who does the same job every day isn't happy. It's so dull to do the same work again and again. Why can't we throw away these frustrating jobs and chase our dreams? We should remember we only live once, so we should look up to Bill Gates, who is very well-known. At the start of his work, Bill Gates dared to bring a new idea of using computers to the PC world—a completely new idea. Some thought he was silly, but he made it, and now everyone uses his software; everyone knows Microsoft's software; it's everywhere!"}

Companies usually lie or stretch the truth in their ads to make their items seem the best. A TV ad might show you what you want in a product. But this can trick you into thinking the product is better than it is. For example, you see a TV ad for a cleaner that says it can make old things look new. You think it will make your old dress look like a new fancy one. But it actually makes your dress smaller. Ads also use actors to show how great the product is. Like a weight loss drug ad showing people who were heavy but now look fit. Later, you find out the pictures were of different people or changed on a computer. When companies make their items look much better than they are, they trick people into buying them. Later, people see the item isn't as good as they thought. This can make the company lose trust and money later on."}

For example, in my country, which is growing, a person started to sell a new kind of MP3 player and he spent a lot of money. He took a risk because there were many MP3 players, and usually, people in my country don't like to change what they do. But he didn't worry about this and he went to many shops, and now people are buying this new MP3 player and it's popular.\n\nHowever, people who take risks don't stop to think too much because they like challenges. If someone thinks too much when choosing, they can't be successful. A successful person can choose what to do in any situation. For example, my friend has a shop that's almost 25 years old. There was a money problem in my country and many shop owners shut their shops because it was too hard. But my friend didn't shut his shop even though it was tough. He made some good choices and didn't stop to think. He's still working there now.\n\nAlso, successful people are not scared to try new things. Some owners are scared to try; they worry that if they can't sell something new, they will lose their business. But if they tried, they could make more money and their business could get bigger.\n\nIn the end, someone who takes risks and does different things will be successful."}

Because of this, I don't think there will be fewer cars in twenty years than there are now. Some might say that new, advanced ways to travel could replace cars, but I believe twenty years is too short for that change to happen. I hope and think that in twenty years, there will be just as many cars, if not more. But they might not harm the air like they do today. A lot has been done to cut down on air pollution, and I'm sure we can do even more. For example, cities in Italy and other parts of Europe are getting people to buy cleaner cars, like the Euro4 and Euro5, which are much better for the air. These cleaner cars are possible because of better car technology. Every month, car shows around the world display new cars that are cleaner and have better designs, engines, and features. Some of these cars are very costly, depending on the make, but others are easier to afford. Car makers are working hard to get everyone to buy these cars, rich and poor alike. It's not just car companies that want to cut down on pollution. Governments are also doing their part. They run lots of ads to teach people, set days when cars can't be used in very polluted cities, and put money into electric buses and trains. I think these are strong reasons to believe that there will be just as many cars, or more, in the next twenty years. But these cars will likely be cleaner than the ones we have now."}

Knowing how and why helps us understand the fact. Understanding ideas and concepts is key for two reasons: You learn where the fact comes from, and you learn a lot about one subject. First, if you get ideas and concepts from the start, you can understand facts better. If you only know the fact, you miss how it began. For example, you know earthquakes are dangerous and shake the ground. But if you understand the idea behind it, you can be safe. You might even move to a place without earthquakes. Second, it helps you study and learn deeply about one subject. You can explain how and why things happen. This gives you a lot of knowledge about one area. For example, you know touching fire will burn you. If you understand the idea behind it, you know what to do if you get burned. You might need to go to the hospital or just use an antibacterial cream. In short, knowing the ideas and concepts gives you a big advantage over those who only learn facts.

I believe that having experience, enough time, and a better chance of success are the main reasons for my view.\n\nFirst, experience helps people succeed at a job. If someone has done a job for a long time, they can usually make the best choice when there's a problem. A person who is new to a job doesn't have experience and doesn't know which choice is better. They can easily make a bad choice. Successful people stick to what they know because they have experience.\n\nSecond, we need a lot of time to do our jobs well. It takes a long time to make a job successful. Someone who knows a job well saves time because they don't need to learn the basics. They can use that time to improve the job and become successful.\n\nLastly, if you know a job well, you have a better chance of success than if you try new things and take risks. Trying a new job means you don't have experience and need a lot of time to learn. It's risky because you might spend a lot of time and still not succeed. But if you know a job well, you know what to do to succeed quickly and well.\n\nI don't agree that successful people always try new things and take risks instead of doing what they know well. They might not have the experience, the time, or a good chance of success in a new job."}

I prefer to travel with a few friends, by myself, or with my girlfriend. There are many reasons why I feel this way. First, you don't have to follow a guide's schedule. I want to make my own plans. If you find a place you like, you can stay longer. In a group, people have different ideas. Some want to go quickly, and others want to stay. You can't change plans easily. Also, tours with guides cost more than trips you plan yourself. These days, with the internet, you can look up all you need to know. Websites and books like Lonely Planet have lots of information about places and history. From what I've seen, you meet many people when you travel. Sometimes, these meetings are better than the places you see. You can learn a lot from other travelers. Tour guides often take you to popular spots that are very busy. To sum it up, I want to be able to do what I want and not spend too much. If I don't like a place, I don't want to stay just because the group decides to. That doesn't feel like a vacation. Planning the trip is also a great part of the experience."}
{"file_id": "101568.txt", "output_essay": "Age shapes our lives, and it's important to have fun. But it's not simple because we face different challenges at each stage of life. I believe young people have more fun than older people. Young people have three main reasons for enjoying life more. First, they have fewer responsibilities. They don't have to worry about much because parents or others help them. If they do have things to do, they have the energy for it. For example, paying bills or taking care of a house can be stressful, but young people can handle it. Second, young people are usually healthy. They can move and do things without help. Being able to move on your own is key. Third, young people have a better mindset. They think positively, dream, and set goals for their future. They have hopes and try to do things to make their lives better. Older people, however, have a harder time. They've been young and done a lot. They've had many responsibilities and now they're tired and need to rest. This makes them less excited about life. They don't have as much energy for responsibilities. Also, their health often isn't as good. Getting older means they might not be able to do things they used to. Lastly, having a positive mindset is hard for them. Life changes, and getting old is tough. That's why I say young people have more fun. Being young means things are easier, and you have more to enjoy. As you get older, you lose energy and your outlook can change."}

When we look at adults, they have a lot to worry about. They have bills to pay every month and bosses at work who always want more. This doesn't mean they don't like life. But they have a lot to deal with. The more you know, the more you worry. Kids keep things simple, and that's why they're so happy. They can watch cartoons for hours and not worry about dinner because their mom will handle it. Or they can play outside with friends until they're so tired they need a nap. For adults, it's different. They still have fun. They can talk with friends, watch movies, or eat with family. But they don't have the same excitement and hope that young people do. Young people look forward to life and want to try new things. So, I think young people enjoy life more than older ones. That's probably why you often hear people say they wish they could be kids again."}
{"file_id": "112184.txt", "output_essay": "Many think that young people have more fun than older people. Is this true? Young and old people are different in social standing, experiences, and what they can do. These differences might explain why people think this way. Let's look at them. Older people may not be able to do much because they are not as strong due to age. Simple tasks like shopping, driving, or hanging out with friends can be hard. These challenges can make it hard for them to enjoy life. Also, older people often have more to worry about with their families or jobs. This can cause a lot of stress, which makes it hard to fully enjoy life. But having a family can also bring a lot of joy! On the other hand, young people often feel more 'free' because they worry less. They want to have fun and enjoy life. They usually don't have to think about family or work problems. So, they can be more focused on themselves and having a good time. We should also remember that young people often don't worry about money as much as older people. Usually, their parents give them money and everything they need. This means one less thing for young people to worry about, which might help them enjoy life more. In the end, it seems that young people might have more fun because they don't know about some of the worries older people have. But some people choose to work hard when they are young and have fun later in life, while others do the opposite. It's hard to say which way is best to enjoy life the most."}

First, people who take chances can usually handle new situations better and are more comfortable trying new things. For example, when a student from a different country moves to a new city with a different culture, he gets to try new things. He can enjoy the local music, food, and buildings. These things make his life richer, widen his view of the world, and help him think in new ways. Also, when someone tries new things, they learn from their mistakes. This makes them stronger and more able to bounce back from tough times. For instance, if a person knows they can always try again after failing, they have a better chance of doing well in the end. Success can mean different things to different people. Some think success means making a lot of money, while others think it means being happy with what you do. No matter how you see success, I think taking chances will help you become more successful."}

First, we can't say this is true for everyone. Some young people might have more fun than some older ones. But I think this has more to do with how they view life than how old they are. For instance, an older person might be less hopeful than a younger one. But they could have always been that way, even when they were young. I think that young and old people find joy in different things. This is because they are at different points in their lives. Each stage, like being a toddler, a teenager, or an adult, comes with its own challenges. A teenager might take risks, like using drugs or being more open with their love life. This could be because they want to feel free or figure out who they are by pushing boundaries. This is normal for their age in Western culture. Nowadays, people often think that being more open means you're happier. But this isn't always true. Some teens might not be happy with their lives. Meanwhile, an older person who lives a quiet life with their family and likes their job might not seem happy at first. But they could be very satisfied with their life. What we call 'fun in life' might be better described as happiness or satisfaction with life. Also, we sometimes mix up older people's way of life, which might seem boring to the young, with their age. Older people today had different values when they were young. They've just kept living by them. It's not boring to them, but it might seem that way to us."}

I believe that being the best in one subject is more valuable than knowing a little about many subjects. \n\nI think that focusing on one area can give a person more benefits than knowing a little about many things. For example, if you only know a little about many subjects, this shows people that you are not an expert. It just makes you smarter, but you need to be an expert to get a good job. These days, just being smart is not enough to live well. If you're not an expert in something, you can't make a lot of money. \n\nAlso, being an expert can show that you are successful. You can be the best in your field by doing more research and work. For example, you could be a famous scientist or teacher in your area. This is not possible for someone who knows a little about many things because life is short. You don't have enough time to learn everything about every subject. You should spend your time on one thing that can make you the best. \n\nIn conclusion, as I said in my essay, I don't think it's better to know a little about many subjects.

She talks about how close she felt to her community. She says the community had many festivals for kids and old people. For instance, they celebrated the cherry blossoms in spring and watched fireworks in summer. They also had a moon festival in fall and made rice cakes at the shrine on New Year's Day. Young people always helped set up and clean up these events. This let them get to know others and make friends. As a result, they often wanted to help again. This kept a cycle of helping and friendship going. This is how it was when my mom was young. But what about now? When I was young, I rarely joined in local events. This is because my area is old and lacks young helpers. Also, I don't know many people here. Our community isn't as close as it used to be. Also, when I was in middle school, I did volunteer work. But it wasn't often for my own community. I remember going to other places that needed help. This shows that young people today have fewer chances to help where they live.

Knowing about many subjects can be good. It lets you change your mind and plans for the future. It helps students who don't know what they want to do yet. They can wait before making a big choice. It also makes it easier to fit into different jobs. Learning just one subject well can make you an expert. This is very helpful for getting a job. But, these students may find it hard to adapt to changes. Employers don't always want that. I believe the best choice depends on who you are and what you want. So, there isn't just one best way to learn. Also, the education you choose should match what you need for your subject. For example, doctors need to know their field well, but teachers need to know about many topics."}
{"file_id": "10535.txt", "output_essay": "Today, students often wonder what's more important: getting the meaning of ideas or memorizing facts. This question is widely discussed because it touches everyone's life. Some people think understanding ideas is better, while others don't care much about it. Before I share my view, let's look at both sides of the argument. \n\nMany people find memorizing facts more fun and simple. But this way has its problems, like not really getting the full picture. So, we can't say for sure that memorizing facts is always the best choice. Also, people don't always see how good it is to really get the meaning of ideas. If you do see it, you'll get a deeper understanding. Now, I'll talk about a few key reasons. \n\nThinking is a big part of getting the meaning of ideas. For example, my parents are teachers. They always focused on helping me understand ideas since I was young. Over time, I became good at thinking. This helps me be more creative. \n\nAnother reason I support understanding ideas is that being interested in what you study is essential. Many experts are paying attention to this. I find understanding ideas more interesting than memorizing facts. They grab my attention more. \n\nI also believe that understanding ideas is easier for students. Facts can change depending on the situation and can be affected by other things. But getting the meaning of ideas is more direct. It's better for students who aren't very smart. \n\nConsidering all this, we can say that understanding ideas is more important for students. It's better for us to work towards this.

I think most ads make products look much better than they actually are!\n\nAds are not very believable because they want to get as many customers as possible. How do they do this? They give false and amazing facts about what they sell. For example, some health foods say they help build your body in the ads. But they don't show real numbers or studies about how it works for people. We might see a picture of a heavy girl and a slim girl. But can we be sure it's because of the food? Since ads are made to sell things, they usually don't have scientific proof.\n\nIt's also common to see famous actors in ads. These actors look good and make us think the products are good too. But do these celebrities really use what they're selling? They just get paid to say a line or pose. This can trick customers. People might think the products are as good as the actors make them seem. But that's not always true.\n\nThe reason why products in ads seem so different from the real thing is that there are no strict rules for ads. There's no policy to control what ads can say. So, ads often stretch the truth. I've been let down by the real thing compared to the ad. We can only make good choices if the government and media give us true facts, not just pretty lies in ads.\n\nSo, when you're buying something, don't believe the ads.

Mathematicians like Andrew Wiles spent a lot of time to prove just one idea, but he solved one of the biggest puzzles in math. So, giving all your effort to solve a problem or make a plan can lead to a smart, complete, and new way to understand something.\n\nBut focusing on just one thing can also make you bored or waste your time. Working all night on the same thing over and over might make someone's life feel empty. They might even forget what they were trying to do, making all their hard work for nothing. Some smart people got trapped in their own thoughts. They thought there was only one thing that mattered, like religion or strange ideas, and they ignored everything else. This stopped them from learning and growing as people. The mind needs to move, try new things; it's not stuck in a box. There are so many ideas and ways to make the world better. Knowing about different things and having many skills can make life better and open your mind. The hard part is figuring out how to learn about each thing without getting sidetracked. It's tough to know what to focus on and when.\n\nStill, we might not be seeing the whole picture. Looking at Wiles's work, he couldn't have proved his idea without knowing a lot about math. He looked at old papers that others thought weren't important. He tried new ways when he needed to. Today, it's hard to think about just focusing on one subject.

There are three reasons why I feel this way. First, knowing the big ideas in a subject, like economics, helps you really get what the subject is about and what can happen in it. This means that when students finish school and start working, they can do many different jobs, even if they didn't learn every little detail. Second, if a student really understands the main points in a subject, they can make sense of new things that happen and learn from them too. Third, I think facts depend a lot on when and where they happen. For example, a big strike by workers in France before a change in who's in charge wouldn't mean the same as one in Bangladesh when times are very tough. Also, facts can be tied to what's popular in thinking or making things. Like how an American once sold a lot of French foie gras because he liked it, but then stopped because of changes in how the US and France got along and how people felt about how ducks were treated. But I do agree that learning facts can help make sense of ideas that are hard to understand or not clear.

We act on simple ideas. Simple ideas can change because of someone else's ideas. Belief is one example. If a person only knows one way to think, it's very risky. Japanese students don't know the real facts. They also don't seem to want to know them. They think facts are too hard. They are avoiding them.

Many pro soccer players from Brazil didn't read books about soccer when they were kids. They played for fun. They didn't learn about the science of the ball either. Another example is driving a car. I learned about car mechanics for a month and thought I knew enough. But when I first drove a car, I wasn't good at it. I think just getting the idea isn't enough. So, the most important thing is to learn by doing, using your body, not just your mind. Sure, sometimes you need to get the ideas and concepts, but you really learn when you do it."}

I believe it's not better to know a little about many subjects than to be an expert in one area. First, you can't study well if you try to learn many subjects. You have to divide your time between them. We know that the more time you spend on something, the better you get. Studying for one hour is not as good as studying for eight hours. If you focus on one subject, you'll learn more about it. But if you try to learn many, you won't understand them well. Second, if you're really good at one thing, it's easier to get a job. You have expert knowledge in one area. Companies often look for people with one strong skill. For example, in Canada, they need people who can build cables. If you can do that, you can get a job easily and earn more money. Still, people who know a little about many subjects can find jobs too. Some international companies want people who can speak two or three languages. These people might speak a few languages, but they might not write them well. In the end, it's better to be an expert in one subject than to know a little about many. You can learn much better when you focus on one subject."}
{"file_id": "105202.txt", "output_essay": "I mostly agree with the statement. But we need to think about the situation it applies to. For example, with languages, it's better to speak a little English, French, German, and Italian than to know just one perfectly. But when it comes to jobs, I don't agree. In today's job market, it's better to be an expert in one area. There are so many people without jobs that even smart people can be jobless if they're not experts. Still, knowing a lot about many subjects is good if you run your own business and can't depend on other experts. \n\nKnowing a lot about many things is the starting point for learning more. Without this variety, it's hard to learn new things. Right now, being able to change and keep learning is important. If you only know one subject well, you might not want to learn new things. \n\nIt really depends on the person, but I think knowing a lot about many things is better than being an expert in just one area. The basics are most important. You can become an expert later in what interests you. If you don't know what's out there, you can't be sure you've made the best choice. \n\nI'd choose to know a lot about many things. That way, I keep all my options open. If I became an expert in something and it was the wrong choice, I'd be upset. We can't predict the future, and that's why being an expert can be risky. It's better to know a little about many things than to be an expert in something no one needs. \n\nOverall, I agree with the statement. You should learn about many things first before you become an expert."}
{"file_id": "108870.txt", "output_essay": "Big companies are well-known because usually, their products are better than those from small companies. I believe that a company's experience and knowledge help us know if one product is better than another. For instance, I bought a cheap oil at the store that I didn't know. It was less expensive, and I didn't think it was much different from the oil I usually buy. But when I used it, I realized I wasted my money because it wasn't as good as my regular oil.\n\nSo, I think that even though there are famous companies, it doesn't always mean their products are good. For example, a popular toy company had issues because their toys had a harmful chemical. This company is known worldwide, but that doesn't fully ensure their products are of high quality.\n\nI agree with the statement that 'Most ads make products look much better than they really are' because the market is like a battle for customers. Therefore, the quality of products is judged by the people. I think that when a company focuses on making just one special product, the items will be more expertly made and cost less than before.\n\nSome products only look better than others, but people should judge which product is better when they use it. This is important for their choices in the market and for regular buyers; it also plays a role in society."}
{"file_id": "112115.txt", "output_essay": "I fully agree that in twenty years, we will use fewer cars than we do now. I have three main reasons for this. First, new and faster ways to travel are being made, like subways, bullet trains, and fast city-to-city trains. These are more convenient for people because they save time. Cars often get stuck in traffic and take longer. People prefer to take the train for long trips and only use their cars to get to the train station if they can. Second, because of the internet and video calls, many companies let their workers do their jobs from home. This includes software companies, business offices, and stock trading firms. This way of working from home is becoming more common. Soon, many people will work from home. This means they won't need to drive their cars to the office as much. Third, the most important reason is that we are running out of fuel. We use more and more fuel, and it's hard to find new sources. With only so much fuel available, we can't keep up with how much everyone wants to use. So, people will have to find ways to use less fuel, and one way will be to drive cars less. It may be surprising, but with these changes, it looks like we will cut down on using cars, one of the biggest inventions ever, in no more than twenty years."}
{"file_id": "105390.txt", "output_essay": "To answer this big question, I would say that I don't really agree. I think we need to remember facts to get better and to understand ideas. For example, when we mess up, we can and should learn from it. That's why I believe some facts are very important. About Nazism, we can't forget it happened, because people made big mistakes. They trusted a leader who was a dictator, and it led to a war we could have stopped. Now we know what that kind of thinking can do, we know we must choose leaders more carefully. But not all facts are important like this. In subjects like philosophy, some facts don't help us think or be more aware. Some things affect our lives and actions, but others are not useful for growing our conscience. But this brings up another point that connects to my first idea: we need to know facts to learn at all. Why? Because even things that seem unimportant to you are more important than you think. Still, we can understand a lot without knowing everything about a topic. We can learn about World War II without having lived through it. You learn that millions died for your freedom, but you don't need to have felt the fear of bombs to understand what it was like. In the end, I want to say that it's not just about how we make things better. The key is to be interesting when teaching and curious when learning. We learn from everything, but not just from facts."}

This way, you can do what you like when you like. When you're with a guide and other people, you might not have enough time to enjoy what interests you. For example, I like to try local foods and talk to local people, not just see monuments and learn history. Everyone likes different things when they travel. Often, a good book about the place can be just as helpful as a guide. So, I suggest buying a book or looking up information online. Then, you can spend your time doing what you enjoy most on your trip."}

Nowadays, they don't spend much time helping their communities because they feel no connection to them. There are a few reasons for this lack of connection.\n\nYoung people like different things now and have new habits. They love using things like TVs and computers for fun. They watch world events on TV and talk to people from all over the world online. This stops them from talking to people in their own communities.\n\nAlso, parents don't teach their kids enough about their own ways, like how to talk or act in their communities. This makes young people not know much about their own ways, so they get used to other things instead.\n\nMoreover, young people now have to study a lot more than in the past. Tests for college and high school make them focus on their schoolwork and not have time for other things. This means they can't connect with their communities.\n\nYoung people should be helping out in their community.

{"file_id": "114142.txt", "output_essay": "I agree that students should learn ideas and concepts instead of just memorizing facts. I think that our world has become very advanced in technology not because we memorized facts, but because we understood ideas and concepts. Many areas have improved. If people only focused on facts, we might still be stuck in the past. We wouldn't have seen any new developments in science. Using concepts with facts helps us move forward. I like science, and that's why I became a scientist. It's not because I know a lot of facts, but because I understand ideas and concepts well. I am in a math class where I will use ideas to solve problems. Facts alone sometimes can't help us find answers. In everyday life, we use ideas and concepts too. For example, if my parents ask me to buy vegetables, I choose the best way to go. I think about it using my own ideas, not just facts. Our minds can only remember so many facts. Then we need to use ideas to succeed. There are too many facts in the world for us to know them all. So, knowing how to use ideas and concepts to solve problems is more important. In the end, I believe that facts are useful up to a point. But it's really ideas and concepts that help us in everyday life, in our jobs, and at work."}

I don't like traveling with a tour guide because it makes the trip less flexible. It's true that having a tour guide is easy. Some might find it hard to plan where to go. A group trip with a tour guide is good for them. Tour guides know how to plan and keep you safe. The trip should be easy and safe. But, traveling with a tour guide means you can't change plans easily. In big cities, there are many famous spots, and travelers have to pick only a few. For example, in London or New York, you would need three or four days to see everything in a museum. If you join a tour, you have to stick to the tour's plan. People who love art and want to spend more time in a museum should travel on their own. I sometimes change my plans when I travel. When I was in college, I went to Germany. I wanted to visit five cities in one week. But at the first place, I loved the view of a river and castle so much that I stayed there for a week. So, I only saw one city. When we travel, we often find amazing places or things. If you travel with a tour guide, you can't decide to stay longer than you planned."}

Ads want to show that their product is the best, that you really need it, and most of all, to sell it and make money. Take diet pill ads on TV as an example. They promise you can reach hard goals easily and quickly, without effort. They focus on what people care about: looking good. People want to be healthy and in shape to avoid sickness like heart disease or diabetes, and to meet society's standards of beauty. Getting healthy usually means eating right, exercising, and planning. But diet pill ads suggest you can skip all that and still get a fit body. This isn't true or safe, and doctors don't recommend it. Yet, people buy these pills hoping to look like the fit women and men in the ads. To see how this works, we need to notice why the product looks so good. Ads make hard-to-get results seem easy to sell more and make money. Also, when you see an ad on TV, look for the small print that tells the truth about the product. They don't want you to read it easily. This trick isn't new. Every product is shown as the best to make money. But we should learn about what we buy to make smart choices."}

When I visit a new country or island, I learn about it. If I don't, my trip is a waste. The best way to learn is with a group and a tour guide. The guide tells us about the place's history, importance, famous spots, and other key things. Last summer, my wife and I went to Rhodes in Greece. It was like a museum full of Greek history. We learned so much, and it was all thanks to our great guide. \n\nThe guide also helps with other parts of the trip. He helps us talk to locals, shows us the best places to see, and helps with everyday things.

They don't spend much time helping their communities anymore. One big reason is that young people don't have time for these activities. They are busy with work, family, friends, and sports. So, they rarely have time to spare. Also, people are more competitive now. Everyone is trying to do well in their jobs. They want to earn well and have a good future. Because of this, they don't have time to think about others outside their family. They ignore their duties to their communities. Another reason is that they don't know their duties to others. It's sad that some still don't care. We need to make young people more aware of their roles. Still, some young people do a lot for their community. For example, TV actors and famous people have shown they care by doing their part. These people are seen as examples by others and encourage young people to do good things too. So, young people today don't help their communities enough. But we should remind them of their roles as responsible people who are important for our country's future."}

There are a few reasons: to make our world better, to help create a good future, and to answer our questions. Many people think humans have made their lives much better and that they control Earth; I don't think so. For example, a hundred years ago, we didn't have electricity. What smart people did was think up ideas and focus on science. For instance, without Einstein, Edison, or other smart people, we wouldn't have electricity or new things. We might still use old machines and live in dark homes. Also, we have big problems in our world. Even with computers, rockets, and flying cars, the world might end soon. For example, the Earth is getting too hot, and we need to save it. How can we fix this? Probably by thinking more about science, we can find a solution. We need more scientists to look at this problem, and we should get young people to study science and think about ideas. We don't have enough food and things, and we need to make them better. If we didn't think about the ideas behind changing foods, we couldn't make more and healthier food. For example, I used to pay two dollars for a pound of apples with many problems; now, I pay less for better apples. In short, without learning more about ideas, we couldn't make our lives better, and I'm thankful for all the scientists who spent their time on this."}

It has good and bad points on both sides.\n\nFirst, aiming to be a specialist is like chasing a dream to be 'the best' that we all have. It pushes you to work harder. And yes, we need experts for new ideas. They must have the time and energy to think of new things and try them out. Being a specialist has always been key in all kinds of growth, especially in how humans have grown. People became experts and split the work. This made them quicker and gave them knowledge, understanding, and skills that others didn't have. In fact, being a specialist is central to our culture; without it, we wouldn't have any art.\n\nBut, some might say that experts are only good at one thing but not so smart in daily life. They rely on others - we can't all be experts; we need people who can work with them and share their skills. It's also important to see the big picture. If you know about many areas, you can see how things connect and affect each other. And you can come up with your own ideas.\n\nYou might find new solutions to problems because you don't think in the usual way. Also, not everyone likes all school subjects or has the skills, so they might not care as much.\n\nWhen it comes to learning, as I see it, the best approach is to mix both. You need to start with some basic facts and skills that are important in all subjects. But if you find a subject that really interests you and you're good at it, then you should be able to focus on it.\n\nI think you should always keep learning. Nowadays, you can always ask someone for help if you don't understand or know something.

They started using computers when they were very young, around 3 or 4 years old.

This means they might spend a lot of time with these gadgets instead of with other people, including those who live near them. \n\nStill, young people with these skills have more ways to help their communities. How? With their great computer skills, they can do different things for their communities. For example, they can show older people how to use computers and look for information online. These tasks are easy for young people but very helpful for older ones who don't know how to use this technology. When older people learn to use computers, their lives can change a lot. In my area, there's a young person who likes to teach computers to older people. He says it makes his life better, and he's happy to use his skills to help. It's easy for him to do this."}

I believe the opposite and here's why. First, I can't go wherever I want when I'm with a group. I remember going to Guam Island with friends after graduating from college. We stayed at a hotel and I wanted to swim right away. But my friends wanted to shop instead. I had to go with them. I couldn't do what I wanted. I didn't feel free. Second, I miss out on problems that can happen when I'm with others or a tour guide. Problems on trips, like getting lost, can be fun. For example, when I went to New York, I tried to find Central Park by subway. I got lost near Times Square. My English wasn't good, but I asked a person for directions. A nice man helped me, and I made it to the park. I had a problem and solved it on my own. That was interesting. If I had been with others or a tour guide, I wouldn't have gotten lost or talked to a stranger. In conclusion, considering these points, I completely disagree that traveling in a group with a tour guide is best. I don't want to travel with others, even friends.

{"file_id": "1000168.txt", "output_essay": "Many say that young people today don't spend enough time helping their communities. Is this true? It's hard to say. When I think about my grandmother, was she more active in her community? Maybe when she was young, kids and teens did more for their community. Back then, people set up events for everyone and helped each other a lot. But this wasn't just the young people; it was everyone in my grandmother's village. Still, my grandmother and other kids had to work hard at home and in the fields. They didn't have much free time to hang out or help the community. I also believe that young people today are active in their communities. It really depends on where they live. In small villages, people are closer to each other than in big cities. In a large city, like Zurich, people don't help each other much. The bigger the city, the more alone and separate people feel. They don't have enough time or a strong connection with others. Because of this, people, especially the young, are not really part of the wider society. They only have their friends and don't connect much with people of different ages or backgrounds. These people don't think about helping their communities. But this isn't just their issue; it's a problem for all of society and shows the gap between city and country life."}

Since then, people have wanted to live in peace without any fights. This idea was also backed by money matters, and the 1980s were a big change for young people. Their parents had seen the harm of wars all over the world. So, young people began to feel cut off from others. Their main goal was to get jobs and earn as much money as possible. Today, young people don't spend much time helping their communities. I fully agree with this for many reasons. Young people like to spend their time in front of computers and playing video games. They focus on their work goals and don't think about the community. It's clear that young people love video games. More and more video games are being played, and young people don't spend time with their families, friends, or community members. But, the community has many problems that need quick solutions. For example, not having enough jobs is a big problem today. Young people choose to play video games instead of looking for ways to fix the job issue. Since young people have more energy, they could help with projects that try to solve the job problem. Also, young people care more about making money than solving big problems in the community. It's true that work goals are important for young people, but big community problems will soon impact many people. In the last ten years of the 20th century, organizations were very helpful to society because they were supportive and well-run. However, it's important to say that the active involvement of young people made this success possible back then. In short, I strongly believe that young people today don't help their communities enough. This might come from wrong guidance in schools and homes. But no matter the cause, governments should look closely at this issue and find solutions. If not, society will face different problems. This is because young people are the ones who will build the future of society."}

But customers don't really know how these companies use pictures to make things look better than they are. Ads from big brands have messages that are carefully made. They use marketing to sell dreams with their ads. For example, people don't feel bad when they drink a lot of Diet Coke. They think it's okay because it has less sugar. Also, people who buy workout machines hope to get fit just like the people they see in the ads. People often forget how much computers can change images. This is very true in the makeup industry.

This helps him learn and get life lessons. By getting these lessons and more experience, a person will start to feel hopeful and happy. He will enjoy life more and want to do new fun things that teach him. I think a person who takes risks is very sure of himself and knows what he wants. He is lucky to have this trait. It's a good choice that everyone should make to do well in life. People who don't take risks will end up not able to do much. They will wish they had been braver and tried more new things. They will want to turn back time and do what they missed. The difference between these two types of people is that one is ready to learn, while the other is too dependent, afraid, and lazy.

They share their good and bad times. They go to dance clubs, music shows, and movies. Older people often don't agree with this. Older people are usually wiser and stay calm in different situations. They have learned a lot from life. One big reason why fun changes as we get older is because of hormones. When someone gets older, hormones don't affect them as much. This changes how much they enjoy things. There are some exceptions, but usually, young people have more fun than older people. In my home, I want to celebrate big, but my parents limit me.

If you have a famous soccer player or model in your ad, more people will like the product. But companies also use tricks with cameras and lights to make things look better. They can make big things look small and slow things look fast. Ads on TV or online are shown a lot to make people want to buy things. This makes people feel like they have to try the product. Another thing that gets people to buy is the price. We often think cheap means good, which isn't always true. Companies know this and use it to their advantage. Still, some ads are honest about what the product looks like and how it works. In these cases, we might trust the brand. For example, we can trust products and ads from brands like BMW, General Electric, and LC Waikiki because they are famous. In the end, in our world full of technology, all companies want to be part of global trade and make more money. Big companies have a lot of power in the world.

I saw this myself when I was in junior college. This way of thinking is common among young people in cities, and it needs to change.

Success is about loving what you do, being good at it, earning well from it, and spending free time with people you care about. What's the point of having lots of stuff if you can't even check on your kids' school work? I would choose to be really good at my job, earn well, and have a good time with family and friends. This is better than always trying new things."}
{"file_id": "111532.txt", "output_essay": "I don't agree because more and more people are living in the world every day. This also has to do with cars. Car makers are making a new car every year. When I look at the roads, I see that each car is carrying just one person. Each family owns at least two cars. This is happening because cars are getting cheaper and people are making more money than they used to. The government should fix this issue, but no one is doing anything. The government needs to look into subway and bus options.\n\nTake Istanbul as an example. It's a very big city with 15 million people. Our city has 5 million cars. But Istanbul doesn't have a good subway system. The buses are too old to use. Taxis aren't cheap either. For these reasons, people decide to buy a car for daily travel. I believe this is a common issue around the world.\n\nAnother issue is the old cars on the road. Many cars are over 20 years old. These cars still run and carry people. Because of this, countries need to make new traffic rules. I think they should ban the use of cars that are over 20 years old.\n\nScientists are looking into using electricity or water to run cars. If they can do this, I think even more people will buy cars. Right now, oil is very expensive everywhere. But electricity or water is almost free."}
{"file_id": "105219.txt", "output_essay": "\"Jack of all trades, master of none.\" We often hear this saying. Do you want to be good at many things or the best at one thing?\n\nI think it's better to know a lot about one thing than a little about many things. When you know a lot about one thing, you become an expert. This has many benefits.\n\nFirst, being an expert can help you in your job. If you know your area well, you can use it to do better at work. For example, in the tech world, knowing a lot about one area is better than knowing a little about many. If you understand a topic well, you can do your job well and help others too.\n\nWhen you focus on one thing, you become the person others go to for help. You become more liked and respected for helping.\n\nFinally, if everyone only knew a little about many things, we wouldn't have big discoveries. Think about Leonardo da Vinci. If he wasn't so good at painting, we wouldn't have the Mona Lisa. Or Mozart, with his music, gave us beautiful songs. Or Albert Einstein, who studied science deeply and invented many things.\n\nIn the end, I really think it's better to know a lot about something you love than to know a little about many things you don't care about much."}
{"file_id": "1004000.txt", "output_essay": "It is better to focus on just one subject. I believe this for a few reasons. First, focusing on one subject helps a lot when you want a job. For instance, if you aim to be a carpenter, learning only about carpentry will make it easier to become one. This is because you know a lot about carpentry. A carpenter does not need to know about many other things.\n\nSecond, knowing about many subjects takes more time than learning just one. This is a big issue for people. It can make them finish school later and start working later too.\n\nThird, learning about one subject can save you money. If you know about many subjects, you need to buy lots of books to study them. But if you focus on one subject, you only need a few books about that topic. This way, you don't have to spend a lot of money on learning materials.\n\nIn conclusion, focusing on one subject is good because it helps you get jobs, saves time, and costs less. These are very important reasons."}
{"file_id": "10445.txt", "output_essay": "Many say that young people care less about their communities these days. Some might think this is true because people are thinking more about themselves. But I don't think this is right. I believe young people are still involved in community work because of what schools and society ask of them. First, schools push students to do more community service. Now, many schools have volunteer programs that can give students extra credit or count as a class. The Ministry of Education in Korea found that the number of community services by schools like high schools and colleges went up by 67% in the last 10 years. Also, 87% more students are joining these programs. This shows that schools are helping young people get more involved in their communities. Also, society is focusing more on community help. There are lots of ads asking for young people to volunteer, and when they do, society gives them a lot of praise. If young people do good things, the government might even put their names in the local newspapers. For example, I once saw a poster asking for help to fix my community after a hurricane. I joined as the team leader and my village leader gave me an award. When I applied for my current job, having this volunteer work on my resume really impressed my bosses. They said that helping others is something they value a lot. In conclusion, I don't agree that young people aren't doing enough for their communities. They are, thanks to the push from schools and society."}
{"file_id": "105955.txt", "output_essay": "I think young and old people live very different lives. Young people are in a world of their own. What they like to do for fun is often not the same as what old people like to do. What 'having fun' means can change from person to person. Some people, no matter their age, think having fun is going to parties all the time. Others think it's about starting a family. Young and old people live in different ways. Even among them, there are many types of people. What you think is fun depends on your own beliefs. Sometimes, young and old people might not be so different after all. Young people's lives are usually about school, friends, parties, and doing things they can't do when they're older. I believe old people like to have quiet lives, often with their families. But we know some young and old people don't have fun at all; their lives are dull. Young people often get into trouble and complain a lot. But if we think about it, what's important in old people's lives is often related to young people. Like police officers, they mostly have to handle problems with teenagers. And who helps us when we're in trouble? Old people. In the end, I think both young and old can have fun. As a young person, I like to study, party, and spend time with friends. But I also know old people who like the same things. I really believe now is my time to have fun. Later, I'll find new ways to enjoy life."}
{"file_id": "1003553.txt", "output_essay": "I believe that in twenty years, we will not have fewer cars than we do now. This is because cars are very important for the economy today, and some people will not give up their way of making money easily. Take the tire business as an example. Companies like Goodyear or Pirelli will not want fewer cars. They would spend a lot of money to stop any plan that could make them sell fewer tires. The same goes for the fuel industry. Big companies like Mobil, BP, and Texaco spend billions to stop new energy sources for cars. They make a lot of money from selling fuel and will not give up without a fight. They will also fight against anything that could reduce the number of cars. Roads are another reason. In Western countries, about half of the government's money is spent on roads for cars. If there were suddenly a lot fewer cars, it would cause big problems for the government. So, tire makers, fuel companies, and government officials in Western countries will not let the number of cars get smaller. In fact, I think the need for money in car-related businesses will not only stop the number of cars from going down but will actually make car use go up."}

Studies show that ads can change what people think about products. In the world of TV and famous people, the media has made many of them well-known. We like these famous people and listen to their ideas. So, companies use this to their advantage. You often see actors, actresses, and singers in ads. If someone likes Michael Jackson and sees him in a Pepsi ad, they will probably start to think a lot about Pepsi. Also, ads show products but hide the bad parts. For example, you shouldn't use a microwave near babies or people who can't be around radiation. But ads for microwaves don't talk about this risk. In the end, ads are strong at changing our thoughts about products. Research shows that products in ads are liked more than those that are not in ads. Companies use famous people to get our attention and they don't tell us the bad things about what they're selling."}

But this can confuse buyers because ads often make things look better than they are. This essay will talk about how ads can trick people and look for a way to fix this problem.\n\nMany people have had trouble with things they bought because ads only show the good parts of the thing. Ads don't talk about the bad parts. Also, because of competition, makers might not tell you everything about the thing in the ad. They worry you might learn too much and buy something else. Plus, with new computer tech, ads use special effects that make people think the thing is right for them or as good as it looks in the ad.\n\nIn the end, most ads are too positive about the thing they're selling. Even though we need to make ads better, this doesn't mean they can ignore the rights of buyers and other sellers in the market. Because of this, groups that watch over competition and buyers' rights in countries should keep an eye on ads. And buyers should know what they can do legally against the makers."}
{"file_id": "1009747.txt", "output_essay": "Asking if ads make things look better than they are is a smart question. Ads are made to sell more of a product. So, the more good things about the product people know, the more they buy. Some ads do make things look much better than they are. Take food ads for example. The food on the box looks great and tasty. But when you open the box, the real food is not the same. I remember as a kid, I saw a toy ad. The toy moved a lot, talked a lot, and was bright. But the toy I got didn't move much, said only a few words, and was not bright. Ads use kids like this. They see something pretty and want it. There are rules that ads should be honest about what they sell, but not all follow these rules. It's true, some ads show the real product. But not many do this. If an ad shows a product that's not pretty, people will buy a different one that looks better in the ad, even if it's more expensive."}

We spend thirteen years learning about all sorts of things, and I think that's good! When we get to college, it's time to focus on just one or two things. We live in a world where people think they can do it all, but that's not true! It's important to be really good at one thing so you can stand out. In Italy, our colleges don't do a great job getting us ready for jobs. When we finish school, after eighteen years, we're not ready to work.

Many young people don't spend enough time helping their communities. Let's look at my own community as an example. When I look at how many people are in our local Red Cross group, I see fewer and fewer people. Sometimes we didn't have enough people to fill the work shifts. One reason might be that students and others are very busy these days. If you want a good job or to get into a good school, you have to work a lot. This means you have less time for other things. But if we look more closely, everyone should have more free time than before. Many new tools help us finish daily tasks faster, like computers and phones. I believe the real issue today is how we choose to live. It seems like every day there's a new way to spend our free time, like watching the newest movie or going to the latest bar in town. Young people don't help in their communities because they want to try all these new things. But these new activities don't always make you feel more confident. If some people started to get involved in their community, they would find out how enjoyable it is to help. In the end, I agree with the idea, but I think helping in communities could get better if people just gave it a try. You often get more joy than you give."}

Most products are not as good as the ads make them seem. Marketers don't show the truth. They try to make us believe their product is high quality, but it's not. For example, a beauty cream or face mask is shown in a very appealing way in ads. But in reality, it doesn't work that well, and they don't talk about any bad effects. Also, food and snacks are not as healthy as ads claim. They are shown as if they give you a lot of energy and strength. Clothes don't stay as shiny as they look in ads with detergent or washing powder. Ads just try to trick people into liking their product. It would be better if ads showed the real quality of the products. Only a few products are as effective as they appear in ads.

At first, it seems true because being young and healthy with a future ahead is easier than being old, in pain, and close to death. Also, parents often tell kids they are lucky. I agree that being old isn't much fun for your body or health. But being old means you've lived through many things, found your path, and maybe have kids or grandkids. In short, older people have finished the hard work and can now relax and do what they want for fun. \n\nBeing young isn't always easy, especially during the teenage years. Teenagers are building their identities, finding love, facing problems, and making big choices. It's hard because they lack experience and confidence. Plus, being young can be tough with friends. Young people can be mean to each other, and many suffer during this time. The teenage years are full of changes and aren't always fun. You lose innocence and face the real world, which can be disappointing. \n\nIn contrast, older people have settled their lives. They know more about life and solve problems more easily because of their experience. \n\nIn the end, I can't say I'd rather be young or old. That's not the point. I think every age has its good and bad parts. But I do think being young is harder because it comes with many problems and questions we're not always ready for."}

After that, they can look at these facts and check if they are true. This helps them come up with their own ideas. To me, it's like practice and theory. Facts show how things happen. They make it easier and faster for students to understand because they give details about what's happening. This helps students get a clearer picture of what they are learning. People have different ideas about things based on how they see the facts. Let me give you an example: It's a common idea that kids need to study. There are many thoughts about this. But we must know the fact first. Then, new ideas can grow from it. For instance, some may not agree that kids need to study, but others think it's important and kids should do it. From this one fact, we get two opinions. If we keep looking at the fact, we'll find more reasons to agree or disagree. But the fact stays the same. It's like the starting point of the topic. In the end, I believe it's more important for students to first understand the facts. Then they can understand what others think and create their own ideas about it and show they are true."}
{"file_id": "111649.txt", "output_essay": "In today's fast-paced world, there are more jobs than ever. Every subject has smaller areas to explore or new fields to work in. People who do well are those who try new things and take chances. They don't just stick to what they know. They do this to make money, get famous, grab people's attention, and use their creativity.\n\nFirst, making money and getting famous are the main goals of all work and success. People always want money and fame, or at least one of them. Trying something new can give you money or fame. For example, think about a car mechanic who is well-known in his area. If he starts fixing luxury boat engines, soon his customers will ask for his help with boats or other mechanical issues. They will think he is very good with anything mechanical. So, trying new things can give you money and fame, which make you want to try even more new things.\n\nSecond, getting attention from others makes you feel good. Everyone might ask you about what you did or made, want something from it, or just say 'well done.' At that time, you feel like you are the most important person. You feel like everything is about you, everyone loves you, and everyone needs you. This feeling is like food for the soul and the secret to success. That's why getting attention is so important when you try or do new things.\n\nLastly, only people with big imaginations try new things because they think of ideas no one else has tried. They might be born with a talent for success, or they might be special. They can create a world of their own and live in it. When they think of something, they can also think of what will happen next. If they don't see success in their mind, they won't try the new thing. Their brains work differently; they are clever.\n\nIn conclusion, trying new things and the success that comes with it is about money, attention, and creativity. People who try new things can do well, but sometimes only people who are already doing well can try new things. They have the courage and smarts for it. This is like a road that goes both ways; someone on this road will always do well or keep trying new things. And one leads to the other."}

As a young person, though, I don't agree with the idea on the left screen, and there are many examples to back up my opinion. First, we know our society is getting older, and our support systems are getting smaller. This leads to a new trend where many older people spend their free time traveling. This is why travel companies are making a lot of money now. For instance, my parents often spend 4 months in different cities. Also, many older people don't have as much work stress as younger people. Most of them get a steady retirement income. They don't worry about money. This lets them have fun in life. My uncle gets a big retirement income, and he doesn't save it. He often spends a lot on food and fun. Besides, our society needs young people to keep improving. This helps keep a good cycle going. If we have fun in life, it means we don't want a good life when we're old. Any growing country needs lots of young people with big goals to stay successful. From what we've talked about, we can say that older people have more fun than young people."}
{"file_id": "1001574.txt", "output_essay": "The old saying, \"Jack of all trades and master of none,\" is out of date. Now, in this tough world, we should say, \"Jack of all trades becomes the master.\" I believe that people with a lot of knowledge do well in life. It's true that being an expert in one area is important. But in today's fast-paced world, we need to be good at many things. Look at science experiments that lead to new things. Even a basic biology test needs work from people like chemists and physicists. Without a chemist to give chemicals for cleaning DNA, or a physicist to make machines, we wouldn't know our genetic code. Knowing about different areas is necessary. The tests I take show that knowing a lot about many subjects is good. I also think that knowing more helps us learn and use what we know better. We can think of new ideas and use our knowledge to make new things. Even if we study science, we should know about culture and history. In interviews and tests, they ask us about general knowledge, not just what we studied. This is good because it shows how much we know about the world. Knowing a lot doesn't just help us succeed. It also makes us better people. It helps us understand more and live better lives."}
{"file_id": "109364.txt", "output_essay": "When I read about successful people and their lives, they always talk about their unique methods or inventions. These days, the big challenge is to come up with completely new ideas. Everyone wants to find new ideas and products to be successful. The world today is too advanced for simple ideas or inventions. Also, successful people have often had tough times. I think they are successful because they faced their problems and beat them.\n\nFirst, we often think successful people are never happy with how things are and always try new things. Walt Disney wasn't happy with the TV shows of his time. He made up Disney characters like 'Mickey Mouse' and 'Minnie Mouse'. These characters got kids' attention and helped Disney become successful. He also kept making new characters, which made him even more successful.\n\nSecond, successful people take more risks than others. It's not true that someone can get rich quick, except with the lottery. Successful people take big risks to get better and more valuable results. Bill Gates went to Harvard University, which made people respect him. But when he started working on Microsoft programs, he failed some classes at Harvard. Gates chose to leave his good name at Harvard behind. Most people wouldn't do that.\n\nThird, successful people never stop improving. They try new things and take risks but never quit. They keep trying until they are happy with the results. Then they use what they've learned to try again. Picasso, a famous modern artist, has paintings worth over a million dollars. At first, his art wasn't well-known because it was very different. But he didn't stop painting his way. After he died, people realized his art was very creative and started to appreciate it.\n\nIn summary, successful people try new things even if there are big risks, and they don't stop until they achieve their goals. That's why I really agree with the idea that's been shared."}
{"file_id": "11644.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with this idea. Travel should be fun and let lots of people meet during a group tour, not just with the people who live there. On a group tour, you can talk to more people than if you travel by yourself. First, you'll make friends with the tour guide. This is the first chance to meet someone. There are many good things about traveling in a group with a guide. To start, you just follow the guide. You don't need to plan the trip or decide what to see. You just listen and look at what the guide shows you. You can focus on what you want to see or learn. Next, it's safer to travel with a group and a guide. The guide must keep you safe. This means you won't go to dangerous places. If you're alone or without a local friend, you might not know if a place is safe. That can be risky. Also, it's more convenient to travel with a group and a guide. You won't get lost and waste time, or lose money by getting tricked. The guide plans where to go and when. So you follow the plan, which saves time. You can see what you want and go to safe places for shopping or eating, like in a mall. No one will trick you. These points are true for trips in your own country and for trips to other countries. I suggest traveling with a group and a guide, especially when going abroad. In a foreign country, people speak a different language, and not every place is safe. These are the reasons why I agree with the idea."}

I have lived in New York City for 3 years. I have met many people from different places. I have tried new foods, seen different ways of living, and learned about many religions. In my first English class in New York, there were 10 students from 10 countries. They talked about themselves on the first day. I thought I knew about other countries, but I didn't know some of them. I felt bad and embarrassed. Some classmates didn't know where Korea is. People also ask me which part of Korea I'm from. I'm surprised because only South Koreans can live in other countries. I thought everyone knew that. This showed me I need to learn about other cultures.\n\nAlso, all subjects are connected. My subject is interior design. I thought I would only learn to draw and measure. But I also had to learn math, history, and art. At first, I didn't know why. Then I learned history to understand how interior design changed over time. This made it easier to learn.

They would rather hang out with friends. Some spend their time on studying and extra classes. Others think playing games is more fun than helping their community. They don't care as much as people did in the past. They don't know that the community will help them when they need it.

But after dinner, being good at many things might just be annoying. Knowing things helps us understand ourselves and the world. So, why not try to learn as much as we can? One problem is that learning more often shows us how much we don't know. So, learning just to learn might seem silly. We should learn for better reasons than just fun. Everyone has their own likes, goals, dreams, or big questions. These reasons can make us want to learn more. They can also make us focus on one area more than others. But if we value learning just to learn, we might waste time trying to know everything. Focusing on one or a few areas can help us understand better, find answers, or do something great.

{"file_id": "108264.txt", "output_essay": "In our time, we judge the worth of everything by the picture it paints in our minds. The best way to create this picture is through marketing. One of the top ways to market is by advertising. Some people think ads can make things look better than they are. Others say you can't make a product look better by lying to customers. This is because there are many rules and groups watching over this. But I believe both views can be right, depending on the situation. First, not all countries have strict rules for honest ads that show the product as it is. In these places, companies can make their products look better in ads. For example, take the cream on cakes. In ads, they might use shaving cream instead of real cake cream. Shaving cream lasts longer and is thicker. If there are no ad rules, no one can tell the difference. People watching the ad might think it's a great brand to buy. They don't know that real cake cream can't look that good and last that long. So, without rules for honest ads, products can be shown as better than they are. But, if a country has strong rules for ads, you can't trick customers with lies or fake products. The company knows it will get in trouble if it tries. For example, in the USA, if a company wants an actor to say good things about their product, the actor must have used the product for six months before the ad. To sum up, ads can make a product seem better than it is if there are no rules against it. So, we need more laws on this matter."}

They can do more things than older people can at their age. But I also believe older people have more fun than young people. We often hear about young people taking their own lives. This shows that young people may not know what they are doing or what is right. Older people usually don't want to die because they have money to enjoy life. They don't have to work so hard anymore and are free. It really depends on the person and how they view life. Everyone is different. You can't say who enjoys life more.

Without a guide, friends might wander off, miss out on fun together, and learn less. Being with friends is more enjoyable when seeing new places. Without a guide, you might get bored. With a guide, the group will likely stick together, so no one gets left behind. The guide will show you around in order, with interesting facts. If anyone has questions about the sights, the answers can help everyone understand better. This is especially true for students on a history trip. A guide won't skip parts to save time and earn more, especially with a big group watching. In India, guides work better with more people. A group can split the cost of a good guide, which is cheaper than hiring one alone. This way is safer and gives everyone the chance to have fun while traveling."}

Knowing just a little can be risky. For example, think about pain medicine. Someone who doesn't know much may take too many pills to stop pain quickly. But someone who knows more understands that too many pills can hurt them. This is why we need to know about many subjects. Still, we don't need to know everything about everything. There's a saying, 'A jack of all trades is master of none.' Trying to know every little thing can make us lose focus on what's really important. I tell people to learn about many things. You don't need to know every small detail. But you should know a lot about one thing. Also, learn from others who know different things. Remember, 'Opportunity knocks but once a year.'"}
{"file_id": "105546.txt", "output_essay": "Most ads today try to grab people's attention so they will buy their products. They also want to beat other products for sale. They often show their product as something you must have to be happy and healthy. I think they make their products look much better and more useful than they really are. Some ads make their product seem a little more useful than it is. Others show their product doing amazing things or even working like magic in your life. For example, look at ads for fizzy drinks. They have famous athletes like David Beckham or Michael Jordan say they like their drinks. They show how the drink could make you play sports better, like your heroes. We all know a drink won't make us stars or play like one. But seeing our heroes in the ad might make us buy it. This might happen with things that don't cost much. People might buy them even without the ad. They just choose which brand to get. Ads also make products look better by saying they will make you look good. This can change your life. Look at beauty products. They say you will look better and more attractive if you spend a little money on them. These ads get people's attention because everyone wants to look good without spending much. Teens who want to look good for their friends might really notice these ads. Some products use big stars to make their point. Others use what people really want to sell their product in the best way. Most of the time, ads make products look much better than they are. They show competing products in a way that makes us feel we need them."}
{"file_id": "1006883.txt", "output_essay": "I agree that people who do well in life often have tough jobs that involve taking risks. A person is seen as successful if they stand out from others who haven't done as well. It's easier to stand out in a hard job than an easy one. In easy jobs, most people do their work well, and we expect that. So, it's normal and doesn't lead to special success. But in tough jobs, a person will run into many problems and have to deal with more things. This means they are more in the spotlight. When people take risks, they might not always win. They can fail. But if they fix a problem or grow a tough or new business, they get noticed and become successful. Another point is that hard jobs and risks make life less boring. People face new and hard things, so they don't get bored. They might be more excited about their work because there's more at stake. When a job is less risky, we might get bored because we know it too well. Then we might care less about our work and focus on other things. This is important to think about. Not everyone wants or is good at working in hard jobs. So, I agree with the idea. We can see it's true by looking at successful people like politicians or business leaders who have been in tough spots."}

They are more free. They need to go to school, finish their homework, and tidy their rooms. But they also have lots of time to do what they want. They can use this time in many ways to enjoy themselves. They can hang out with lots of friends and have a good time. Older people have big jobs to do. They have to work for their families or for themselves. They work most of the time. They can only follow their dreams or hobbies on weekends or in the evenings. Older people are wiser than young people because they have seen more in life. In the end, I feel that young people have more fun than older people. Being young is great. If you were a kid, you could do what you like without trouble. Kids don't think about serious problems. Older people have stress and are serious. Young people are always happy. They can have more fun because they only see the good and happy things in life."}

An ad's job is not to give facts to buyers (that's what news does), but to make a product look good. Ads are meant to boost sales for profit. They aim to influence people. The company that makes the product pays for the ad and decides what it says. Everyone knows this, so it's somewhat okay to exaggerate a bit. In Western countries, there are laws to stop ads from lying. So, ads usually don't tell complete lies. But ads can still make claims that can't be checked. They're not true or false. For example, ads for anti-aging creams don't say they stop aging. But they hint at it by showing young, fresh faces. Ads often sell a dream or feeling, not facts. Ads for fancy cars and luxury items talk up their quality a lot. But people buy them for the status or the special feeling they get, not because they're the best. A costly Swiss watch isn't really better than a cheap one. But that's not why people buy it."}

I think this is true because it is very important for a student to understand something, not just remember it. When they understand, students can keep learning and get more information. This helps make sure they really get the idea before they learn the facts. \n\nA student, who is a person, can't ignore the main ideas and concepts of what they are studying. If they don't understand, they will have a hard time and won't learn the facts well. It is good to understand the study in steps. This helps avoid mistakes that a student might make. \n\nIt is necessary for all students to understand ideas and concepts. They should do this in steps before trying to learn them right away. Once they understand, it will be easier for them to learn the facts. Schools are there to give students a simple explanation of how to do this. They show students how to understand the ideas before they think about them and learn the facts. \n\nColleges offer different subjects and help students understand the ideas of what they want to study. Schools help with this understanding. Later, when a student finishes school and goes to college, they will be ready to learn the facts. They will have already understood the ideas and concepts. But, understanding the ideas and concepts is more important than learning the facts. \n\nThe main point of this essay is that every student, no matter where they are, should understand the ideas and concepts before they try to learn the facts.

They can relax in city parks, feed animals at the zoo, play card games, or make music with instruments like guitars or pianos. These activities make them happy and relaxed. Another point is that older people have lots of experiences from their lives. These memories can make them feel strong feelings, sometimes even romantic ones. It's hard for me to decide who enjoys life more. I'm a young guy with lots of dreams. Dreaming about the future is also a way I enjoy life. It gives me feelings that I might use later in life."}

I believe that in twenty years, we will have fewer cars than we do now for three reasons.\n\nFirst, if fewer people drive often, it will help fix the world's environmental problems. Cars use up a lot of gas and release harmful gases. This is a big issue. These gases are bad for us. They can make people, especially young kids, sick. Right now, gas is very pricey, and people are worried about their money. Still, many people drive a lot. We need to care about the environment. We all share the Earth.\n\nSecond, if people drive less, we won't have as many traffic jams. Many cities, especially in rich countries, have this problem. Take Tokyo in Japan, for example. Every morning, it has big traffic jams. This is a big issue. The government in Japan has made more highways and roads, but there are still too many cars. I think this is because cars are cheaper now and more people can buy them. The best way to cut down on cars, I believe, is for the government to charge a tax for driving. If they do, fewer people will drive.\n\nThird, with fewer drivers, the roads will be safer. It's too easy to get a driver's license. Not everyone is a good driver, and this leads to accidents. If getting a license were harder, not as many people could drive, and there would be fewer accidents.\n\nIn conclusion, if fewer people drive, we can fix many issues. So, I hope more people will take trains or buses. Then, we will have fewer cars than we do today."}

Also, governments are making rules to protect the environment and make city life better. \n\nCars cause a lot of air pollution. When cars are used more, they pollute more because of the gases from their engines. People understand this risk and might use their cars less to help stop air pollution. \n\nCars also cause city problems like traffic jams. Cities are full of cars, which makes traffic very bad. This makes people take a long time to get where they are going.

In the job world, bosses want people who know a lot about one thing. For example, just finishing school for business is not enough. You should know a lot about Finance or Marketing to make more money. I work with trees and wood. I studied forestry. Now, I know a lot about trees, wood, and similar things. Second, in our world that changes quickly, if you want a top job and a big salary, you must focus on one subject and be an expert. To sum up, you should learn a lot about one thing.

I'm 21 years old, and I feel young. I believe I can do anything I want. This idea is fun and thrilling. But as you get older, life gets harder. Older people often stop dreaming and forget to have fun. This might be because of money, family, and health issues.\n\nFirst, older people worry about money a lot. Money from a job is important to live on your own. Being an adult means you need to earn your own money. But when you're young, you can stay with your parents. You might have a small job and use that money for yourself. I had the most money when I was in high school. I lived at home and did what I wanted. Having money lets you do more things and have more fun.\n\nNext, let's talk about family. When you're young and don't have kids, you're free to do almost anything. But with kids, you have less free time. You have to think about your family and pay the bills. You might not like your job, but you need it for your family. Work is a big reason adults get stressed. And stress makes it hard to enjoy life. It's a real headache.\n\nFinally, as you age, your body doesn't work as well. I don't have any health problems now, but my mom does. She often complains about her legs and back. She doesn't go out much. Staying home all the time isn't great, but sometimes you don't have a choice. So, I want to do what I can while I'm still young.\n\nOne day, I might enjoy life as older people do. But for now, being young is something special that older people can't match."}

They don't have to deal with the problems grown-ups often have. Their main job is to go to school, which gives them a lot of time to have fun.\n\nAlso, young people have many things to learn, like kids who haven't seen much of life yet. Going to movies, the zoo, or the circus helps kids learn about the world they live in. Later, young grown-ups will learn about new parts of life like love and getting along with others.\n\nMoreover, young grown-ups have fewer problems than their parents.

A Korean newspaper said that the best students understand the subject's ideas and concepts, not just the facts. In one high school, researchers did a test. They had fifty students study only concepts and ideas, and fifty students study only facts. Forty students who studied ideas and concepts got A's. Only ten students who studied facts got A's. After I read this study, I started to focus on the ideas and concepts. My grades got better than when I just studied facts.

The bag looked great on the website, and I wanted it right away. I used my credit card to buy it. But when the bag arrived, I was let down. It wasn't as big as it looked in the picture. After that, I promised myself not to buy bags online again. My parents also had a bad experience. They ordered a massage machine they saw on TV. It looked very comfy and like it would help them relax. They bought it, but it wasn't as comfy as they expected. The person in the ad looked so happy using it. Why didn't they feel the same? My older brother had a similar problem. He ordered an XL T-shirt with a cool design from the internet. But it was too tight when he tried it on.

First, it's very important to be an expert in one area. Science grows by building on what people learned before. To improve on past research on certain topics, we need experts. A person who knows a little about many things wouldn't be as good in this case. Second, we see the need for experts in everyday life. Imagine you're sick and go to the doctor. The first doctor, who knows a bit about everything, would send you to a doctor who knows a lot about your specific illness. This shows we need both kinds of doctors. Finally, experts might get stuck because they've been doing the same work for a long time. Someone who knows about different things might see the whole situation better and help solve problems. For example, in my major, industrial engineering, we need to see the whole company to fix its problems. When one department has an issue, they might not see that another department could be causing it. My internship showed me that focusing on one thing all the time can have downsides. In the end, we need both experts and people who know about many things. They both help solve real-life problems. So, it's not right to say one is better than the other."}

I believe it would be good for the health of plants and people if there were fewer cars making the air dirty with gases and loud sounds. We also have to make roads through forests and fields where wild animals live, and this destroys their homes. People could also use trains, buses, bikes, or walk, or share a ride with others in one car, instead of each person driving alone. I think the need for oil will change how we act. Oil is running out fast, and in the next twenty years, it will cost a lot more. So, many people who own cars won't be able to pay for the expensive gas, because they will not make more money. This is a big problem for car companies and the jobs they create, because many people could lose their jobs. Thinking about all this, we should make plans now for how to deal with the issue. First, we could create new ways to move people around and look for other things we have on Earth that we can use instead of oil. Maybe in twenty years, we might be able to drive cars that run on water or sunlight. These cars could have solar panels on the roof. This way, the air would not get dirty."}

Many car makers, like Toyota Motors in Japan, are working faster to create new ways to get around that could take the place of cars. Some people, especially in big cities, might use these new ways to travel. So, the number of cars might go down in those places. But, there's a need for an area to have good infrastructure and a strong economy to switch to these new systems. This means that places that are still growing can't afford to buy or make these systems. Also, as the economy gets better, more people want cars. Plus, cars cost less than it does to start using a new way to travel. When we look at the world, more people live in growing countries than in rich countries. If this is true, the growth of car numbers in growing countries might be faster than the drop in rich countries. This is the main reason I think this way. The second reason is that people will always want cars. There are many people who love cars."}

Your hard work will reward you in many ways. Being successful is not just about how much money you have. Money does not equal success.\n\nI feel that success is not just about earning money. It's about being different from others, like knowing more and having more experiences. You might not always succeed when you try new things and take risks. But the experiences and knowledge you gain make you successful.\n\nSuccess is about personal growth. It shows in how much you have improved. When you try something hard and risk failing, that effort makes you successful. It's not about having more money or power. Everyone has their own challenges and their own level of success. If you succeed on a personal level, money and power will come.\n\nPeople who try new things and take risks will succeed. They get better than they were before and don't just stay comfortable.

So, I believe that the best way to travel is with a group and a tour guide leading us.\n\nFirst, tour guides know a lot. When we travel alone or with friends without a guide, we use travel books to learn about what we see. This only gives us a little bit of information. But guides have studied a lot. For example, in Japan, to become a tour guide, a person has to study Japanese culture deeply. They know much more than what books can tell us. Like at the Guell Park made by Antoni Gaudi, there is a famous bench that is very comfortable because it was designed thinking about how people's bodies are made. We thought this bench was Gaudi's work. But our guide told us it was made by another designer who helped Gaudi. No book had that detail.\n\nSecond, guides know the best local spots, so we can do special things. They know where to eat well, where to buy the best souvenirs, and they get the local ways. For example, my guide took us to a restaurant and we ate together. My guide said if I show the chef I like the food with a certain sign, they will be happy. I did it, and I got more chicken soup for free.\n\nTour guides are skilled. They share information that books don't have. They know the area well, so we can do things other visitors can't.

You should enjoy the trip, not just the place you're going to. And it's best to do this with others. Going on a trip with a group and a tour guide is the best way to travel. You have more fun in a group and do things you wouldn't do alone. We are social beings. We like having others to talk to and share feelings with. For example, if you see a beautiful old church, it's nice to talk about it with someone. Also, a tour guide is very helpful in a new city. They know the place and can show you around. Without a guide, you could spend hours trying to find your way. Plus, being in a group means you're never alone. You always have someone to talk to, play with, or do fun things with. Being with others can push you to try new things. For instance, if someone tries adventure sports, you might want to try too. You might even be good at it. So, traveling with a group and guide is more fun and exciting. The guide might cost more, but they save you time and help you relax. They take care of everything. This way, you can really enjoy your holiday."}

People today like to take risks and face challenges. But this can lead to failure. For example, my friend had a good banking job. He made enough money. He wanted more from life, so he went back to school in a different area. He had to stop using things he liked, such as his car and his nice apartment. Sadly, five years later, his risk has not paid off. He should have finished his studies in four years. But he found out he didn't like the new field. He got bad grades and has to repeat some classes. When he's done, it might be hard to find a good job because there are fewer jobs in his field now. If he had kept his old job, he might have been a director by now. I also disagree with the statement because I think we should treat everyone the same. We shouldn't judge their success by how they got there. For instance, when two people apply for a job, the one with years of experience at the same place might be more successful. But it's surprising that people ignore them. They prefer to hire someone with a more interesting past who took risks. Still, taking risks can lead to opportunities you never thought possible.

For a long time, travel was something people did together. But this doesn't mean it's only for groups. Many people also like to travel alone. Travel is for fun or for work. This essay will talk about travel for fun. Tourism is a huge industry that meets many different needs. It has grown to offer everything from beach holidays to space trips. When you travel with a group and a tour guide, things are well planned. There's a set number of travelers, chosen spots to visit, a fixed schedule, and a professional guide. Traveling with others can help you make new friends. It can also be cheaper because of group discounts. But there are downsides to group tours. You have to follow the plan without much freedom. If you want to see something not on the list or stay longer somewhere, you might not be able to. You also have to stick to the group's hotels and meals, which can be a problem if you don't like them. Changing these can be hard or cost more. In short, group tours can be more limiting than going on your own. Whether group tours are good or bad depends on what the person or family likes, how much money they have, and how much freedom they want when they travel."}

It is important for everyone to help their community. By making their community better, they also improve their own lives and where they live. For example, young people might not care much about being social workers in their community because they are too busy with their jobs. They prefer to have fun at a playground or watch movies instead of doing community work. Young people today often do not help their communities grow because they are busy with other things. They do not think about helping their community as much because they want to look good to their friends. They are so busy with school that they do not have time for community service. Schools should not be blamed for giving students a lot of work. It is because young people are not interested in helping their community. They choose whether to help or not. Also, not many young people want to help their community. Usually, older people do more because they are not as stressed with work. They have less work stress than young people. So, they can do more for the community. In the end, I want to say that young people have much less time for community service than older people. If young people were more interested, the community would get better and grow faster. Young people have more energy and excitement than older people."}

Knowing more can open up our minds, help us find what we really love, make it easier to talk to people, and help us understand the world better. First, learning about many subjects can open up our minds because we learn about different things. Each subject is special, so it's good to know a little about each one. Second, learning about many things can help us find what we really love. If we only look at one thing, we might miss out on other interests. When I was in 11th grade, I took classes in Chemistry, Accounting, PE, Business, History, and more. I didn't know what I wanted to study in college, so I chose to learn about many things. But my friend, who wanted to be a doctor, only took science classes because she knew what she loved. So, I think it's better to learn about many things before you choose just one, unless you already know what you love. Also, knowing about different subjects makes it easier to talk to new people. People come from different places, so if you know about different things, you can talk to people who are different from you. Reading all parts of the newspaper, like Business, World, Entertainment, can help you learn more and talk more with new people. The world changes every day. If we don't know the basics about a subject, we won't understand new things. Many subjects are connected, so you need to know about different areas to understand something well. For example, business is linked to politics. Political changes can change the business world, so it's important to know a little about politics to understand business. In the end, for all these reasons, I believe it's better to know a lot about many school subjects than to just focus on one."}

There are many other ways to travel; there won't be enough room on the roads for all the cars. Also, I believe that future laws will limit the number of cars. Today, people can take a train, a boat, a plane, or buses to get to different places. These options will get better and cheaper because of new technology. For instance, many people in Germany like taking the train because it's easy and always on time. The cost of oil has gone up in recent years, and it doesn't look like it will drop. The car industry has made engines that use less gas, but cars still need a lot of gas because of all the electronics. Another point is that cities are getting too crowded, and there's no room for more cars. In Japan, for example, there's no space for new buildings, and the roads are too small to make bigger. One way to deal with this is for people to share cars when they go to work. Lastly, there will be new laws to control the number of cars. The world has big pollution problems, and governments are starting to make new rules, especially in fast-growing places. They want companies and people to think more about how they use energy.

If they stick to what they know, they don't take any chances. Being successful doesn't mean you will be good at everything you try. But it does mean you can try many things and still do well. A successful person wants to try new things to see if they can do well. If they only do what they know, they are not truly successful. For example, I play the piano well, so I was successful at first. But I had never played the guitar, and I wasn't good when I started. I took lessons and quickly got good at the guitar. This shows I am successful. Now, I am a good dancer. I know how to dance, but I don't try other things. So, I am a good dancer, but not successful because I only do well in what I know. A successful person tries new things, even if they might not be good at them. In the end, because they are successful, they get good at these new things. To be truly successful, you have to try many things. This is how you know how successful you are. Just being good at a few things doesn't make you truly successful. For instance, after learning the guitar, I can try another instrument, and then another. If I do well in each one, I am really successful. So, if you want to be successful, you need to try new things and take risks. If you don't, you might seem successful, but you're not really."}

But, many think it's better to keep doing what they're good at instead of taking chances and trying something new. I don't think this is right. To start, Dr. Gong, a business teacher in Korea, says it only takes about two years to get really good at something if we work hard. So, if your job is very competitive, it might be tough to do well. You should switch to a job where your idea is new. Next, people who do well in business usually have different ideas, like making the light bulb or starting the internet. I believe if your skill is common, it's not special. For example, if you're good at math, you might end up teaching because it seems like the only option. So, if you believe someone might like your idea, you should try new things and take the chance."}

This is because you can use ideas in life, and you will keep them in mind for a long time. First, when we get the meaning of ideas and concepts, we can use them every day. For example, when we learn about Plato, we might only need to know when he lived or the names of his books. But if we get his way of thinking, we see things differently. Old ideas and concepts can then help us in our current life and make it better. Second, when we get the meaning of ideas and concepts, we can remember them better. Take Chinese characters as an example. We learned them in elementary school. When we learn to write, we also learn where these characters come from. That's why we can remember them well when we get the ideas behind them. In the end, getting the meaning of ideas is more important than just learning facts. Understanding ideas and concepts gives us new ways of seeing things and can make our lives better."}

People usually buy things based on what ads tell them. When the products aren't as expected, it's confusing. I wanted to lose weight, so I bought a workout machine. The ad said it would be easy to lose weight, which sounded great. I bought it right away. But when I tried it, it was hard to use and took a lot of effort. I stopped using it.\n\nSecond, I believe that companies that use too many ads can ruin their good name. Because of my bad experience, I don't trust that company anymore. They still sell that machine and say it helps with weight loss. I really doubt their ads and if they're actually helpful.\n\nThird, too many ads are bad for my country. Even though ads help make more money, they're not allowed by the law. It's like lying to buyers. If we allow these ads, they could be everywhere in my country. That's bad for us. For example, food should be sold with a date by which it's safe to eat. But some companies are changing these dates on purpose. This makes the people in my country lose trust.\n\nBecause of these points, I don't agree with the statement."}

I believe this because it's key for them to think clearly, fix problems, and imagine new things for the future. I will explain these points more below.\n\nFirst, a student must learn to think clearly to figure out problems. This is true for school work and job tasks. They need to find what is missing. If they can't, they might not get the right answer.\n\nSecond, if a student only remembers facts and not how to tackle a problem, they won't know what to do with a new problem. For example, a student can work out how much money is made from selling things if they know the price and how many were sold. But if they don't know how many were sold, and only know the price and total money made, they will be stuck. They need to learn how to find the missing number.\n\nThird, a student must understand the big picture, like how a car works, to make new things. If they only focus on facts, they will just know what already exists. They won't be able to think of new ideas. This is important for school and work in the future.\n\nIn the end, I think it's more important for a student to be able to think clearly, solve problems, and come up with new ideas than to just know facts. This will help them do well in school and their jobs."}

Also, it's easier to get the meaning of ideas and concepts than to memorize facts. If students get the meaning, they might not forget it. But memorizing is different. \n\nSecond, memorizing facts is hard. For example, students might take more time trying to memorize facts than if they were getting the meaning of ideas and concepts. We should save our time. \n\nIf students memorize facts, they might forget them. This is not a good use of time. Third, memorizing facts costs more than getting the meaning of ideas and concepts. If we try to memorize facts, we have to pay. But if we choose to get the meaning of ideas and concepts, we can do it by ourselves. For example, we can read books. Reading books helps us get the meaning of ideas and concepts. \n\nMemorizing facts is not a good way to learn. We should learn so we can find jobs. Finding jobs is very hard. The world's money situation is not clear because of high oil prices, a weak dollar, and more. \n\nSo, I suggest we focus on getting the meaning of ideas and concepts. If I could go back, I would pay attention to getting the meaning of ideas and concepts. I could never memorize facts because I don't have much time.

Everyone has started to use new things that make their lives simpler than before. For example, we have washing machines, dishwashers, fridges, TVs, and, more recently, cell phones, computers, the internet, and so on. All these things I talked about make our lives simpler, and I am sure we will see more in the future.\n\nIn the past, people worked together in every part of life; women would wash clothes together by the river, bake bread together, or help farmers clean the farm. But since technology came into their lives, people have started to do these things at home. This has made people a bit more alone. Some might think this is good, but I think it's bad.\n\nHowever, what I see as good is that it's now easier to help others. For example, if you want to give money to a charity, you don't have to go there or to the bank; you just go online, type the address, and enter your credit card details.

{"file_id": "1010664.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with the idea that successful people try new things and take risks instead of just doing what they know well. This is because being adventurous can make one's view wider and help one find new chances. First, trying new things and taking risks can make one's view wider. The story of the famous company Wells Fargo shows this. Wells Fargo was mostly an American company because it only focused 1 percent on its work outside the country. One day, the main leader of Wells Fargo took a big risk. He moved the company's top boss, who was in charge of most of the company's work, to work on international things. Everyone was surprised by the leader's choice to try something new. But Wells Fargo did well. After a few years with their top boss in the new role, Wells Fargo grew to be not just a big American company but also a big international one. This wider view helped Wells Fargo grow and made its leader a successful boss too. Next, trying new things and taking risks can help one find new chances. In our fast world, we meet new problems every day. If we only keep doing the same things without learning about the world by trying new things and taking risks, we will fall behind the more adventurous people. If we don't open our eyes, we might miss chances even when they are right in front of us. If we are ready to try new things and take risks, we will move from being average to being successful. Starting today, living with open minds will bring us amazing things soon."}

This is because 'fun' can mean different things to different people.\n\nFor young people, fun might be hanging out with friends, having birthday parties, or studying if they like learning. Fun can be many things.\nFor older people, fun might be watching TV or taking a long walk. For instance, my grandfather, who is 75, really enjoys eating his favorite foods.\nIt's true that as people get older, they find joy in simple things. But this doesn't mean they're not having a good time. They just enjoy life in their own way.\n\nYoung people might seem to have more fun now, but older people have had their share of fun too. In fact, older people have experienced all the fun that young people have. This means that what we find fun changes as we get older.\nIt all comes down to what someone likes at their age. Like my grandfather loves certain foods. For me, it's playing my guitar on the rooftop.\n\nSo, I think that fun is different for everyone.

I like to focus on one subject for many reasons, which I will talk about in this essay. First, when you focus on one subject, you become an expert in that field. Also, if you spend a lot of time on it, you will do very well. It is better to learn one subject well than to get mixed up by many subjects that you will forget later. Second, it is hard but good to learn just one subject. For example, if you choose one subject and study it all your life and get a high degree, your life will be better. Your kids will also have a better education. I am thirty-three years old and still working to get my master's degree in engineering. I chose this subject in high school, and I still think about it. I do everything I can to finish what I started. It feels like I am testing myself. Last, I want to say that learning one subject is much better than trying to learn many, which is too hard for me. Focusing on one subject is a test for you or others. You should also focus on one thing if you want to succeed in life and be well-educated."}

Traffic jams are now common in big cities like New York or London and even in smaller ones like Lyon or Bilbao. The car is the most popular way to travel. We use it to go everywhere, even though gas is expensive and cars pollute the air. This is why I think there will be even more cars in twenty years. There are a few reasons for this. First, more people have jobs now, and fewer are without work. More people with jobs means they have more money and need to get to work. Not everyone will get a new car, but a lot of them will. Second, people in rich countries are living better than before. In the past, a family might have one car. Now, they often have two or more. As life gets better, families will buy more cars, one for each child. Third, countries that are getting richer, like China, are seeing a big rise in car sales. Big companies are going to China to sell and make cars because they can't make enough to meet the demand. Experts think this growth will continue for many years. This is not just happening in China but in other growing countries too, like those in South America. In the end, I really think that these reasons show that the number of cars will go up and there will be more cars in twenty years than there are today."}
{"file_id": "1016671.txt", "output_essay": "Some people like to travel alone, while others enjoy traveling in a group with a tour guide. I like to travel with a group and a tour guide. I want to share three reasons and examples for this choice. First, traveling in a group makes it easier to see new places in popular tourist areas. A tour guide knows a lot about the area and can take us to great places that are not well-known. For example, when I went to China with my school, I saw amazing forests and rivers in places I had never heard of. I wouldn't have found these spots if I was alone because I didn't know China well. Second, a tour guide can help us talk to people in other countries. They often know the local language well. This means we can talk to people who live there with the tour guide's help. If we don't have a guide and don't know the language, we can't talk to the locals. Talking to local people is important when we go to other countries. It helps us learn about their lives and culture. Without someone to help with the language, we might miss out on a lot. Third, being in a group lets us talk to other travelers. It's a chance to meet new people. I'm a university student and usually see the same people every day, like classmates or club friends. Traveling could let me meet someone who likes the same things I do. We might become good friends. So, I prefer group travel with a guide because it helps us find hidden spots, talk to locals, and meet new friends."}

I have some reasons for this belief.\n\nFirst, everyone is busy these days, and there's a lot happening. Young people seem busier than before. School is tougher, and they have to study more. They want good jobs and a good life later, which makes them happy. But I think they might ignore important things if they only think about school.\n\nLike friendships, helping others, and looking after family. Doing volunteer work is a great thing. It helps others and teaches you new things. So, young people should try to find time for their communities.\n\nSecond, I think it's just an excuse when they say they're too busy. Even if they study a lot, they still have some time. If more and more young people act like this, I worry about the future. Helping our society is important. We need to know the people and places around us.\n\nWe can learn important stuff from them, and it's good for our future.\n\nSome might say young people don't care about this. They think young people are just enjoying life for a short time. But I believe helping is key to living in this world, no matter what it is.\n\nSo, students should make time for their communities.\n\nIn conclusion, I think we should let young people have more time to do this.

{"file_id": "1009929.txt", "output_essay": "First, I want to say that the goal of marketing and ads is to show the good sides of the products they talk about. So, it's common to see ads that make products look better than they are. But this is about how people see the products, not a problem with the people who make the ads.\n\nIf an ad lies or gives wrong information that makes people choose poorly, that's a problem. For instance, if a soap ad shows a test comparing two soaps, it must show the real results. This is because there are laws to protect people from lies and wrong information.\n\nThese laws mean that the ad world must be very careful with facts and pictures. Over time, they've learned ways to say the best things about their products without lying. They want to make people think their products are the best, even when they might not be.\n\nFor example, we often see very beautiful models on TV using creams and saying these products make their skin or hair look great. But we're kidding ourselves if we think these products will make us look like those models. This isn't the ad makers' fault because their job is to make us want their products.\n\nIn the end, people need to be smart and question ads. They should use what they know to decide if a product is as good as it seems."}

It is true that these ads have made some products more popular and brought in more customers. But, we have also heard about people complaining about these products in newspapers. Most of the time, the complaints are about the products not being as good as the ads said they would be.\n\nSo, I think that most ads make products look much better than they actually are.\n\nFirst, some ads might be so over the top that they claim the products can do things they can't. I just read in a newspaper about a woman who bought a TV. She found out it didn't have many features that the ad promised. For example, the ad said the TV could get channels from other countries without extra gear. But, the woman's TV couldn't do that at all.\n\nAlso, some ads might turn the bad points of products into good ones. It's even more surprising that these made-up good points can make people want to buy the products.\n\nLastly, to get more people to buy their products, ads might ignore or hide the bad points. This means that only the good things about the products are shown in the ads. We know that nothing is perfect and without any bad points. Even if the ads are telling the truth about the good points, they still give customers the wrong idea. They make the products look much better than they are.\n\nSo, from what we've talked about, we can say that most ads make products look much better than they really are."}

First, let's think about why people travel with tour guides. One reason might be that they don't have much time and want to see as much as they can quickly. Tour guides show them the famous sights and help them visit a lot in a little time. I think this is a good choice for short trips to see the main attractions. But there's a big downside. When you try to see everything fast, you have to follow a strict schedule. If you want to learn more about a place, it can be hard. The group might be moving on, or you just don't have the time. So, if you really want to understand a place, a tour might not be the best way. It can be hard to make that happen. In the end, I think having a tour guide is good or not so good, depending on what you want from the trip. If you want to really get to know a place, you might want to choose another way. But if you just want to see the top sights on a short trip, then a tour guide is a good choice."}

There are many reasons for this, like better technology, age, and less stress. \n\nEvery day, technology gets better, and it brings new ways to have fun. Young people can drive around, hang out with friends at bars and restaurants, and go to amusement parks to relax from work. Older people often can't go to these places. They might be too old, not healthy enough, or they just don't know about them. Many older people prefer a quiet life at home with their grandkids. \n\nYoung people also have less stress, which lets them enjoy life more. They work hard all day and need fun to relax. Older people didn't have these fun options when they were young. Plus, young people are full of energy and can explore places with excitement. \n\nThink about a 20-year-old and his grandfather. The young man has many chances to have fun because he's full of energy and technology offers him lots of options. His grandfather can't have the same fun because he's older and might not understand the new ways to have fun that technology brings. \n\nAs technology keeps getting better, there will be even more ways to have fun. Future generations will have more fun than we do now because they will have even better technology. \n\nSure, older people can have fun too, but sometimes their health doesn't allow it.

When we walk in a city today and look around, or quickly glance at a newspaper or magazine, or turn on the TV, we see that our world is full of ads. Ads are short, colorful, and meant to grab our attention for all kinds of products. But what's really behind their shiny looks? This is what buyers wonder about and sometimes get confused by. Sadly, often what we get isn't as great as we thought it would be. For instance, a while back, a well-known company showed a car driving on water near Mont Saint-Michel, France, in a short movie. It looked amazing. But when the car was sold, it wasn't as good as the company's usual quality. Food ads can also be tricky. They show special foods as amazing or super tasty, but sometimes these foods come from unsafe places or don't taste good. The reason for this is simple: marketing is a big and costly business today. Marketing is becoming like an art. Its job isn't to tell us the real quality of the product, but to make it look the best and sound the most exciting. We should also remember that sellers, whether alone or in groups, put a lot of money into their businesses. They work as hard on their ads as they do on making their products. Like many things in life, we can find something good if we look at it the right way. With ads, maybe there will come a time when we won't worry if they are true or false.

This thinking can also apply to knowing about today's political world. But, without facts, it's hard to form your own opinion on a topic.\n\nWhen we look at science, we can't agree with this idea. You can't talk about a scientific idea if you don't know the facts (rules, laws, properties) that are part of that idea.\n\nI believe that facts and concepts are closely linked. (We could have a deep talk about facts and thoughts in Kant's philosophy here.) I tell other students to understand a fact well before they share their view, and to check a fact before they believe what others say. This issue is also about the big problem of historical sources: experts have to trust historical stories without being able to check if a fact is true by themselves.

Soon, the price of gasoline will be so high that many people won't be able to buy it. If we don't find a new energy source that works as well as gasoline, driving will become too expensive for most of us. Second, cars that use gasoline pollute the air.

We have only one mind. If something interrupts us, we might forget what we were doing. That's too hard for most people. Also, when we focus on one subject, we notice it more.

But as long as car companies make money from selling cars, we can think that the number of cars on the road in the future will mostly depend on whether people will want to buy cars in, say, twenty years. Many people think there will be fewer cars in the world soon. First, most guesses tell us that the Earth's oil won't last forever. With the ways we use now, we might run out of fuel by 2050. It will also be very expensive. Second, to fight global warming, people will need to use less fuel and, therefore, fewer cars. Tougher laws will mean less pollution later on. Also, as more people move to big cities, they will use subways and buses more. But the main thing is: even if we're not sure there will be fewer cars in twenty years, we know for sure that cars will change. Why might people want more cars? One simple reason is that there will be more people in twenty years. Since the number of cars people want is linked to how many people there are, the world might need more cars in the future. Cars could also use less fuel to go the same distance, and we might find new oil fields. But new, cheaper types of energy will soon be used in cars. For example, oil from plants is already working well in Brazil, and there's also hydrogen energy. In the end, we don't know for sure how the number of cars in the world will change.

Finally, there is so much study in each field that as soon as we get an idea, a new explanation comes out. Take Pluto, for example. It used to be a planet, but not anymore; when I was young, everyone thought it was. Because of these reasons, I truly think that learning facts is more important for students."}
{"file_id": "1011443.txt", "output_essay": "Every year, millions of people from around the world go on trips. From a rich man taking his wife on a holiday to a young person with a backpack ready to see the world, travel is for everyone. Clearly, going to a new place needs planning, and a tour guide is often there to show the group around. But is this the best way to travel? I don't think so. I believe it takes away the fun and adventure of a trip. When I go to new countries with friends and family, I want to have fun and see things I might not see again. But I also love the freedom to go anywhere at any time. A travel guide can remove that freedom by making you stick to a set plan. Often, the guide is not just for you, so you end up doing things you didn't want to do. I remember being in Paris on a tour. I had to stay at an art show I didn't choose because I had no car and no money for a taxi. I was very bored. Also, staying in a nice hotel with lots of drinks is good, but I prefer backpacking. I like moving from one place to another without a fixed plan, staying in cheap places, and not having to follow a set route. With a guide, backpacking wouldn't be the same adventure. In the end, I want to say that touring with a guide is a good way to see a city's main spots. But it might not be right for everyone. Some people, like me, look for thrills."}
{"file_id": "116669.txt", "output_essay": "I believe that it is more important for students to grasp ideas and concepts than to just memorize facts. I agree with this view. A good example to show this is from before the Renaissance in Europe. At that time, the Roman Catholic Church was in charge. They wrongly claimed that the Earth was the center of the solar system and that other planets circled it. This incorrect fact was taught to everyone. People focused on these facts, even if they were false, and didn't care about the real workings of a solar system. This meant that people believed a lie because the fact was seen as more important than the idea behind it.\n\nIf people had valued understanding ideas over just knowing facts back then, we could have learned more about the universe even before the Renaissance.\n\nThis idea also fits the saying 'necessity is the mother of invention.' If students only learn facts, they don't get to think for themselves. They just learn what others have figured out. This stops new ideas from forming, and the future doesn't change.\n\nI also think that some facts can change or be shown to be wrong when we understand the ideas behind them. The example from before proves this. In the Renaissance, thinkers like Galileo showed that the old beliefs were false. They did this by understanding ideas and concepts. This led to great discoveries and new facts.\n\nIn the end, we need to create ideas and concepts first to come up with facts. Facts are just what come out of those ideas and concepts."}
{"file_id": "1013600.txt", "output_essay": "Often, people who do well in life want to find new things. They want to try and do well in new areas too. They do this to aim higher. But this way has its problems. It means taking lots of risks. In the end, these people might lose everything. They could have just kept doing what they knew. This makes us wonder if it's worth it to try new things or if we should stick with what we have.\n\nI think life is about taking risks and finding new things. This way, we don't just know what we are already good at. We can learn and do well in new things too. For example, if no one wanted to learn about the human body, medicine wouldn't be as far along as it is now. This shows that even with risks, learning and getting good at something new is important for progress.\n\nBut sometimes, risk-takers regret it. Maybe they didn't do well in the new things they tried. They might lose what they had, or they might not like what they found in new areas. Let's say a man who owns a shoe company tries to put his money in a new perfume company or a different business he knows nothing about. He could lose money if the new business fails. Or he might give up because it's not right for him. Either way, he would lose money. This could even hurt the business where he was successful. So, taking these risks can really harm people if they're not ready for it.\n\nIn the end, it's about being lucky and hoping for the best. Finding new things can lead to good or bad outcomes. But if I had to choose, I would take the risks. The world wouldn't be where it is today without our desire to find and master new things."}

So, what is the best choice? Kids and teens should learn about many different things. This helps them see the world better and find out what they like and are good at. This way, they can make plans for their future. Adults should focus on learning things that help them at work. Every day, new things are found. If adults can't keep up, they might lose their jobs. They need to focus on certain areas to stay competitive. Everyone is different. Choosing to learn about many things or just a few depends on what each person needs. There is no one right answer."}
{"file_id": "1017901.txt", "output_essay": "I agree that in twenty years, we will see fewer cars on the road than we do now. Every day, more cars join the traffic in cities. Better economic conditions make people buy their own cars rather than take buses or trains. But our city roads can't handle all these cars. This leads to more traffic jams and accidents. A recent health study found that people stuck in traffic feel more stress. This stress hurts their home and work life. We also can't ignore the air and noise pollution from these cars. Another big reason people will use cars less is the rising cost of fuel. There isn't enough fuel for all the cars we use. New public transport, like the metro rail, can move lots of people quickly. So, people might choose these options to avoid traffic jams. The government is also pushing for more use of public transport. This could mean fewer cars on the road. People are also trying out carpooling. This is when a group shares one car instead of each person driving their own. This could lead to fewer cars as well. Because of these reasons, in the future, people will probably drive their cars less."}
{"file_id": "1000545.txt", "output_essay": "I don't agree that traveling with a group and a tour guide is the best way. Even if it's cheaper and easier, I think going alone gives you a better experience for many reasons.\n\nFirst, group tours take you to places that are too busy. These spots are full of other travelers and local sellers who charge a lot for small things. For instance, on my trip to China, the guide took us to a crowded part of the Great Wall called 'Badaling.' It was so packed, I could barely move! But when I went alone to a different part of the wall, it was quieter and the views were better.\n\nSecond, I don't like that you can't choose your own schedule on group trips. Everything is planned out and you can't stay longer than allowed. If you do, you might get left behind. Like when you go to the Louvre in Paris, it's not good if you can only rush to see the 'Mona Lisa' and not the other great paintings.\n\nLastly, I think the best part of travel is meeting local people. On my trips, I've learned a lot by talking with them. It might seem gross to see Chinese people spitting on the street. But when you learn they do it to get rid of bad stuff from pollution, it starts to make sense. Talking with locals helps you respect their ways.\n\nIn the end, based on what I've seen, I always tell people to travel alone, not with a guide. It's the best way to really get to know and respect a different culture."}
{"file_id": "1013452.txt", "output_essay": "People will always need to get around, but the way we do it will change. We might use fewer cars in the future, about twenty years from now. This is because people are looking for different ways to travel that are better for the environment. When we look at other ways to travel, like planes, trains, and boats, they have some advantages over cars. For example, cars usually carry only 1.5 people, which is not a lot. Trains, ships, and planes can carry many more people at once. Cars also cause traffic jams, which other forms of transport do not. Even though cars let you go where you want, when you want, this might change. In twenty years, planes and trains could be cheaper and go to more places. Cars also cost a lot to fix and you have to pay taxes for them, which could make them seem like a luxury. Cars are also bad for the environment because they need oil to run. This probably won't change soon. Cars also make a lot of noise and need more roads, which hurts the environment. If there are more cars, we will need more roads and there will be more noise. This will make people think about how they travel or deal with the bad effects on the environment. In the end, it looks like cars will be used less because of these reasons and maybe others not mentioned here. Car companies might try to make cars that are cheap and don't harm the environment. But even this might not stop people from choosing other ways to travel. Other industries might improve their technology and become even better options than cars."}
{"file_id": "105179.txt", "output_essay": "I fully agree with the idea. Success comes from pushing yourself hard, leaving your comfort zone, and beating the challenge, no matter what it is. By preparing well, being smart, and using what you've learned before, facing a challenge head-on is the best way to grow stronger and more patient. For instance, as a martial arts student, I watch my teacher's successful moves. He trained hard to succeed. When I first met him, he was just an advanced student. After he became the main teacher and owner, he changed the school's lessons to include new things. This is leaving your comfort zone, even when you're doing well, because you know you can do even better. He added community events to our classes to help local people. To do this, he had to hire more staff for at least a year, no matter what happened. In short, being involved in the community made our school more popular, and we earned more respect, a better name, and more money. If the new events had failed, it would have been hard to pay for staff we didn't need. But he would have figured something out. He wanted to do better by being creative and thinking differently, and I think he did. Another example is when Microsoft Windows started in the 1990s. Before Windows, most computers used simple systems like DOS and Linux. They were plain but worked. Mr. Gates took a big risk by making a new, more costly and complex way to use computers. But it ended up being better and more fun for most people. Now, Windows is the most used system. Taking risks means thinking differently. It also takes bravery and belief to make an idea real. Mr. Gates believed in Windows, worked towards his goal, and made it happen. To sum up, trying new things can be scary but can make us and the results better by testing our strength and patience. It won't be easy, but if you keep going, you'll make it in the end."}
{"file_id": "1012862.txt", "output_essay": "I think the statement that products seem better in ads than they really are is true, and I agree with it. I've seen this myself. I once bought pens that were supposed to have a 0.7 mm tip. But when I used them, the tips were smaller than 0.3 mm. The problem comes from the companies that make these products. They try hard to make their products look good so more people will buy them. But they don't think about what happens when a product doesn't work as promised. The customer will return it to the store, and the store will send it back to the company. This can happen a lot. Then, the company's good name in the market will suffer, and they won't sell many products with that name anymore. Maybe they just wanted to make quick money. If so, they did. But when they lie about what a product can do, it makes people want to check and test the product before they buy it."}
{"file_id": "1011317.txt", "output_essay": "I believe that ads usually make things look better than they are. There are three main reasons I think this. First, ads are made to sell things. Second, ads for things like contracts often have tiny print that lists the bad parts. Third, all things have good and bad points, but ads don't show the bad ones. To sell things, makers must make their products look good. If not, people will buy from other companies. For example, some skin creams claim to make skin look better. But studies show they don't work and can even hurt the skin. If ads said this, no one would buy the cream. Phone contracts are a good example of the second point. They tell you some costs but not all. They must list the bad parts because of the law, but they do it in small print. If you're not careful, you might think the contract costs less than it does. Ads never talk about a product's bad points, unless they have to, like with phone contracts. But all things have pros and cons. Ads hide the cons, especially when other products might be better. To find out the truth, independent magazines test products. For instance, computer magazines test tech stuff. So, you can't trust ads."}
{"file_id": "1014680.txt", "output_essay": "This is a hard question for me, because I am one of the young people who do not know my neighbors well. So, I fully agree that young people do not spend enough time helping their communities. There are a few reasons for this, I believe. First, most young people do not know the people who live near them. There is no chance to meet them. In the past in Japan, people did everything with others in their area. They were like family. They made big decisions together, like fixing a house or getting a new job. They helped each other. But now, people do not care about others. They do not want to know their neighbors because bad things have happened. Second, there is a big difference between the ideas of older and younger families. If they have a chance to do something together, they do not agree. People want to stay away from trouble. So, they do not help their communities much. When I was young, I had to clean the park for a community event. This was a job for the kids. Adults watched us. On other days, adults taught sports at the community club. I think young people should help their communities more. But we need to change how we do things. This will help us get along better with our neighbors. If something bad happens, the people who live closest to us will help first. Helping each other makes everyone get along better."}
{"file_id": "1021251.txt", "output_essay": "It is very important to know a lot about many things. But it is also true that today we need people who know a lot about just one thing. This issue starts after you leave high school and, I believe, it never goes away. I say knowing a lot about many things is important because you need to try different things to choose what you like best. You must pick the thing you like most and understand it well before you can focus on it. Focusing on one thing is the next step. This is very important because the world changes fast and we need people who are good at different jobs. People must focus on one job to do it very well. For example, an economist needs to know a lot about math and the history of economics. So, he must study these things a lot. At the same time, he should also know about other things. This is not because the system requires it, but because I think to be a complete person, we must be open-minded. Knowing a lot about many things helps us be open-minded. In my view, this is a tool that can help us change the future."}
{"file_id": "1005891.txt", "output_essay": "Cars are a main way to get around. They offer comfort and quick trips to different places. This makes them a key choice for many people. Even though some say cars cause traffic and dirty the air, I think we will still see just as many cars in the next twenty years. People think that cities have too many cars now. They say soon there will be no room for cars because of the crowds. They also say we should have fewer cars to stop traffic jams. But cars are very important in our lives. They are a big part of how we live. We use cars to get to work and to take sick people to the hospital quickly. Cars also show how advanced we are. Another issue is that cars pollute the air. Their exhaust gases dirty the air and add to the greenhouse effect. This is true. But it doesn't mean we should use fewer cars. We can fix this by using different kinds of energy in cars. We could use energy from the sun or hydrogen instead. To sum up, I believe we will not see fewer cars in the future. There might even be more. But the kind of energy cars use might change."}
{"file_id": "1003423.txt", "output_essay": "The question of if successful people try new things and take risks instead of just doing what they know is a hot topic. I agree with this idea. The main reason I agree is that trying new things and taking risks can lead to fresh ideas and better ways to solve problems. Take Einstein, for example. He was a well-known scientist who always tried new things and found new ways to figure things out. He gave the world new theories that people didn't know before. Einstein is one of the best scientists ever. Next, just doing what we know well means we're not paying attention to changes around us. For instance, my father was good at making spears. I learned how to make spears from him. But now, with new technology, I can't say my way is the best. Today, machines can make spears faster and more precisely. So, to do things well, we must understand how things are changing. Third, if people don't try new things or take risks, the world's economy would stop growing. Look at Bill Gates, the man who started Microsoft. He took a big risk by going into the computer business when others said he would fail. But he worked hard and made it. Microsoft created a lot of jobs and made products that made some tasks much easier. Microsoft helped the world's economy grow quickly by bringing in new technology and jobs. Bill Gates is now one of the richest people. If he hadn't taken the risk to start his own company, he wouldn't have made it. In the end, people who try new things and take smart risks do well. Those who stick to what they know might do okay, but not as well as those who risk."}
{"file_id": "1011805.txt", "output_essay": "I really think it's more important for students to learn facts than to understand ideas and concepts. I have three reasons for thinking this way. \n\nMost people are better at learning facts than at grasping ideas and concepts. Facts are specific, while ideas are more about general thinking. Take paintings, for example. We often judge a painting's worth by how real it looks. But experts look at the colors or the way it's painted. We might not get what's special about Van Gogh's work because we don't know what he's trying to show. \n\nAlso, it's easier to learn from a teacher than to learn on your own. Teachers can use clear examples and facts to explain new ideas, which helps students get it. \n\nWhen we talk about learning facts, we can't forget about part-time jobs. Why do so many students work while studying? Because jobs teach them how to deal with people, something you can't learn from books or in class. Plus, they enjoy making money. \n\nEven so, understanding ideas and concepts is important for students. They need to know subjects like math, science, history, and social studies to learn new things. If someone can't read, write, or add numbers, they won't learn much, even with a lot of facts. \n\nIn the end, I believe that understanding ideas and concepts is just as important as learning facts. We can work on both skills at the same time."}

Every young person should have a role in their community. They should work to help their community and the people who will live there in the future. Young people often get help from their community, but when they succeed, they sometimes forget who helped them. For example, in poor countries, some students get special chances because they come from a poor group. But when these students do well, they often don't feel they owe anything to their community and don't help it. However, this isn't always the case. Look at an Indian student who goes to the United States for college. He finds other Indian students at the college and talks to them before he arrives. These students help him by picking him up from the airport and looking after him for a few days. This shows that young people can be good at helping each other. There are also young people who do help their communities. When someone moves away from their country and does well, they remember where they came from. They try to help the place they were born. Many young Indians who live in other countries try to help by giving money to charities in India. So, while I think that young people today don't spend enough time helping their communities, it's not always true.

I hope these ads go away because I think how people spend money is serious. I could give many examples. My friend Kate bought a shower gel that was supposed to make her skin very smooth. It didn't. Another example is LCD TVs. Salespeople push you to buy them, saying they have great picture and brightness. But then you find out you need to pay more to actually watch certain channels. I've argued a lot with people who sell these things. I'm not saying it's always like this. Sometimes, things from ads are actually good after you buy them. But I don't like lies or liars, and I really hate when you're promised something only to find out it was a lie. I think those who trick people about money should face the law and go to jail. We live in a time with lots of information. It's important for economies to be honest. A clear economy helps people trust their governments and helps the world move in the right direction. I believe we need laws that make people trust ads. Ads should be clear and honest so people don't get unpleasant surprises when they buy things."}

In the car industry, companies spend a lot of money on research to make better cars. They want to please their customers who are looking for something better. These examples show that trying new things is usually good. But there can be problems. If companies make a mistake, it could be very bad for them. They need to be careful when trying something new. In today's competitive world, taking risks is important. Without risks, we can't be very successful. A successful person can't just keep doing the same thing. They are successful because they took risks before. In the end, it's obvious that not just successful people, but everyone should take risks to have a life full of success.

So, I think it's true that young people today don't spend enough time helping their communities.\n\nFirst, young people are too focused on their looks; they only want to wear costly clothes.

If you start a business, it won't do well if you just copy what others are doing. It might be safe to use well-known methods and make popular products to earn money, but your business won't be better than any other. Taking risks to try new things is key to success. This is clear when you look at McDonald's history and the book 'Le Papillon'.\n\nRay Kroc, the man who made McDonald's big, started with a normal restaurant. But he wasn't making enough money. He wanted a new way to sell his food. So, McDonald's started making fast food. They made hamburgers quickly because people were busy and didn't have time to sit and eat. This way, customers could grab their food and go. It worked well. But Kroc wanted to do even better. When more people started driving, he thought of 'Drive-Thru'. This let people get their food without leaving their cars. Some people in the company didn't like the idea. They thought customers wouldn't enjoy it. But Kroc saw the future and took the chance. Now, McDonald's is known all over the world. It was a big risk, but it paid off.\n\n'Le Papillon' by Bernard Werber also shows that trying new things opens up new worlds. The main characters are tired of their world because it's full of lies and selfishness. One character, a scientist, wants to leave Earth. But it's hard to find money for his project because it's risky. Then, a wealthy businessman gives him the money. Other business people and scientists think it's too risky and won't work. The project needs a lot of money, and it's a big gamble for the businessman. But in the end, the project is a success. The characters who took the risk get to leave Earth, while the others don't.\n\nEven the game I play shows that taking risks can lead to better rewards. It's better to try something risky for more success than to just do what we already know. This is just like in McDonald's story and 'Le Papillon'."}

It will only make them good at one thing. For example, if someone keeps trying to do something and fails, they will eventually succeed because they will learn why they failed. Trying and failing is actually the best way to succeed. \n\nA person who only does what they know won't get better, but they will feel sure of themselves. Even if they really know how to do something well, they won't be as skilled as someone who has tried and failed many times. You only get chances when you start trying new things. The more new things you try, the more chances you have to find opportunities. If you don't try, nothing will happen.

For instance, think about a scientist who makes medicine for people. If they only make medicines that already exist, they won't find anything new, and they won't be needed anymore. They have to look for new medicines. This is risky because they have to test on animals. Look at students who do well in school. They do well because they try new things, like reading different books and talking to their teachers. Their risk is taking extra tests that they don't have to. If they don't read a lot and check their own work, how can they do well? They would just stay the same and not learn anything new. They can't just stick to what they know or they won't be open to new ideas. I have my own experience with this. I am trying new things and taking chances by studying in the United States. I am learning about new cultures and languages. I haven't made it yet, but I am working hard to succeed. This is also a risk for me because my parents can't easily pay for my college in America.

Second, without a guide, you can travel when you want. For example, I went to Bombay, Lonavala, and Khandala with my college friends last month. These places are very pretty with lots of nature. We got a guide to show us around. He rushed us through all the spots in one and a half hours. He showed us many places from far away. We asked him to stop for a bit at each spot, but he said no.

It was a big deal for me because it was expensive. I spent five months looking at different cars online and talking to sellers. But in the end, a TV ad with Ichiro, a well-known baseball player from Japan, made me choose my car. I looked up to him a lot, and owning the car made me feel closer to him. Sadly, the car had many issues. Without Ichiro's ad, I wouldn't have picked that car. This shows that a celebrity in an ad can make us get the wrong idea about a product.\n\nAlso, ads usually only talk about the good things. Like when I bought a computer last year. It was cheap and new, so I bought it fast. But then I found out it didn't come with common programs like 'word' and 'excel.' In Japan, computers usually come with these. The ad didn't say it was missing these programs. If I knew everything about the computer, I wouldn't have bought it. This tells us that ads often only show the positives of things.\n\nIn the end, I really think that ads make things look way better than they are."}
{"file_id": "1019727.txt", "output_essay": "One big problem with schools in Italy is that we have to learn too much in every subject. I know from what I've seen that we forget most of what we learn right after we study it. I really think it's more important for students to understand ideas. A well-known Italian writer said that culture is not just what we remember from school. It's about all our experiences and ideas. It's okay if we forget small things about what we learned a long time ago.\n\nI believe a good teacher should help a student learn about history (for example) by making it interesting. They shouldn't just give them a bunch of dates or names of old rulers and events. They should talk about how life was different back then and make the past seem like an amazing place with their imagination. This is true for most subjects, but not all, like math or physics. We often forget facts because they don't fit into our daily lives. We might never think about them again. But if we really understand an idea, we'll always remember it.\n\nStudents should get a little taste of different things. This helps them find what they love and what they're interested in. To end, schools in Italy (and I think this is true in other countries too) should teach students values. They should show them how much we don't know and open the door to many worlds. Then students can explore these worlds on their own, based on what they like."}

They learn skills and get their education from those around them - their families, teachers, friends, and others in their place. As a young person, I think that I have learned the important lessons of my life from where I live. We young people owe a lot to the older ones, so we should not ignore them. We have been taught to respect our older people and others around us. So, I don't agree with the idea that young people don't spend enough time helping their communities.\n\nYoung people go to colleges to study subjects like science, business, and arts. But they also do many things outside their school work. There are many groups and clubs started by young people that do things for the community like helping the environment by teaching people about it, and fighting bad things like cheating and stealing. At my university, there are groups like this. For instance, the Nature Club, where members work to teach people about problems like loud noise and the bad effects of plastic. They use signs, quizzes, and more to share their message. There's also a club that speaks out about big problems in my country, like unfair treatment of women. I am part of this group, and we do things like visiting places and putting on plays to share our ideas.\n\nAnother way young people show they care about their communities is by being interested in politics. In my country, students in college run for positions and help bring big national problems to places where we can talk about solutions.\n\nYoung people also help their communities grow by starting new businesses and bringing new ideas. For example, they can start their own companies. I want to mention that many people who graduated from my college and are now successful give money to help social groups.\n\nI know some young people focus on making money and leave their countries for a better life, but many of us, including me, really want to help our communities where we started."}

Older people have lived more and have different experiences. You can't compare them the same way. I believe older people have fun in their own way, different from their younger days. In the past, parents were stricter. Older people have fun without needing to go to clubs or discos. They enjoy traveling, walking, and reading books, among other things. As you get older, you might have more money, which can mean more chances to have fun. I find it sad that many young people need to drink alcohol or use drugs to have fun. That's not a good way to enjoy life. Take my parents, for example. They didn't have as much fun when they were younger because they were busy being parents. Now, with us kids grown up and out of the house, they can go on vacations or to the movies whenever they want. I think that's a great way to enjoy life and free time. In short, it's important to have fun whether you're young or old."}

I think it's very important for people in a society to try new things. This is key for creating new things. If people hadn't tried new things, we wouldn't have cars or planes today. These were risky to make. We need new inventions, but we also have to think about the risks. Take Albert Einstein and his work, for example. He added a lot of value to our society. But, we have to ask if nuclear weapons would exist if he hadn't been so creative. Most people work in a group or a company. I want to talk about how a company competes in a tough market. I believe the only way to do well and last is to be creative and have creative workers. Some companies do okay by just doing what they're good at. But to be 'successful,' like the question says, you need to be creative. Some might say that a company doing just one thing well doesn't risk much. But I think the risk is being forced out of the market by a more creative company. There's a well-known saying about running a company and its workers. It also applies to everyone else: 'It's often more important to do the right things than to do things right.' I believe that people who try new things are successful, but they should know the risks."}
{"file_id": "104080.txt", "output_essay": "Nowadays, cars are the main way people get around on land. As cities get bigger and places are farther apart, people need ways to move around every day. So, most people who have enough money, are older than 18, and have a driving license, have a car. Think about how many people there are in the world, and you can see that's a lot of cars. But, public transport is getting better, which means we might not need cars as much. What will things be like in twenty years? To start, you need a way to get from one place to another. In big cities, it's too far to walk to work, the store, or anywhere else. People need a car or public transport. Most like to have their own car. Public transport can be slow and not on time. You can't be sure when the bus will come, and you might be late. Buses are slow and stop a lot. Trains can be very full, and it's not nice to be so close to strangers. Taxis cost a lot. Also, if you shop for food, you need a car's trunk for your bags. Imagine being on a full bus or train with lots of heavy bags. It's not easy or practical. That's why families need at least one car. But, too many cars cause problems like pollution and traffic. It can take an hour to get home when it should take fifteen minutes. Finding a place to park at work or the mall is hard. It would be better to spend that time watching a movie or eating out. That's why some malls and offices offer buses for their workers. Also, we might run out of oil, and cars pollute the air a lot. If twenty people took one bus instead of driving separate cars, it would cut down on pollution and traffic. I think there will be fewer cars in twenty years. Governments know about the pollution and traffic issues and are making public transport better to get people to use it instead of cars. For example, in big US cities like Los Angeles, there are special lanes for cars with more than one person. I believe that knowing more about pollution, the rising cost of car fuel, and better public transport will lead to fewer cars in the future."}

Focusing on one subject can make us more creative in that area. I am an example of this. I focused on teaching. I think I became a very creative teacher. I also think I became one of the best teachers in my country. As a teacher with a focus, I brought new ideas, methods, and tools to my classes. These were great for my students. I also think that focusing on one subject can lead to creative professionals, like my brother. He focused on medicine. Now, he is one of the most well-known and creative doctors in my country. I believe his success comes from studying just medicine. To sum up, I think we should all focus on learning one subject well. This way, we can be good and creative in it. This is better than learning many different things. I also think that this is how we find creative people everywhere."}
{"file_id": "106895.txt", "output_essay": "I fully agree that young people today don't have enough time to help their communities. This is because they are too busy and don't know much about their community. First, like many young people, I don't help my community much. The main reason is that we are all too busy with school. I want to help, but I don't have the time because of school. Many students go to private schools far from home, which takes a lot of travel time. I go to a private school too, and it takes me one and a half hours to get there. So, I can't find the time to help my community. Second, students, even young ones, go to extra classes after school. Parents and students want better education or extra help with schoolwork. This means they don't have time for family or friends. Older students who are getting ready for big exams go to these classes almost every day. If they had free time, they would prefer to spend it with family or friends. Third, the community feels strange to me and others. Long ago, people knew their neighbors well and talked a lot. But that's not true now. I just moved to a new city and don't know my community or neighbors. So, I don't join in community events because I don't know anyone there. I think this is common today. In conclusion, I agree that most young people can't find the time to help their communities. They are too busy. We need to make the community more welcoming first."}

I believe we learn more when we travel alone or with a few friends or family members.\n\nFirst, when we travel alone, we can do what we want, when we want. We can choose the places we want to see and plan the best way to see them. Last month, I went to Spain with my son. We picked the places we wanted to see first and planned our trip well. We used the subway to get around and saw old buildings and museums. If we wanted to change our plans, we just stopped for coffee and made a new plan. For example, in Barcelona, after we saw a famous church by Gaudi, my son wanted to see more of his work. So we decided to look at other buildings instead of going to the Picasso museum.\n\nSecond, we can visit places that interest us. In Granada, we went to an old town called Albayzin. It's on a hill with narrow roads that big buses can't drive on, and it's easy to get lost. If I were leading a tour, I might lose people in the maze of streets. But looking back, this town was the most exciting for us. If we were on a group tour, we wouldn't have been able to see this amazing old town.\n\nFor these reasons, I like to travel by myself or with just a few people. We can see the places we really want to see and enjoy them. The trip to Spain with my son is one I'll always remember."}
{"file_id": "1017282.txt", "output_essay": "I agree that ads make products look better than they are. Every company's marketing team works hard to make ads that will sell more. They want to make people want to buy what they are selling. To do this, they use different tricks for different things. For instance, they might show a happy family with kids in a car ad. They hope the person in charge of the family will think, 'This is the right car for us. I'll buy it next week.' Ads like this are all over the place, like during movie breaks or between TV shows, trying to get people to buy things. Take a washing machine ad as another example. It might say, 'This is the cheapest washing machine; it will save you money!' But it might actually cost a lot in water and power because it's not made well. The bosses of these companies use these tricks to beat other companies in sales. This is why people should choose what to buy on their own. The best way is to not pay too much attention to ads. Usually, it's smarter to think about what the product can really do, not just how it looks in the ad. People should compare things, looking at which one works best or costs less to use, not which one looks the best in an ad."}
{"file_id": "116293.txt", "output_essay": "I agree that successful people try new things and take risks instead of just doing what they are already good at. This happens in many areas, but it's very important in business. People often think success means making more money. So, they believe a big company will take more risks than a small family business. This isn't always true because big companies have more money to try new things. But when you look at a successful business and one that isn't doing well, the successful one usually takes more risks to make more money. \n\nTake Coca-Cola as an example. It's now one of the top companies in the world. But it didn't start big. It began with just one drink, Cola. Once Coca-Cola became popular worldwide, it made more money every year. Then, Coca-Cola decided to make new drinks, Fanta and Sprite. This was a big risk. If people didn't like these new drinks, the company could lose the money it spent making them. But even if they had lost that money, Coca-Cola would still be a successful company. \n\nIn short, successful companies risk more often to earn more money than those that aren't successful. They do this because losing money on a new idea doesn't hurt them as much."}
{"file_id": "1005231.txt", "output_essay": "I fully agree that students should focus more on grasping ideas and concepts than just memorizing facts. Memorizing facts might seem quick and can help you get good grades at first, but it doesn't help you much later on. For instance, in a math test in elementary school, if you only memorize the answers to word problems, you'll have to memorize more for each new grade. But if you understand the concept, you can use it to do well in all grades. I know this because I only studied word problems in grade 6 and didn't have to study them again after that. Just memorizing can blur your understanding and stop you from thinking deeply. It can also prevent your mind from growing. If we don't ask questions and look for answers, we limit our own understanding. Take Newton for example. If he hadn't thought about why an apple falls, he wouldn't have discovered his theory. Understanding something well not only makes it clear to you but also makes you interested in it. And it's great if you enjoy what you're learning. Every skill needs practice, time, dedication, and interest. This is true for all learning, including science. For example, if you learn what titration is in high school, you'll enjoy doing it in the chemistry lab and watching the pH change. Another example is cancer. If you understand how cancer cells work and what changes in the genes, it's exciting to study. You can then share your lab results with clear explanations. Just learning a method makes you a worker. But understanding a subject makes you a scientist. Deep knowledge is not just important, it's essential. Memorizing facts makes you a worker, but to truly enjoy and master a subject, you need to understand the concepts. This will help you a lot in the long run."}

If we don't have much time, it's good to listen to the guide's advice. Being with others makes me excited to learn. If I've been to a place before, I'll try to tell the others about it. Being in a group stops me from being lazy. I'll try to learn about the country's different cultures and what people think. Traveling with others helps me focus and pay more attention.

I don't agree with the idea of knowing a little about many subjects. The world of learning is always changing. I believe that it's becoming more important to focus on one subject. When you specialize, you learn everything about that subject. In Turkey, where I'm from, we have a saying that it's better to know everything about one thing than a little about many things. This saying came to my mind when I saw the question. I agree with what it means. Focusing on one subject has many good points. Let me tell you about one of them from my own life. In Turkey, there are colleges with Business Schools. These schools have a department called 'International Trade' that I want to focus on. When I had to choose what to study in college, I could pick either business or international trade. In Turkey, people who work in international trade usually have a business degree, not a trade degree. So, I chose to study international trade. Now, I see the benefits. Many companies want to hire people who are experts in International Trade. Another good thing about focusing on one subject is that you can clearly tell people what you do. For example, if doctors don't focus on one area, they won't be experts in anything. There's another Turkish saying that if you don't specialize, you'll end up saying you can do any job.

I was lucky to get a job at a good company, but I had to work many hours every day with little sleep and rest. Because of this, we, the young people, do not have time to help our communities. Second, communities are getting worse on their own. I live in Roppongi, Tokyo, where many young people work long hours just for themselves. Here, people do not even think a community exists. So, they do not consider helping the community and do not spend time on it. Some may have a different view in the countryside. But many young people agree with what I said.

To help young people become good parts of their community, they should go to talks or classes. These would teach them to focus on helping their community instead of just talking to friends. This could be through unpaid work or joining in community events. When young people understand what life is really about, they will help their community more.

Older people say, 'In the past, young people had more time to help their communities.' But times have changed. Now, many young people don't want to help or don't like their communities. Even if their parents don't care about the community, they won't make their kids help out. Also, Japanese students study a lot. They study more than they play. This means they can't find time to help their communities. Not just in Japan, but in Asia, students study very hard, even more than in North America. I have seen young Americans helping out. And my American friends say that Japanese students study more than American students. This means Japanese young people don't have time to help out. In Japan, there's a big problem with young people. It's called the 'Hikikomori Phenomenon.' These young people, including adults, stay in their rooms all day. They don't work, go to school, or leave their homes.

Some might think this is wrong because more and more people are buying cars worldwide. But let me tell you why I think this way. Cars used to be very expensive, but now most people in rich countries can buy them. This has caused two big problems: oil is getting more expensive and cars are hurting the environment. More people in big countries like China and India are buying cars. This has made the demand for oil go up, and so has the price. We are using oil fields very fast, and there is not enough oil. This makes the price go up. Companies are now looking for oil in hard-to-reach places because there is not enough oil in the usual places. I think oil will get so expensive that only very rich people will be able to have cars. This will make the number of cars go down. The only way to avoid this problem is to find a new type of energy. But research is moving slowly, so our energy future does not look good. Also, cars cause a lot of pollution. This is getting worse as more cars are used everywhere. This pollution could lead to very bad things for our planet. Some experts think that if we keep using more cars, governments might stop us from using them to save the environment. But by then, the damage might be very bad. In short, I think we will see more cars for a little while. But soon, they will be too costly and bad for the earth.

They are making better fuels to cut down pollution, but not to cut down the number of cars. However, I also think there might be fewer cars in the future. Medicine and science are getting better. Maybe we will travel by planes instead of cars. Or maybe we will have teleportation soon. This could take the place of cars. Also, we might run out of oil soon.

These things are fun and help them relax after a long day at school or work. However, they need money to do these things. So, young people often work very hard. They might work while they go to school. They spend their money in the evenings and on weekends. They move from earning money to spending it without taking a break to do simple things like reading a book.\n\nSome young people work almost all the time. They do this so they can work less and have more fun later in life. This is not a good situation.\n\nOlder people are usually different. Most people who have retired like to have calm days. They are not in a hurry or stressed. They are happy with their daily routines. This makes their lives stable and pleasant. They don't worry about missing out if they go to bed early sometimes. This is something many young people worry about.\n\nWhen we compare these two ways of enjoying life, a problem appears.

They are young and healthy, so they can do things that older people can only think about from when they were young. Those times are gone for them. For example, an older person can't join in on an adventure sport. They can only watch young people do it. They have back pain and many medicines to take, so it's hard for them to even think about it. Even if they want to do it and know how, they can't because their bodies won't let them. Young people find it easy to try new things, but it's hard for old people. As someone gets older, the way they think changes. They start to tell others what to do instead of doing things themselves. And most people don't like being told what to do; they want to learn by trying things out. This makes older people feel left out from the younger ones. When you don't have many friends, life isn't fun. Have you ever thought about why athletes and workers retire when they get older? It's because they can't do as much and they don't have as much energy. An old person has to let a young person take their place, even if they don't want to. Think about a coach yelling at his team and remembering when he was the star player. He's not coaching because he wasn't good, but because he can't play anymore. This can also be explained by science. When you get older, your senses get worse, and they are how we connect with the world. How can you have fun if your senses are not good? As you age, your body breaks down and it takes longer to get better. Old people can't fully enjoy things. You've probably heard your parents or grandparents say, 'Those were the best days of my life.' They smile when they talk about their youth. There's no better proof than when they say it themselves. So, it's clear that young people have more fun than older people."}

Young people today don't help their communities enough because no one encourages them. They all want to be happy. Young people like to have fun more than anything. To get young people to help the community, someone needs to inspire them. Someone should show them how to do it. Then, young people will spend enough time helping the community. I want to say that young people should do all the tasks they're supposed to do. Helping the community is not too hard. It helps them learn what they should do for the community.

I think in twenty years, there will be a big fight between people who want to protect the environment and car makers like General Motors, Ford, and VW. I'm sure Greenpeace will get more important because everyone should care about the environment. Also, there might be fewer cars because traffic in big cities is really bad. In London, cars are not allowed in the center, and many people there have sold their cars and not bought new ones. Cars aren't needed in central London. I heard Paris might do the same thing.

They don't have to be the best at everything, but they should know enough to handle different situations. On the other hand, people who only focus on one subject might get so good at it that they can't pay attention to other useful and helpful things. For example, a brain doctor who has a flood at home won't know what to do because he knows nothing about fixing pipes. I'm not saying that all brain doctors should learn plumbing, but knowing some basics about tools or the water system in the house can help them take action to protect their home until they can get expert help.

First, if we don't use a tour guide, we can visit any place we want. For example, last year I visited Japan with my friends and we didn't have a tour guide. It was fine; we got to Japan safely and did things like shopping and taking photos with local people. I had a great time with my friends. Second, we can learn about the history of the places we go to on our own. We don't need a tour guide to learn about where we are visiting. These days, we can easily find lots of information and history about places like Japan. We can read travel books or look up information on the internet. So, I believe the best way to travel is with friends and without a tour guide."}

In about 20 years, the number of cars on the road will have gone down a lot because of several reasons.\n\nA car usually lasts for about fifteen years. After that, most parts are old and the car doesn't work as well. If a car is used for more than fifteen years, it might pollute the air more. Our local government is making rules to use a car for only fifteen years. After that, the car must go back to the dealer or get a full check-up. This is to make sure old cars don't make the air dirty.\n\nWe need more oil products than before. Cars need petrol to run. But we are running out of oil products. With less petrol, fewer people, especially those with less money, will be able to use cars because petrol is too expensive.\n\nToday, our roads are too full because there are too many cars. The traffic is so bad that walking is often faster than driving. We want to drive without traffic, but the roads can't get much bigger. So, people are looking for other ways to travel.\n\nAnother big issue is that many people are overweight. Food and diets have changed, and people don't have time to exercise. Riding a bike is a good way to stay fit. More people might start biking for short trips instead of driving.\n\nI think that in the next twenty years, there will be fewer cars than there are now. The main reasons are the lack of oil and health issues. To deal with these issues, people might start using different ways to get around, which means fewer cars on the road."}

First, I believe that people who do well can fix bad things, so they should take chances. For example, if they are good at making computers and don't take chances to make them easier to use and more helpful, we might not have laptops. So, I think we need to take chances to make our lives better. On the other hand, some people only build computers because they are already good at it; they can't make those computers better. Their business might fail. Also, we live in a world where we have to compete, so we need to get better. Second, we should create new things that require people who do well to take chances. For example, many people have CD players; they have made them lighter and more helpful, but other companies create MP3 players that are even more helpful and lighter. This means there are chances of failure if people don't like MP3 players; their company might disappear. It's a big chance. But, if it works, the business can become richer and more well-known. In the end, I think people who do well should try new things, not just stick to what they already do well. If they take chances, they can become richer and it's also good for everyone in the world. It means they can make things better and also create helpful new things for people."}

Big risks can lead to big success. To be successful, I think you need two more things besides trying new things and taking risks.\n\nHaving a strong desire to achieve something is important for success. Let's talk about Ichiro Suzuki, the Japanese baseball player who played for the Seattle Mariners in the United States. He is very successful. Everyone knows he is very good at baseball. But he also had a strong desire to be the best in the world since he was young. He wanted to be a baseball player and worked very hard. Without this strong desire, Ichiro Suzuki might have only been a good player in Japan.\n\nHard work is also key. Even if you have a great dream, you can't succeed without working hard. For example, I have a dream. I have wanted to study in another country to learn more and get better at speaking another language since I was in high school. I don't just dream about studying in the US. I also work hard for it. I need to study a lot for the TOEFL test. The TOEFL test is hard. My strong desire helps me stay motivated to study. But in the end, hard work leads to success.\n\nIt's clear that I agree with the idea. But I also think two more things are important to be successful. Just doing what you already know is not enough. If you want to be successful, you need to try new things, take risks, want it a lot, and work hard."}

They do this by showing famous people, perfect results, and amazing scenes to make their products seem great. Ads often promise great results. For example, a skin cream ad may say it will make you fair in six weeks, but the real results are not that great. So, the ad makes the product look better than it is. Ads also use famous stars or athletes to promote their products. This makes people like the product just because a star they love is using it, even if the product isn't that good. The star's support makes the product look better. Ads also show models doing amazing things after using the product. For instance, an ad might show a model doing amazing stunts after drinking a certain drink. This makes the product seem cool, especially to young men who want to be cool too. So, the product seems better than it is. Finally, ads don't talk much about the bad points of their products. Like in a mutual fund ad, they say the bad points so fast you hardly notice them, making you only see the good parts. In the end, ads make products look better by using famous people, making big promises, and using tricks."}

But now, we can play these games inside with an Xbox. New tech changes our lives in many ways. For example, we can talk to someone far away whenever we want. We can call or email them and have a good time. \n\nAlso, young people go to cinemas to watch movies. At the cinema, we can pick what we want to watch, like a horror movie or a sad one. Watching movies is fun when we have free time. We can also eat whatever we want there. In the past, there were no movies, so people probably watched the news a lot. \n\nLastly, we can find out what we like and look for jobs online with Internet Explorer. If we want to ski during winter, we can look up the best places and learn how to ski. When we search online, we can find out what we enjoy.

This is because the product is not like what the ad said it would be. Also, some companies make their products sound much better than they are.

If they don't get these ideas and concepts, it's hard to understand the main point of the text or theory. Facts are not helpful if the main idea isn't clear to the students. We all know about 'funny stories.' We often hear these stories and they seem to have no point, but we still laugh and get the meaning instead of just the facts, which are not interesting to you. This is because the fact is like an easy class that only shows the surface, but the real message of the 'funny story' is the deeper idea and concept. It's like a more advanced class that teaches what's really going on in the story. I think this is very important and we should all care about it. Facts can sometimes add to what we know about things we don't know much about. But the truth is, facts are only a small part of what we can learn from information. We should think more to understand the deeper ideas and concepts. This makes the facts much clearer. If we don't get the main point of what we're told, we might get the facts wrong and stay confused. Many students just read the news to keep up with what's happening in the world. They don't really want to look deeper and get the main point of what's going on. They are overwhelmed with too much information. Because of this, they only understand a little and then tell others what they think. They keep making these mistakes without knowing it. It's like they're tricked. They don't think they're ever wrong, but they make many mistakes. These mistakes could cause them big problems one day.

When teaching, there are two main parts: learning facts and how the student understands them.\n\nFirst, a student must learn the basics of a subject. The teacher's role is to give as much basic information as possible. A teacher is skilled (because he has learned the subject before) and has his own opinions. But the teacher should only give basic information and not shape the students' thoughts. So, just learning facts is too focused on theory and not enough on real-life use.\n\nAfter knowing the basics, the student should think more about the information to understand the subject better. I think understanding ideas and concepts is a personal thing. It is something you do by yourself. No two people will see ideas the same way. It depends on the student's own experiences and connection to the subject.\n\nFor instance, in a law class, the teacher might talk about how society's view on gay marriages has changed. But I think it's more important for students to understand why these views have changed and to hear all the arguments from people who agree or disagree. This way, the student can make up his own mind, even if it's different from most people."}
{"file_id": "1017038.txt", "output_essay": "I think there will be fewer cars in twenty years. I have three reasons for this belief, which I will explain now. First, governments are spending more on public transport. This means people won't need to buy their own cars. In our city, people buy cars because there aren't enough buses or trains. They are often late to work or school. If the government spends more on buses and trains, fewer people will need cars. Since our city started improving public transport, fewer people are driving. Second, oil is getting harder to find and more expensive. We have less oil now, and we have to look under the sea for more. This costs a lot of money. Also, wars in the Middle East have made oil prices go up a lot. Driving a car is getting more expensive because of fuel costs. I think this will not change in the next twenty years. So, people will drive less. Third, people want to protect the environment and stay healthy. Cars cause air and noise pollution, which are bad for our health. People care more about their health now. They will drive less to cut down on pollution. So, in twenty years, there will be fewer cars. In summary, government spending, less oil, and caring for the environment will lead to fewer cars.

But, this way of doing things can stop us from getting better in all areas we need to. First, every science is linked and no one subject stands alone. Not knowing about other subjects will hold us back. For example, as a computer scientist, I might not use physics or chemistry at university. But if I have to make software for a chemical company, I will need help with the chemistry part. My work in the industry has shown me that knowing a little about many things is useful. A computer engineer who doesn't know basic engineering won't be complete and will always need help. Also, in the software business, knowing about many subjects makes you stand out and get picked for jobs over others. To be good at our work, we can't just focus on one subject. There are many exciting subjects in science. We should be happy to learn about different ones and get better. It's not good to always stick to one subject because we might find other topics interesting. In the end, I think it's better to know about many subjects. We have the time and ways to learn about different subjects at university, so we should learn about as many as we can and not just stick to one."}

I must eat what the tour guide picks and use the bathroom when they say. It feels like the tour guide is more like a boss than a helper. Also, tour guides often tell you things you can find in books or online. Why pay for a guide if I can read that myself? Second, tour guides usually take you on trips that make them the most money. There are many places they don't go, especially to new and exciting areas. Once, my friends and I wanted to visit a mountain nearby. We checked many tour websites, but none had that trip. We had to go alone. Third, some say that going with a guide saves money. This can be true. But you have to pay more for the guide, not just the trip. Also, some guides take you to stores and malls where they get money, not to the places you want to see. I've heard that some guides trick and threaten tourists about food and travel costs.

Others do not care about helping at all. They only think about their own issues and lack time for others. I believe that people do not spend enough time helping their communities. One reason I think this is that jobs today take up too much time. People work long hours and are too tired at the end of the day. For instance, five years ago, I worked at an advertising company. This job was very hard, and I often worked more than 12 hours a day. When I got home at 9 PM, I was too tired to do anything else. I just wanted to rest. I could not find the energy to help my community. Another reason I believe this is that people have become more focused on themselves. They only care about their own lives. They ignore other people's problems. A recent study found that less than 15% of people in my hometown have helped in the community in the past two years. For these reasons, I agree that people today do not spend enough time helping their communities.

A car used to be very important; our parents saw their first car as a dream come true. Now, young people want a car just because their friends have one, not because they really get why it's special. I think that in twenty years, cars will be even more popular, more wanted, and more risky... There are already too many cars that go too fast; in the future, it will probably get worse. Today, young people die because they drive very fast cars; tomorrow, they might fly. I hope things will change. In my grandfather's time, having a car was a big deal because he couldn't afford one. Cars are expensive, and during the war, money was very hard to find. In the sixties, someone named Corradino d'Ascanio made something to help people see the world: the Vespa. It became a symbol of success because of what it meant. 'With Vespa, you can fly,' they said, and so engines became very important to people. In the sixties, you could 'fly' away; maybe we can really fly tomorrow? Being free is important; with a car, I am free because I can go anywhere. That's why there's a craze for cars.

This makes us think about if ads make things look better than they are. I believe this is true. First, average products often spend a lot on ads. Companies put a lot of money into promoting their items, which hides what the product really does. This is bad and unfair to buyers. In fact, many high-quality items can't pay for big ads, so they don't get many buyers.\n\nAlso, most buyers choose what to buy based on TV ads. You know, most people watch TV for 1-2 hours a day. They believe the ads are true, especially if someone famous is in them. If they like the celebrity, they will believe the product works well. So, they end up spending too much money on it. But the product isn't as good as they think.\n\nLastly, the nice words and descriptions in ads make products look useful. People add features that aren't real and make the product's abilities sound bigger. The words seem right and honest; it's hard to tell what's false. So, people easily buy things to try them out. For example, a medicine that doesn't fix headaches might be sold as if it can cure your headache and help you sleep.\n\nIn short, ads often make things look better than they are.

A tour guide's job is to teach people about other places' cultures. They show us the culture and let us try it out. For example, I visited Hong Kong last week, and it was great. The guide taught us about Hong Kong's culture. We got to eat local food and see where people there usually go. He told us about Hong Kong's history, which made it easy to understand and interesting. So, with a guide, you can learn more about the places you visit.\n\nAlso, I spend my travel money in a smarter way. Some people travel to take a break from work and to relax. They want to rest while traveling, but they also need money for it. I think this is not smart with money. Like when I went to Cambodia without a guide, I didn't know where to go. I ended up just staying in my hotel room, which wasted time and money. I could have just stayed home to rest, but I spent money to rest in another country. That was not smart.

I'm a boy who loves adventure because it's more exciting than being in a group. Culture shows what a place is like and we should respect it. If a tour guide tells me all about the culture, I'll be bored. I want to experience it myself. Also, going with a tour guide can limit us. They plan everything and might push us to buy expensive things. This can ruin our trip. Traveling with a group isn't always cheap. If I go alone, I can plan my budget well.

A designer who has finished a project by looking at many books and articles will know the most important parts of their job better. Also, it's better for a student to learn from doing things themselves. When I helped make our university's website, I learned a lot by setting up the server and writing code, which you can't find in books. This helped me get better at computer science more easily. Plus, knowing facts is a higher skill than just understanding ideas. Students who use what they learn in their daily work can learn new things faster. Big companies like Microsoft, Google, and IBM want people who can learn quickly.

I'm learning about different subjects in high school right now, and I like all of them. It's fun to learn new things.

This time, they might solve it and understand the idea too. Next, we learn ideas to do things in real life. So, why not learn facts that help us do things right away? Learning facts is faster and doesn't waste time on boring theories. It saves time. Also, facts are sometimes better than ideas. Let's say we're learning to fix a bike. Books tell us about common problems. But what if the bike makes noises everywhere? That's a tough problem. Facts can help us here. In the end, learning facts saves time.

This has an impact on drivers. \n\nNowadays, more young people like cars than in the past. They like to take risks and have fun, and getting a driver's license at a young age doesn't help. In my country, Bahrain, most car crashes are caused by young drivers speeding, and the number of people dying each year doesn't seem to stop them. For a driver who wants excitement and to take risks, the right cars need to be made. \n\nAs I said before, today's cars are faster and have better technology than older ones. We must realize that this progress won't stop. When we think about other things in life, we see that cars are more in demand and needed more than ever. As jobs related to cars change, what we expect from cars changes too. New roads are built all the time, so we need cars that are faster and more reliable for these roads. \n\nNo matter what we do to try to use cars less, like making people older to get a license or using different ways to travel, I think that people can't stop using cars because they are private and save time. If we think about it, if the world gets better, we move forward, not back. So, to me, moving forward means more cars, not fewer."}

The first reason is that young people are more active. The second reason is that young people come up with fresh ideas for fun.\n\nFirst, young people are more active. They can dance with more energy than older people. Older people often can't dance with as much energy. They usually don't have the energy to dance for a long time.\n\nSecond, young people have new ways to enjoy life. Take festivals as an example. Young people use their creativity at festivals. They often think of fun ideas.\n\nIn conclusion, young people tend to have more fun in life."}
{"file_id": "1028226.txt", "output_essay": "Yes, I agree that young people have more fun than older people. This idea is interesting because some may not share my opinion. Life has changed; it is now very fast. This has made stress levels go up. It is hard for older people to keep up. They can't keep up with younger people at work. This means they can't enjoy their jobs or the good things that come from success. So, it's true that young people have more fun. I once read a book that said Alexander was able to chase his dreams because he was young. History tells us that the emperor Trajan was sad he couldn't conquer more because he was old. This tells us that to do most things, and to have fun, we need to be young. Many stories say people have looked for a way to stay young forever. Today, a lot of research tries to slow down aging. People spend billions of dollars on this. To go on many adventures, we also need to be young. Being young is a special gift that we can't get back. We should do important things while we are young. If not, it will be too late. This is what I believe. I'm not saying being old is bad. I'm saying being young is great, so we should make the most of it. That way, we won't have regrets when we're old."}
{"file_id": "1029018.txt", "output_essay": "I fully agree that successful people try new things and take risks instead of just doing what they are good at. Our world has many examples of people who took risks and made new things. These risk-takers have shaped our modern age. I think there are two main types of these actions.\n\nFirst, some people change how we do things. Look at the music industry. Not long ago, Sony's Walkman was very popular. To listen to music, you had to buy a Walkman and tapes. Sony thought this was the best way. But Steve Jobs from Apple had a new idea. He made the iPod, which uses flash memory to store music. You could keep more songs on an iPod than on Walkmans. Steve Jobs became famous for this, but Sony lost its lead because they only made better Walkmans. They didn't try something new.\n\nSecond, some people skip the old ways and find a completely new way to solve a problem. For example, consider how we used to send letters. You had to write on paper and mail it. This was slow. Then, some people thought of sending messages electronically, and we got the internet. Now, you can send an email with just a click. Email is faster and more efficient.\n\nSome might not agree. They say trying new things is risky and we shouldn't do it. I want to tell them that if our ancestors had thought that way, we would still be in the Stone Age. It's true that trying new things can lead to failure. But learning from failure and trying again is what makes someone successful."}
{"file_id": "1017877.txt", "output_essay": "I agree that successful people try new things and take risks instead of just doing what they are good at. I think this is because successful people want to get better and aim for harder goals than before. They try new things and take risks, which makes them feel strong and full of potential. Regular people look at them and think they wouldn't take the same risks. They often see successful people as very different for the reasons I've said. But I think it's normal for successful people to act differently from others. If they didn't, they wouldn't stand out. A person's success starts with their natural talents. Even before they were successful, they were born with special skills in talking, playing, and getting better at things. As they grow, those with these talents from a young age become truly successful. Most people think taking risks leads to failure or danger. I disagree. If a person doesn't risk much, he stays ordinary. But if he risks a lot (not all the time, but sometimes), it shows he might become successful. Successful people are also lucky. Sometimes they do things with more success than regular people. This isn't something they choose; it's like a special gift."}
{"file_id": "1029906.txt", "output_essay": "Education is very important for people, society, and making money. But, the way people learn can be different. Some writers think it's better for students to understand big ideas than to know a lot of facts. Others think knowing facts is better. I believe that knowing facts is better and I will explain why with two examples.\n\nFirst, let's talk about Math. It's clear that students who try to remember all the theories and rules in Math will find it hard to keep them in mind. That's why computer programs help students remember what they study. This is true for other subjects like economics and farming too. For example, students who study farming need to be outside, in the fields or greenhouses, to use what they learn about science and crop growing.\n\nThe second example is about when I was young in school. We went to some important places for our History and Geography class. I remember one place called Goree and its Slavery House very well. The guide's stories made me feel like I was there when slavery happened. I can talk about History better than people who never visited that place.\n\nIn the end, I've seen that using computers in subjects like Social Sciences and from my own school trips, I can"}
{"file_id": "1021923.txt", "output_essay": "Some people think that to be successful, you must always take risks and try new things instead of doing what you know. This idea has two sides. On one side, taking risks can lead to big rewards and new, creative work. On the other side, doing what you know well can lead to sure success, while taking risks can sometimes lead to big failures. I think that successful people are those who do what they are good at, and here are three reasons why.\n\nFirst, trying something risky without knowing much about it is like gambling; you might win or lose. You might even lose more often because you need to learn and get used to the new task. For example, you can't snowboard well without a lot of practice and lessons, or you might get hurt.\n\nSecond, to come up with new ideas, you need to start with what you know. Many books on managing people say that to create new things in any area, you first need to know a lot about that area.\n\nThird, people who take risks without knowing what they're doing can lose a lot. These big losses can stop them from being able to do other things later on. For instance, when the market crashed in the late 1990s, new investors who put in a lot of time and money into something they didn't understand lost a lot. Many went broke, lost their families, and got sick.\n\nIn conclusion, I think you can be successful by doing what you know well. Choosing to do familiar tasks usually leads to better results than taking risks without knowing what you're doing."}
{"file_id": "108871.txt", "output_essay": "Successful people try new things and take risks instead of just doing what they are good at. I believe that successful people should try and take risks instead of just doing what they are good at. A person should first make sure they are stable with money and in their mind by doing what they are good at. After that, it makes no sense to keep doing the same thing and getting the same results. To get ahead in life, a person should try new ways to do their work or try new things and take chances. We know that doing the same work all the time will only make life boring. To make life more exciting, one should try something new. But this should be done with care so it doesn't hurt one's good name or job. Let's look at Mr. Dhirubhai Ambani, who started Reliance Industrial Group in India. He first made a textile company in the late 20th century. He worked very hard to make it a big company. He was very successful and had a lot of money then. But he was a real business person and tried new things and took many chances by going into the oil industry. Now, Reliance Petroleum is a big name in the Indian economy. He also made Reliance Telecommunications, which was the first CDMA mobile service in India. He made a lot of money from this. In fact, the Reliance group has also gone into the energy and retail businesses. Today, the Reliance Group is one of the top 50 companies in the world. None of this would have happened if he hadn't taken chances and gone into these businesses instead of just sticking with textiles. So, I think it's always better to make sure you are stable first, with money and in your mind, and then try new things and take chances to grow your business. A successful person never stops but works hard to be more successful. Successful people try new things and take risks instead of just doing what they know how to do well."}
{"file_id": "115743.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with this statement. Successful people try new things because they want to do more. There are several reasons for this.\n\nPeople with many achievements are not happy doing just one new thing. They have big goals and want to learn, even if it might be risky. They are willing to try something they don't know because they don't like doing the same thing all the time. I think this way of life is better. Trying new things brings many new ideas into our lives. For example, I like soccer. In my country, I played soccer every weekend. But after some time, I got tired of it. I wanted to change my routine. Before I moved to the US, I didn't know about American football. Now I am learning it. I like it and am learning new rules, which makes me want to play it. Another example is about taking chances. I was working on a Ph.D. for two years in my country. I wanted to study in a new place, even though it was risky. The risks were spending a lot of money, needing to pass the TOEFL exam, and starting a new Ph.D. in the US. They didn't know how much money I had already spent. I also didn't know if I would pass the TOEFL or finish my studies. But I decided to do it.\n\nSuccessful people improve by trying new things. They find new ways to do things, which helps them try more new things. Let's say a student is getting ready for the TOEFL. He comes up with new ways to study, which helps him find better ways to learn. Then, he can use these ways for other tests, like the GRE.\n\nEvery successful person tries new things because of the way they live. They don't like to do things they already know well. They feel a push to learn new things."}
{"file_id": "1027356.txt", "output_essay": "The question says that in twenty years, there will be fewer cars than today. I think this is true and believe pollution is the main reason. Nowadays, there is more pollution than before, and it comes from factories and industry. This pollution makes the ozone hole bigger every day. It also increases the dangerous ultraviolet light that can harm our health. To fix this problem, we need to cut down on air pollution. Cars and other ways of getting around, like trains, are big causes of this pollution. If we want clean air, we should use other ways to get around that don't harm the environment, like bikes. We can also cut pollution by using cars and trains less. Cars are used by fewer people at once compared to trains, so they are not as good for the environment and there are too many of them. That's why I think we need to use fewer cars to fight pollution. In some cities, you can only drive cars on certain days. This rule makes me think that in the future, I might have to use trains or other ways that can carry more people. This is the only way we can get clean air, a clean environment, and clean seas. Plus, we will be healthier and get sick less often because a lot of sicknesses come from pollution caused by cars, trains, and so on."}

Every day, more people are born, and the number of people keeps going up. This means more people will need their own way to travel. Right now, cars are the best way to do this. Because of this need, and because cars are getting better all the time, they will be even more popular in twenty years. Cars run on fossil fuels, which we will have plenty of for the next twenty years. So, people will keep wanting cars. Cars that use less gas and pollute less are becoming more common. This makes people want to buy cars even more. Also, cars are getting safer and nicer to drive. This will make even more people want to drive cars now and in the future. Unless we come up with a completely new way to travel, like flying saucers or teleporting like in 'Star Trek,' cars and other vehicles that drive on the ground will still be the top choice. The truth is, as more people are born, they will need ways to get around. The car, which keeps getting better, will still be a key way for people to travel for a long time. Driving a car has become a big part of how we live, just like riding a horse used to be. Cars were the solution to travel needs sixty years ago, and they will still be the solution twenty years from now."}

Others say learning facts is also important. I think schools should focus more on helping students understand ideas and concepts. Here are my reasons. \n\nThe main reason is that schools are the best places for students to get ideas and concepts. They can learn facts on their own from the internet or movies. In class, teachers can guide them, and they can talk about things with other students. This is very important for understanding ideas and concepts. If teachers only tell students facts, we are not using what is special about schools. Also, the internet has more and newer information than textbooks. \n\nUnderstanding ideas and concepts also helps students with harder problems. Tests these days ask for more than just facts from the book. They ask students to use what they have learned to get better scores. If a student understands the ideas and concepts, they might do better on big tests like the College Entrance Examination. This can really affect their future jobs. \n\nIf students want to understand ideas and concepts, they will likely talk and share thoughts with others. This is good for their social skills. Talking can lead to friendships. When students talk, they might find they have things in common and become friends. As they keep talking, their friendship can grow stronger. \n\nEven though learning facts is important, I think understanding ideas and concepts is more important."}

They don't have to memorize things when they understand the basic idea. They also remember it for their whole life. Knowing facts might get them high grades, but they forget the subject quickly. \n\nWorkers do better in their jobs when they get the basic idea and main point of the projects they work on. Just knowing facts won't lead to good results. To get a better job or promotion, they need to learn the concepts well. For example, today, you need to understand computers to do well in most jobs. \n\nFor a sports player, it's very important to know the basic idea of the game, not just the facts. When I learned football, my coach taught me the main idea of the game. That's why I play well.

First, when you try new things, you learn more. Take driving as an example. It helps you pay better attention and notice more around you. Also, you get more skilled when you try new things. The more you try, the more you feel you can do anything, and the more skilled you become. Look at the bosses of big companies. If they hadn't tried new things and taken chances, they wouldn't be where they are today. Next, when you try new things and take chances, you get better at fixing problems. But if you're too scared to try new things and take chances, you might stay in the same spot forever. You'll do your job well, but you'll always do the same thing.

{"file_id": "1024274.txt", "output_essay": "I think that to really get ideas, we need to back them up with facts. First, you can't get an idea if you don't look closely at the facts that make up the idea. If you get an idea but don't know the facts that support it, you're just learning something that's taken as true without question. For example, in religion, people often accept beliefs without questioning the facts. They're not trying to deeply understand things but just want answers. That's why religious studies often skip over facts and prefer to interpret things. Second, to understand something, you should first learn the facts. This is how you start to think critically about it. You need to know the history behind an idea to get it. For instance, you can't grasp the main ideas of communism or Nazism without knowing the history and events that led to these harsh political systems. Lastly, I believe you don't really understand something if you can't back it up and explain it with facts. You show what you understand and why you believe it by looking at the facts. A scientist needs to do experiments to make his ideas clear. If he doesn't, people won't trust him, and his ideas won't seem good. These are the three reasons I think understanding an idea and knowing the facts about it are closely linked."}

This is because people who try new things know more about their work, take more responsibility, and care more deeply.\n\nFirst, people who try new things know their work well. They work hard to see if their ideas are correct. This means they need to learn a lot. So, they study harder.\n\nFor example, my brother studies science. He was not interested in it before. Last semester, his teacher asked him to make a new product. He worked so hard on this project that he read his books even during meals.\n\nTrying new things makes people focus more on their work. Second, it makes them take more responsibility. When you share a new idea, your reputation is on the line. If your idea fails, people might not trust you anymore. I once gave new advice to my cousin. Then, I tried to follow it myself. This made me take more responsibility.\n\nLast, looking for new ways in their work makes people care more."}

It was easy and it helped us learn a lot. I think the best way to travel is with a tour guide in a group. \n\nHaving a tour guide is the best because they know a lot and can teach you. People travel for two reasons. They want to relax or they want to learn about the places they go to. If you want to learn, you need a guide. It's hard to learn about places by yourself. If you don't have a guide, you will just look around without learning. This won't help you know more. \n\nTour guides also make trips safer. Places you haven't been to can be risky because you don't know what might hurt you. People who go alone can have problems. For example, I heard about a person who went to another country alone and got kidnapped. To be safer when you travel, go with a tour guide. A good guide knows about the risks and can keep you safe. \n\nAlso, with a tour guide, you don't have to plan your trip. If you go alone, you need to book hotels and flights. You have to decide what to do and where to go. But if you're in a group with a guide, the company takes care of all that.

So, they show it as perfect. For example, in a car ad, someone drives in a beautiful place. But in real life, we often drive in loud and dirty traffic. The person in the ad seems to enjoy driving more. Also, ads use music to make us want the product. The music makes the product seem better than in our noisy life. Plus, the people in ads are always happy and use the product well. We sometimes have trouble using something because we don't know how. Think about a new phone with many features we don't know how to use. In the end, I think products look better in ads than in real life because we don't use them in perfect conditions.

By learning about many subjects and getting knowledge from different areas, a person can live anywhere in the world, in any job. After learning a lot about many areas, we can see how important these areas are in our daily life. This can be helpful at some point in our life. We should know about many school subjects like reading, art, science and technology, medicine, and more. I just named a few key subjects that are very important in our lives. After learning a lot about many subjects, we can understand better. This can make us more creative and unique. We should learn about many subjects to handle all the subjects we need to live and deal with this tough world. By learning and going through different things in our lives, we can handle any situation we face. By learning, we can at least become kinder to others. Even if we know a lot, we should not use this knowledge to do bad things, like making nuclear bombs to destroy countries. We should use our knowledge to help our country, not to harm it with bad thoughts. So, I agree with the statement because by knowing a lot about many subjects, we can at least understand the basic things we need in our lives.

So, they don't have time to help in their community or do good things for others. When I look at my friends, only a few spend time helping others.

First, it's important to pick your future path once. It's too soon to pick what to learn. The more we try, the better we can choose. We don't know what we want to do yet because we haven't had enough time to think. Most college students are not sure about their future. In my case, I started studying French and worked with it. After two years, I wasn't sure if it was the right choice. I took some English classes and talked to a teacher. After that, I could think about my problem better. In the end, I decided to study both English and French. If I hadn't tried English, I wouldn't know what I really wanted to study because I wouldn't know I liked English. Second, sometimes people only know about their main subject, and this can make them dull. Today, the world likes people with many interests and skills. We can learn this from different activities, like other school subjects. Through these, we can look into other fields. For example, my university has a sports department. Many friends liked jazz dance and working out. Even though it wasn't their main subject, they took those classes and had fun. They didn't just enjoy their time at university, but they also made great memories and learned new things. Until we finished high school, we couldn't pick what we wanted to learn.

Second, ads are a strong tool for companies to tell us their products are good for us. So, they focus on the good points and not the bad ones, unless they have to by law. For example, ads for skin care products make us think they will fix all our skin issues. But the ads don't talk about how much time or money they will cost. This is why products like cigarettes or sleeping pills must list the bad effects they could have. If not forced by law, companies wouldn't show the bad sides.

They might have fun in a more active way, while older people might think more about their fun. When you're young, you can play sports. I enjoy horseback riding. To ride a horse, you need to be strong. Being strong is often linked to being young. At 80 years old, you probably won't be strong enough to ride a horse. Being able to do something can make you happy, just like not being able to do it can make you sad. So, if I can't ride a horse when I'm 80, I might be sad. Or, I might tell my grandkids about how great I looked on a horse. This brings me to another point.\n\nRight now, I can't say I look great on a horse. I'm focused on getting better at riding. But when I'm older, I'll think about all the active things I've done. I believe only older people can do this. It's a good thing because it means nature works well. Young people enjoy life in their own ways, like what they can do. But there are things they can't enjoy because they're young. Older people have their own joys, like thinking about their past. They're older, they've lived a long time, and they have time to think. Unlike me, I don't have time to think about how I look on a horse.

In the end, I believe that both understanding concepts and learning facts are important for the growth of young people. So, students need to grasp ideas and concepts."}
{"file_id": "1026027.txt", "output_essay": "In twenty years, we will see fewer cars on the road because of new technology. In the past, new technology often led to problems like heavy industry and using up natural resources. But now, people think technology can work with nature or even help it. This idea is popular among scientists and the public. Scientists are trying to make a car that doesn't dirty the air. They are working on an engine that doesn't need gas but uses something else instead. Some people say that scientists have made this engine using hydrogen, but it's not for sale yet because of business reasons. Also, buses and trains are getting cheaper. So, more people will ride them in the future. People will care more about the environment, just like we care more than our grandparents did. Some old writers said that big cities like Rome used to be very loud and dirty. It was hard to sleep at night because of the noise. Governments, mainly in places like Europe and America, know that too many cars cause problems. They will likely make rules to encourage cleaner cars or other ways to travel. These governments have learned from their mistakes. They will show new industrial countries how to grow and make money without hurting the land too much. This could prevent natural disasters that have happened in some parts of the world recently."}
{"file_id": "1041350.txt", "output_essay": "I believe that for a student, getting the hang of ideas and learning facts is key. But I don't think that ideas are more important than facts. Here's why I think this: first, it's no good if we get ideas but don't use them to learn facts. Learning ideas is great, especially when we use them to do helpful things. So, learning new ideas matters, but we also need to learn facts to see how to use these ideas. As a university student, I learn many ideas in class every day. Since I go to a technical university, it's crucial for me to get lots of hands-on experience to get better at a subject. Also, knowing facts is useful because they can help us later on. Another reason I feel this way is that if we only get ideas, we won't really get how they work. There are many things we can only learn through facts and doing things. I think a student is well-prepared in a subject if they learn both ideas and how to do things. In fact, in many companies, if someone wants to move up, they need lots of experience and knowledge."}
{"file_id": "1034797.txt", "output_essay": "Like wars and how countries deal with each other, our future also depends a lot on oil and other energy sources from the ground. I think there are two main things that could happen. The first is that we will have fewer cars than we do now because there might not be enough oil for all of them. But it's not just about cars. If we run out of oil, buses, taxis, lawnmowers, and planes won't have fuel either. No one will be able to travel. I could ride my bike to the store, but why? The store shelves will be empty. Without oil, trucks can't bring food to the stores. And this is just the beginning. Without oil, there would be no making of goods, no moving around, and even our modern technology could fail. I don't want to make this future look too dark. There's another way it could go. We know that our traffic system and maybe the whole world rely too much on oil and similar resources. We could change this. There are many smart people working on new ways to get energy. They have found things like wind and sun that we can use over and over. We could use less oil if we bought our veggies from a local farmer. Then we wouldn't need as many trucks. We have to start changing how we use energy now. In twenty years, we might have the same number of cars, but they could be powered by different types of energy, not oil. But I really think that in twenty years, there will be fewer cars that use oil."}
{"file_id": "1011110.txt", "output_essay": "In our world, most people go to school for 6 to 12 years to learn. The main goal is to get knowledge. Some students think it's more important to understand ideas than to learn facts. They focus on understanding only. I don't think this is right. I believe that facts are just as important as ideas. You can't split them when you're learning. First, we need to know why we study. We study to get knowledge. But what do we do with it? We should use it to get better at things we can do at work and in life. For example, if a student cares more about ideas than facts, he might not see why facts matter. He may not want to learn them. When he finishes school, he knows a lot of ideas but might not get a good job. He can't use what he knows at work. So, knowing facts is key for a student's future. Also, facts help students get ideas. Often, ideas are made of words and math problems. These can be dull. But if a teacher shares some facts, students might find the ideas more interesting. They might understand them faster. So, facts help with learning. Lastly, students can learn from facts. Facts are things that happened or times when people failed. This is big. If students don't learn from these, they might have to learn later, maybe by making mistakes. So, I think learning facts is very important for students. No one should overlook them."}
{"file_id": "1023612.txt", "output_essay": "Ads are everywhere. We see them in newspapers, on TV, and on big signs. These days, we even see ads in movie theaters. I think that ads often make things seem better than they are. They usually don't tell you about extra costs, how well the product works, and so they trick people.\n\nFirst, ads today don't share all the details about a product. Take the MasterCard ad, for example. It talks about good things like low interest and free gifts. But it doesn't tell you everything you need to know. My friend got a bill for $500 because he paid late. The ad didn't tell him about this. Also, the free gifts aren't really free. They charge you for them. In the cell phone world, it's the same. I got a call about a 'free' offer. But when I used it, my bill went up. They didn't say it would cost to use it.\n\nSecond, ads don't tell you how good the product is. I bought a calculator from a local store. It broke in two days. Some buttons didn't work. The ad didn't say how long it would last. I also got a BlackBerry. The ad offered 'Free Bluetooth Headsets' with it. But the headset stopped working in a month.\n\nLastly, ads often lie to people. They show the product as big on TV, but it's actually small. They say the product is free. But when you go to buy it, they tell you it's only free if you trade something in. Companies use many tricks like this to fool us.\n\nFor these reasons, ads give a false image of products and make them seem better than they are. I believe that companies should tell the truth about their products."}
{"file_id": "1034558.txt", "output_essay": "We need to think carefully about the idea that understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning facts. We should look at both sides of this argument. Learning facts is very important, especially in classes like history or medicine that have a lot of information. To pass tests and exams, you must remember these facts. But, if you first understand the ideas behind the facts, it's much easier to learn them. You won't just memorize; you'll know what they mean and why they matter. This helps you remember them better, especially if you talk about them with others. Also, remember that learning isn't just for school. It's for life. University teaches you many things that help you do well on tests and prepare for your job. As you get older, learning gets harder. You won't have the chance to learn so many things for free and with joy like you do now. I believe you can't just choose one way. It's best to mix both. Understand the ideas first, then learn the facts for tests. This is how I study at university, and it works well for me."}
{"file_id": "1033252.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with the statement because of what I've seen and what I think will happen. Cars pollute a lot, aren't very good at using energy, and need oil, which are big reasons why I agree with the statement. Cars hurt the environment a lot. They make the air dirty, which can make people sick. Since we all want to keep the environment safe, people will use cars less when they understand how bad cars are for the air and our health. Cars also need oil, which is hard to get and very expensive now. Oil prices are going up fast, and we might run out of it soon. Oil can't be made again quickly after we use it too much. With how much oil and natural gas we use now, we can't be sure we'll have enough for cars in 20 years. I've also seen that governments want fewer cars because they cause problems. Cars are handy for people, but they also cause harm that needs to be fixed. Every year, governments spend a lot of money on things related to cars, like pollution and accidents. That's why they are pushing for public transport like trains, buses, and subways. These are better because they save money and are easier for people to use. I think cars are bad because they pollute, waste resources, and cost a lot."}
{"file_id": "1021027.txt", "output_essay": "Cars are a big part of how we get around today. We've used them for over 50 years, but it's tough to guess how many there will be in 20 years. This needs a lot of thought. Still, we can guess if there will be more or fewer cars by looking at the good and bad things about them.\n\nThe number of cars might go up or stay about the same in 20 years. They are not new, so they are very important to us. For example, we've made big roads, bridges, and rules for driving them, and some people even think of their cars as friends. Also, even though cars make the air dirty, this hasn't stopped people from driving them. Plus, cars are still easier for getting to places than planes or trains. We will keep using cars for short trips. Also, in 20 years, we might have new stuff to use instead of gas that could make cars more popular.\n\nBut, we could also have fewer cars in the future. There might be new ways to travel that are better. For example, we might choose vehicles that are easier to get and work better. Also, cars need gas, which is running out and has caused people to fight and die for years. So, it makes sense that people are tired of the trouble gas brings. Not just the fighting and social issues, but also the cost. Gas prices have gone up a lot and are very high.\n\nIn the end, cars could still be as common as they are now in the future. But I think cars have so many problems that people will look for new ways to get around in 20 years. Plus, no one wants to deal with wars or high costs anymore."}
{"file_id": "1023946.txt", "output_essay": "Nowadays, many people think that learning facts is the best way to get better. But I believe that it is more important for students to grasp ideas than to memorize facts. This is because students with a good grasp of ideas can explain things better, and they have more time to learn than adults. Here are the main reasons why I think this way.\n\nOne reason is that ideas help people make sense of things in a logical way. For instance, students can sort and be sure of things with clear ideas. Take my brother as an example. He always explains why things happen because he learned many ideas at university. I didn't learn ideas, just facts from what I've seen and done. It's hard for me to explain things to others because I don't get the real ideas. People often say they can't understand my explanations. That's why I think learning ideas is key.\n\nAnother reason is that students have more time to learn ideas than adults. Adults might want to learn, but it takes a long time to understand new concepts. Like I said, my brother learned ideas at university. I wish I could explain as well as he does. So I tried to learn on my own. But I work six days a week and didn't have enough time to really learn the ideas. I wish I had studied ideas in university.\n\nIn conclusion, I think it's more important for students to understand ideas than to learn facts. When I have kids, I will tell them to focus on ideas at university so they won't have trouble explaining things to others."}
{"file_id": "1034720.txt", "output_essay": "No, I don't fully agree that traveling in a group with a tour guide is the best way to travel, for many reasons. I've visited lots of places, with my family and by myself. The best trip I had was in the USA with other teenagers my age. We were from different places. But it wasn't very relaxing. You didn't have total freedom to enjoy things your way. Instead of getting up at 6 AM and following a tour guide's plan, I'd rather explore by myself. I like to find new spots and see my trip as an adventure. Traveling with others can be fun. But I think it's better with just 2 or 3 friends who agree on things. Big groups can be great, but the tour guide often ruins it. They plan everything with strict times. It feels like a school day with a tight schedule. So, I think the best travel is in a group but without a guide. This way, you can do what you want and make your own choices. But if the guide is like the group and knows the area well, it could be the best trip. Still, having a guide in the Himalayas would spoil the adventure. You'd miss out on the thrill of doing it alone. So, the idea has good and bad points. It depends on the guide, the group, and the situation. If all three are perfect, then the idea is right."}
{"file_id": "1037397.txt", "output_essay": "I believe it's important for a student to grasp ideas and concepts, not just learn facts. Nowadays, technology is advancing, and people are creating new things. This often comes from thinking logically about something. For example, when Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone, he didn't just look at facts. He used logic and did physical experiments with concepts. Many early scientists also didn't just focus on facts. They really understood the ideas and how to use them. So, it's better for students to learn about different concepts and try out their own ideas. Let's think about another case. If students only think about facts, they might only know that things like oil and petrol are fuels, and cars need them to run. But then, Sastry, a student, wouldn't have made a new kind of fuel from a plant leaf and some chemicals. He used his deep understanding of the concept and worked hard to make his idea work. His idea could help a lot of people. Now, about the second part of the topic, which is learning facts, it does help students a bit. For instance, when studying the solar system, if you ask a student about the Earth's shape or the number of planets, they need to know those facts instead of trying to find out by experimenting."}
{"file_id": "1043585.txt", "output_essay": "I believe it's better to know a lot about many school subjects than to only know about one. I think this because a person who only knows one subject can be dull. Imagine someone who only knows about sea animals. Every time you see him, he only talks about that. It would be boring to listen to him. But if you know a little about many topics, people will think you're smart. You don't need to talk much. Just knowing a little about different things is enough. Most of the time, people won't argue with you, unless they know a lot about the topic too. It's still good to know a lot about one thing, like if you're a teacher or a doctor. Then, being an expert is important. Both knowing a lot about one thing and a little about many things are good. It's better than not knowing anything. I had a friend who was quiet. But when he talked about cars, he talked a lot. He loved cars and spent a lot of time on them."}

They were just for getting from one place to another. But now, we can even read a newspaper while driving because of new technology. If there is a crash, people are not hurt because cars are made to be safe. Old cars made the air dirty with smoke. But new cars use gas, not petrol or diesel. This helps keep the air clean. This was not possible with old cars. Now, there are many people, and they use cars a lot. In the end, I think that in twenty years, we will use fewer cars than we do today. Right now, cars with the latest technology sell well."}

Both have their good points, but is one more important than the other? For students, which one works better?\n\nIdeas are always needed and are important because they start all progress and success. Students need to understand these ideas because they really want to know more, and ideas start this desire. In detail, a student has to know what ideas mean to move ahead, to see new things, and to be more creative. So, getting ideas is very important for students, who will shape the future.\n\nBut, students also need facts because facts show what ideas lead to; they make things clear for us. Students can't just use ideas; without facts, they can't use their ideas in real life. Also, facts tell us about the past and present, and help us see the future. Like in history, we can't move forward without knowing what's real, and for students, facts show what's real. Plus, students use facts to check if their ideas are right.\n\nIn the end, with these good points, we can't say if learning facts or getting ideas is more important for students. I think we shouldn't compare them because they always work together. Both are needed for students."}

The reason people believe it is because it's true that successful people take risks. Those who disagree might think that success doesn't come from taking risks. They have a different view. \n\nPeople think this way because they learn about it in business classes. They learn that to be a good business person, you need to take risks. This is a key trait of successful people. It's very important. People agree because this information comes from real studies taught in schools. They trust what schools teach. \n\nBut, some people don't believe this. They trust their own ideas. That's okay. It's good to believe in yourself.

{"file_id": "1020691.txt", "output_essay": "The topic of focusing on one skill is hard to talk about because many people have different opinions on it. Some people might think that knowing a lot about many things helps a person understand more about the world. But we can't ignore that knowing a lot about one thing is sometimes needed to fix complex issues. After thinking about everything, I believe that focusing on one skill has more good points than knowing a little about many things. \n\nFirst, focusing on one skill definitely helps solve problems better. Why would you ask a math expert to read literature when you could ask an actor? I am sure that each person has a special talent that makes them unique: one person plays the piano, another cooks well, and I don't see why the piano player should learn to cook! Instead, he should keep practicing the piano to get even better. \n\nAnother reason I think this way is when I look at jobs. In marketing, there's a difference between how long a customer waits before a company starts to fix their problem, and how long it takes to actually solve it. When a company hires experts, it can fix problems faster. Also, if it has many different experts, it can start working on many problems quickly. \n\nFinally, a company needs to be well organized to make the best use of its employees' skills. If a company is well organized and hires experts, it will work better. \n\nIn the end, I strongly feel that focusing on one skill is an important way to solve some big problems in business and government.

Lastly, some people think a small market means cheap prices, but that's not always true. People like to shop no matter what, and the prices aren't always low.

But I believe that getting the ideas is way more important than just knowing facts. I have two reasons for this: people will remember longer if they get the ideas, and they can solve all kinds of problems, even the tough ones. First, people remember things for a longer time if they really understand the ideas. If they just memorize facts, they forget them fast. For example, in biology, I learned about the 'Feedback system' in our bodies. My mom knows a lot about biology, so she helped me understand it. But my friend, who had no help, just memorized the steps of the 'Feedback system.' We had a surprise test last week, and I could answer all the questions about it, but my friend couldn't answer any. I knew the answers because I understood how it worked. My friend forgot what he had memorized. Next, students can solve any tough problem if they really understand the ideas. In math class, teachers don't just give easy problems; they give hard ones. Students who get the ideas can solve these problems. But students who just memorized facts get confused or stuck because they only know the basics. So, since students don't forget or mess up what they know when they understand the ideas, and those who get the ideas can solve all the hard problems, I say that understanding the ideas is way more important than just knowing facts."}
{"file_id": "1034028.txt", "output_essay": "I don't agree that young people have more fun than older people. I think this for a few reasons. Being young leads to getting old. We need to save money for when we are older. Many young people go to college or trade schools. They work hard to get better at what they do because they want good jobs and pay. Young people are healthier than older people and learn new things more easily. So, they can get jobs and make money more easily. Think about how hard it is to work and make money when you're very old. It's tough for older people. I know two people who show what I mean. One man saved money when he was young. Later, he got married, bought a nice house, and paid for his kids' education. But another man didn't save or work hard. He had fun when he was young, drinking with friends, buying fancy clothes, and getting expensive gifts for his girlfriend. Later on, even though he got married, he still lived in a rented house. Sure, we can have fun when we're young. I'm not saying it's bad to enjoy being young. Trying new things and traveling are good for young people. But we should also work on making ourselves better when we're young. There's a story about two bugs. An ant worked hard all summer and could relax in the winter. But another bug just had fun and sang all summer. When winter came, he had nothing to eat. Think about it. Isn't it easier for young people to study and make money?

For instance, in my country, some companies make low-cost items and promote them as the best, like no one else can. They end up selling millions.

They make their products in Asia where labor is cheap. This way, they can make things they can't make in the US. Most countries do this, even if a person could make the product on their own. They just say where it was made. Still, everyone knows ads are meant to show off and sell products. So, people can choose to buy or not. If the ad is good, the product usually sells well. You can tell if a product is strong or bad. Ads should be clear. If they're not, people get confused and wonder what the ad was even for.

Being young and being old both have good and bad sides. Young people are stronger and can do more things like sports. But they are often too busy with school or work to notice. Old people, when they retire, have time to do things they missed, like reading or learning new things. An old teacher of mine started learning about philosophy after he stopped teaching. Old people can handle problems better because they have seen a lot. They don't worry about getting a job or finding someone to love. Young people might have family issues, but old people have their own families to enjoy time with. The biggest problem for old people is getting sick. It's risky for them to go out in the cold because they could get very sick. Young people can fall and maybe just break a leg, but their grandkids can fall without getting hurt. It's also sad for old people when their friends or partner pass away. My grandfather was 93 and had been alone for the last ten years of his life. That's hard to believe.

If you only know about one thing, you might not be able to talk about other problems that are important. This is a big issue because most people only see their own problems. Others might have bigger problems. People who only know one thing might only have one kind of job their whole life. If you lose your job, it's better to be able to do different jobs. This is easier if you know about many things. But if you only know one thing, it's hard to find a new job.

Last summer, we went to Spain to see the country and its culture. We didn't have a guide. We took a taxi to our hotel.

First, let's look at the bad effects of cars. More cars mean more traffic. A person might spend an hour to get somewhere. This makes them stressed and angry. They become unhappy and do less well at work. Imagine if this happened to many people! The second issue is car crashes. We often hear about them because people break traffic rules, and this can kill people. Think about how this affects everyone's mind. The third issue is dirty air. Too many cars make the air bad. In big cities, you can smell the car smoke, which is bad for health. Because of these problems, people want to find better ways to travel. They want to make less harm from cars. In every country, people are working on their trains. Trains can help avoid traffic and get people to places faster. This makes people less stressed and they can travel calmly. Also, some countries push people to ride bikes. I think this is a good idea. It reduces stress and is better for health. In the end, as cars and their problems bother people more, they look for solutions. With trains and bike paths, people will use cars less. So, in twenty years, we will see fewer cars than we do now."}

But we need to use fewer cars because they pollute, cause accidents, and gas is getting more expensive. This can work if we make public transport better. Pollution from cars is a huge problem for the planet. We know cars are a big part of this. Car crashes kill and hurt many people. Drinking and driving too fast are often the cause. Gas prices have been going up for a while. They will likely keep rising. Rules to control cars will work if buses and trains get better. We need a good subway, train system, and bus services that people can afford. It's a tough task. Yet, considering the pollution, accidents, and high gas prices, better public transport will be appealing."}
{"file_id": "1041462.txt", "output_essay": "Ads are made by many factories and businesses to tell people about their new things. Sometimes they are honest about their things, and sometimes they are not. So, how can we find out the truth?\n\nFirst, we can see if something is good by asking people who have used it. For example, if your cousin saw an ad on TV for a new machine, like a sports machine, we know the TV will say good things to make people want it and buy it, even if it's expensive. So, your cousin bought it. Then, you learn about this machine and think about getting one too. You ask your cousin, but he or she says it's bad and it broke on the first day. When you hear this, you will choose not to buy it. This is one way to know if an advertised thing is worth getting.\n\nSecond, if you really want something you saw in an ad, why not get it? You won't lose anything by trying; it might be better than you think. Anything can happen, but be careful with what you do and don't spend too much on stuff you don't need. Only get what you really need.\n\nIn conclusion, ads can be helpful because they tell you about new things you might have been looking for, and then you find them easily. So, you should keep up with new ads because sometimes they are good."}

By doing new things, we can learn a lot and become well-known. We can find out new things by trying. Some people might not succeed after taking many chances, so they keep doing the same job. I don't think this is right because we can't get ahead without trying new things. For example, a country that is growing will always be growing if it doesn't try new things to become a developed country.\n\nTake someone who wants to be the best or an engineer. He has to take many chances and try different things, think in new ways, and work hard. I believe this will make him successful.\n\nI don't agree with the idea when a person doesn't work hard or try new things. Then he won't reach his goals or be successful. Look at Sachin Tendulkar. He wasn't good at school but loved cricket. His dad took many chances and helped him practice cricket instead of just focusing on school. Because of taking chances and trying new things, Sachin became a great cricketer, and India is proud of him. This all happened because he didn't stick to what he knew.\n\nIn the end, I believe that people who try new things and take chances will find success and be the best."}
{"file_id": "1036123.txt", "output_essay": "The thought that understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning facts is very true. I want to share some reasons why I think this is true. Learning something well means two things: getting the main idea and using it in real life. Students often try to remember all the details like dates, places, names, and rules for a test. But we forget that this isn't the most important part of learning. A teacher should first help a student get the idea. When the idea is clear, it's easy to use it to solve problems and in real life. For example, if a young student learns why a country's people fought their government, they understand why good government matters. When a student gets the main point of a problem, they won't forget it. They can use it in real life. After understanding, it's key to practice with examples. This helps the student use their own thinking and make personal views. Practicing means dealing with different situations. This helps the student think of solutions or form opinions. That's why I say teaching a student just the date when human rights were signed is not enough. But if you teach them why human rights matter, you help create a great person."}

For example, my family went to Singapore. We missed many great places because we didn't know much about them. If we had a guide, this wouldn't have happened. \n\nA guide can help us spend less money. They know about hotels and other things. They can find trips that are not too expensive. A friend went to Singapore with a guide and spent only 10,000 dollars. I went without one and spent 15,000 dollars. So, a guide can help us save money. \n\nGuides also save us time. They make a plan so we can see a lot of places quickly.

{"file_id": "1024264.txt", "output_essay": "It is very important for students to understand ideas and concepts. This helps them remember how to do things easily. For example, in biology, it is tough to learn facts if you don't know why they matter in living things or in their actions. In history, knowing when things happened is important. But if you get the ideas and how an event grew, you can sort it into the right order more easily.\n\nStudents learning a new language need to learn words. This helps them get better at the language. Law students must learn facts too. They can't skip this. Medical students also need to learn many words for body parts.\n\nLearning facts about a topic takes a lot of time. It is not very useful when you work for a company later. Understanding ideas and concepts is better. It is simpler to learn and get than to just remember facts. Facts can seem made up, and you might not know how to use them right when it really matters.\n\nFor example, if a machine stops working, it is hard to check every fact about it. It is simpler to think about the machine as a whole: How it works and what it makes. This way, it is easier to find out what is wrong with the broken machine.\n\nSo, I believe students who want to work in a company that deals with trade or processes should learn more about ideas and concepts. It is more important to understand the full way a process works than to know facts you can find in a book. Understanding ideas and concepts helps you think about problems. Being able to solve problems is a skill that many bosses look for.\n\nI think that understanding ideas and concepts is the top skill for business. That is what students should focus on learning in college."}

After the trip, we realized we didn't remember much because the group was in such a hurry. We didn't have time to take many pictures. So, I've decided to always travel with a tour guide from now on. There are a few reasons for my decision. First, some think traveling with a group is cheaper than hiring a tour guide. I don't agree. A tour guide isn't too expensive and gives you a lot. They show you amazing places not in your travel book. You also get time to take photos and feel free. When we travel with a group, we rush from place to place. We don't enjoy what we see. This feels like a waste of money and time to me. Second, with a tour guide, we can be ourselves. In a group, we have to follow orders. We travel to have fun, not to be told what to do. We should be in charge of our trip. Third, group travel might seem safer. We can deal with problems together. But we should be ready to handle challenges on our own. Dealing with issues can be a good part of travel. Plus, a tour guide will help us when we need it. We are in charge. We use our money and time to enjoy life and face problems. In conclusion, group travel has its good points, like safety and cost. But these don't match the great experience a tour guide can give us. So, let's get ready to really enjoy our lives!"}
{"file_id": "1031374.txt", "output_essay": "From what I've seen on my trips, the best way to travel is with a group and a tour guide. When you travel with someone who knows the place, you learn a lot. You also form smart thoughts about what you see and do while traveling. Two years ago, I went to New York with my family. I noticed a big difference between going alone or with a guide. On our own, we just walked around, looking at tall buildings, but didn't learn anything cool about the city. We also got lost trying to find our hotel. The next day, we hired a tour guide to learn more about the city and its main sights. The guide told us city stories, showed us important spots, good places to eat, and other helpful things we wouldn't know if we kept going alone. Going with a guide is better than just not getting lost: you learn real facts and secrets about the place. I also want to talk about my trip to China with my family last year. With a guide, you can form smart thoughts about the place. When we first got to China, I thought we'd see poor people under a communist rule. This didn't change when we explored alone. But in Beijing, our guide shared the Chinese view of their country. I learned so much about Chinese culture and their way of life from the guide. This new view changed my mind about China. I now have a more thoughtful and smart view of Chinese culture and their current life. After going to New York and China with a guide, I still think it's the best way to travel. Without a guide, my family and I wouldn't have seen New York like a local or learned about Chinese culture from someone who really knows it."}
{"file_id": "1029696.txt", "output_essay": "I think that marketing and ads are now important in our lives. There are more and more products to buy, so companies are trying hard to make us know and remember their brands. Why do we remember one product but forget another? It's simple; we are made to think (even without knowing it) that one product is better. So, we only remember the good one. This pushes advertisers everywhere to make their products look better than they really are. They want to show that their product is the best.\n\nOne way they do this is by showing ads with places or things that aren't real. For example, a perfect beach that looks like a painting, or a photo changed by a computer. They want us to think what they sell is better because it's shown in a perfect place. Also, the people in ads are usually very pretty or handsome. Advertisers use these perfect-looking people to make us think we can be like them if we buy the product, like a new phone.\n\nThe biggest problem is when ads say a product can do something it usually can't. Ads often talk about the best things that happened, like a toothpaste that made teeth super white in a test. But while they tell us this, there's a quick note in small letters saying a special chemical helped the toothpaste work in the test.\n\nThis issue will get worse as more new products come out every day. It makes advertisers want to keep doing this."}
{"file_id": "1030588.txt", "output_essay": "If 'success' means making a lot of money or creating new things, I agree with the statement. Lately, life has gotten easier because of better factories, and everyone knows the same things because of better ways to talk to each other, like the internet. So, you can have a good life by doing the same work every day. This means you don't need to try new things for a normal life, and it seems like many people don't want to. But trying new things is even more important now! In science, you only find new things if you try new things or think of new ideas. Doing what we already know only gives us what we already know. In making money, trying something new can sometimes make you very successful. But trying new things in business can be risky and can turn into a risky bet, so we need to be careful with our risks. But I also think it's important to keep old ways, ideas, and cultures. They can help start new ones. And we can stop some mistakes and bad things that happened before by remembering them. So when talking about 'importance' or 'important people', I can't say one is more important than the other."}

Knowing a lot about one subject also helps a student feel sure of himself. He can live a good life with nice things. He will get better at his job. Other workers will help him. His experience will lead him to success and happiness. He will earn more money, get more respect, and do better at his job. In the end, he will feel good about what he has done in his work.

But we might ask if young people really have more fun than older people. First, we will look at reasons why this might be true. Then, we will think about older people to decide if it's true or not.\n\nWhy do we think young people have more fun? One reason is that young people are full of energy. They are not afraid because they are young. They feel like nothing can hurt them. They are at a time in their life when they have big dreams and will do anything to make them come true. This could mean traveling the world or going after a certain job...\nAnother thing about young people is that they have more time to spend with friends or enjoy their hobbies. They have less to worry about...\n\nThis is why they can do what they enjoy. They always make time for it because they are full of energy. Another reason they have fun is that everything is new to them. Also, people often make their best friends when they are young.\n\nNow, why do we think older people have less fun than young people? One reason is that older people have many responsibilities like work, family, and kids. These things take up a lot of time and can be boring sometimes.\n\nBut we need to think about what 'having fun' really means.

They have many ways to have fun, like computers, clubs, sports, and more.\n\nOlder people, on the other hand, don't have the strength to do things that need a lot of effort or energy. They also might have health problems. A big issue for them is that they find it hard to use new and modern fun gadgets. Also, having money is important to enjoy life. Even though older people might have money saved from working before, young people can be happier and have fun with just a little money.\n\nYoung people stand for energy, hope, joy, success, and life without problems. In short, I think that young people have more fun than older people. Young people are very fortunate and have a great chance to do what they want to be happy.

In twenty years, these new technologies will probably be good enough to let cars run without oil. This doesn't mean they won't hurt the environment. The environment might be in bad shape by then. But I don't think anyone will do anything to fix or stop the damage, since no one has done anything so far. People may give up their cars if the Earth gets so hot that it's hard to live here. But I don't think that will happen in the next twenty years. Car companies are too strong, and no one will stop people from using cars until it's too hot. Since this won't happen soon, and because cars are very popular and fit well with how people live in cities around the world, it's likely that car sales will keep going as they are now.

Here are two reasons why I think this is true.\n\nFirst, ads make things look great to get a lot of people interested. Take the Nintendo DS ad as an example. It's a handheld game made by a big Japanese video game company. In the ad, a famous Japanese actress, Nanako Fujisaki, seems to have fun playing it. So, I bought one last year. It was fun at first, but I got bored in three days. Now, I don't use my Nintendo DS at all. It's just sitting in a box. This shows that ads make things look better to draw people in.\n\nSecond, many people think ads make things look too good. When I was at Kyoto University, a well-known school, I took a class on how to make a brand look good. We looked at real examples. My teacher, Professor Okada, talked about a car ad. The top student, Okaie, said that in the ad, cars from companies like Toyota and Nissan drive on a road that's too perfect to be real. He said it was just a trick to make the brand look good, and we all knew that road didn't exist in Japan. Everyone in class agreed with him.

You don't know much about life, so you have to find out about it. You usually have little or no money compared to when you're older. This lets you focus on what really interests you. For example, if you're young and want to go on a trip, you look for a cheap way to do it. Maybe a very cheap flight to Mallorca, Spain, and staying in a hostel for 10 dollars a night. No breakfast, because you still feel the alcohol from last night. I am 30 now. This kind of trip would be too much for me. But 5-10 years ago, I would have loved it. Now, I prefer to fly to a very nice place, stay in a good hotel, maybe rent a car. Do some sightseeing. And at night, I would eat out. At a good restaurant, with tasty food and good wine!

First, ideas and thoughts are the start of actions, new things, showing feelings, and more. To connect with facts, we need to think about the ideas and thoughts behind them. Students will learn both. Even if an idea or thought is not proven today, it might become a fact tomorrow. But learning facts is also important to understand where they come from. What makes a fact a fact? Second, students should learn how to compare thoughts and facts. This helps them understand facts better and makes learning easier. We can also teach them how to compare things. Also, when we set learning goals, we should aim to learn facts but also keep in mind ideas and thoughts. It's like knowing about the three forms of matter, but now we know there's a fourth form. Knowing about thoughts helps us stay open to new ideas. In the end, students should know why they are learning and how to learn. They should learn to link and compare facts and thoughts.

The first reason is that the main goal for people who make things is to sell more. Ads are very important for selling because there are so many similar products out there. To stand out, you need good ads. For example, when I lost my cell phone and needed a new one, I saw many ads. I chose to buy the one with the best ads in the store. But when I started using it, I found it hard to use. It had too many extra features I didn't need, like a camera. I only use my phone to make calls. So, I learned that I should be more careful with ads. The second reason is that makers sometimes think they'll only know if their product is good after lots of people try it. They want to sell first and deal with any problems later if customers complain. This isn't a great way to think, but it's common because selling is their top priority. But now, with more people paying attention to recalls, this approach is becoming more dangerous in advanced countries.

These groups help new students learn about the campus, including classrooms, labs, the library, and departments. They also help with the university catalogue, advising, signing up for classes, and choosing a major. Plus, they tell new students about clubs and other activities they can join. AUC students also join groups that talk to former students and donors to get money for many university activities. This shows how well AUC students serve their small community. Looking at the larger community, AUC has many clubs run by students that want to make life better in Egypt. These clubs, like the Help Club, Cancer Club, and Hand in Hand Club, do important work. The Help Club collects money from students to buy food, clothes, and homes for poor people. The Cancer Club gathers money to help cancer patients. The Hand in Hand Club visits old people in homes, gives them what they need, and tries to make them happy. This is a way to thank them for what they did when they were young.

Often, people see learning facts and understanding concepts as two different things. But if you really get the ideas, you can learn facts too. For example, my friend in college focused on one special idea. From this idea, he figured out things like math formulas.

For example, in the first two years of studying for a pharmacy job, we took classes in culture and art, which have nothing to do with pharmacy. Many students changed their main area of study after these classes. They found they were really good at other things. Studying different subjects let them pick what they liked most. Think about if these students only learned about pharmacy from the start. Many might have failed because they didn't get to try other subjects. This is very important in areas that affect people's health and safety, like medicine, pharmacy, and engineering. But students working on advanced degrees don't face this issue. They chose a specific area after trying out different subjects as undergraduates. So, knowing a lot about many subjects won't last forever. It goes well with knowing a lot about one subject."}
{"file_id": "1036451.txt", "output_essay": "I don't really agree with the opinion above. I believe that understanding ideas and learning facts are both important. Understanding an idea is key. It helps you use it in new situations and link it with other ideas. It's needed to do well on tests and to come up with new ideas or theories. I think true understanding shows if someone is smart and can think for themselves. These qualities are needed for a good researcher and a rewarding career in academia. For instance, Skinner's work on learning theories was used by many other scientists. They did many exciting tests and found useful things. But you can't ignore the need to know facts. For too long, students just had to remember facts without showing they understood them. I agree this is pointless. It's also hard to learn facts, and sometimes it feels useless. Still, facts matter. Researchers need to know all parts of a theory, how tests were done, why, and when. They should know when a theory or fact was found and who found it. This background info is helpful. You start by learning facts. Then you understand the idea behind them. Next, you learn how to use this understanding. You can't do the last part without the first two. So, I think you can't say which way of learning is more important for a student."}
{"file_id": "1046028.txt", "output_essay": "I really agree with the idea. I think the main purpose of education is to give students the big ideas and concepts. These are things they can understand, make their own, and use to learn more or to make choices in life. Facts are like proof in a trial. They back up the big ideas and concepts. Students need to read facts, get them, and see how they show or tell about the big idea. Facts are key to understanding, but they are just details we learn and then forget. What stays with us is the big idea, the concept, and that's what's really important. Let's look at history as an example. We learn many facts, dates, and events. These are details we'll probably forget later. But we need these facts to get what happened at a certain time and to think about the causes and effects of those times. Facts help us get a wide view of that time and the main forces at work then, like the economy, society, or religion. Even if we forget the exact dates or facts, we still remember the general idea of what was going on. Also, I believe our minds can't keep all the details and information we read. Computers are great at keeping information. But our minds are amazing at working with information, putting it together, and coming up with big ideas and concepts. Once more, we see what's really important: ideas and concepts. To end, I really agree with the idea, as I showed with the examples I gave."}

I think they actually spend more time helping than young people did in the past.\n\nOne way young people help is by volunteering. Even though young people in the past volunteered too, now there is a bigger push and need for it. There are many reasons why young people volunteer today.\n\nFirst, young people now have more chances to volunteer. In schools, teachers tell students to join in things like Flag Day or teaching English at a local school.\n\nToday, volunteering is almost a must. In the past, students didn't have to volunteer, but now they must volunteer to take part in many activities. For example, there's a program called HKAYP. Students work on outdoor skills. To join HKAYP, they must volunteer for a number of hours to get into different levels (bronze, silver, and gold) and get certificates when they finish each level.\n\nAlso, volunteering is seen as important. All students want to get into good colleges. They know that volunteering can make a good impression on colleges. It shows on their college applications. So, young people in Hong Kong now spend a lot of time volunteering, especially during holidays. They get a certificate from the government after they volunteer for a certain number of hours.\n\nIn conclusion, I don't agree that young people today don't help their community enough. I believe they actually help more because they know more about volunteering (schools tell them about it), some programs make them volunteer to join, and they can show their volunteer work on college applications."}

They go to parties, dance clubs, bars, and also to movies, college, and plays. Young people like to travel. They go to many cities in Europe or Asia. Older people have to think about their families, their kids, or even their own parents. They watch TV or take walks in the park. They play 'tre sette,' a game from Italy. Young people don't have as many worries or things to take care of as older people. Young people are the future. They need to learn from the mistakes older people have made.

These clubs are part of what students do to help society. \n\nStudents at my university like these clubs a lot. They all want to make society better. They focus on different people, so they form different clubs. At the start of the semester, these clubs look for new members. Then they put the members into groups to plan help projects. Sometimes, they spend a whole semester planning a big project. This project might include many universities and happens during the summer or winter break. \n\nThese students do amazing things for communities and society. They give their time and ideas to do things like clean up every piece of trash in an area, wash elderly people who live alone, or teach children for free after school in faraway places. It's not right to say young people don't want to help just because some spend a lot of time on computers or at karaoke. \n\nStill, we need more young people to help out.

For example, trucks bring food to stores or cars take us to the hospital if we get hurt badly. I believe we need cars, and most people in our country agree. That's why I think there will be just as many, if not more, cars in 20 years. People argue about cars. Some say cars are bad because they pollute. Cars use natural resources and can harm the environment. If this stays true, we might see fewer cars in 20 years. People would want to cut down on cars to save the environment. But I don't think that will happen. I believe our scientists are getting better at their work. They have made engines that use less gas, like hybrid engines, and engines that run on solar power or plant oils. These new engines aren't ready to take over yet. Scientists need more time to improve them. Remember, it took many years to make gas engines as good as they are now. I think scientists will make big improvements to these new engines in the next 20 years. In 20 years, we may not have a perfect car that doesn't pollute at all. But I think we'll be close to finding an engine that pollutes much less. And maybe in 40 years, we'll have cars that don't need gas at all. If that happens, people will see how great cars can be.

Times are moving and growing quicker than before. Some have gone to space, and many satellites fly around the earth. People will travel with their own flying machines, like small planes, or even fly on their own. Long ago, people dreamed of flying and they built airplanes. The more we want, the more we make. Airplanes were just a start. Now, many smart people and dreamers are making new things and turning them into real stuff. Next, the future will be full of robots. We always want things to be easier and have made machines to do our work. There are robots for the kitchen, for playing with kids, and even for dancing. So, most easy work, like housework or bringing things to us, will be done by robots. We won't need cars, and we'll just call our robots for help to move or get things. Of course, cars have been very useful for a long time. We still use cars almost every day. But changes in time and technology are bigger and shape our lives. We can't stop the change."}

I learned that it's hard to find a job without being an expert in one area, especially a good job. My friends who studied Economics said that jobs have changed a lot lately. Companies need people who can do one thing really well. So, bosses want to hire experts. My friends who got a PhD or went to a technical school got jobs quickly.

I will talk about some examples now. Think about the richest man, Bill Gates. If he had just kept doing what his coworkers did, he wouldn't have made so much money in the last 20 years. Bill Gates worked at a software company. He turned a small program into a small operating system. He did well, and it was a big step for the world of computers. This operating system got better and could do many things that used to take the computer operator a lot of time. He has made billions of dollars from selling different versions of Windows. I think he was very successful because he tried to create something new. I also have an example from my life. One day, I told my boss, 'We should stop doing the same paperwork every day and face a new challenge!' I shared my idea to make the payment form at our company automatic. We used to fill out this form by hand, and we had about 10,000 forms like this every month. I led the project to make the form electronic. With a lot of help and support from our top managers, I finished it. I saved my company about $400,000. After that, I got a promotion, all because of my idea.

If I could do it again, I would hire a tour guide without a doubt. I really think it's good to travel in a group with a guide leading us.\n\nFirst, I like to hire someone to show me around because it's the best way to see a city I don't know. Also, the guide can tell me about the history, show me famous buildings, share fun stories, take me to local restaurants, and places to have fun. And it's all included in one price! For example, on the trip with my mom, the guide took us to every important place in France. My mom had been there alone three years earlier, but with the guide, she found out many new things about Paris.\n\nNext, traveling with a guide means I'll be safe. The guide knows the best paths and times to see the city. So, I don't have to worry about getting lost or running into trouble.\n\nIn short, I like to travel with a guide because it's the best way to learn about a new place.

Looking up travel books and searching online for the best spots is exciting.\n\nSecond, with a tour group, you must stick to their plan. This means you can't do what you want whenever you want. The worst thing is they decide when you can have free time! When I travel, I feel different at times. Sometimes I want to move fast, but often I like to slow down and enjoy the moment. I think it's important to do things at your own pace.\n\nThird, the flights that tour groups book often leave in the middle of the night and use small airports. Tour guides try to save money and make more profit. They pick big planes with tiny seats to pack more people in. They also choose cheaper, smaller airports. This makes the trip uncomfortable and less fun.\n\nThis is why I think traveling with a tour group is not the best way. There are many other ways to enjoy a trip more."}
{"file_id": "1034078.txt", "output_essay": "I don't agree with the idea that young people have more fun than older people and I want to explain why I think so. First, let's be clear about what 'having fun' really means. Many of us get it wrong. Having fun is about doing things that make you or the people you care about happy. It's not about showing off. This is even more true for older people. They have lived longer and have more experience. They are wiser. So, they usually don't do things just because these things are seen as fun. Young people, for different reasons like wanting to fit in, trying new things, having energy, and being excited, often do things that are easy to see and say they are having fun. But older people might not travel, go on adventures, watch movies, or go to parties as much. They have other things they like to do, such as reading, gardening, religious stuff, or community events, that make their day happy and fun. I also think that while young people have fun doing things for themselves, older people find joy in doing things for the people they love. For example, a dad who works hard to build a house for his family feels as happy as a young person who loves to hike. We shouldn't think this means he's not having fun. So, to end, I want to say that fun doesn't depend on how old you are. It's about how you feel inside. Everyone tries to find fun in different ways at different times in their life."}

Steve Jobs started Apple and knew that to win, you have to risk and do things not like your rivals. Professor Porter believes that the best edge for a company or person is to be unique. Being unique isn't just about new things; it can also be about doing old things in new ways. When we try new things, we risk more. But to win, we need to think about the risks and what we might gain or lose. I think success comes from many things: being creative, thinking of new ways to do things, being willing to risk, and being able to guess what might go wrong. Look at Steve Jobs again. He made Apple a hit by seeing how to make the iPod stand out from other MP3 players. He chose a new way, thought about the risks, faced some failures, and then made it with his product. So, success comes when a person learns from their mistakes, which happen when they try to be different and take risks.

{"file_id": "1029769.txt", "output_essay": "For many years, teachers, leaders, bosses, thinkers, and students in Germany have talked about what school should teach: Should we learn a little about many things or a lot about one thing? Some think it's better to know a little about many topics. Even though this has some good points, I think it's better to learn a lot about one topic. First, it's better to study what you really like instead of many different things. This way, you can focus on one thing. If you do, you will finish your studies on time and get good grades. Studying too many things is confusing, and you won't have time to learn each one well. For example, it's hard to study literature, culture, or media with math or engineering. Second, companies today want experts, not people who know a little about everything. There are not many jobs for these generalists. Job ads in papers always list the skills a worker needs. Usually, only an expert has these skills. So, being an expert in one thing is the best way to get a good job. Finally, knowing a lot about one thing doesn't stop you from learning about other things. If you're good at one thing, you might learn about other interesting things too. But you should still focus on your main study area. Thinking about all this, I believe it's very important to be an expert in one thing rather than knowing a little about many things. In some ways, we all know a little about many things.

He wants to improve things like schools to help the kids grow.\n\nLastly, I think young people today really want to make a difference. They have a lot of energy to help.

{"file_id": "1044553.txt", "output_essay": "As we get older, we often get wiser. It's not always true that young people have more fun than older ones. It really depends on how someone lives and what they do every day. Young people can be full of energy, happy, friendly, and also serious and calm. But some young people might not have fun. This could be because they've had bad times, or they don't get to enjoy time with their family, school, or other parts of life. On the other hand, a lot of older people have fun. They think getting older is a great way to get more experience, which gives them lots of memories and know-how. I think my grandfather shows that older people can have as much fun as young ones, or even more. He is 86 years old and started to live again when he was 75, after my grandmother passed away. Some thought he would be sad, but he wrote a book, dances at a club every week, opened his own small bar, and now has a girlfriend. He might even marry her soon. Even though he has diabetes and high blood pressure, he has chosen to have fun and see life as a new chance. I think he sets a great example for young people who might give up on their dreams, hopes, and sometimes their lives. He's also a good example for me, and I want to have as much fun in life as he does, or even more. That's why I don't agree with the idea that young people have more fun than older ones."}

Some people believe that in twenty years, we will have even more cars than now. Owning a car is getting more costly. There is less oil in the world, so its price is rising a lot. Not everyone can buy it. Also, in big cities, public transport will get better. For example, in Paris, the government is making new bus lines. They want Paris to be a city without cars. Some people think we should stop driving cars because they make the air dirty. But cars are the easiest way to travel. You can go anywhere, anytime. You don't have to wait like you do for buses and trains. Even though gas prices are high, governments are looking for answers. In France, the government is trying to bring in a new kind of gas made from plants. This gas is used in places like Brazil, where it's cheaper than in France. It also makes less pollution in big cities. Plus, in a car, people can do what they like, just as they do at home. They can pick the music they listen to, they can smoke, and they can make phone calls. I think public transport can improve a lot. But with new technology, everyone will want their own car. I believe in twenty years, we will use more cars than we do today."}

This knowledge helps us understand events better and shapes how we think in different situations. It's hard to think about things you've never heard of. You can't talk about your feelings if you don't know about the topic. It's better to know a lot about many subjects than to only know one subject well. If you only focus on one subject, you might miss out on other things. It's also hard to pick which subject to focus on. You might miss other opportunities if you choose just one. You should learn about many subjects before you pick one to focus on. For example, I study International Relations. My course says it's important to know about many things. I can't just learn about the Cold War without knowing what happened in World War I. Knowing a lot helps you look at events in many ways. With my knowledge, I can understand why countries do certain things. If you only know about one subject, you'll miss out on a lot of other things. This can be risky. It's hard to have an opinion on something you know nothing about. We can see this in everyday life. For example, you might be a great cook, but it's useless if you can't clean up after. These skills work together. This is a simple example, but it shows why knowing a lot is important. In the end, knowing a lot about different subjects lets people see things from many angles. Even when reading the news, they can connect it to other things. It's also hard to pick the most important subject to learn about. You should learn about many things before you focus on one. But once you focus on one, you can't go back and learn about everything else."}

Every person who studies the economy knows that selling the product is more important than how good it is. It's a fact that companies spend a lot of money on ads. There are many studies that look at ads and how they work. For instance, they found out that ads take a few months to start working. This is why we see ads for a movie that won't be out for another three months. It's important to remember that we don't just buy the thing; we buy what we think the thing is about. Sometimes we have tried different things and know which one is best, so we can pick the best one. But often, we have to choose from many options and we don't know which is best. If we remember an ad that talked about the good points of one thing, we might pick it, even if it's not as good as the others. A while back, a kid wanted a pirate ship toy for Christmas. When he got it, he cried because he was looking for the sea that the ship sailed on in the ad. He had never seen the sea and really wanted it with the toy. This story shows how ads can affect us. Many times, we buy not just the thing itself. We buy what it looks like or what it stands for. For example, some clothing brands show that you are part of a certain group. To sum up, ads play a big role in selling things. This doesn't always match up with how valuable the things really are."}

I think that 'Successful people try new things and take risks instead of just doing what they know well.' Trying new things is important for success. The New Times says that everything is changing fast. Look at technology. We have everything from easy calculators to advanced satellites in space. New technology lets us learn quicker and better. Without new things, life would be boring. Thomas Alva Edison, a famous inventor, made more than fifty things and gave us light. He made a big difference in the world. Trying new things makes our lives better. For example, with computers, you can do many things online. You can shop, bank, study, and take the TOEFL test on the internet. This is because creative people make new things. Not just in technology, but in health care too, we have made our lives better. New ideas and tools have helped cure diseases that used to kill many people. In the end, I think that trying new things and taking risks can give us a better life. Now is the time to act."}
{"file_id": "1041264.txt", "output_essay": "Traveling is a great way for families or individuals to spend good time, relax, or enjoy themselves. It's important for travelers to plan their trips well to have the most fun. A well-planned trip often means traveling with a group and a tour guide.\n\nGoing on a trip with a tour guide has many good points. First, a tour guide knows a lot about travel. He knows the best places to see and how long to stay at each one. He can plan the day well. If you were alone, you might take hours to decide where to go next. Second, a tour guide can get tickets before you get to a place. This means you can skip waiting in lines. For example, at the Eiffel Tower in Paris, you could wait 2 hours for a ticket in the busy season. But a tour guide would have your ticket ready. You wouldn't have to wait in a long line. Third, a tour guide sets up all the travel ahead of time. He might book buses and tell them when and where to go. If you were alone, you would spend a lot of time getting from one place to another.\n\nTraveling with a group also lets you meet people. Often, these people are from your own country. You can talk with them about the places you see and make new friends.\n\nSome might say that a tour guide stops them from making their own choices. They think they can't do what they want in a country. But you can solve this by adding a day or two to your trip. Or you can skip some group tours that don't interest you.\n\nIn conclusion, I really think traveling with a group and a tour guide is the best way. The good things about it are more important than the bad things. I believe most people would have more fun this way."}
{"file_id": "1052334.txt", "output_essay": "I believe the key to inventing is being curious. I fully agree with this idea. People who succeed try new things and risk rather than just sticking to what they know. There are many traits that lead to success. Being persistent and smart are just two of them.\n\nFirst, if someone is persistent, they keep going and don't take 'no' for an answer. They study hard to reach their goal. They want to know more about what they are aiming for. They do their best to meet their goal. They are eager to learn and create new things. Take Einstein, for example. He was a great thinker and creator. We still use his ideas in school today. I think he used his drive, smarts, and persistence to become someone the world will always remember.\n\nSecond, being smart is key to success. A smart person can figure out problems quickly and tries hard to solve them. If people aren't curious about making new things, we wouldn't have any discoveries. For instance, without curiosity, technology wouldn't get better, and we couldn't study serious illnesses like cancer. All these things help humans.\n\nIn conclusion, you can't achieve anything without taking risks. The world is changing fast. People need to keep learning to keep up with these changes. They shouldn't be scared of new things or technology. They should ask themselves, 'what can I do to get better?' instead of just doing what they already know. They should do this not just for themselves but for everyone around the world."}
{"file_id": "1012615.txt", "output_essay": "The best way to travel is different for everyone. It depends on what you like and what you need. But when you travel with a group and a tour guide, you might miss out on the best parts of the places you visit. A tour guide usually takes you to popular spots. You can get photos of yourself at famous places. But you could also make a fake photo with you in it at home. What makes travel special is meeting new people and learning about their culture. People make a place unique. This could be through their buildings or their food. If you talk to local people, you can discover amazing things. But there's not enough time to talk about all of them. Let's look at Germany, and more specifically, Baden-Württemberg. This region has the famous Cinderella Castle that Disney uses as a logo. Many people visit it. But when you go there, it's so crowded. You can't really enjoy it. And you miss out on seeing other, even nicer castles without the crowds. Food is another reason to travel on your own. You can find a McDonald's anywhere. With a tour guide, you might end up at an expensive restaurant that doesn't serve local food. Or you might just eat fast food because there's no time. But if you explore on your own, you can eat with locals. Maybe you'll even get to eat at someone's grandma's house. That's the best. There are many reasons to travel by yourself instead of with a tour group. But you'll only know what's best for you after you try it. If I had to choose, I would always go on my own trip and make my own plans."}

People are seen as successful when they reach a goal that others, and society, think is good. Take the stock market as an example. A famous investor, Warren Buffett, got rich by putting money into ideas that others were afraid to. He became one of the wealthiest people in the world. He said, 'Taking the usual path won't get you anywhere.' I've watched my dad make money by putting it into a special kind of fund. This fund buys stocks that go against what the market is doing. So, it does pay off to explore new areas. Big discoveries like electricity and antibiotics happened because people like Faraday and Fleming were brave enough to risk their lives. So, I think that people who are brave get to enjoy their success more. Famous explorers found success because they trusted their gut and kept sailing to find new places. The biggest find was the Americas by European explorers. Now, America is one of the strongest countries in the world. When you're just one of many, you're not noticed; you need to be different and make your own place. There are many stories where someone became successful by taking chances. So, I believe that being willing to take risks, with some hard work and commitment, will lead to success."}
{"file_id": "116085.txt", "output_essay": "Today, we live in a time full of competition. To keep up, people have come up with different ways to get ahead. One way is advertising to make their products more popular. I don't fully agree with the idea that 'most ads make products look much better than they really are.' These days, we often see famous people like TV and movie stars, and athletes, in ads on TV or in newspapers. People might be tricked by these ads and buy something that isn't worth a lot of money if they don't check it carefully. I admit that sometimes ads might lie to beat other brands. People trust these famous faces too much and buy the products. That's why I don't completely disagree with the statement. But I think people should watch ads carefully. Before buying, they should look at the product closely and see if the ad's claims are true. Customers should remember that some companies might say their product is better than it is to sell more. In India, there's a group called 'ISO' that checks products to make sure they're good. They inspect them closely before allowing them to be sold. With groups like 'ISO,' it's hard for a company to lie in their ads. Ads help us tell the difference between good and bad things about a product. They let us compare it to other similar products. Ads also tell us about new and better products. In the end, considering the benefits of ads, we can't say that all products are shown as better than they are. As customers, it's our job to check if products are as good as the ads say."}

They compare how they acted in the past to how young people act now. But I don't think there's any proof that young people today act differently from past generations. People often remember the past in a way that's not correct. They think about big protests in the 60s and 70s about wars and political tensions. This makes them believe that young people back then cared more. \n\nFrom what I've seen, young people do help their communities. I volunteer at a local group, and most of the volunteers are my age or younger. Young people also help in other ways that might not be as easy to see. For example, I have friends who are very active in local politics. \n\nIn the end, young people are just as involved in their communities as they were before.

At first, ads were to tell people about products. They said what the product was and how to use it. Now, ads just show the product. They don't tell the truth about what it can do. They compare it to other products and trick people into thinking it's better than it is. Ads use women to sell face creams. They look plain at first. Then, after using the cream, they look pretty. But it's not real. It's just camera tricks and makeup. The same goes for toothpaste. Brands like Pepsodent, Colgate, and Closeup all have the same stuff in them. But their ads make each one seem special. They don't say the other brands are the same. How can the same toothpaste be different just because of the brand? Ads today just make products look better than they are. Take soap, for example. The company JOCIL makes it. Then, big brands put their labels on it and talk about how great it is. They don't really know. Ads also use famous people. If you like the celebrity, you might buy the product. If not, you won't. This makes the product seem more valuable than it is. People trust celebrities and buy what they sell. So, I think ads today just make products look better than they are. They add features that aren't really there.

Some think young people have more fun than older people, but not everyone agrees. I believe that young people do have more fun than older people. Older people might have more money and experiences, but they can't become young again. For young people, the world is new and exciting. They have a lot of time to try new things and enjoy life more than older people do.\n\nFirst, young people have a lot of time and excitement to learn new things and keep up with what's happening around them. This helps them stay trendy and have more fun. A survey by China Daily showed that not many people over 50 use computers for work or to talk to others. Using computers is a cheaper and more fun way to do things. So, young people can have more fun in life. Second, I believe young people have more time and energy to enjoy themselves. They are young and strong and can do many exciting things that older people can't. This shows that young people can have more fun. I am a young girl, and I feel I can do whatever I want. I plan to travel the world one day. I think not many older people can dream of this. So, I say young people have more fun than older people.\n\nAlso, young people are usually healthier than older people. There's an old Chinese saying, 'Health is the most important for anything you want to do.'

Some might agree, but I don't because we have made useful and advanced cars, like hybrid cars that don't pollute the air much. And it's hard to make something completely new, like flying cars, in just twenty years. We have made advanced cars. This shows that car makers can do a lot. So, we will have even better cars to drive. Everyone knows that cars can pollute the air. But cars are a very good way to get around. For instance, we can now buy and use hybrid cars. They don't pollute the air too much. I know they are costly. But car companies will lower the prices soon. The government is giving them money to help. In twenty years, there will be more cars, and they will likely be hybrids. Maybe we won't even have to pay for gas or insurance then. Making new things, like flying cars, is tough. We often see them in movies. But that's just fiction. Twenty years is not enough time to make such big changes. When I was seven, I dreamed of going to the Moon. I thought it would be possible in twenty years. Now, we can go to the Moon, and a woman from America just did. But it costs a lot. So, maybe one day we'll have fewer cars, but not in twenty years.

But on the other side, really understanding ideas is what lets students make a difference. Knowing facts is a starting point. It helps when making new things, studying, or creating programs for the government or everyone. Let me show you what I mean by talking about my dad's work. He studies how brain cells connect at a university in Munich. He and his students looked at everything known about brain cells. This was the start of their study and tests. Once they knew how messages move from one cell to another, they tried to figure out how to stop this. They used poisons like atropine to block messages between certain brain cells. This story shows how knowing facts and exploring ideas work together. Another example is the political system. A student can learn all the facts about how Germany's government started after World War II with help from other countries. But this isn't needed when thinking of new ways for people to take part in politics. Facts are a key starting point. But to be original and think of new ideas, one must really grasp the main point of an idea. In the end, I suggest students learn facts. They should use them to understand big ideas easily."}

If a young person doesn't enjoy life, they probably won't enjoy it when they're older because they haven't learned to enjoy it. When comparing people at the same time, you can't say who enjoys life more. There are too many things that affect this, and age isn't a big one. Health, money, and where you live are more important. But I think how you see things is the most important. This can change how you feel more than anything else. Most people know this, but not many use it to their advantage. For example, someone who is healthy, rich, and has many friends might still be unhappy because they think they're old. On the other hand, a young person who is poor, sick, and alone could be happy and not worry about why. Being young or old doesn't tell you if someone enjoys life. I believe my life is better now that I'm older. I won't worry about my age. Instead, I'll work on myself and my outlook. I want to enjoy what's important - my two sons and my wife.

In this essay, I want to talk about the good and bad things that can happen when we travel without the right guidance.\n\nFirst, if we travel with a group and a tour guide, we can feel safer and more excited to see new things and places. This is because a tour guide knows a lot and has a lot of experience. Also, the guide can take us to the best and most interesting spots. This is key because it can save us money and time. You get right to the good stuff. It's great.\n\nBut, traveling with a tour guide can also make us feel uneasy about some things. For example, you can't go to some places whenever you want. This is because the tour guide usually has a set plan and schedule. Plus, you can't enjoy quiet spots and activities on your own because you often have to do things with everyone else, which can be dull.\n\nIn my opinion, it's very important to travel with someone, but it's even better in a group because you can share cultures and make friends. You can join in on lots of activities easily. And if you have a tour guide, it's a great way to see many places without spending too much time or money.

Second, in Turkey, even though the old culture of helping each other is not as strong as it was 15-20 years ago, there are now more charity groups and more people joining them. I have seen that 3 out of 5 people who join these groups are between 18-30 years old. They help people with disabilities, run support groups for troubled kids and women, and teach children from poor families.

For example, in building work, people have built big buildings, dams, towers, and bridges. This was risky in the past. But because they have done well in their work, they keep trying bigger and riskier projects. They know about their work and the problems they might face, so they plan well to solve them. This is not just true for building work. Scientists also always try to create new things. If they were afraid to take risks, we wouldn't have many of the comforts and medicines we have today. These medicines help us fight serious illnesses. Trying new things brings new items into our lives. These items become part of what we use every day.

I've seen this myself many times. Take the first ads for the iPod from Apple. They made people think the iPod was more than just a nice-looking music player. It seemed like the easiest one to use. I bought an iPod early on, but soon I felt let down. The ads didn't say, for example, that you could only change the music with one special program and just on one computer. I still have the iPod, but now I will learn more about a product's features before I buy it.\n\nAlso, many products don't match what their ads show. A close friend of mine works in the marketing department of a company that makes ads for other companies. When we meet for a drink and chat about work, it's always fun. He tells me about new clients and their products. Sometimes, he and his team can't find anything good about a product they have to advertise. But they still have to make it look so good that people want to buy it.\n\nAs I've explained, ads don't always tell the truth about a product. They often make it look better than it is.

We see ads on the street (like at bus stops), online (ads pop up when we browse), in movies (they often show products without us knowing), and more. But TV is the main place companies show off their products. \n\nMost people have a TV at home, or they can watch it nearby or at school. Who doesn't watch TV? If someone says they don't, others might think they're strange. Ads on TV are very important for TV channels: companies pay a lot of money to show their products after a show. \n\nAnd what about the products on TV? We see all kinds of things advertised: cars, perfumes, movies, drinks, food, and more. But do they show these products honestly? I don't think so. Ad experts make ads to grab your attention, not to tell you about the product itself. They talk about what you'll feel or think if you buy or use it. Have you seen a 'high quality' perfume ad? They won't tell you how it's made. Instead, they say it will make you feel fresh, make everyone love you, make you the most attractive person, or compare it to the best things in life! We don't see that this isn't true until we buy the product. By then, it's too late. So, we end up agreeing with the statement that ads often make products look much better than they really are."}
{"file_id": "1024659.txt", "output_essay": "I disagree with the idea that ads make products look better than they really are. I think this because the person who makes the product knows how it's made and how it works. They care about the product's quality and how to show it to people the right way. The best tool they have to do this is advertising. They find good ways to advertise so that people learn about the product's value. Without ads, it takes a long time for a product to become known in the market. Ads don't force people to believe them. But they do tell people what the product does and how it works. People buy products based on what they need, not just the ads. Before an ad is made, the product must pass many tests. Only then is it sold in the market. Ads are based on what the product can do. Not every maker uses the same way to advertise. They choose how to advertise based on the product's cost and their own style. Some use TV or the internet, others use salespeople or flyers. There are many ways to advertise, depending on what the maker likes and can afford. Ads are made to be so interesting that people think about buying the product. Some makers use famous people in their ads to attract customers. They pay these celebrities a lot of money. Since ads are the main way to let people know, they are very important. For example, even governments use ads to tell people about their programs. In my area, a famous person helps advertise the government's polio campaign. This helps people learn about it quickly and clearly. So, governments also depend on ads. This shows how important they are. In conclusion, ads are a key tool.

First, I think that governments in many places are starting to limit how many cars people can use. This is because cars cause big problems. For example, cars make carbon monoxide when they use gas. This gas is bad for people, animals, and plants. Cars also make carbon dioxide, which causes the greenhouse effect. Second, governments are worried about running out of things like oil. We need oil to make cars go and to build them. For instance, making cars needs a lot of heat, which comes from oil. Also, cars have parts made of plastic, and we make plastic from oil. Besides, news and reports from the United Nations say that countries are not just limiting cars. They are also looking for new ways to get around that don't have the same problems as cars. For example, in Japan, where I am from, the government is putting money into making a new kind of train called the 'linear motor car.' It uses magnets to move, so it doesn't make any bad gases. Experts think this train will be more common in 15 years. So, I agree that we will see fewer cars in the future for these reasons."}

They also take part in many social events, like going to movies, traveling, and similar activities. However, most young people don't have a clear goal in life. They don't know what's really important and waste time watching TV or playing computer games. They use their precious time on things that don't matter, which is sad for them.\n\nIn fact, we see that young people today don't spend enough time helping their communities. With modern life, parents move to cities with their kids to find work. When parents are at work, their kids are either left alone or in daycare. These kids don't see adults who give time to their communities, so all they learn is to enjoy life. Parents are always examples for their kids. This is why young people today don't help in their communities enough. Also, TV and other media often send the wrong ideas to young people. They focus on having fun. This is another reason for the problem.\n\nTo sum up, young people need more teaching to learn to give time to their communities. Parents need to learn to be good examples. TV and media should make better shows to teach young people about helping others. With these steps, we can hope to see young people giving more time to their communities. Then, we will have a better world than before."}

Take companies that make gadgets like gaming consoles and iPods. They risk a lot each year to add new features and ideas to their products. Sometimes, people don't like these changes, and the hard work is wasted. But often, it works out well. Most electronic parts do well because they keep bringing new things to people. Look at the latest phones. They have cameras, music players, internet access, and more. Cameras are another good example. They keep getting better. Now, we have digital cameras that take great photos. They have settings for different places, like indoors. They can also record voices and videos. All this shows how trying new and different things can lead to success. I think the more they experiment with new ideas, the more successful they will be. This is true now and should be in the future too."}

This will help us figure out which is better.\n\nThe main differences are in nightlife, responsibilities, and money.\n\nFirst, let's talk about nightlife. Some young people, from 15 to 20, don't even know what nightlife is. But if you are an adult, you can go to a night club without any rules. You also don't have to tell anyone where you are or what you're doing because you're not a child anymore.\n\nNext, let's look at responsibility. Young people have to go to school, which is a big responsibility. But when you're older, you can do what you want and only think about yourself.\n\nMoney is the last big difference. Young people have their parents to worry about money. But they can't always get what they want because it's not their money. If they want to buy something and their parents say no, they can't buy it.\n\nIn the end, life for older people was, is, and will always be better. If you are young, you can have fun but not as much as you might like. Or you can wait until you grow up and become older."}

They've been through a lot, so they're grateful to be alive and know how valuable life is. They may seem busy working, but they understand life. They find joy by thinking deeply about it.\n\nYoung people think having fun is very important. They surf in summer and snowboard in winter. They say, 'I'm having fun.' Sure, they have fun, but just for the sake of fun. They don't see it as something special.\n\nTo truly enjoy life, you need responsibility and a goal. Without these, people don't see the value of their lives. A young person who always 'has fun' might end up taking their own life. Even if he had fun, he lacked a goal.\n\nOld people have lots of experience. They've taken care of their families and know how great life can be. Who enjoys life more?

If we think of the Earth as a sick person, it is clear that it is not well. People will soon see this and will want to fix it. They will start to act better and quickly work to stop more damage. This means they will use cars less. For example, many people are already worried about global warming and want to help. \n\nThe environment will affect how we live and may change how much money people have. If this happens, owning a car will be too expensive for many people. This will lead to less car use. Other ways to get around, like buses and trains, will become more important.

I believe this is true because ads are made to help companies make more money. Also, ads don't last long on TV or online. First, ads are made to get customers interested. There are many companies and products out there. So, companies try to get people to buy what they are selling. Ads are a good way to sell more. For example, we see lots of ads every day. To get our attention, ads show products as being better than they are. My mom is a good example. She gets the flu a lot and buys medicine she sees in ads. But she can't find one that works. This is because the ads make each product look perfect, but they don't help her flu. So, she keeps having to buy different medicines. This shows that ads often trick people about what products can do, to make more money. Moreover, ads are very short. Companies have to make a strong impression quickly.

People now want to buy things that famous people say are good. They don't go to stores as much as they used to. Now, they shop online from home. If they like an ad, they might buy the thing on the internet. People used to buy things because they needed them or because they were good. Now, they buy things just because they look good in ads. In the past, there weren't many ads. People knew what they were buying. But now, they buy things just because a celebrity they like is in the ad. Also, people want to buy things that their neighbors have. They want to have better things than their neighbors, even if they don't need them. This causes problems. Ads today make things look more special than they are. It's not smart to buy something just because you saw it in an ad. Ads often overstate how good things are. When people get the thing they bought, they might see they made a mistake by trusting the ad. Next time, they might think more carefully before they buy.

But successful people are different. They take risks to succeed. We shouldn't just copy and repeat the same old things. Sometimes, we need to change. We should make new things for better lives. Second, we all know the saying 'life is a venture.' It's a famous saying. Yet, few people find it to be true because they are scared of making mistakes when trying new things. But I think avoiding risks to prevent failure is the worst thing you can do. Don't worry if you fail when you try something new. It will teach you something. This experience is so valuable that you wouldn't trade it for anything. In conclusion, the world is full of chances. Some people see and grab these chances, but others don't and miss out. You must take these chances in your life. Today, being creative is very important. Society needs creative people. So we should be brave and keep trying new things."}

I read about a drink ad with a famous Korean star. After the ad, the drink's sales went up a lot. Why did this happen? First, ads try to make the product look good to get customers. No one says bad things about their product on TV. So, people start to think the product is better because of how it looks in the ad. For example, if Jessica Alba is in an ad, people think, 'If I use this, I'll be pretty and healthy like her.' Ads also make people trust the product without thinking. We tend to trust what we know. Ads make products well-known. We don't trust what we don't know. So, ads use this to make us feel like we trust the product, even if it's not true. For instance, would you use Pantene or a shampoo you've never heard of? Most would pick Pantene because they know it. Ads are like magic. They draw people in. They use nice images and famous people to make us want to buy. But we should remember that 'A picture means more than a thousand words.' We should try things ourselves, not just see them on TV."}

Because of this, people focus on showing off these things rather than what's inside. Second, TV, radio, and newspapers have grown fast. They reach people everywhere.

Before applying, students should think about some things. First, people say that if you know a lot about one area, it's easier to get a job in that field after college. But, knowing a little about many topics lets you apply for more jobs. It's easier to get hired if you're not specialized. Once you're in the job, you need to adjust to what the company wants, whether you're specialized or not. Second, some say that it takes less time to learn just one subject than to learn the basics of many. This might be a bit true, but really, no matter how you study, it takes the same time to get a degree. I think it's better to learn about many subjects because you have more job options later, and it takes the same amount of time. In summary, students need to know what it means for their future jobs if they get a degree in one subject. They should also not believe that learning about many subjects takes more time than getting a degree in one area."}

The two main reasons are the harm cars do to the environment and the rising cost of oil. Cars give off harmful smoke that makes the air dirty in big cities. Because of this, many governments and city leaders are limiting how many cars can drive in city centers. Over time, people will start to prefer public transport over driving because it will be too hard to drive in a big city. I could mention a study from my university that shows people don't want to drive as much in big cities. Another reason is that owning a car is getting more expensive. Oil prices go up a lot when there is even a small threat of less oil being made. Ordinary people already struggle with money, and this will just add to their troubles. Also, governments are making it more costly to own certain cars by adding taxes. For example, Italy might soon tax big cars. With these points in mind, it's easy to see why I believe there will be fewer cars in the future."}

Right now, there are 6.0 billion people, and this number could go up to 6.5 billion in twenty years or even less. So, the number of cars being used will probably go up too.\n\nSecond, the way we think about young people and driving has changed. In the past, driving was mostly for men, not women. But today, many women drive because people's views have become more open. Fifty years ago, this was different. Also, the age when you can start driving varies from place to place. In some places, 16-year-olds can get their driving license. As views keep changing, more countries might let young people drive sooner.\n\nBecause of these points, I don't think there will be fewer cars in the future.

Just knowing a lot about one thing isn't enough for the problems workers and researchers face today. To be clear: You need deep knowledge in one subject and also some understanding of other subjects and general things. Our society is very complex and changes quickly. No one can know everything about all subjects. So, it's important to know a lot about one subject. This helps you understand it well and keep up with new things in that field. If you only know a little about many subjects, you won't understand them well enough to solve problems. Also, everything in society and school changes too fast.

I wondered if this kind of study was really helping me learn what I needed for life. I didn't like some subjects, like engineering, cooking, or music. They were not needed for my future. Many other students felt the same way. It is also very hard to be good at so many subjects. Some people say that to do well in society, we need to be good at many things. For example, in companies, workers need to be good at math and talking to people. They need different skills. But if you try to be good at too many things, it might not help your job. You only need to be really good at one thing for your work. The main reason not to study too many subjects is that it stops you from truly learning anything.

The government will make it hard for people to have cars by making them pay a lot of money for things like registration, insurance, road taxes, and yearly fees. This will make owning a car too expensive for many. As oil gets scarce, car makers are turning to new kinds of cars like electric and hybrid ones. Electric cars can't go very far without charging, which takes time and is a big problem. Hybrid cars use different fuels and are expensive, but people say they are the cars of the future. We might only see these cars on the road later on. More people mean more cars, which leads to more harmful gases like CO2 and lead in the air. This is bad for the planet and our health.

Others think that sticking to what they know best will help them succeed. I believe that successful people must take chances and not just stick to what they are good at.\n\nI will show why I agree with this idea by talking about engineering. Taking chances can lead you to parts of your job you didn't even know were there. This is because you spend all your time on what you already know. For instance, creating new tech or making current tech better. If you don't take the chance to try new things, this new tech might never come to be. This is because you, as an engineer, keep doing the same work again and again.\n\nAnother good thing about taking chances is that if you fail, you can go back to your old job. Let's think about making a new product. If engineers only make deodorants in roll-on bottles and never try to find a new way to use the product, they might never make spray deodorants. But let's say they make a spray and find out it's bad for the ozone layer because of the gases it releases. They can go back to the roll-on and help the environment. They took a chance with the new spray, but it caused problems, so they can return to the old way and fix the issue.\n\nThese two main points show why people need to take chances at work. But this also applies to other parts of life, like marriage. Getting married is a big risk. You sign a contract that's supposed to last forever, not knowing what will happen in your life. But as I said before, you can end the marriage if things don't work out. You can get divorced and be single again. You took a chance for a good marriage, but if it doesn't work, you can start over."}

For example, 70 percent of people who travel with a guide are in a good mood. When I travel with my parents, we always have a guide. The guide knows a lot and plans our days.

I've noticed in the past ten years that there seem to be fewer cars, even if this isn't a good thing. I believe there will be fewer cars in twenty years for a few reasons. First, cities are growing. I read last week that more people live in cities now. This means they need to get around in the city. As cities grow, more people will need cars unless there are other ways to travel provided by the government. Second, cities are too full, and people with less money have to live outside the city. They will need a car to come into the city for work. Also, some people don't like city life. They might choose to live outside the city but still drive to the city for work. I also think it depends on what the government or local groups do. There are examples where local groups have found ways to reduce the number of cars in the city. Planning a city well can really help. If a city is designed smartly, with good roads and other ways to travel, getting around is much easier. The government should also make people in the city more aware of this issue. Many people don't think it's a problem because they like using their own cars.

The main reason is that young people have more energy. We see this in how they seek fun. For example, young people care a lot about movies, music, and famous stars. They spend a lot of time talking about and watching these things. They can do this because they are strong and healthy. You rarely find older people in a dance club. In short, young people's energy makes them more likely to have fun. Another important reason is that young people are more creative. This is especially true for teenagers. Studies show that young people's brains are still growing, so they can learn new things easily. Take the Internet, for example. Most of its users are young. It's no surprise that some people compare young people to the morning sun. Their creativity helps them enjoy life the most.

Let's talk about the first reason. It means 'You only get experience one day at a time.' Money is important when you're young. You have little money and often can't stick to your budget. This is because of ads, friends pushing you, and just being immature. Money problems can make being young tough. This can cause more problems in everything else.

This confidence is important for a person to grow.\n\nKnowing a lot about different subjects helps a person keep up with new technology. This needs creative thinking, being smart, having talent, and knowing a lot of information. This helps a business do well in the future.\n\nFor example, a growing business needs good and smart people to make it famous. The business looks for someone who can improve everything it does. A business hires someone who knows a lot about marketing and business.\n\nThe business needs someone who works hard and cares a lot. This person must also be smart enough to handle problems and understand what the business needs. They must use their wide knowledge to find the right answers. This helps all parts of the business work well.\n\nIf a business is doing badly, it must figure out why. It needs to know which part needs to get better and find a quick solution.\n\nAs society changes and wants new things, knowing a lot about different school subjects helps a person think of new ideas and be practical. It is better to focus on learning about many subjects than just one. Knowledge is split into different subjects. To really understand everything, it is important to be good at all subjects."}
{"file_id": "1054940.txt", "output_essay": "Should we learn or should we understand? People have asked this for a long time. Everyone wonders if learning or understanding is better. But can we understand if we don't learn first? I agree with the idea that learning by heart isn't always good. I think understanding things and thinking critically is more important. But both matter a lot. Still, I believe we need to learn to understand our lives and society. For example, to get politics or to vote well, we need to know what Republicans and Democrats stand for. We must learn to understand. But, we must not learn without understanding. That's silly. Like knowing how to write words but not how to make sentences makes no sense. Even if learning by heart is dull, we should be able to do it. The more we learn about a topic, the more we can talk and understand it. For instance, learning about the American parliament helps us understand G. Bush's role better. So, I think we shouldn't just choose to understand or to learn. We need both. They work together. Even if no one likes to learn by heart, we should to understand our lives and society better."}
{"file_id": "1040518.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with the statement. I believe that young people have more fun than older people for many reasons. Older people have more problems to think about that young people don't. For example, an older person has to worry about their job and family. A person with a family must think about their kids. But the kids don't have to worry because their parents do that for them.\n\nI am 23 years old, and I see the difference between being 10 years old and now. At present, I have to worry about many things I didn't when I was 10. Now, I live by myself and I have to do everything on my own. For instance, I have to cook because no one else will. I also have to buy my own food and clean my clothes.\n\nBut when I was a kid, I thought about playing with my friends. I loved to play soccer, and I played it with my friend for hours every day. We also went to the pool and stayed there all afternoon. At the pool, I played volleyball with my friends, and we had a great time.\n\nNow, I can't do what I did as a kid because I have to work, and I don't have time to play soccer or go to the pool.\n\nIn conclusion, I agree with the statement because I had more fun when I was young. I think being young is the best time of life, and I'm sure many others feel the same."}

Here, it's true that in cities, we might see fewer cars. This is because we have good trains, subways, and buses. People can get around without a car. I also think that areas outside of cities might get better at offering ways to travel. But, this idea doesn't look at the whole world. Second, we should think about all countries. Many places want to grow and get better. In these places, I believe more cars will be used. They need cars to move products and help their businesses grow. This is very important for them. So, if we look at the whole world, I don't agree that we'll have fewer cars in the future."}

I want to share how I feel about this in our world today. Ads often annoy and confuse me. They are everywhere - on TV, in the newspaper, and even in the park when I run. We see so many ads that we start to ignore them. So, companies have to make their ads really stand out to get our attention. They say their products are the best to get noticed. There are so many products and so much competition. With the internet, we see even more ads, making it harder for companies. A product has to be very special in its ad to make people want to buy it. But often, the product isn't as great as the ad said. I've been let down by things I've bought, like the new iPhone. It wasn't as good as it seemed. But that's just my opinion. Other people might like it. In the end, what we think about a product is personal and can be very different."}

I don't think this is always true, and we should look at each situation on its own. But I do agree for a few reasons. The world is now more competitive than before. Also, most families are just parents and kids, which doesn't help young people learn to care about their community. First, it's harder for young people to reach their goals, have a good career, and get a good job to keep their family safe. This means they often don't have time to help others in their community. Second, the problem is with how families are set up. When you only live with a few people, you don't learn to care about others outside your home. If you grow up with lots of family members, like brothers, sisters, and grandparents, you might care more about other people's problems. In the end, I must agree that young people don't help their communities enough for the reasons I've mentioned. I say 'must' because it's not something good, and it makes young people look bad. Sadly, I think it's true."}
{"file_id": "1052028.txt", "output_essay": "It is true that more people are using buses and trains, which could mean fewer cars are needed. But I think there will be more cars on the road, not fewer. First, people want their own car. In a family, the dad needs a car for work. The mom needs one too, for work or to take the kids to school and go shopping. When kids grow up and can drive, they want their own car for college. So, everyone ends up needing a car. This means more cars in our towns and cities. Second, people like to live a bit far from work, maybe 30 minutes to an hour away. They need cars to get to work. For example, my teacher lives an hour away from school. She drives her car to school every day, not the subway. It is true that more people ride buses and trains to save money and fuel. But this doesn't mean they don't own a car. They have one but choose to ride buses and trains to save money. If they are in a hurry, too tired to wait for the bus, or going somewhere the bus doesn't go, they will use their car. So, because people want their own car and live far from work, more cars are needed. Also, even if people ride buses and trains, they still have a car. This means there will be more cars on the road than there are now."}
{"file_id": "1016757.txt", "output_essay": "In twenty years, I think we will still see many cars being used. Cars are a big part of countries' economies and have been for almost a hundred years. Now, they are even more important because countries that are growing or have just grown are making more industries. The car industry is one of the biggest parts of this growth. So, every day, more cars are made, and soon they will be on our roads. For instance, Asian countries like the ones that make Toyota and Honda cars are doing well in this field. If we look around, we see more and more of these cars. Also, countries that already have big car industries are not stopping. They keep making new cars to stay in the race. Germany has Volkswagen and BMW, the United States has Chevrolet and General Motors, and there are many others. They all want to sell more cars by making better ones. I think that the car industry is so important that we will have even more cars in twenty years, and this problem won't be fixed. But, we are also seeing more care for the environment. More groups are starting up to save our planet. Greenpeace was the first, but now there are many. I believe this is becoming part of politics too. So, we might see a 'solution' to the harm cars do to the environment, like cars that run on electricity and don't pollute as much. In the end, I think that the need for money will keep the car industry alive, but they may find new ways to make money while also protecting the environment."}
{"file_id": "1047079.txt", "output_essay": "I agree that ads often make things look better than they are. I think this because we can't really know how good a product is just by seeing ads at home. The first reason I believe ads don't show the true quality of products is that what we see is not always right. For example, a TV ad shows a new car from XYZ company. To buy a car, we should go to the store, see it, and drive it. We can't know how the car drives on sharp turns just by watching an ad. Second, many ads use famous people like actors and athletes. I saw a bike ad on TV with a famous sports person. Many people in my town bought the bike after seeing the ad. But my friends say the bike is not good at all. It has many problems with the electronics and engine. Now, they are unhappy and complaining to the seller. So, we shouldn't just trust an ad and buy bad products. Also, do the people in ads or the famous people who say they like the products really use them? For instance, an actor in my town says he likes a certain computer brand. But my friends saw him using a different brand at a movie set. This shows he doesn't trust the product he promotes. Often, the people in ads don't use the products they show. They use things from better-known brands. So, we shouldn't just buy something because of an ad. In conclusion, I strongly think that ads today are just tricks on TV to get money from people. I believe that ads make things look much better than they are."}
{"file_id": "1051912.txt", "output_essay": "Yes, I agree with the statement. It's important to know a lot about all school subjects instead of just one. This is because in early learning, all subjects are connected. Knowing a little about each subject is good for basic learning. Just like veins in the body that carry blood to keep us healthy. If someone is hurting inside, they go to the hospital. The doctor checks them and might find something wrong. If they need surgery, the doctor must know about all body parts. If not, they can't do the surgery without knowing the right parts. For example, a general doctor can't just know about veins. In the body, every part is linked to another. So, a person who wants to be a doctor must learn about all parts of the body to be good at their job. In math, to figure out how much a project will cost, you need to add, subtract, multiply, and divide. Only then you get the final number. So, sometimes, you need to know a lot about different subjects. This also helps us talk better and get along with others. We need to know about many things to live well in society. Knowing a lot about different things is helpful. Every smart person has a lot of experience. So, knowing a lot about many school subjects is better than just focusing on one."}

This might not be true for every ad, but we see this difference between the real thing and how it's shown almost every day.\n\nFirst, we must remember that an ad's main job is to get people interested in a product. So, ad creators use tricks to make you believe their item is not just good, but the best compared to similar ones.\n\nIn this process, there can be a gap between what the item is and how it's shown to people. Even if ad creators know what the product can do, they want to make you feel like you need it. They talk a lot about the good points and ignore the bad ones. This one-sided view can make us think the product is much better than it is.\n\nThe car industry is full of examples of this. In this tough market, ad creators try to make every car look perfect for you, which isn't always true. For instance, American car ads often say their cars last a long time and are powerful. But they don't tell you that these cars use more gas than others. If you only listen to the ad, you'll think the American car is great. But if you buy it, you might find out it uses a lot of gas. You could feel like you chose poorly, that the car wasn't as good for you as the ad said. This shows that ads usually try to make a product look more valuable to sell it."}

First, young people don't get the same joys as older people. Young people live for now. They like to hang out with friends, play sports, and travel to see new places. But older people like other things. They might want to get married, have kids, buy a nice house, take family vacations, and do well at work.\n\nNext, a student's duties are very different from an older person's. Students usually don't have many duties because they often don't have kids and their parents help them with money. A student's main job is to get good grades and do well in school. But older people have more duties. If they have a family, they need to work, buy food, pay bills, and more. Having these duties might make it harder for them to have fun. But some adults like having duties because it makes them feel important.\n\nLastly, young people might not have as much fun as older people because they usually have less money. If you're a student, it's harder to go on trips or to the movies often. Students often have to work and go to school at the same time to pay for fun and school. Older people usually don't have to do this and they often make more money.\n\nIn the end, whether you're a student or an adult, you have fun in different ways because your life is different."}

I believe that knowing a lot about one thing is very important for these reasons. Today, most areas of learning are hard to understand. They need experts who can work on them and make them better. It's true that we need people who know about many things. But what they know comes from the work of experts in each field. Experts are the ones who find new things and add to what we know. They can do good research on one topic. This is why I think experts are more important. Also, it's easy for anyone to know a little about many things. Sharing information is very easy now. We can look up new information in books and on the internet. This makes the job of someone who knows about many things less important, especially today."}

They say your hair will look shiny and beautiful after using their shampoo. But when I tried it, my hair did not look like that. Ads often make things look better than they are. One big reason is that if people believe the ad, they will buy the product. This means the maker of the product makes more money. This might be stretching the truth, but it doesn't seem like a huge problem. Another problem is that the government doesn't always check on these ads. Some ads for medicine and food promise things that aren't true. This can hurt people or even kill them. But some of these products are still sold without the government stopping them. I work in ads, and I think we need to fix this. My coworkers and I try to make our clients, the product makers, tell the truth in their ads. We call this idea 'The ad, the real fact.' With help from the government and everyone else, if no one buys the bad products, they won't make money. Then, the problem might go away."}

It's true that we have many more cars now than before. Take Seoul, Korea, for example. Ten years ago, three in ten people had a car.

{"file_id": "1044456.txt", "output_essay": "There are two main kinds of ads based on time. The first kind is called modern ads. These ads started it all and they focus on what the product can do. The second kind, which came after the Cold War, is post-modern ads. These ads care more about how they look and feel. They are the most popular kind of ads today. But there's a problem with post-modern ads. They try to impress people by showing only the good things and hiding the bad. If a product isn't that useful, the ad will try to dazzle you with other things, like how it looks. This means ads today often make products look better than they are. Let's take an example from my country. Here, insurance companies spend a lot of money on ads that look good. They write things like 'No extra money for 2 months' in big letters. But they write important bad stuff in tiny letters that are hard to read. People only notice the big, attractive words. But when they actually use the company's services, they feel tricked. Another way ads make things look better is by just showing beauty, not how useful something is. This happens a lot with ads you can see. A beautiful picture can make you forget what the product is really for. Sometimes, ads even use famous people to help sell products. People end up copying these celebrities. Post-modern ads use clever tricks to make you want to buy things. They hide the bad parts and highlight the good. Or they just make the ad look amazing, even if the product isn't that useful. Often, people are fooled by these ads. We need to be careful not to be tricked. Because of all this, I believe most ads make products look way better than they actually are."}

Young people are usually healthier and have more energy. They can do many things because they are strong. As people get older, they often have less energy and their health gets worse. They might like to do something, but they can't because of their health. For example, an older person who likes music might not hear well anymore. Older people often need medicine, and medicine can make them feel tired or have other bad effects. Young people don't get tired quickly and are usually very healthy. They live life fast, unlike older people. Young people can do exciting sports, travel, go to parties, and eat and drink whatever they want. This would be hard for older people. Also, young people are more free. They don't need help from others as much. They can go places on their own. Older people worry about small things and don't try new things as much. They are more traditional and might not like what young people think is fun. Older people care more about saving money. Young people might spend money to have a good time.

For instance, in the Middle East from 1989 to 2000, the rate of students failing in senior high school was 30%. But from 2001 to 2006, it went up a lot to 70%. This shows that young people today are not doing their duties. They should be teaching these duties to the next generations. If they don't, our communities and societies might not learn enough.

It could be the music, the colors, or the setting in the ad. The goal is to make you feel good about having the product, not to show how good the product is. I think people need to know that ads can twist what a product means. They play mind games. We should know what's true and what's right when we buy things.

By looking at different communities around the world, I want to talk about my own community to show how young people are dedicated to helping out. I think 'helping communities' means volunteering to help with local issues without getting paid. Many youth groups exist for all ages and interests. They meet once a week to do things they all care about. These groups include choirs, playgroups, and sports teams. When they get together, they help the community. Some organize events like summer parties for everyone. Money made at these events goes to local places that need it. Also, many young people join groups like the fire department to save their families and neighbors if needed. They meet and train every week for this. Some choose to be social workers, either part-time or even full-time for a year. They can work in different places. They might take older people for walks, shop for them, or just spend time with them. Some work with disabled people to help them with everyday tasks. Others help young kids who have trouble at home or school. There are many ways they can help make things better. Another way to help is to get involved in local politics. This lets young people share their ideas and make the community better. For example, I recently led a campaign for young people. We told people about the bad conditions in our local kindergarten and got signatures to protest it. Soon, we made enough of an impact to get what we wanted."}

In school, students learn many facts and ideas. The school subjects include both. But the key question is, \"How much do they actually remember?\" They keep what they learn, not what they just try to remember for a short time. So, learning ideas in school is better than just remembering facts to forget them later. History lessons often don't teach us what we should really learn. Take Alexander the Great as an example. He won many battles. But his desire to win led to his end. We should see his bravery and energy. But we should also see that he was too sure of himself and wanted too much to win. Our schools should help students think better. A smart person is confident, trustworthy, and kind. The old schools in India, called 'gurukuls,' were special. Students there focused on understanding. They learned facts, but also how to use them. This is what education should do. A student who knows the basics well will do better than one who just remembers facts for a while."}

It still means a lot in small towns, but in big cities, most people live alone and don't know their neighbors. Young people often don't take part in community life. They grow up in a world that doesn't focus on community. They miss out on learning to be active in society and to give back to their community. Schools should teach this, but if parents don't care, kids probably won't either. Young people are also busy with other things, like hanging out with friends or going to parties. Working for the community isn't seen as 'cool,' and friends might tease you for it. Also, helping out usually means volunteering, which doesn't pay. Many young people prefer to work for money. These are reasons why young people don't help their communities enough. But it's very important that they do. Your community is more than just people living in the same area. It can be a strong support network for tough times. To be part of it, you need to get to know people and work with them. This means showing interest and trying to join in. Communities often have money problems and need volunteers to keep everyone's quality of life. Young people might think things will always be there without their help. But if fewer people help out, things will start to go away. Then young people might miss the bus that took kids to school or the park that turned into a mall. That's why it's so important for young people to learn to be active in their communities and to start helping out."}

They use sales, special deals for new products, selling door-to-door, and discounts. These tricks get people to buy things without knowing what they're really made of or how they work. Ads make things look good and easy to use. For example, a car ad might show the car going very fast and highlight its fancy features. But the ad doesn't say that driving fast can lead to crashes or that the tech in the car will soon be outdated. A better ad would show how the car is useful. It would talk about its comfort and how much room it has. This would help people more. Ads are everywhere now, like on banners and flyers. They give people information and make them see the product in a good light. But often, the real quality and look of a product are not like what's in the ad. This can disappoint the buyer. Some ads give us useless information or offend people's cultural or religious beliefs, or make them feel bad about their social status. For instance, an underwear ad might show a man chasing a horse, which doesn't happen in real life. I end this essay by telling people to think about what they buy, how it will affect them or others, and if it will be useful in the long run."}

But just like the saying 'All that glitters is not gold,' this can also be true for successful people. The real problem is not with the people we talk about. It's with us. We think someone is successful only if they get a lot of attention, fame, or money. We think this means they are worth something, which most of us are not. So, it's hard to say someone is successful just because they have money, fame, or people know them. For that person, it might just be a goal they wanted to reach for themselves. \n\nTake soccer as an example. Some players are much better than others. But they are only good at soccer because they practiced it for years. They might not be good at other sports. In the same way, we can't say the person who started Microsoft is very successful just because he made software for computers. I wonder if he knows much about mining or making clothes. Some people think stores like Walmart are run by successful people. I don't think so. They are just good at selling things. \n\nI would call someone successful if they made a good name and money in selling, but also did well in making things and in research. So, I think some people are still successful when they try new things."}

For instance, it's rare for both to live in the same house now. So, young people don't feel the strong community bond that used to be there. But I believe young people are still doing things to help their communities. Many teenagers volunteer at churches or help out during elections. I know some who do this, and their work is really great. Also, many teenagers work to solve environmental issues. This is good for the community because it leads to a better way of living. Lastly, many students work hard at school or college. This isn't just for their own success; they also want to make school or college better for everyone.\n\nNow, about the hard work at school or college.

As cities get bigger and more impersonal, young people don't feel as rewarded for community work as they would in a smaller town where everyone knows each other and they get more thanks for volunteering. But this is a wrong idea because helping out is valued in both big and small places; it's just not as clear to the young people. So, what are they doing with the time they used to spend on helping their communities?\n\nThey choose to do things they enjoy more. This is something we see in all parts of society and at all ages, not just with young people. It's obviously more fun to go to the movies than to help older people in the community. So, we need things that will encourage them. Parents can offer these by teaching their kids early on that it's good to help in the community sometimes. Even small tasks for the community can be more important than you might think, and all help is really valued.\n\nThe community needs to be strong to build networks and draw in young people with special places and activities for them. I believe that if young people feel connected to their community, they will want to be more active and give some of their time to help."}

When you really understand one thing, you can work in that area and do it well. Learning one subject well lets you become an expert because you spend time on what you want to learn and enjoy. For instance, if you try to learn many subjects, you would need to study forever to really know a lot. Also, focusing on what you like means you can work in a field that interests you for your whole life. If you enjoy your work, you can be the best at it. But if you work on something you don't care about, just because you must, you might not do it well. That would be a waste of time. In the end, I believe it's better to focus on what you truly care about. This way, you can do your best and not waste time on things that don't matter to you. To me, wasting time is bad because life is too short."}

But not all parts are the same in how much fun they have. Some say that young people have more fun than old people, and this is often true. \n\nYoung people have more fun because they are just starting to explore life. They find new things to see, learn, and enjoy. They can go anywhere they want and have many chances to pick their way in life. They can make new friends, go to parties, and get involved in real life. For example, they can join groups and share their thoughts on politics. They choose what they want to be, like an engineer, and go to college. Then they dream about their future. They really have fun when they fall in love and think about starting a family. So, they have a lot of things to have fun with and share with others. \n\nOld people have fun in their own ways too. They think back on their lives and the things they did. They enjoy seeing their family grow and love holding their grandchildren. They have fun after they stop working. They can do things like fishing or hunting. They might have problems, but they still find ways to have fun. \n\nIn the end, no matter if you're young or old, people have fun in different ways. But young people might have more fun because they have more ways to enjoy life that old people might not have."}
{"file_id": "1063282.txt", "output_essay": "Who has more fun, young people or older people? I believe that older people have more fun. First, older people have a lot of free time. They have worked for many years, so they don't have to work as hard as young people. They don't have to fight as much to make a living. So, they have more free time than young people. With this time, they can travel, spend holidays with family, and enjoy other activities. Think about what young people do while older people have fun. College students might be busy writing papers or studying for tests. Workers might be doing extra tasks at work. They are not very happy! Second, older people have more money than young people. This lets them live more comfortably. They have earned and saved more, so they can afford trips to far places like Paris, Rome, or even space. But young people might only go on short trips or hikes. These are fun, but not as exciting as trips to other countries. Third, older people handle their lives better because they have more experience. They know what matters most to them, like enjoying life and spending time with family. But many young people don't know what's important. They try hard to earn money and get ahead at work. They forget the joy of being with family. In the end, I think older people have more fun. They have more time, more money, and they know how to live better."}

Others think ads show products as they really are. I believe ads make products look better to earn more money, get more customers, and grow the business.\n\nOne reason is to earn lots of money. Many owners don't care about others. They just want to sell things at high prices, even if the real price is lower. Take my grandfather. He wanted to buy a computer and saw a TV ad saying it was worth three thousand dollars. He didn't know much about computers, so he bought it. When he told my father, my father got mad. He said the computer was only worth one thousand dollars.\n\nAnother reason is to get people interested in their product. They want to get as many people as possible. For instance, my mother bought a vacuum she saw on TV. She thought it was the best. But when it arrived and she used it, it broke in four days.\n\nLastly, ads make products look better because owners want to grow their business. This way, they can sell more and make more money. They might start with one product, but with the money they earn, they can make more things. So, they grow their business.\n\nIn conclusion, I think many ads make products look much better than they are because the owners want to make more money, get more customers, and grow their business. I feel these people should care more about their customers and make ads that show the product as it is, not how they want us to see it."}
{"file_id": "1048280.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with the statement, but I want to add that today, many young people help in their communities, even if they are not on any list. I believe that young people don't help their communities enough because our society has changed a lot over the last hundred years. We have become more distant and don't have strong community ties. In the past thirty years, many communities have turned into big cities because of globalization. This change has made it harder for communities to stay close. It's not surprising that young people don't help much. Another reason is that cities and communities don't give young people chances to help. In Germany, where I live, the government shut down many places where young people could help, like organizing parties or Easter events. Many young people do help, but they do it through private groups or on their own, and most people don't see it. I think it's not just the young people's fault that they don't help more. They can't change what has happened in the past years or the effects of globalization. They also can't change government decisions because many are too young to vote. Still, I believe young people should do what they can to support their communities. I try to do my part. I live in a village with a big, nice natural area. But this area is split between two states, and neither state wants to take care of it. So, the young people in the horse riding club, including me, clean it twice a year. Sadly, the state governments don't notice our work."}

They use famous people to help sell them. But what happens when someone buys the product?\n\nThe buyer feels tricked and gets mad at the company. For instance, one company said they made a bike that could go 120 km on one liter of petrol. This was to beat other companies. They didn't tell the truth about the bike's mileage. Many people bought the bike and found out it didn't go as far as promised. They asked the company about it, but the company didn't help them well. The buyers went to court and got their money back.\n\nThis story shows what can happen. The company had to give money back and got a bad name. Now, no one wants to buy from them. The company thought ads were everything. They thought if people saw the ads, they would believe the product was good. But what we see isn't always true. We shouldn't trust everything we see.\n\nCompanies need to be honest. They should only advertise what the product really does.

I'm from Italy and grew up with the Italian school system. It teaches many subjects. For example, I learned Latin and ancient Greek in school. In university, I took twenty-five tests on different parts of economics. I believe knowing a lot about many subjects is important. In today's work, you need to adapt to changes. This is different from the early 1900s when Ford talked about doing just one job. But sometimes, like for engineers or doctors, you need to know a lot about one area. As for me, I want to be a manager. A manager has to solve many different problems. You need to think of new ways to fix things. Let's say a product isn't selling well. You can either stop selling it or come up with a better way to market it. In the end, I think you should get an education that fits your interests and the job you want in the future."}

But we shouldn't forget that ads have good points too.\n\nFirst, I accept that ads often overstate how good products are. This is why companies love to make ads. The ads grab our attention by showing how great the products are. Take shampoo ads on TV, for example. Models or celebrities show off their very shiny and smooth hair, saying it's all thanks to the shampoo. It looks very tempting. But when we buy and use it, it's not as great as the ad said. In this way, the ads trick us.\n\nStill, ads are important in our lives. They give us information and advice. Think about when you're shopping for drinks at the store. There are so many brands to choose from. If we don't know anything about them, choosing can take forever. But if we've seen some ads, we know a few brands and can pick from them instead. Also, ads are a big business. They create lots of jobs for people every year. So, ads are needed.\n\nLastly, what really matters for a product is its quality and service, not the ads. We might get fooled once, but not all the time. Plus, not all products are bad. In fact, the well-known and long-lasting brands are usually good. That's why I think it's okay if ads sometimes overdo it when talking about how good products are.\n\nFor these reasons, I think ads do more good than harm in our society, even if they sometimes make things look better than they are."}

Even though I'm an expert, I make choices and pick the right times by looking at charts, checking orders, and studying economic information because the currency market is hard to predict. I believe this idea works the same way. Usually, unexpected things happen; sometimes, lucky people might get through these things, but I think that luck won't last if you don't have a strong base of knowledge and experience. Just trying new things without knowing what you're doing is too risky.\n\nSecond, when I play tennis, I don't use a new way of serving when I really want to win.

I think young people have fun by going to parks or beaches and doing hard sports. They can stay up late, drinking or dancing, and still get up early to work. They are not afraid to take risks. Many young people get money from their parents, so they have more time to have fun. Parents want to give their kids the life they didn't have. New technology also helps young people find new ways to have fun. They care more about today than the future. Older people, however, feel tired. Even if they stay healthy, they can't be active or social for too long. But that's okay because too much of anything is bad. Older people look at life differently. They do things like young people but not as much. They learn to see the small, beautiful things in life. They know that giving and getting things with care is important. One day, everyone will understand both young and old ways of life. I am a 37-year-old man with Latin roots. I love Jesus and now I agree more with older people.

Still, I think the good times happen more often than the bad ones. Being young is great. I can do fun things. Like yesterday, I played football with my friend. I have also played baseball, cricket, basketball, and other sports. I can do these things because I am in good shape; I don't have any health problems. Right now, I feel like I can do anything! It feels amazing, the best feeling ever. But I know this won't last forever. I can't stay young forever. As we get older, things get harder. When we are old, our bodies get sick and weak. But even in these hard times, there are good moments. Being close to family makes us feel connected and that's important. It can make us happier than being alone.

{"file_id": "1053038.txt", "output_essay": "I don't agree with the statement. Some might think it's true because young people like to play and no one makes them take responsibility for what they do or what happens because of it. Here are my reasons and examples for disagreeing with the statement. First, let's look at extra activities in schools around the world. Many help the local community. Kids clean streets, collect money for charity, and do other good things. A study by a big company in Europe found that young people spend 5% of their time helping their communities. Second, companies are talking a lot about social responsibility. This talk is spreading to everyone. So, more people understand why it's good to help others. They are teaching this to young people too. Last, there are youth groups that are good at giving time to help others. They help not just their own places but also places far away. For example, some kids in France sent their toys to children in Lebanon who lost their homes because of a conflict."}
{"file_id": "1046103.txt", "output_essay": "The problem we're looking at is if people who have done well should take chances or stick to what they know. This is a big deal because we face many 'risks' like this every day. I think that a person should try new things and look for chances everywhere. I say this because life is risky, and if you don't take chances, you'll miss out on a lot of great things that come your way.\n\nFirst, I think taking risks usually leads to good things. If you avoid risks, you won't get any rewards. For instance, a bank gives you a chance to earn an extra $1000 a year with a new bond. That's awesome! Why settle for a sure $100 because it's familiar? I think someone who settles for $100 doesn't know what they can do, and it's sad to not take a chance. I believe a person who does well wouldn't pass this up, and that's what makes them do well!\n\nNext, life is risky and you can't do well by playing it safe all the time. Every day, life offers many people lots of new chances, and these can make your life better (and not just with money). For example, join a club and meet new friends: good things can come from friendships, right? That's why I think someone who only does what they know will never find new chances in life, but a person who does well will use these chances well.\n\nLastly, I think people who do well don't miss out on chances. When you look around, you can tell who does well by seeing who takes chances. People who do well are usually the ones who take and 'grab' more chances.\n\nTo wrap it up, I want to say and suggest that everyone should take more chances to do better. Taking chances will bring them better things in many ways and help them succeed. If Napoleon Bonaparte were here, I think he would say 'chance, chance, chance, do well, do well, do well' instead of 'money, money, money.'"}

I think there are a few reasons for this.\n\nFirst, young people have more chances and money to enjoy their free time. So, they might choose to have fun with friends instead of helping the community.\n\nAnother reason could be that life is different now. People need to be more adaptable. More young people move away from their hometowns to study in cities. They also change jobs more often and move homes. They don't stay in one place for long. This means they don't feel as connected to a community. To want to help, you need to feel responsible for that community. If you haven't been there long, you're less likely to help because you don't know many people. Knowing people well makes you want to help more.\n\nThe biggest reason young people help less is that they act differently towards communities. They think more about themselves and what they need. Families and communities aren't as important to them as they were before. People can take care of themselves financially, so they don't need community help as much.\n\nConsidering all these points, I agree that more young people are not giving enough time to help their communities."}

Ads also try to catch people's attention. Companies work hard to make people remember their products. They don't always think about what's best for people. That's why we see many false ads on TV, in newspapers, and online. For example, some young women want to look better. But they don't get advice from doctors. They just buy pills online.

Some students can't pay for special test-prep classes or college-prep programs; our tutoring groups answer most of their questions. I was new to the country, but they helped me get better at English. Now I help teach Math and Chinese to other students. I think we, as young people, do a good job of helping our community. I'm sure there are groups like ours in other schools too. In the summer, many of my friends look after kids or old people. Some kids don't have parents, and others are left alone. I once read stories to them. At first, I thought it was just good practice for my English, but I ended up feeling sad because I wanted to help more. I got more friends to come and help. We all learned a lot from it. One friend helped at a hospital. She talked to old people and read to them. She said helping the community was a special experience.

First, more people around the world are getting richer. Many people in Asian countries are now able to buy cars, and they are buying them. This is happening today. In twenty years, it's likely that people in Africa will also be able to buy cars. So, there will be a bigger demand for cars. Second, car companies make new cars every year. They keep making better and more attractive cars, and people love it. Look at the big car shows like the IAA or Geneva Salon. People from all backgrounds go there to see the cars and they love what they see. Even if they don't have the money, they still buy cars. They pay for them little by little each month. This is what car sales data shows. Some people might say that new laws will be made to reduce car use to help the environment. But as a car engineer, I don't think this will happen. Expert teams work hard every day to make cars that are better for the environment. They are making cars that pollute less. They are also planning for a future without oil by designing engines that don't need oil. In conclusion, I believe that there won't be fewer cars in twenty years.

I think three main things will make more people want cars: new kinds of energy, more people, and better technology. These things will make more people want cars. First, we are finding new energy like solar and hydrogen to replace oil and gas. These new energies are good because they don't pollute and they won't run out. In twenty years, we could use these to power cars and not hurt the Earth. This could make cars more popular. Second, cars are getting better with things like GPS and stronger bodies that keep people safe. These improvements make driving easier and safer, so people will keep buying cars. Third, there are more and more people in the world, and this will keep going for at least twenty years. More people means more people will need cars. Even though we are making new trains, I think people will still want to buy cars for their safety and ease of use. For example, in New Delhi, India, a new subway wasn't used much by the people.

But do ads tell the truth, or do they lie or go too far about their \"perfect\" items? This is what the statement talks about.\n\nI think the statement is right that most ads make items look way better than they are. Look at laundry soaps. Each one says it's the best. They promise to make your clothes look new and get rid of all stains. They say their soap is better than others. But I don't think this is true. Some ads say their soaps won't bleach your clothes and they'll still look new after 30 washes. But no soap can really do this.\n\nShampoo is another example. If you believe the ads, every shampoo would make your hair shiny, strong, and not oily. But this isn't true. Shampoos often don't do what people hope.\n\nMy last example is cigarettes. Ads show them as something that makes you feel free, happy when you're sad, and can take you to another place. But is this true? Aren't there bad points or even risks?\n\nYes, there are! Not long ago, no cigarette ad said that smoking could hurt your health or cause cancer, which can lead to death. Now, they tell people in ads and on cigarette packs, but the warnings are very small and people often ignore them or don't see them. Some people even joke about these warnings.\n\nTo end, you must know that ads want to sell their item to make lots of money.

But then I'll explain that it's not easy or maybe not even possible to do this. Knowing a lot is great. In school, I learned about many different things. It's amazing to know as much about history as about science or stars. If I knew a lot about many things, I could talk to a scientist or a history expert. But can you really know a lot about many subjects without focusing on just one? My knowledge in science wouldn't be as deep as a scientist's. This means if you know a little about many subjects, you don't know a lot about any. So, it might be hard or even impossible to get a job. I think you need to focus on one subject to get a job or to know a lot about that subject. In the end, I think it's better to focus on one subject. But it's also important to remember other subjects. So, you should read books about different things. For example, a scientist should know about history. He won't know as much about history as science.

These features make the product easier to use. You would highlight these features. You would make the ad show the product as an amazing creation from the company, just for the person watching the ad. The ad must look good to the customer so they think about buying the item. If an ad tells me about the benefits and many other details, I wouldn't care much. That's because it's just one of many new items. But if the ad shows the best benefits, it might make me want to go to the store to buy it. To make people think this way, you must stress the improvements. You might even make them seem better than they are. You can compare the product you're selling to another one. In the comparison, the other product should do badly, while yours does well or even amazingly well. Showing the bad product as the usual option before your product came out makes your product look even better. Making ads like this is the only way to get people to buy this product instead of another. It's also the only way for an ad to be noticed by people.

Some people think it is more important for students to understand ideas than to learn facts. Others believe learning facts is better. I agree with the first group. It is very important for students to understand ideas because they need to know the basics before they can find out new things. Learning facts is part of learning, but understanding ideas is the most important part. \n\nIn schools, especially in universities, teachers tell us that knowing ideas is important. This helps us make better use of facts to help people. \n\nThink about a student studying electrical engineering who wants to make new things in transistor technology. Transistors are parts of all electronic devices. If the student only learns facts and does not understand the ideas, they cannot be a good engineer. Engineers need to be creative and think of new ideas. To make new things, they need to really know the ideas well. \n\nIn communication, think about how 15 years ago, not many people used mobile phones, but now, everyone has one. Technology has gotten better over time. If engineers and students only remember facts and don't understand the ideas, they can't make technology better. By knowing the ideas, they can share information and use technology in a better way. \n\nTo end, I want to say again that understanding ideas is more important for students than just learning facts. If a student wants to create new things, they need to know the ideas. I think if they only know facts, they can't make anything new. This is how universities teach. They focus on learning through ideas. This way, we can learn facts too. But if we only learn facts, we won't make progress in the world or in technology. We need different ideas."}
{"file_id": "1067151.txt", "output_essay": "Not many people in France think it's good to know a lot about many subjects. They think you should learn every part of one subject to be good at it. Is this right or wrong?\n\nI don't think this way is right. I believe knowing more makes you better at things. Take someone who wants to work in a library. Will he be better if he only knows about books, how they are made, and printed? I don't think so. He will be better if he knows about many topics like history, people's studies, thinking, writing, and science. Doing things over and over can teach you the skills, but it can't take the place of the wide learning you get from schools and colleges.\n\nAnother reason I think knowing a lot is important is because it makes people more able to change jobs. They can move from one area of work to another. They are 'complete people.' They can handle any change. For example, you could be working with money today and be in charge of people tomorrow.\n\nMy final point is about how I see a modern society: I think a good person in society should know a lot about many school subjects to make smart choices. Life is complicated: if you want to get what's going on in your country and the world, you need strong knowledge in different areas like places, money matters, or new inventions.\n\nTo end this talk, I would say that the British idea of a 'gentleman' who knows a lot about human life is still important today."}
{"file_id": "1055205.txt", "output_essay": "In the next twenty years, I think there will be more cars, not fewer. I believe this because people want and need cars more and more every day. Technology is getting better, and car companies show that car sales will go up soon. Cars are getting cheaper and better, which makes me think more people will use them. Policies could also affect this increase. Cars used to be a luxury, but now even families without a lot of money have them. This is because car companies make it easy to pay over time. Banks are also willing to lend money to buy cars or make them better. Car companies let you trade in your old car for a new one with some extra money, which helps sell more cars. Cars are great because you can travel with your family whenever you want, and they are helpful in emergencies. Cars also show social status. People always want new cars with the latest features. Some cars are seen as very special, like royal cars or classic cars. You can go where you want, when you want, and as fast as you want. Some cars even have special features like rooms for meetings or sleeping. This is good for busy people who can't waste time. With all these good things, it's hard to believe that there will be fewer cars soon. Cars do have downsides, like pollution and using up natural resources. But new technology is making cars that don't pollute and use sunlight or electricity instead of gas. With all these benefits, I think more people will want cars, and we won't see a big drop in the number of cars soon. So, I expect there will be even more cars in the future than there are now."}

I was shopping with my friends, looking for a new phone. I had seen it on TV one morning and loved it right away. I promised myself I would get that phone, no matter what. I thought the phone was cute and had lots of features. It seemed perfect for any teenager. But when I saw the phone in the mall, I was shocked. It wasn't as cute as in the ad, and it didn't have as many features. The ad was just cheap tricks. The phone was shown in a misleading way. Luckily, my friends were there. Without them, I would have bought the phone, loved it, and then felt like a loser when it let me down. Ads often make us fall for products just by watching them. This can ruin our trust in ads and the people who make the products. We feel sad when we get home and see the product isn't as good as we thought. The people who make ads or products trick us into paying a lot, making money for themselves but losing our trust. Ads should be more honest. They shouldn't show things that aren't really in the product. Advertisers should only talk about what's truly there and useful. If they want to talk about other features, they should tell the makers to add those features first. Then they wouldn't be fooling us. They would be showing us something real."}

Some people say it's good to learn about many things, but I believe knowing one thing well is more important. We go to college to learn a lot about one subject. Knowing a lot about one thing can help you get a job because companies like experts. I want to study law deeply after I finish college. Experts are in demand because the world is always changing and there's so much to learn. For example, someone getting a divorce will look for a lawyer who knows a lot about divorce, not a doctor or a business lawyer. It also takes too much time to learn many subjects well. Some people get many degrees and keep studying without becoming experts in one field. They know a bit about things like economics and finance, but not enough to be the best. Studying many things is also expensive and might not help you beat someone who only studied one thing but knows it very well. Trying to learn many things can show you can't make up your mind. Some students keep changing their major in college and never pick one to focus on. They get tired and might even drop out before finishing. For me, focusing on one subject is the best. But I still want to learn a bit about other things like languages, sports, and art to talk with others about different topics."}

Someone lived, or something happened like that. When we read history books, we see many different ideas and concepts. Take World War II as an example. Some countries claimed they were right, and their enemies said the same. I could give more examples, but I want to focus on this one. If you want to do something, you need a solid reason. It must be real and not change from one person to another. Everyone has their own way of seeing things. They can say, 'I am right,' and that's their idea. But no one can change the facts. To learn, I need to know facts. We should also understand ideas, but they are not the main thing. I want to form my own opinions. Ideas help create new thoughts, but with facts, you can imagine the ideas and find your own truth. It's hard because many people just accept what others say. I don't. In a democracy, we choose our own path. We pick our ideas and concepts. To do this well, we need knowledge. Finally, I read a lot about the U.S., but when I visited, it was different from what I thought. That's why I can't fully trust what people say or accept every idea I hear."}

Governments are making laws to protect nature, and people want to harm the environment less. Cars give off carbon dioxide, which is a big cause of pollution. If people drive less and use buses, trains, or other public transport, we can cut down on this pollution. That's why I believe there will be fewer cars in the future. \n\nCities are growing, and more of them will have public transport like subways, trains, or buses. These options are cheaper and save time. So, people will prefer them over driving. For instance, most of my teachers have cars but only drive when it rains. Our city's subway is less expensive and more comfortable. They don't need to drive otherwise. \n\nAlso, it costs a lot to keep a car. You have to pay for gas, car taxes, and more. These costs can make people think twice about owning a car. \n\nLastly, too much traffic and the struggle to find parking can discourage people from driving. \n\nIn conclusion, caring for the environment, the ease of public transport, the costs of having a car, traffic, and parking issues will lead to fewer people wanting their own cars."}

Now, I'll start talking about the topic to the students. It depends on the type of topic: A. Science topics: I'll say understanding isn't key because students should look at it differently. For example, if a teacher says the sun rises in the east, there's no point in arguing. Talking for days won't add new knowledge. So, I think in science, it's not key for students to get the idea. Maybe the teacher can just mention it's about how the Earth moves. B. Art topics: These topics are flexible because they don't have set rules like science does. Teachers can share ideas, and some students might agree while others don't. Take the 'Mona Lisa's' smile. Some might see secrets in it, but not everyone sees art the same way, or maybe Leonardo da Vinci didn't mean to make it that way. So, I think it's not key for students to get the idea or concept. C. Medical topics: These are for medical students who need to know all about the human body. They can't miss any detail; they must talk about every part. Here, I think students need to understand to learn the facts. In the end, I'm looking at the topic from outside, and I could be wrong. To sum up, I'll say this way of thinking isn't for school kids because they're still growing and need to understand everything. My thoughts might fit better with college students.

{"file_id": "1055820.txt", "output_essay": "The word 'advertisement' comes from 'advert,' which means 'to get noticed.' The main goal of all ads is to grab a lot of attention. Ads usually do more than just list what a product can do. They try to make a product seem way better than it is. I completely agree with this idea.\n\nAds today are fancier than they were years ago, but their main goal has always been to get people to notice them so that products can sell more. Back in the '70s or '80s, ads often made the product's features and customer reviews sound much better than they were. This made the product seem much better. Overstated customer reviews made it seem like everyone who bought the product was happy. These tricks already made people think the product was better than it was. But in the last 10 or 20 years, ads have become even more tricky and fancy. They trick people, both kids and adults, with the special image they create for a product. This image is what marketing and ad companies call 'The Brand.'\n\nThese fancy ads make people link certain products with certain actions in their heads. For example, they suggest that if you drive 'Car Z8,' you are cool. Or if you wear certain perfumes, you will be more attractive to others. These links make people see things that aren't there, so they can't choose products based on facts and reason. Also, with this kind of advertising, a product doesn't have to be good to sell well. A normal clothing line could cost twice as much if a famous person says they like it. These tricks make sure that people and companies forget what's really important - the product itself, not the image around it.\n\nAlso, this fake image leads to crazy shopping. People going wild to buy certain things is bad for everyone. With ads and brands, people sometimes can't tell what's really good from what's just pretend.\n\nI truly think that ads make a product seem much better with different tricks. But this kind of selling hurts everyone, especially the people who buy things."}

Second, trying new things can help me meet many new people. This can happen at work, with friends, and in how I live. Making smarter friends can make life better.

He can come up with new, important ideas that can't be replaced. I know that facts are important to know and learn. But without really understanding them, a student's knowledge isn't complete. He can't form his own opinions or come up with ideas by himself. His knowledge will just be a list of facts, not based on strong thinking.\n\nStudents should spend time alone to think and make their own ideas. This is because in the real world, they will face many problems where facts might not help. For example, imagine a student becomes a doctor. He might have to handle medical problems fast. I don't think he can just use facts then. Facts might tell him what the sickness is. But how to treat it will depend on the patient's own situation. He has to figure this out himself. It might not be like what's in the textbook.\n\nAlso, understanding ideas helps a student move forward. It lets them give the world new ideas. Sometimes the information we have might have mistakes. These can only be fixed if the idea is clear. Then a student can ask questions. He might find answers himself instead of waiting for someone to give him new facts and numbers."}

They are too busy studying for school, having fun, and they don't really get what it means to help their community. In Taiwan, parents really push their kids to do well in school. They want them to keep studying and not focus on anything else. So, the kids don't have time to do things like help out in their community. Young people act like kids and would rather play. They like to play video games or watch TV in a cool room when they are not in school. They don't want to help outside, especially when it's very hot in Taiwan. Take my nephew for example. He's a teenager and doesn't know much about where he's lived for over ten years. He likes to chat on the phone with friends and go out with his girlfriend. He only helps in the community when his school makes him for a grade. When I asked him to volunteer, he thought it was a weird idea he had never thought of. In the end, it's normal now for young people not to help much in their communities. This is because their parents and the community don't make it easy for them to help. They also don't give good rewards or explain why it's important. Because of this, young people don't feel connected to their own communities."}

Another good thing is that you can talk about many topics. This can help you make more friends. If someone talks about something, you can join in because you know about many things, not just one. Focusing on one subject also has its benefits. People who study many things may not know a lot about one topic. But if you focus on one subject, you become an expert. This means you can answer detailed questions and solve tough problems. Companies also like to hire experts. They often pay experts more than people who know a little about many things.

They stay up late, go to parties, drive fast, and some may use drugs. But this does not mean they have more fun. I read a great book called 'Tuesdays with Morrie.' It talks about life. A young man learns from an older man's life. The older man has been through a lot. He teaches the young man an important lesson: 'You need to learn how to die before you can learn how to live.' This means he should learn from what happens to him, let go of some feelings, and then he will understand success, love, and pride. Morrie, the older man, says knowing about death helps you enjoy life more. I think older people might enjoy life more. They get more from each new thing that happens. But some young people are also mature. They have fun even when things are tough, like when they don't have much money. They make the most of their chances to go out or party.

The problem is that most young people use most of their time for fun things like watching TV, playing video games, listening to music, and using computers. In the past, people helped more in their communities because they didn't have as many fun things to do. They would spend an afternoon at a community center to help and learn. Now, young people spend most of their time in front of screens instead of helping their communities because there are too many fun things to do.\n\nAlso, young people today often don't care about helping others. They haven't had tough times since they were born. They are too satisfied and don't think they need to help others. Older people would help others because they know that even a little help can mean a lot to someone. So, young people don't help much in their communities because they don't understand how much their help can mean to others.\n\nLastly, the way young people think is also a problem. If the media told them to help, there would be more helpers in the world. Young people pay a lot of attention to the media.

The person who said we would might think this because the growth in car use has slowed down over the past 25 years. They might also believe that public transport will get easier to use and cheaper. A new way to travel could also lead to fewer cars. Plus, our streets are already too full of cars and can't fit any more. This is clear in places like Germany. But in countries like China or poorer nations, there's still room for more cars. As these countries grow, they will want more advanced things like cars. This growth is fast, and countries like India or South Africa could become developed in the next twenty years. A new way to travel could happen, but we can't see it yet, and it would take a long time to become popular. It wouldn't affect car use much in 20 years. I hope and think that public transport will get cheaper and spread worldwide. But I'm worried that cars, being more comfortable, will always be popular. I used a car to get to the TOEFL center today, not a bus or train. Even in Germany, where public transport is great, there are still many cars on the road. This shows that good public transport doesn't greatly reduce car use. Outside of Europe, countries are more spread out. It's much more costly to set up public transport than to build roads. It's true that car growth is slowing, but this doesn't mean the number of cars won't keep increasing. Europe might not see much more growth, but other countries will want more cars in the coming years. This will be more than the decrease in Europe. The world's population is also growing. Even though it's slightly less in very developed countries, the total number of people is still going up fast. This won't change in the next 20 years. In conclusion, I don't see any strong reason why car numbers would go down in the next two decades. Maybe a nuclear war or a meteor could do it, but nothing likely. I don't like the trend of more cars, but I'm sure it will continue."}

But if you focus on one thing, you will learn details that others don't know. This deep knowledge is better to have. For example, imagine you run a company and need to hire someone for marketing. You have two people to choose from: one went to a regular college and the other to a business school. Who would you pick for your business? I'm not saying the person from the regular college is not good. But I would choose the one from the business school. That's because I want someone who knows a lot about business. This isn't just what I think. It's how the world works. Many successful people, like the boss of Microsoft, were not just good at their jobs. They knew a lot about one thing. Knowing about many subjects might help you choose what you like. But if you know what you want to do, you should learn more about that one thing. And keep going, even if it seems hard.

For example, if a software engineer works on the same project for many years, he won't get better at his job, and he might even lose his creativity. He can only get better and learn more by working on different projects.\n\nMukesh Ambani is a great example of success in many businesses. He and his brother started with industries and made them more profitable. Then he moved on to oil refineries and created Reliance Mobiles. Reliance Energy Resources also do well in mutual funds and the stock market.\n\nThis creates jobs in many areas. If there was only one industry, we could only help people in that area. Starting new businesses also cuts down on unemployment and helps different parts of the economy grow.\n\nAnother reason to have different businesses is to balance losses. If one business fails, the others can cover the loss. For example, knowing both hardware and software is useful when there are not many jobs in either field.

I can't say everyone will know little, but most people won't know a lot. This means our society won't be strong. Also, if we only knew about one thing, scientists wouldn't be as successful as they are now. For example, if Newton only thought about why an apple fell down and didn't research more, he wouldn't have found the gravity formula. He might have spent his life not understanding gravity.

Second, the guide might show us special spots that aren't in maps or books. Third, in a group, people think differently. If one person is curious about something, everyone can learn from the answer. A guide is the best person to answer these questions. So, traveling in a group with a guide is the way to go. But, there's a downside. The guide might give wrong information or have biased views.

It gives you the chance to plan, handle things, and learn about challenges you will meet in life. Life isn't just about fun and happiness. It's also about going through hard times."}

They want you to get up and go on a trip. How would you feel? Awful, right? Just send me back to my dream! I think it's silly to go on a trip with a tour guide and a group. Here's why. I'm a lazy person. I want to keep dreaming about my love. But you interrupt my dream to travel! It's tough to pick a time that works for everyone in a group. Some people might not want to wake up when the tour guide says so. This can make everyone tired and grumpy. But that's not the only issue. If we're in a group, we can't do things on our own. We have to follow the tour guide like little kids. This can be annoying and we might miss out on seeing nice places. Imagine I see a beautiful spot, but the tour guide says it's not part of the plan. What can I do? Nothing. I can't leave the group. These problems can make us all very upset. But the worst part is the tour guide has all the power. If they're not around, we just sit and wait. If the tour guide wants to go somewhere boring, we have to follow. We must do what the tour guide says or we'll be left out. All these things make the trip hard for everyone. What I've learned is that traveling with a tour guide and a group is not the best way to see new places."}
{"file_id": "1059458.txt", "output_essay": "In my time at university, I often thought back to what I learned in high school. I studied Latin and Ancient Greek in Italy. Our teacher told us that these old languages helped us think better. They taught us to use our minds in a stronger way. Ancient Greek and especially Latin make it easier to understand things. They are like math because they have a clear structure. Knowing Latin helps you think about complex ideas in a clear way. My high school was a 'Classical High School'. This is different from a 'Scientific High School'. I didn't study subjects like math, physics, or geometry. Instead, I learned how to think. At the Architectural School in Milan, I saw that my teacher was right. I had no trouble with hard subjects like math and structure. This was because my mind could handle all kinds of information, even if it was different from my high school studies. That's why I believe it's very important for all students to learn how to understand ideas, not just facts. If you understand an idea, you can think about it deeply. You can form your own opinions and not just remember facts without knowing why they are important. For students, understanding ideas is key. It will help them solve all kinds of problems in life."}

I think you find joy in different ways at each stage of your life.\n\nAs a young person, you don't have kids. You might think you're having more fun because you don't have to take care of children. But I believe I'll be very happy when my child grows up and can take care of themselves. Even with all the hard work, I'll still find joy in life.\n\nAlso, when you're young, you can't do everything you want. You must follow your parents' rules. Being grown up means you can pick what you do and try new things. For instance, my mom wouldn't let me swim because she was scared of water. I started swimming late, but now I love it. As you get older, you like new things. I used to think looking at paintings for hours was weird. But now, I love going to art shows! Over time, I learned to find joy in new ways.\n\nGetting older also means you can work. You can do well in your job and get paid for it. I was so happy when I got my first paycheck! The thought of earning money with my mind still excites me. It's a way of finding joy that I didn't think about when I was younger.\n\nIn short, I think being happy and finding joy in life isn't about how old you are. It's about being able to enjoy the good times and learn from the bad ones. I want to be happy with this way of thinking about life!"}

The first group likes a safe, normal life. They wake up, do chores, go to work, sit in a small office space for eight hours a day, five days a week. They look forward to weekends with their family and want to live like their neighbors. They contribute to society, but not in a big way. They won't be remembered because they just follow orders. The second group makes the world better. This group includes famous people like Albert Einstein, Thomas Edison, Mahatma Gandhi, and Yuri Gagarin. They were curious and wanted to discover new things in their work. Einstein and Edison made big discoveries in science, like gravity and electricity. Gandhi changed politics with his peaceful protests. Gagarin went to space and made us think about the universe. These people were all willing to work hard and risk everything to show they were right."}
{"file_id": "1069486.txt", "output_essay": "To answer this question, we need to understand why young people help their community. Often, young people join groups to be with others and have fun with friends. This can be in church groups, sports teams, or just meeting up. For example, church activities try to show young ones how good it is to help those with disabilities. But, because young people watch a lot of TV, community activities are seen as 'uncool.' It is more popular to be on your own and get your own fame. Another reason is that people don't trust their government. They feel the weight on them if they want to succeed. So, they work to do the best for themselves. This is clear when people see that government officials, who should help the public, seem to care more about making money for themselves. This can make people think more about themselves. With the internet, people know about the selfish acts of some officials. They also hear about life's dangers on the news every day. I believe this constant stress and dishonesty have made young people not give enough time to their communities. But, society knows about this issue. There is a lot of work by the media and government to show how big this problem is and to say how key it is to help the community. Hopefully, this will change modern societies. Helping could become seen as something good and not 'uncool.'"}

I think this is true because my idea of success is different. A truly successful person should not only do their job well but also keep getting better. They should aim to create new things. This is important for their career. It helps them get noticed and move up. But I'm not saying that people should always take risks and change their methods. When and where to try new things and take risks matters a lot. If the timing or place is wrong, it could lead to problems. For instance, if your boss gives you an important project that needs to be done soon, you shouldn't take a risk then. You also don't have the right to risk the company's reputation. In the end, I think people should try new things and take risks when they have enough experience and are ready for change. This can make a person successful and respected."}

There are too many cars, and it's hard to move around on the streets. Cities should have good roads for driving. We should learn to drive safely and respect other drivers by not speeding. In the end, we should only use cars when we really need to. If there are other options, we should use them. Sometimes we take the easy way without thinking. But we can't go back to how things were.

{"file_id": "1061257.txt", "output_essay": "Learning facts is very important for students of all ages. When a child starts school, this is the first thing they are asked to do. They learn rules like standing straight in a line before going into a class, or not moving around when the teacher is talking. These rules are taught to them before they learn about right and wrong. They learn what happens if they break the rules before they understand why the rules are important. In our schools, learning is more important than understanding, especially at the start. As students get older, the expectations change. In higher grades, you can't just memorize things without understanding them. Understanding a concept can make a student smarter, while just learning fills their memory. Since school should teach kids how to think, just learning becomes less important as they grow up. However, learning is still needed for tests. It shows if a student can remember things and if they are smart. It also shows if they are motivated and can memorize well. So, learning is still a big part of doing well in school and in the whole education system. For a student's own growth, it is more important to understand concepts and ideas. But learning is easier to check on a test, for example. This makes us think about what schools are for. If schools are just to prepare people for jobs, then being able to learn quickly and a lot is very important. But schools are also important for a country. They shape how people think. This is very important in a democracy, for example."}
{"file_id": "1034419.txt", "output_essay": "These days, most old people feel upset and cut off from others. They don't have a good life, and many say they are just waiting to die. On the other hand, young people have many choices for how to live and what to do for fun. This means that young people seem to have a better life than older ones. To decide if this is true, we need to look at the facts carefully. \n\nMany experts believe that old people don't want to join in with society after a certain age. They also think that old people like to be alone and value their privacy over being part of big groups. But now, there are more chances for old people to enjoy their lives within society. Also, a lot of people over 60 are still active and up-to-date, not lonely and upset like in the past. Old people do take part in groups and activities. This shows they are interested, but they need help and encouragement to join in. \n\nSome people think that nearly all old people are sick and can't do things they used to do. They say older people live with pain and need help to manage their lives. This is partly true. But thanks to new discoveries and research on diseases like cancer, experts have found many ways to make old people's lives better. This is one reason why people are living longer now. \n\nIn conclusion, there are many ways to help old people have fun and a good life. They respond well to joining groups and doing sports, showing they enjoy life even if they can't do everything they want. We can't say that young people have more fun.

{"file_id": "1052180.txt", "output_essay": "This topic makes us think about the common question: 'Which is better: having more or having better?' The essay will look at the good and bad points of knowing a lot about many school subjects versus knowing a lot about just one. The first part of our essay will list and talk about the good points of each way, and the second part will look at the bad points. In elementary and high school, students learn about many subjects instead of just one. This helps them get to know different areas and think about what they might want to do later in life. Often, students have enough time to figure out if they like a certain subject or job area. For example, a student who studies both physics and biology can choose from different jobs. They might want to work in technology, engineering, or healthcare. But a student who only studies one subject will likely be very good at it later because they spent a lot of time on it. This is often the case for students in trade schools who pick their job path early on. A student who goes to a school for airplane repair will have what they need to do well in airplane engineering. There's a saying, 'Jack of all trades, master of none.' This means that students who learn about too many subjects might not become experts in any. Knowing a lot about many subjects can also make it hard to pick one to focus on later. But, if you only know about one subject, you might not have many job choices. Also, if the job market changes, you might have to start over in a new field. For instance, a student who only studies nursing will probably just go on to get a nursing degree. In the end, whether having more or having better is best really depends on the person and how well they use what they know."}

For example, old couples might not party hard, but they enjoy traveling and remembering good old times. Young people might find this dull, but it's precious for the older ones. Old people find ways to have fun that are healthy and full of meaning. Second, old people like many things, including what young people like—parties, clubs, and working out. They prefer quiet places but still enjoy dancing with their partners and spending time with special people. My grandma, for instance, loves to party with her friends. Third, there's something young people don't get but old people love—gardening. Young folks think it's just a way for old people to kill time. But it's not true. Gardening is a joy for them. They love seeing their plants and trees grow. It's about the happiness of making things come to life. So, I believe old people know how to have a good time, maybe even better than the young. They don't do things that hurt their health or cause trouble. They live in ways that make life better. These are my reasons for disagreeing with the statement."}

This helps me think about the best way to use it. Also, I have to follow certain steps. When I find the answer, I should describe the steps in an easy way. For instance, I start with the first thing to do, then the next, and so on. In the end, all these reasons show that it's good to know a lot about one topic.

Not long ago, I found out that a past student from my college had brain cancer. When this news spread at school, many student groups quickly started to raise money to help. The students were very eager to support a cause they believed in. In my country, many political groups have youth sections. These groups are made up of young people. They work hard to share their group's ideas and goals. They give their time and energy to help their community. Many young people also work with charities to help poor people get what they need. For example, I'm part of a group that teaches poor and uneducated people about diseases, how to prevent them, and what signs to look for. We travel to different villages to share this important information. In the years I've been with this group, I've seen more and more young people join us.

Hanging out with friends can be fun, but it's also a way to learn how to get along with others. Not all young people are like this, though. Some just want to have a good time and don't think about what comes next. But this isn't true for all young people. Older people, on the other hand, can really enjoy their lives. They often have more free time and money. Those with jobs and good health can definitely have a good time. They can also set a good example for younger people. My parents, for example, go on short trips on the weekends. When I see them, I wish I could be like them. It makes me think about my own life.

{"file_id": "1069391.txt", "output_essay": "Many students at some point wonder if they should focus on one subject in school or if they should go to a regular university to take classes in lots of different areas. I think both choices can be good, but it all depends on what you want to do later on.\n\nFirst, I think it's important for students not to focus on one thing too soon. In high schools, for example, students should learn about many areas before they pick what they want to study more. This way, students might find new subjects they didn't know about that they really like.\n\nAlso, I believe whether you choose to focus on one subject or not depends on the job you want in the future. Some jobs need you to know about many subjects. Take journalism, for example. Some journalists focus on one topic, but most can write about anything, from changes in retirement money to a soccer game.\n\nFrom my own experience, not picking one subject to focus on can be very interesting. Someone who doesn't choose a main subject will be interested in more things than someone who only cares about history or philosophy.\n\nBut I also think there's a risk for people who know a little about many subjects. We also need experts who really understand certain parts of our world. For example, to teach biology, you need to be an expert in biology. This is true for all teachers. In some places, teachers cover two subjects, but I don't think that's a great idea because they can't know two subjects very well.\n\nIn the end, we can say that we need both experts and people with general knowledge in our societies. But for me, I'm glad I learned about many subjects before I chose my main one. Because of this, I found out what biology, physics, and other subjects were, which I wouldn't have known without my high school classes."}

Companies want to hire people who know a lot about their field.

They can also switch jobs more easily. \n\nSo, even though learning a lot about one subject might seem like a good idea at first, I think learning about many subjects is better in the long run. \n\nI say this because I chose to study management engineering in detail. I did this to be better than other students when looking for a job. But when I'm not studying, I don't like to read because I'm too tired from school. When I talk to people who study different things, like economics or mechanics, I feel like I'm missing something. I feel like my education isn't complete because I can't talk about many topics.

But as I said earlier, this is about physical ability.\n\nThe issue is that many young guys don't enjoy life, and I don't get why. A lot of people are sad these days, maybe because of stress and a life that cares too much about work and having things just to fit in.\n\nI believe the idea is too narrow; we can't say young people enjoy life more than old people because it's not always the case. Take a teacher I had; he was old, but he acted young: full of energy and good with my young classmates.\n\nThankfully, my friends are very energetic, so I'm never bored like some people.

Their needs have changed a lot because of new technology and science. This has made life easier but also harder to succeed in. People, no matter their age, are working harder than they did 20 years ago. A young child is busy with school and has a lot to study. He doesn't have much time for other activities. A teenager is busy trying to start a career. An adult is busy trying to get better at his job or improve his life. Only an older person who has retired seems to have time for activities but doesn't have the energy. Changes in technology have not only made life easier but also changed the way people think. Even a young child thinks about what he can gain by giving something up. Everyone is more focused on what they can become, how much they can make, and how to earn more. They live a life where they think 'Time is Money'. They don't want to spend time on things that don't give them money or comfort. In management science, it's said that people's social needs are less important than their need for money. In this kind of world, people don't think much about their communities or spend time helping them.

Things like gadgets, friends, movies, clubs, and bars pull them away from their families and the community.\n\nIf they're not having fun, then schoolwork keeps them at home after school. They have to study a lot because of how schools teach today.\n\nSchools mostly teach book knowledge. Not having enough hands-on activities means students don't get to experience the real world.\n\nBesides school, young people don't seem interested in helping with community issues. They are becoming more selfish. They put themselves first. Everything else is less important to them.\n\nAnother reason they don't help is that they don't get the idea of big families living together. In the past, big families meant people were closer. They cared more and knew how important community is. Now, smaller families mean young people don't feel as connected.\n\nLast month, the Mumbai blast shocked the country. It made us question our unity and safety. The terrorists were young. But the people who helped were older, not the youth.\n\nNot all young people are unhelpful, but many are too focused on themselves to help their community.

For example, a person might be sad on a rainy day but then suddenly become very happy when they drink a Coke as the sun comes out. This suggests that Coke can make you happy, even though the weather has nothing to do with it.\n\nMagazine ads and photos sometimes make products look bigger or show them with things that you don't get when you buy the product. These tricks make the product seem more appealing.\n\nAlso, some ads promise results that the product can't fully deliver. This happens a lot with diet products.

The ad implies that the yogurt helps you lose weight, even though it really just helps you not gain weight.\n\nLastly, ads often don't talk about a product's bad points. If they have to because of rules, they mention them very quickly and in a way that's hard to read. Alcohol ads do this by showing a tiny warning about drinking too much that's hard to see.\n\nIn conclusion, ads don't always tell the full truth about what they're selling.

Let's look at global warming. If a student gets how rising temperatures affect the weather, he can dig deeper. He can see how things are linked. This can be very exciting. It helps to have a teacher who can make the topic exciting. Then, the teacher doesn't need to make students learn boring facts. He just needs to explain the idea or how something works well. It's also key to let students have time and help to discover things on their own. This leads to more self-confidence. I think it's like a good cycle.

They do this by trying to create new things that no one has tried before.\n\nSecond, successful people try new things and take risks to get better at what they do. Doing the same things over and over only gives the same results. There is no growth or progress. To be successful, we need to be better than others. Even if we are better at one point, we can become just the same or worse over time. Take Ichiro Suzuki, a major league baseball player, for example. He always looks for new ways to improve his batting every year. He is one of the most successful people because of this.\n\nThird, successful people usually like to face challenges. I think it's important to do new things. Trying new things gives us new skills and ideas. These can lead to success.\n\nIn conclusion, I agree that successful people try new things and take risks instead of just doing what they know well. I say this for the three main reasons I've talked about."}

It can be as simple as helping your family with everyday tasks, watching the neighbor's house when they're gone, or giving time to charity groups. At the heart of these actions is the understanding that we are not alone. We are part of a larger group. We should also be thankful for what we have, like being young, healthy, or having talents. Sharing these things can help others and make us feel good too.\n\nI believe that young people don't pay enough attention to what their communities need. In fact, I think they are quite separate from the whole idea of community. This issue is complicated and has many causes.\n\nFor one, our culture values time a lot, especially free time. Life today asks a lot from us, and there are so many fun things to do. We see our time as very precious and get upset when we can't use it as we wish.\n\nAlso, I think that in Western countries, people are becoming more focused on pleasure. We think we have the right to enjoy life, make our own choices, and go after what makes us happy right away. This is very clear in young people. They want to play and have fun. They see helping others as unfair.\n\nIn a world where people only think about themselves and having a good time, talking to people who are different seems like a waste. This is a problem. Young people and older people or those who need help seem to be growing apart. These are the people who need more time and help from the community. Young people should be there for them.\n\nIn the end, I think that the values that are now important in our society shape how young people see life. This leads to a more selfish view of how to use time and talents. Sadly, this means that parts of the community that need help are being ignored."}

I fully agree that 'successful people try new things and take risks instead of just doing what they are good at.' We can see this by looking at some famous people in different areas, like the ones below.\n\nFirst, let's talk about Dhirubhai Ambani, the richest man in India, who used to sell vegetables. He was great at selling them, but he got interested in the field of communication and started to learn about it. It was a new area for him, but his hard work and belief in himself made him successful. In the end, he became a leader in that field.\n\nNext, Sachin Tendulkar, a cricket legend, was studying to be an engineer because he wanted to be one. But he loved cricket a lot. So, he chose cricket after starting engineering, even though it was a big risk. He was willing to work hard for it. Now, he is a famous cricketer. The risk he took was big, but it was worth it.\n\nSo, I think that a person who is good at many things and thinks in different ways can be successful. A successful person is not just someone who takes risks but also works hard to make those risks pay off in the end."}

Many of these groups are made up of young people. I think that young, eager people can do a lot for their communities.\n\nYoung people often want to do a lot. But sometimes, they can't find the time or the best way to help their communities. For instance, I am a lawyer, and I usually work for 10 to 12 hours a day. On weekends, I often have to read and check papers. So, I don't have much time to volunteer. But this doesn't mean I don't want to help or that I think it's not important. It's just that our busy lives today make us choose what to do first. Still, I try to join in community work when I can.\n\nWhen I was in college, I did a lot of charity work. I was part of a social club, and we did many good projects. I am proud of that work. My college had over 50 clubs like ours. We think it's important to help people in need and to try to make their lives better. One summer, in 2002, I helped paint a school in a poor area. The kids from the school helped us, and it was wonderful to see their happy smiles.\n\nI believe that young people are very important to society. They just need to find the right way to go. They have hope and belief and have a lot to offer. And today, they really do their best to help make their communities better."}
{"file_id": "1069410.txt", "output_essay": "I think that older people enjoy life as much as young people do. What makes a young person happy might not make an older person happy. Enjoying life means different things to different people. It depends on their age, culture, religion, and where they live. I learn to enjoy life more every day. As a child, I was very shy because of family problems. I found it hard to make friends and have fun. I often felt stuck in bad situations and didn't know how to ask for help. This made my childhood quite sad. Young people today might not know how to say what makes them happy. They feel pressure from friends. They might end up doing things they don't want to do. But as we get older, we start to say 'no' and feel okay about it. We become more sure of ourselves. We learn how to deal with hard times. As we get older, we get smarter. We learn from what we and others go through. The more we know about ourselves, the easier it is to find happiness. It takes time to learn what makes us happy. Older people often know this better because they have lived longer. They have had more time to learn from good and bad times. I really think the opposite is true. A shy child or a teenager who feels pushed around by friends will find it hard to be happy. But as I get older, I get smarter. When I mess up, I learn from it. I once heard that getting older happens to everyone, but growing up is a choice. I think that's true."}

They should try hard to achieve the community's goals. By making their society better, they also improve themselves. Everyone should help the community. Every caring person should push others to help in any way they can. For example, rich people might give money to charities that help poor kids go to school, eat, have homes, and get clothes. Kids without money can help by teaching little ones, watching kids, making food, or collecting things. They could also set up special days for cleaning, where people of a certain age all clean together. Young people should read and learn to get better at things, especially in poorer countries. They need to help lift up their countries and communities. They could have meetings to talk about making their places better. I think there are many ways for young people to help their communities. They just need to be ready to try. I am sure that if young people start doing things, they will do them well and make their communities better. In the end, one should always remember what his community has done for him and should work to make it better."}
{"file_id": "1081503.txt", "output_essay": "People often say that traveling with a tour guide and a big group is the best because it's cheap and safe. But I don't agree with this. I think it's more important to enjoy the trip and use time well. First, travelers want to enjoy their trip. They want to see, hear, eat, and feel what they like. But on a group tour, they can't do whatever they want. They must follow the guide. For example, I once joined a group tour in Paris to visit a museum because it was cheaper. But I didn't enjoy it. There were too many people, and I couldn't see everything or learn as much as I wanted. Also, traveling alone is better for using time well. Time is precious and once it's gone, you can't get it back. Group tours can waste time. A study from Harvard shows that solo trips use time twice as effectively as group tours. People traveling alone also feel happier with how they spend their time and their overall trip. In short, traveling alone is better than in a group. It gives you a better trip and helps you use your time better."}
{"file_id": "1069829.txt", "output_essay": "I don't agree with the statement. From what I've seen, it's better to know a lot about one subject than a little about many subjects. I'm an electronics engineer. Electronics covers many areas. You can't know everything about all of them. If you don't choose one subject, you might not be sure about what you know. You could get confused because you know a bit about many things. But if you know a lot about one subject, you understand it well. You become the go-to person for that subject. For instance, I know a lot about Robotics and Control. When there's a problem with control systems at work, I can fix it fast. If I didn't focus on one area, I'd have to spend time learning and getting past my confusion from knowing about other subjects. This would slow me down. Companies value fast solutions. They can't wait for someone to learn on the job. Also, if you know about many subjects, it's hard to show you're an expert in one. People will ask what you're good at. If you say you know a little about many things, they might not choose you. Teams are important for success. No one wants someone who thinks they can do everything alone. You can't do better than a team with experts in different areas. In short, it's best to be an expert in one area. This way, you can be part of a team. Teams with experts are good at solving problems. Every company uses teams for solutions and research. One person can't do as much by themselves."}
{"file_id": "1061634.txt", "output_essay": "There are many reasons why people succeed. Some think that success comes from finding new ways to do things, seeing what will be popular next, and taking chances. Others believe that using what you already know well is the key to success. I believe that taking risks is very important for success. In business, 'innovation' is a word often used to describe why a company does well. Customers and investors like companies that are brave enough to introduce brand new products. The world is always changing. The companies that can predict new social or economic changes will last. For example, easyJet became very successful because it was one of the first to offer cheap flights. This was a gamble because it was different from the expensive options available. But in the end, easyJet and RyanAir became very popular. It's true that being the best at one thing is important. But people who only rely on their experience don't change their thinking much and find it hard to adjust to new situations. People who are willing to take risks, like in art, are often rewarded because they challenge the usual way of doing things. This is what's needed in a world where everything is connected. To do well, we need to be unique and willing to take risks for it. In summary, trying new things leads to new business ideas. Taking chances is at the heart of success. In simple terms, 'who dares, wins.' Even if you're not trying to succeed, taking risks is important because they make our everyday life more exciting."}

We live in a world full of stress, especially in rich countries. This stress often stops people from caring about others and their community.\n\nLong ago, young people didn't do the things they do now. We used to connect more with others and rely on them. But factories, new technology, discoveries, being on our own, competing, and stress have really made the world different.\n\nFirst, parents try to give their kids everything they didn't have. But this can be a mistake. It can make kids not understand the worth and cost of things.\n\nSecond, a child's day can be very busy. They go to school, learn music, play sports, study languages, and do more. When they get home, they're too tired to help out in their community. This is what's happening with average families in Spain, where I live.\n\nThird, there's a big problem: TELEVISION!!! It's a terrible thing for young people today. They could sit and watch it all day.\n\nIn the end, I think we should try to avoid some things and be more creative with our kids. We should teach them to value being with people.

{"file_id": "1051036.txt", "output_essay": "I strongly believe that everyone has a best moment in their life, but I can't tell if it happens when we are young or old. Usually, I think a person's best moment comes after they have worked hard for a very long time. Then they find out they were right about their life and the goals they worked for. This moment comes when they are tired from their struggles, but they have won. Homer once said that people get more tired of partying than fighting. He meant that people are always struggling, and only those who die see the end of struggles. This is not because they are evil or wild, but because they like to live life fully, facing each day and proving they can win. To me, 'enjoy life' means to join new challenges every day and win in the end. I can't say when the best moment in life is. It could be when we're old or young. What matters is to enjoy that time. Young people often live without worrying about getting old, as De'Medici wrote in his poems. On the other hand, older people carry a lot of knowledge and experience. They think more about what they should do, not just for themselves but for others they care about. In the past, people said, 'Only the good die young,' but this was linked to an old way of seeing the world. Now, with Christian culture leading, we believe that not only youth can be great, but being middle-aged or old can be good too. This time in life is not seen as just the fall season. We can enjoy life at any age, no matter how old we are."}
{"file_id": "1064273.txt", "output_essay": "The way we learn shapes us a lot. I believe knowing about many school subjects is important. It helps when you want to talk to others. Sharing ideas and thoughts is key. For example, at work, if someone needs to work with a different team, it's easier if they know a bit about what that team does. Even a little knowledge is good and the other team will like it. Also, in our personal lives, it's nice to be able to talk or debate when we meet someone new. Without knowing many things, how would we start talking? We would miss the chance to connect with people. I think knowing a lot is a big plus; it means we can fit in almost anywhere we go. But, we can't just know a little about many things. We also need to know a lot about one thing. This keeps us excited and gives us a goal. To get a specific job, you need to know a lot about that job's topic. That's why we start learning about many things and then, over time, we focus on what we want to do. Also, it's good for us to really get into something. It shows we can do something unique that shows who we are. In the end, we need both. We need to learn about the world to talk to others. But we also need to know a lot about one thing to say, 'I can help you with this; I am good at this.'"}
{"file_id": "1061931.txt", "output_essay": "Old people often say they are too old and tired. Young people, on the other hand, are usually active and busy. This is common in families with grandparents and children. But I believe the truth is different. When old people talk about their health, they might just want to say they are still here. They might not feel as bad as they say. Being old can mean being alone a lot. This can make you think too much about how you feel. For example, if you think your foot hurts, it might start to hurt for real. This is because our minds are powerful. I have sometimes thought I was sick, but I wasn't. This can happen to anyone. If you are old and sit all day, you might not have much to talk about with visitors. Now, about young people. It's not good when they complain about their age. They might think they are sick, but they are not. They are just growing up. Every age has its own joys. When you are old, you remember being young. When you are young, you have energy and the world is waiting for you. We should think about what we have done and what will happen tomorrow. Life is unpredictable. We should not get bored if it doesn't go our way. Life is what it is, and so is getting older."}
{"file_id": "1066982.txt", "output_essay": "I somewhat agree with this idea. I believe that knowing a lot about many things is very good. If you are willing to learn and can talk about different subjects, you can find more chances and be less affected by job market changes. For example, if there are big economic problems in a certain work area, you can switch jobs more easily and quickly than people who only know one thing very well. But workers, including bosses and those with big jobs, must also know a lot about one area. I think that the job market today needs people who know a lot about one thing. But it also needs people who can share what they know with others. This sharing can help make money by working together. So, I think that while you are studying, you should learn about as many areas as you can. In my opinion, it makes sense to get better at one special skill after you finish school (or in the last year of school). By doing this, you can handle changes because you know a lot about many things. But you will also be very good at one thing, which can make you the best worker in a certain place at a certain time. For example, workers who don't know much might have trouble if their company changes its plans. Or, they might have even bigger problems if the market changes a lot. This could make what they do not needed anymore or bring in new 'killer products'. So, to be a good choice for jobs, you need to know a lot about one thing. But to be safe from job market changes, you need to know about many things. You also need to keep getting better at what you know after school. This is called 'lifelong learning'. I think this is the best way to be in today's world."}
{"file_id": "1067011.txt", "output_essay": "Some people think that young people have more fun than older people. Others think that older people enjoy life more. When deciding who has more fun, many would say that young people do because they have more energy. I believe this too and will talk about a few key reasons why young people have more fun. The main reason I think this is that young people are just starting their lives and they have more chances to do things. For example, my father has many things to worry about, but my brother doesn't. My father has to think about his family before doing something new. My brother, on the other hand, can go out at night without worrying and he doesn't have to earn money for the family. Another point is that people are different. They act differently, have different habits, and think differently. Some older people like to stay home, while others go out more than they did when they were younger. This is also true for young people. Some young people have big responsibilities, but others don't. Young people can choose what they want to do. When they have choices, they can take them and enjoy them. It's hard to say who has more fun because people are different. Some are very emotional, others are very serious, and don't get upset by small things. In summary, even though young people may have trouble picking a career, they have more chances to enjoy life. But this doesn't mean older people don't have fun. They do, sometimes even more than young people."}

It's easy to see why they might believe this in countries where people focus on themselves. But I don't agree that people today don't spend enough time helping their communities. I believe that today's societies have more ways for people to help out indirectly. For example, in France, the social security system lets workers help those who need health care by paying taxes. This might not seem like it's about young people, but they do help indirectly. When they study hard to get good jobs, they will later add to the country's wealth. Some say that governments don't do enough for those who need personal help, like the elderly who need someone to care for them. There aren't enough volunteers for this. Some blame young people for not helping. But we should also see who is trying to make things better. People have gotten used to the government handling social problems. So, we should appreciate those who try to make the government pay attention to these issues by voting, protesting, or being involved in politics. In the end, there are many ways to help a community. In different places and cultures, there are young people who do help by studying hard or by voting."}

Ads tell us how to choose what to buy. It's hard to think about life without ads. But do ads always help us? I don't think so. Many ads make things look way better than they are. Ads make things look so good that people buy more. But when they use the product, it's not as good as the ad said. Most ads show things as much better than they are. For example, some ads for medicine say it will stop pain and heal sickness fast. People in pain or sick will buy the medicine because they trust the ad. But these ads are not telling the whole truth. Even if you use the medicine right, it won't fix your problems as the ad said. Also, to get more people to buy, ads might lie to make things look better. My friends have told me they bought expensive makeup because of ads. But when they used it, it didn't help at all. Some even hurt their skin. I must say these ads are not careful. They only show the best cases but don't give a fair and true description of the product. I know some ads are honest and show the product well, but I think there are very few like that.

It's harder for older people to move around. I believe old people might like doing things at home or nearby alone, but it's not the same as having fun with others. My grandpa lives alone and says he likes taking care of his small trees and walking his dog. But he doesn't look really happy. I wouldn't have much fun without friends.

They have to answer questions right away and be correct. But some jobs don't need you to know everything about many subjects. For example, lab workers making the same drug over and over don't need to know all of chemistry. So, simple or repeat jobs don't need you to know a lot about many things.

{"file_id": "1066392.txt", "output_essay": "I think it's more important for students to get the meaning of ideas and concepts than to just memorize facts. Here are some reasons why I believe this is true. First, knowing how ideas and concepts work helps someone really get it and use it in real life. Let's look at an electric motor. If you don't understand how it works, you can't make motors in different sizes for different uses. If someone only knew facts about motors, we wouldn't have the fun things that small motors do. Think about the motors that make car windows go up and down, or the ones in robots and precise tools. Next, if you understand a concept, you can think of new ways to use it or mix it with other ideas to create new, exciting things. For example, a machine that turns printed words into computer text is made by combining many ideas. It uses scanning to see the words and then pattern matching to recognize the letters by their shape. Just knowing facts doesn't lead to this kind of new idea. Still, facts are useful. They help us picture things and understand them better. For instance, knowing about the big Saturn rocket that went to the Moon, how much fuel it used, and the new inventions needed for the trip helps us see how big the project was. But we can see that facts just give us a way to look at things. The real value is in understanding the ideas that make things work. In the end, it's much more important for students to grasp ideas and concepts than to only know facts, even though facts are important too."}

People get news faster, the world seems smaller, and many things are connected. So, we need people who know a lot about different things; they should understand more than just one part of a topic and know about many subjects. \n\nLearning about many subjects teaches people different ways to fix problems. It helps them see things from many angles. Each class teaches a different way to solve issues. For example, in Geometry, you use shapes, lines, and curves to solve problems. In a Data class, you use careful thinking to answer questions. This means when people face a problem, they can think of many ways to solve it. \n\nKnowing a lot about different subjects can make people sure of themselves. They know about many topics. They can talk about many ideas with others. Imagine a student at a party. If they know about many subjects, they can talk to people who study different things. But if someone only knows about one subject, it's hard to find things to talk about. This can make them feel left out and less sure of themselves. \n\nIn the end, it's better to know about many subjects than just one. It can make people's knowledge and views wider.

In some Asian countries, they don't get vacations at all. They are very dedicated to their families. Even if they complain, they wouldn't give up their life. They sometimes like being able to take care of their family and give their kids a better life. They find joy in this every day.\n\nYoung people naturally enjoy their time.

Young people often waste time more than older people. But if young people use their time well, they have a better chance to really have fun.\n\nIn the end, the main thing about this topic is not how much time you have, but how well you use it.

{"file_id": "1062900.txt", "output_essay": "Ads are usually made by a team of people with different jobs and skills. These people get paid by businesses that want to make more money. If they don't help the business make more money, they could lose their jobs. I think this shows that ads often make products look better than they really are.\n\nFirst, when a business spends money on ads, it wants to get more money back. Ads cost a lot. So, they want more people to buy their product to make more profit.\n\nThis is why the people who make ads try to get more customers than other businesses. They try to show their products as the best ones to buy. They need to make people think that buying their product is the smart choice.\n\nSecond, the people who make ads have different skills. They know a lot about how to sell things and who they are selling to.\n\nFor example, I was in the library a few days ago. I heard some boys and girls talking about a project on how to sell a product. They didn't care about how good the product was. They only cared about how to sell it. They wanted to find the best way to make people want to buy it and didn't worry about being honest.\n\nAlso, I can share my own story. I have a younger sister who is eleven. She always wants things she sees in ads. Sometimes my mom buys these things for her. They can be expensive, but often they're not very good. This happens a lot with things for kids or teenagers. They don't care much about quality. They care about how the thing looks.\n\nIn conclusion, I think ads are often just ways for businesses to make more money or to make their brand known.

Knowing many things doesn't always help you fix a specific issue. In my country, for example, lots of people can use a computer. But only a few know how to fix certain computer problems by themselves. This is why many computer companies hire people from places like India. This isn't good for our people because they often can't find work.\n\nThis is just one reason why being an expert in one thing can be good for a country's money matters. Workers need to know many things to be able to change jobs if they have to. Losing a job is a big problem in our country. But I believe that if a country has experts in many areas, it can be very good for the economy. However, it is risky for people to focus on one thing because they might not find work in their field.\n\nBut as I mentioned, being an expert has many benefits. Still, we should think about how big a company is and what it can do. A large company has many workers. Each one can take care of a problem on their own. If they need to know something else, they can ask another expert. By working together, they can fix almost any problem. Things are different in small companies. They can't hire many workers.

When she wears something, I want to buy it too, just from the picture. But when I go to the store, it doesn't look good on me. My friends have had the same problem. So, ads often look better than the real thing. This happens in other situations too. People want things that famous people like artists or actors use. Companies know this and advertise everywhere. We see ads on TV, radio, in newspapers, and on buses. For example, on TV shopping shows, the person is happy with what they bought. Or, store workers or famous people say the products are great. This makes viewers want to buy them. But we can't be sure until we try the products ourselves. Also, store workers say things are cheap or come with free gifts, but only for a short time. They make the products seem better. The better they present them, the more we want to buy. So, I agree with the statement."}

I believe this because I've had to cram lots of facts for a test, and after the test, I forget them all. My friends have the same problem. However, when we learn the idea behind the fact, we remember it forever. Often, when I talk about history or chemistry, I share ideas that I've learned over time. I explain things I understand because I know the ideas behind them. This is why I agree with the idea that understanding concepts is better than knowing facts. Facts might be useful for a short time, but ideas stay with you always."}

First, I know many boys and girls who aren't happy every day. They seem to need more; they can't be happy with their activities. Everything is a problem for them: marriage, kids, work. I know we're in tough times with bad politics and economy, and there's war. But I wonder: how are today and the past different? My dad told me about World War II, his struggle to find food, and then work. He passed away three years ago, but I think he was happier than many young people today. Now, about marriage. I see many people choose divorce over fixing their issues. I don't really get this. To me, having a family makes life better, but maybe I'm wrong. Many people I know don't agree. They like to be alone or go out until 5 or 6 a.m. They don't want a family until they're 35 or 37. Maybe I'm the one not enjoying life enough. I try to put passion and love into everything I do, even more since I've been on my own. I have no parents now, but I find that if I'm good to others, I'm not alone."}
{"file_id": "1071692.txt", "output_essay": "I agree that successful people try new things and take risks instead of just doing what they already know. Think about Einstein, a scientist. He tried his experiment sixteen times and failed every time. But he didn't give up. He tried a seventeenth time and succeeded. He became very famous. Many people keep trying until they succeed. Look at today's technology and new ideas. Long ago, if someone wanted to make power, they couldn't. But Edison, another scientist, made a special kind of water turbine. He wasn't successful at first. But he kept trying and took big risks. He won a big award from an American group. I don't agree with people who only do what they know. God gave us the ability to learn more. We should use it to make new things. If we only do what we know, we won't change or get anything new. We should try new things, even if they are hard. When we get past the hard parts, we might find success. Think about Newton. He didn't know he would be famous for science. An apple fell on him while he was sitting under a tree. He wondered why it fell. This made him discover the laws of motion. In the end, I think if a person takes risks and overcomes challenges instead of doing the same old things, he will find success."}

They only have fun at certain times, like when family visits them.\n\nFirst, young people go to college. At college, they don't just study. They also do fun things. They hang out in the cafeteria with friends. Older people don't get to do this.\n\nSecond, young people are full of life and have fun playing sports like badminton and cricket. Playing sports also helps them stay healthy.\n\nIn nice neighborhoods, there are groups that meet every month. Young people join these groups and help put on big events. They might organize sports or music shows. They play in these sports and try to make others happy at these events.\n\nColleges close for long breaks at the end of the year. This is a great time for young people to make plans and have a lot of fun. They can travel to see family and spend time with them. Young people also like to watch movies. They find movies exciting and have a good time watching them.\n\nWhen you think about all these things, it's clear that young people have a lot more fun than older people.

I believe this might be true for some, but not for many others who really work hard to help where they live. It's true that our society is getting more self-centered. This means more people only think about themselves. They ignore the needs and problems of others in their community. This is especially true for young people. They are growing up in a world where personal success is very important. What job a person has, how much money they make, the comfort of their home, their car, their clothes, and other things they own are now more important than how they act towards others and where they live. But it's not right to say all young people are like this. Many young people do help their communities in different ways. Some volunteer to help people with various problems. These problems can include helping those with disabilities, immigrants, children with cancer, and old people who are alone. Some even go to far places in Asia, Africa, and South America. They join groups that help with big problems that affect millions. These problems can be natural disasters, wars, and widespread diseases. In conclusion, because of the way society is today, some young people forget to care for others and their communities.

I believe this because I use this way of learning all the time when I study and at work. I often use things I learned in my first years of college, like biology and chemistry, even though I don't use them much in my job. Also, when students get ideas, they can connect them to other things. This helps them understand new things or come up with ideas about things they don't know yet. This is key in making new ideas or in the growth of science and engineering. It also helps society get better. The more students understand, the better they do in school and work later. But, if students just memorize facts, it's harder for them to see how things are linked. This is because they might not see a clear link.

Trying new things helps them learn about life. They get many chances to have fun by trying different things. Young people are strong and can do outdoor activities easily. For example, older people might need to plan a lot to go camping. But young people can go on a camping trip without much planning because they are young and like adventure. Young people also have time to take chances. Older people often don't like to take risks. But young people can take big risks. They know they have time to fix things if something goes wrong. This lets them push their limits and have a lot of fun. It's true that young people are busy. But they don't need a lot of free time to have fun. They can have fun at work, at home, or with friends. They don't have to wait until they are old to enjoy life. Enjoying life often costs money. Older people might have saved money to have fun. But young people often have more money to spend on fun things. In the end, everyone should enjoy life at any age. But young people should really make the most of this chance. They have everything they need to have the best time."}

First, I want to say that statements like this are not always completely true or false. Before I talk about my view, I want to focus on a specific place or culture. I will talk about my own country. Communities change as society changes. These changes bring challenges for people of all ages. At the start of the 21st century, there were big changes in jobs, especially in skilled work, and in technology. Many jobs were sent to Asian countries, and factories moved to the Far East. This made many young people in Europe and my country jobless. In the past, communities were rich and jobs were secure. People had welfare and free time for family or social activities. Now, young people struggle to make enough money to live as they used to. I agree that they help their communities less. It makes sense that they spend a lot of time looking for jobs or working more than one job. They don't have time or energy to help their community. Activities like charity work or taking care of a family member or neighbor have to wait. Young people with money problems can't do these things. Only the lucky ones who don't need to worry about money can help."}
{"file_id": "1076556.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with this statement. I think that successful people are only successful because they once faced a hard time and had to take a chance to win. People who only do what they are good at will stay 'good,' but they won't win if they don't take chances and meet new hard times.\n\nTrying new things and getting past new hard times is what makes a person successful, I believe. For instance, if someone is really good at a sport and people think he's skilled, it's not enough to call him 'successful.' He must compete with others, get better, risk getting hurt or losing, and get even better to move ahead and be successful. If he didn't risk losing to better players and getting past them, he would never know how good he really is.\nAnother example is starting a new business. If a business owner doesn't risk losing some money to start the business, he won't be able to recover his loss and make more money. It's not just important for someone to meet new hard times to get better, but also to move ahead and see how he does compared to others or any competition.\n\nMeeting new hard times and taking chances is the only way a person can win in life. Talent matters, but it's not the only thing that leads to success. All the famous athletes, business people, and stars have met many hard times and got past them no matter how skilled they were, and that's what made them successful."}
{"file_id": "1076677.txt", "output_essay": "I kind of agree that \"young people have more fun than older people.\" Young people have fun by playing with friends, watching new movies, going to school, and joking with younger kids. Older people have fun by staying at home, talking with others, and visiting holy places. Young people today really enjoy themselves. Take my brother, for example. He has a great time. He rides his bike to school, hangs out with friends in the evening, talks about movies, and then visits a friend's house to laugh about the day's events. After that, he comes home, eats well, and sleeps. Older people, like my grandmother, are busy too. She spends her day talking with friends, which she finds fun. She watches old religious movies and visits holy places like Tirupati and Shirdi. She eats what she likes and spends money as she wants. I believe young and old people both have a lot of fun, but in different ways that suit their age. A normal teenager going to school or work lives well, thinking they won't be young again. Older people want to make the most of their later years, so they do what they enjoy, and friends their age join in. So, I kind of agree with the statement."}

What I'm trying to say is that the world is now very competitive because of how connected it is. I believe that to do well in this tough race, you need to be very good at your chosen field of study. You can only become an expert in a subject by focusing on it, not just by knowing a little about many different subjects. I don't really like the saying 'Jack of all trades but master of none.'\n\nI want to make it clear that it's better to know a lot about one subject than a little about many. Let's look at an example. A company will likely choose someone with a master's degree in Chemical Engineering over someone with a lower degree in chemical engineering and another in biological engineering. Even if the company hires the person with two lower degrees for his mixed skills, he will probably get a lower job and earn less money than the person with the master's degree. But, if the person with the lower degrees also had a degree in management and the company needed someone with management skills, then it might be a different story.\n\nIn short, in today's world, having a specialized education is more valued in the job market."}

Trying new things and looking at problems in different ways can help lower the chance of failing. This is because it helps come up with answers to problems. It's also good to know a lot about a subject to avoid unnecessary risks and keep things stable.\n\nAt the start, the people leading a project need to look at it from all sides. Their ability to do this well depends on how much they know from past experiences. The best way to learn more is to try new things and be willing to make mistakes. This is how they find new answers. Just watching is not as good as doing things and learning from them.\n\nAlso, every day, people meet new people and face new situations. These are all different. When things go wrong, what they already know can help a little. If a problem has many unknown parts, changing one part can change the outcome. Like our bodies fight off germs better after the first time, our knowledge helps us handle problems better the next time.\n\nMoreover, people sometimes look for new experiences to make their lives better and feel refreshed. A life with just eating and sleeping is not enough. It's not just how long you live, but how you live that matters. Some people don't take risks because they don't want to change who they are. They stick to what they know. But people should be different from plants. They should try new things and live differently.\n\nIn the end, we can see that experience is very important.

It's hard to think that people will have the chance to drive cars. Many important people and leaders are trying to clean the environment. But this is just the start of a big change in the twenty-first century. There are many big changes and protests to save the Earth now. \n\nIn our daily life today, everyone needs a car. I say a car because in rich and growing countries, every 2 to 8 people have one. In the past, a car was a luxury or a sign of wealth. But now, everyone uses fancy cars even when they don't need to. New car designs come out very quickly. Car makers in many countries make a lot of money and get very rich. \n\nCars are not the only cause of pollution, but they are the biggest problem. The 'National Geographic Channel's magazine' wrote about the bad effects of more cars this century. They add a lot to pollution. It's shocking that cars cause 42 percent of pollution. Some powerful countries like China are changing laws to protect the environment. They make sure people follow these laws. This could make it hard for car makers in the future. In Venice, which is very clean, people don't use cars at all. \n\nMaybe someone will invent a car that doesn't harm the environment. If that happens, we might start using that car. But it's not likely that we will drive cars as much in the future. This is because of nature, the dirty environment, and health problems caused by cars. Car makers who have made a lot of money might face a difficult future. We need to quickly solve the problems of pollution and health risks from cars.

So, they have to come up with smart ways to get people to notice and like their products. This means they need to promote, and that includes ads. Ads help a company show off its product and its good points. I really feel like the product is almost always shown in a way that's too good to be true. The best ways to show ads are on big signs in the streets that use pictures, and on TV, which uses pictures and sounds. If you see an ad on TV and you're the person it's meant for, you might end up buying the thing. By doing this, the person who made the ad has partly won. He doesn't want you to be unhappy, but often, you are. I think about this trick when I see ads for McDonald's. Doesn't the food look so good? But what you actually get is not the same."}

That's why I don't agree with them. I will tell you more about why I think this way in the next part. I think they are wrong. Many young people do help older folks when they need it.

An ad is a way to sell what a company makes. It needs to make the product look good so people will want to buy it. For instance, if you're selling cookies, you want lots of people to buy them. You need to make the cookies stand out. You might use special tricks to make the cookies look more colorful or suggest the best way to eat them. This means you can't just show the cookies as they are. You have to make them look better than they are. Ads can also fool kids. Take a toy transformer ad. It shows the transformer flying. But we know that's not real. The transformer toy can't fly. So, kids might feel let down when the toy doesn't match the ad. This is one more way ads make things look better than they are. Also, because companies always try to beat each other, they use ads to get ahead. They might care more about how good the ad is than how good the product is.

{"file_id": "1073932.txt", "output_essay": "People often say that young people should have fun while they can. This suggests that older people don't have as much fun, or at least not as much as the young. We will look at both sides of this idea and give our opinion at the end. Young people have less to worry about than older ones: older people have to take care of the young! For instance, you don't often see parents playing pranks on their neighbor with firecrackers, but it's common for young people to do it. Young people don't have to work to support their family; they go to school and do many activities; they are young and have fun because they have less to worry about. But this is what young people think. Do older people really have less fun than young people? No, they don't. For example, having a family and kids is fun, maybe the most fun thing ever! If older people had less fun, the world would be very sad. So, some young people don't have fun, and some older people do. The idea can't be right because of this simple reason. If older people didn't have as much fun as the young, would life be worth living? If life isn't fun, then it has no main goal, and living would be pointless. I believe the idea is what young people think and they haven't really thought it through. At first, it seems right, but actually, what we find fun changes as we get older! It's rare for a 13-year-old to love reading poetry, but at 65, it can be loved and understood because the person has more life experience. I think the way we have fun is different, but no one has more fun than anyone else because of their age. Having fun is for everyone and doesn't depend on age. Young people have as much fun as older people, and the other way around."}

For example, in college, there are different areas like Engineering, Business, Teaching, Music, Medicine, and more. Each area focuses on a different kind of knowledge, like Math, Biology, Languages, Politics, and so on. There are many choices. A person can't know everything about everything. They can only know a little about many things. If someone spends their life studying space, doing research, and working on projects, they will learn a lot in that area. They will know more than someone who studies many subjects a little bit. There's not enough time in life to learn about many subjects deeply. In school, kids learn the basics.

On weekends, I like to have fun or spend time with my parents or boyfriend. But 30 years ago, things were different. Many young people had jobs in factories or helped at home. They had strict rules, like going to church every day, helping old people, and doing things for others in their town. My dad grew up in a big family. He worked in his parents' shop, at a big company, and went to church. He also got into politics when he was 18. By 25, he was the youngest leader in the country. Today, not many young people help their communities. Usually, only those who need it to be happy do it. It's their dream. I know some who help out. They often study things like psychology or social work. I've helped my town a lot. I've worked at festivals, in church, with moms and kids, and on trips to the mountains with kids.

We need different knowledge for different times. This makes life simpler. Here's an example. I'm a student and I don't usually need to know about economics. But if I want to work at a bank, the boss might ask me about interest rates during an interview. If I don't know this, I won't get the job.

{"file_id": "1084466.txt", "output_essay": "I partly agree with this statement because while we need to try new things to be successful, we also must become very good at what we do to achieve it. Trying new things has several benefits. First, it's hard to succeed in a field where others have worked for a long time. For example, making shoes is a well-known process, and those in the business know how to make good shoes cheaply. Second, change happens in all parts of life, and those who don't take risks to try new things will fall behind those who do. If a shoemaker only uses leather and won't learn about other materials, they will eventually have to stop working. The most important reason to try new things is that it can bring together what we know with what we learn. We often separate the world into different parts, but we can find useful links between them. However, many successful people in history focused on one area, like military leaders, artists, shoemakers, and athletes. They became the best by getting better at their skills and learning more, which takes a lot of work. So, the level of skill needed for success keeps getting higher. The first man had to try new things, but he also had to get better at them to survive. If he hadn't, we wouldn't be here. There are always new things to discover that could help people.

{"file_id": "1064740.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with the idea that it is very important for students to understand ideas and concepts. I have three reasons for this. First, students need to understand ideas and knowledge when they first learn them. This helps them learn better than just remembering facts. Also, understanding helps students remember what they learned before. If learning was just about saying and remembering, a computer would be a better student. Second, my teachers always said that students should learn 'how to learn,' not just get knowledge. I think the true goal of education is to teach students how to think and solve new problems they will face later. My high school is not a good example. There, even though teachers said learning how to learn was important, they focused too much on remembering. This showed in the tests. To get good grades, we just had to remember the facts. What's worse, we had to study so fast that we had no time to think about the ideas. Because of this, I can only remember a little of what I learned from high school books. Third, understanding and thinking about what we learn is how our cultures have grown from the start! It's how we learn from people before us and make new ideas. Imagine if all students did not learn to understand and think; what would our future society look like?! In short, I believe it is not just important but also essential for students to understand ideas and think more about what they learn."}

The ads use facts to show the perfect skateboard. But buyers may be sad when they find out it's not so perfect after buying it. Look at Kraft's dinner ads. They show happy kids and moms, saying it's a healthy and easy meal. But it's clear that Kraft's dinners are not healthy or tasty. Ad makers know that pretty packaging sells. That's why they use bright colors and nice designs. They also use photos of beautiful women or handsome men to make you want to buy the product. You might think you'll be like the model if you buy it. But the product might not be great. In the end, I think ad companies know what people wish for and make ads that show all these wishes. They suggest a way for people to fulfill their dreams. But not all dreams come true."}

I think the number of cars will go up, even if the technology in them changes. As more people are born, they need more things. Today, having a car is becoming a basic need. New technology has made it possible for many people to buy their own car. Car prices are the lowest they've ever been, and they will keep getting cheaper as technology gets better. This will make even more people buy cars soon because they can pay for them. In the past, only the person who made money for the family had a car. Now, even kids and other family members have their own cars for what they need to do. Also, two-seat cars are popular now. This means a family of four that shares one car today might use two two-seat cars later. Plus, cars pollute less than buses or three-wheelers. Cars that run on electricity or solar power are being made. These cars don't cost much and can help reduce pollution. Governments will likely support this. But, more cars will make traffic worse. So, I really think that in the future, more cars will be used. This will make traffic problems bigger, but pollution might go down."}

Young people have to work hard on their studies, build their skills, and get better to keep up with new jobs. But, it's also true that some people care a lot about others, and many of these caring people are young. The world is complex, and it's hard to reach personal goals. People must work very hard. They have no time to rest, stop, and think about other people's problems. Life is hard, and they need to find their place in today's world. People aim for success, want to show their value, and try to be the best. They have to study, then get a good job, and make it in this tough world. Then they are too tired to do anything else. They know they don't have much time. But, things are changing now. Today, many young people want to help their communities more. They join in different events and groups. Many people work in jobs that help others for free. Our time shows that there are people who want to help and work together. I think we are starting to see a new type of person who is very responsible about social issues and feels for others' troubles."}

First, ads should just tell us what a thing does, how good it is, and if it comes with a promise. Ads that use fancy tags and boxes should stop. They make us pay more for the packaging, which costs a lot. Because of this, regular people can't buy these things, even though they need them every day. Next, ads have famous people say good things about the product. These stars get paid a part of the money from sales. Also, ads draw in buyers with nice pictures and cartoons. This makes the things look more exciting than they are. Kids like these a lot, and this makes their parents buy for them. Shiny stickers on the products also make them look better. All this makes the price of the thing go up. So, I believe that these kinds of ads do make products look much better than they are."}

Most people think of working with the Red Cross or similar well-known groups. But I believe any action that makes someone's day better is valuable. For instance, helping at a sports game or watching your neighbor's kids is helpful. This lets your neighbors take a break and do things they like. These days, many young folks have lots of hobbies. They're busy and don't want to give up their free time. They're not as eager to help as they used to be. You can tell because many groups need more young volunteers. Money is another issue. Young people might not get paid for helping, and money is very important to them. Why should they give their time for just a thank you? That doesn't seem worth much to them. I'm sure many young people have time to help, but they're just not interested. Yet, helping others can give you a lot. If parents helped in the community, their kids might want to help too. I mostly agree that young people don't want to help without getting paid. But some still give their time and don't care about money. I know some who raised money to buy toys for kids. I've watched kids at events so parents could have fun without worrying about their kids."}

This makes you look good and can help you make friends or learn more. It's also good because you can get a great job that pays well. Big companies want smart people who understand things well. If you know what these companies need, you can get a solid job. Like, knowing how to use a computer and different programs can get you a job with good pay and job security.

Usually, we can enjoy our trips in two ways: either travel on our own with a tour guide or join a group with a guide. I prefer to travel alone to fully enjoy my trip. Why do we love to travel? Different cultures, history, art, and buildings draw us to leave our homes and dive into the fun of traveling. Can you picture arriving at a place with many people and having a guide set your schedule? How can we really understand another culture in just a few days or minutes? I believe it's important to plan carefully, learn about the place before we go, and stay there for a few weeks. This way, we can start to feel the spirit of the place. Then, I won't regret the time spent on my trip. Sure, traveling with a group and a guide has its good points. For example, I won't have to worry about finding a cheap place to stay; I won't need to learn about the local ways, history, and culture—the guide will tell us all about it. But, I would have to pay the guide and their company a lot of money, even if it's not worth it, just because I'm too lazy. I can look up information about the place online, talk to the owner about renting a place, and even negotiate the price. To me, these things are also fun parts of traveling. So, I have more fun planning the trip myself. Also, I like to travel with my partner. So, I wouldn't want to go with a group because we wouldn't have much privacy. Based on what I've said, I don't think traveling in a group with a guide is the best way, for the reasons I've mentioned."}

I also think ads make things look better than they really are. Here are three main reasons why ads might not be honest.\n\nFirst, ads want to make you buy things. They try to make you feel like you need the product or it's the best out there. To do this, they often show the product in the best way possible. This can lead to ads giving wrong information.\n\nSecond, ads are made to help sell more and make more money. The people who make products want to earn as much as they can. They might use ads that don't show the real product. This can make more people buy it. When more people buy, the company makes more money.\n\nThird, ads help a company be the best in the market. Companies are always trying to do better than others. An ad that makes a product look better than another's can help a company win. This means ads are made to make a product look the best, not to tell the truth about it.\n\nIn the end, those who think ads make things look better than they are right. Ads are made to help companies make more money. A company won't tell the truth if it means they will make less money."}
{"file_id": "1076604.txt", "output_essay": "Can we say that successful people are the ones who try new and risky things instead of doing things the usual way? I think so. There are different ways to try new things: starting a product that makes people want something they didn't before, and making small changes to how a business works. Successful people don't always have to start a big change. Even small changes can be a big risk. First, let's look at big changes. When we look at the business world, it's clear that many leaders have made very profitable products. These products have sometimes started a new chapter for their company. This is what happened with Apple when Steve Jobs decided to launch the iPod. He didn't just keep selling Mac computers. He took a risk with a new product. And he did very well. His iPod changed how people listen to music. It changed some cultural habits in America and then all over the world. It made people want his new product. Starbucks also changed things. They changed how people drink their coffee. People used to sit in a cafe. Now they walk in the street with their coffee! At first, it was a big risk. It meant changing how people live. But it was worth it because Starbucks became very successful. Next, let's talk about small changes to how a business works. These can also be a big risk. But they can pay off. For example, Dell made a new way to sell computers. Customers could order their computers piece by piece. This was a big success."}

People who do well usually try new things and risk more than just sticking to what they know. This is why some people who invest money do really well these days. People prefer to try new products and looks they haven't seen before instead of just the same old thing again and again. \n\nInvestors want to make a lot of money from their businesses. To make customers feel excited, a business has to change often. If a business sells things for the home like freezers and microwaves, and then it starts selling phones and computers, customers will see the business in a new way. They used to think the business only sold home appliances. Now, customers don't have to go to different stores to buy freezers and computers if they want both at the same time. \n\nBusiness people should also like to risk. Risking doesn't always mean something bad. People ready to risk are more likely to do well. New ideas can make customers think differently. We can't always know what customers want. If a business surprises them, they will probably think highly of it. For example, in fashion, designers sometimes risk if they have a very new idea for clothes. They aren't sure if people will like it. But even if people don't like it, the designer tried. \n\nThere are two simple ways to do well: trying new things and risking. We see this in almost every great investor in the world. Without these ways, they might not be as successful as they are now."}

It's hard to get a job, so someone who can do a lot of things has a better chance. The economy and jobs want you to be a good worker with many different experiences. My view isn't completely right; I know that it's also key for someone to do their job well. This can happen even if they only know one area well. So, I believe it's good to know about many areas when looking for a job. But, after you get the job, you should focus on that area. Sometimes, you don't need a full degree.

Makers don't want to show the bad parts of their products in ads. Instead, they try hard to show the good parts and hide the bad parts. So, in ads, products only have good points. For example, a medicine ad will only say what illness it can treat and not talk about the bad side effects. This can hurt some customers who are affected by these bad parts. Second, to sell more, makers make the product's abilities seem bigger in ads. The products look much better in ads. For example, water with minerals is healthy. But some makers say this water can cure diseases, which is not true. Third, an ad is also a product. The ad maker must make the product look great to please the product maker. This means the ad must show the product as even better than it really is. From this, we can say that products in ads are not the same as in real life. Their abilities are made to seem bigger in ads. So, the government should step in to help customers know the real facts about products."}

I have seen many young people ignore social and community needs. Young people spend most of their time on fun things like parties, video games, and talking, or on studying for tests. They do not think about the local problems that need solutions. For example, at our school, there is a big problem with water that stands still. It is a perfect place for mosquitoes to grow. These mosquitoes can make people sick. But the students, who could get sick too, do not seem to care. If we do not take this seriously, it could get worse. Young students could help if they wanted to. There are also problems like teaching poor workers and their children. These workers build new buildings on campus. Young students could teach these people for free. This could help the children have a better future. But so far, young people have done nothing. Young people often do not listen to older people's advice. They do what they think is right. Helping communities is not what they choose to do. From what I have seen in my hostel, most young people, including me, prefer to have fun. We go to bars and restaurants, talk a lot, or just study our courses. We do not spend time on social or community work."}

They prefer to spend time on fun activities like playing video games and watching TV. Young people often don't help their communities enough. With new technology, there are many exciting things to do. Young people are curious and want to try many things, including bad habits like smoking and drinking. Older generations valued their communities more because they were taught to care for where they lived. Now, people focus more on having fun and forget to help their communities. We learned in school to look after our surroundings, but many have forgotten what this really means. Keeping our community clean and orderly is everyone's job. But many young people don't understand why this is important. When asked to help, they often react badly, thinking it's a waste of time. If young people don't change, our society could suffer when they grow up. But there is hope. Schools are making students do community service before they graduate. This is a good start. Schools also teach about protecting the environment. I believe these efforts are starting to make a difference in young people's thinking. We must remember that Earth is our home. We all own it. So, while we enjoy life, we should also help our community. Our community is for us and our children. Even a little help can improve society. We must leave a clean and healthy world for our kids."}

But now, the simple message of an old sign announcing a new KFC has been lost in the strong push of selling more and more.\n\nNowadays, an ad that just tells you what a product is wouldn't get noticed. It wouldn't make people want to buy it. In today's world, where many brands are good, ads have to be better than the others. This was something only the companies used to worry about. But now, it means making the product look better than it is.\n\nAds are all about beating the competition. This has led to a point where making a product look better is normal. A good example is an ad I saw recently. It said there was a 'mansion surrounded by plants,' but the real place was just a small two-bedroom apartment. It was nothing like a mansion. But some ads go too far. The car ads are often the worst. One car seller in New Delhi was stopped from selling for a year because he lied about the car he was selling.\n\nEven though it's clear that these ads are not telling the truth, some people think they are okay. A survey in the United States showed many people don't mind this trend. It shows we've gotten used to it. It's become a big part of ads today. You can see it in the local newspaper. We might not like it, but it looks like it's not going away."}

They have to work hard for their future. So, they don't have much time for hobbies. But older people usually work less or not at all. They can spend more time with family and do things they like. Next, older people have more friends than young people. They have been around longer and have met many people. Being with friends is fun and makes them happy. Lastly, older people have less stress than young people. Many are retired and don't worry about keeping a job or making more money. They did that when they were younger. Now, they think about how to enjoy life. They can travel and visit friends just for fun. But young people still have a lot of work and stress. They can't have as much fun as older people. For example, my dad works over 40 hours a week to pay for my school. He doesn't have much time for fun. But my grandma has lots of time and less stress, so she can have fun with her friends.

This is because ideas lead to facts. Take a scientist, for example. If he didn't try new things, go to new places, and learn new ideas, he wouldn't be able to find a fact that everyone learns.\n\nOften, people respect a fact more than an idea. This is because a fact is sure. You can see it or check it. An idea, on the other hand, can be scary. It's hard to know if it will become a fact or if people will forget it. This is why people like to study subjects with lots of facts more than those with lots of ideas at college.\n\nEvery new car and building begins as an idea. Engineers change it as they like. When they finish, they start the work. Once the work is shown to people, it becomes a fact for those who didn't know the idea before.\n\nIt's not right to say facts aren't important. But I think they are not as important as ideas. A fact comes from a lot of thinking and studying. It's easy to read and learn because it's written down.

People would lose interest in new things. For instance, a school bus takes kids from school to home. The reason for this is to make their trip safe, comfortable, and fun. Really understanding a subject is how you learn about it. It's good to use facts to explain your ideas. But if what you know is only based on facts, you need to make sure they are full and right. When my mother-in-law went to the hospital, we knew she had a big heart attack. Everyone said she was too old to survive. My husband and I wanted to know how to care for her better. So, the doctor explained how the heart works, how a diet high in fat affects the heart and blood vessels, and how this can lead to atherosclerosis. This makes the heart work harder.

Their parents have taught them to be this way. Young people start to think only about themselves when they are little. They cry and do other things to get what they want.

Young people don't spend time helping their communities because of these reasons. I agree it's not all their fault. They can learn to be good kids and good citizens.

They should use most of their time to understand ideas and concepts. This way, they can learn how to use what they know. They will also like learning more. First, students can get better at using their knowledge if they try to understand things. Think about this: a person who really gets how something works will do better with new problems than someone who just learned it by heart. If students know a subject well, they can use their knowledge better. In Japan, people often say we're not good at this. We don't do well in studies compared to countries like the US. The reason is that in Japan, we focus a lot on memorizing for tough tests to get into high school and college. So we don't often get the chance to think deeply about what we learn. But if students really get the ideas, they can get better at using what they know. Next, it's more fun for students to understand problems. They feel happy when they solve a problem or understand an idea. So, they keep learning because it's fun. We all prefer to do things we like. This also makes them better learners. If they have to learn everything by heart, they might give up. I used to hate studying because I had to memorize so much. But in college, I had to think for myself. Now, I enjoy learning.

But this can sometimes lead to acting without thinking about the consequences. Not all young people are like this, but some are. I don't think it's true that young people have more fun than older people. Older people have fun too, just in a different way that young people might not get. This could be because young and old people don't talk much to each other, and they see fun in different ways. For instance, I like to travel and make new friends. I've asked my mom to join me.

I used to feel this way too. When I had a cool new haircut, I thought everyone admired me. This made me happy all night because I felt more confident. But looking back, it was a silly way to have fun. Now, I have fun with my close friends or family. I also like to stay in my room and make websites. Three years ago, I would have laughed at someone who thought this was fun. I would have found it very dull. My parents enjoy a very slow card game called Bezique. I can't see why they find it fun. They also like boat trips. I find the sound of the sea boring. But who knows, maybe in 30 years, I'll like these things too. Maybe I'll start running every morning at sixty. I can't be sure what I'll enjoy. This is true for everyone. So, I think it's impossible to answer the question about what fun is. Each age group has its own way of having fun. You can't compare what one person does to what another does. Fun means something different to each person."}

Then, we tried more new things and got better at them. I think learning new skills is important for success all through life. We should be brave and try new things to do well. This gives us chances to get better and fix mistakes. \n\nTrying new things is good for us because we learn skills that help us later. For example, Bill Gates learned a lot about computers when he was young. He used this to make a new computer system called Windows. This skill helped him become very rich. So, people keep learning new things even when they have jobs. \n\nWhen we try new things, we get better in ways we can't if we just do the same old things. If I read a book I've read before, I won't learn much. It's not helpful. But if I read a new book about improving myself, I might change how I do things. I could think better. Also, trying new things lets us fix our mistakes. We can compare and see that maybe we weren't doing things as well as we thought. So, successful people keep trying new things to find and fix their mistakes. \n\nTo be successful, we shouldn't be afraid to try new things. This can make our lives better in many ways."}

Our technology today is better than it was in the past, and it might get even better soon. Because of this, new things could be made that take the place of cars.\n\nFirst, think about fifty or sixty years ago when more people rode bicycles. Then, when motorcycles came out, people started using them more. Later, when cars came along, fewer people rode motorcycles.\n\nIn twenty years, we might have a new thing that could take over from cars. For example, if someone makes a flying machine that everyone can use, then we might see more of these flying machines and fewer cars.\n\nSecond, what people need changes over time. In twenty years, if there is something cheaper or better than cars, we might have fewer cars. As people want more, a new thing could come along to replace cars, making the number of cars go down.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that in the next twenty years, there will be fewer cars than there are today."}

But now, a lot of young people in these places are working hard to make things better. They help their community by fixing up schools and being part of groups that help others. \n\nFirst, young people want to make their schools better. They work with groups to fix old schools and they help move used books around. They collect old books from different schools and give them to libraries. They also help keep the environment clean. For example, they clean their neighborhoods and plant trees where there are none. \n\nSecond, young people join groups that help old people and those who don't have much money. They put on events, and some groups get money by selling tickets. We see many groups like this that help make things better by holding these events. They raise a lot of money. But the young people don't give the money straight to the old and poor people. They use it to buy clothes and food for them instead. \n\nIn the end, many young people really want to help make their communities and the places they live better. By fixing schools and raising money to help old and poor people, they improve where they live. If more people become aware and join in, we can make our communities even better by doing what these active young people are doing."}

I want to give reasons and examples for why I believe this. First, think about science and technology. For instance, a biology student might not know how to change a simple fuse if they don't know anything about electricity. Also, a tech student should know a little about what medicine to take for small health issues. So, knowing about many subjects is important. Next, if a student only studies the history of their own country, they might not know about important events in the world's history. Then, look at how computers are made. Many people work on different parts. If someone making one part doesn't understand the other parts, they can't make a good computer. Lastly, a science or tech person might struggle in business if they don't know about the stock market. This is true for politics too. If party members only know about their own party, they could lose their jobs if they don't know about other parties. In conclusion, I want to say again that knowing a lot about many subjects is better than only knowing one subject well. This helps a person learn more in general."}

First, I believe that sticking with something for a long time can make a person successful. Take a doctor, for example. He searches for a better way to help his patient feel better. He must weigh the risks and benefits. He should not choose options that are too risky or don't offer enough benefit. He should look for choices that are safe and offer good results. What if the doctor likes to take risks? What will happen in the end? Second, I believe it's more important to care about old things. When you try new things, you might throw away the old ones. But sometimes, the old things you got rid of could bring you a big opportunity. That could happen, right? Third, following that idea might mean we lose our traditions. So we should pay more attention to old things and safe choices. This could lead us to success."}

First, young people have more energy. They can do a lot of things. For example, young people and old people are not the same in health. When my family went to climb Mt. Fuji, the highest mountain in Japan, my sister and I reached the top. But my parents could not. Also, young people are healthier than older people. If they get a health check, we know what the results will be. So, young people should have fun. Second, young people need to try new things. They are young and haven't done much yet.

I will explain my point by talking about the debate on Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution. Just knowing the ideas and concepts doesn't mean we really understand the topic or know what to do about it. When we think about the debate on Article 9, the question is whether to change it or not. Of course, knowing its history, which has made our country peaceful for 60 years, and its goal of giving up war after the sad events of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, is important. But if we only 'understand' that it exists, we can't protect ourselves from the danger of terrorism. What do we need to live? We really need to 'learn' the facts about the Japan we live in now, and what steps we can take to keep peace. What if North Korea fires missiles at Japan? Should we not fight back? Or should we fight with our self-defense forces, even though they don't fit with Article 9? So, knowing ideas and concepts doesn't help us in life. It is too idealistic. It's nice to have, but it doesn't help us. It's not useful. What I am trying to say in this essay is that it's not how important Article 9 is, but learning facts and knowing what to do next that is much more important in our daily lives."}

First, young people can move around easily. They are full of energy. They can go anywhere to enjoy life fully. Older people often have at least one problem that stops them from moving around. They don't have much energy and may have health issues. These issues can keep them at home and make them rely on others. Second, young people are usually busy with school or work. They meet many people and make new friends. They have fun with these friends on weekends and by going on drives. Older people can't do this as much because of health problems. If they are not well, they can't go out, meet friends, or have fun. Also, young people use the latest technology. They learn about it and use it to have fun. Older people may not understand new technology as well. They might not use it to enjoy life. In the end, young people have the energy, chances to make friends, and know-how to enjoy life fully. Older people often don't have these things."}

Sometimes, we took risks to succeed. I think successful people are different from others; they are not afraid of risks, so they try new things. That's why we enjoy new technology products today. If people do the same thing again and again, they won't find out what they are good at. They won't get better. They should try new things when they are young. This way, they can do things as well as others, or even better. For example, imagine you are the vice president of a company. You did a good job, but the president is fired. You want to keep your job or get the top job. You might get fired if you take this risk. But you won't know unless you try. Also, if we are good at something, why not try something harder? This can open up new possibilities for us. If you learn from your mistakes, you won't repeat them. Then you will do better next time. This will help you succeed at work. For example, you work in a store for a long time. You've tried many things and learned a lot. You know how to run a business well. Now you want to start your own store. You need to take risks to make it happen. In conclusion, many people try new things and succeed. This is why our way of life keeps getting better. We can't just stop; if we do, we won't improve."}

Is one way better? Traveling with a group is often cheaper. A local tour guide can give you extra facts about the places you visit. Tour guides do this job every day, so they're good at it. They can give you more and better information than if you plan a trip by yourself. Another thing to think about is meeting people. When you travel with others, you'll likely make new friends. But not everyone will want to talk as much as you do. Also, group trips are about seeing a lot in a short time. But this rush can mean you don't get to enjoy each place fully, like Mt. Rushmore. If you go alone, you have more time. You can stay longer at a place you like or take a day to just relax. Freedom is important when you travel by yourself. But you need to know what you're doing. If you don't have a tour guide, you might get lost or miss out on important things. You can still hire a private guide if you want. All this costs money. In the end, if you want a trip that's both informative and doesn't cost too much, go with a group. But if you want to enjoy your trip and take your time, then traveling alone is better."}

I believe that more cars will be used soon. The first reason is that cars will become cheaper. In the past, having a car was a sign of wealth. But now, it is something people need. Cars are less expensive than they used to be. If this keeps up, in about 5 or 6 years, even regular people will be able to buy a car. So, more people will want to get a car, and the number of cars will grow a lot. The second point is that people think cars are safer than motorcycles. This idea is getting popular in places like India, where there are many motorcycles. If more people start to believe this, they will switch from motorcycles to cars. This will make the number of cars go up. The third point is that cars can carry more people than bikes or scooters. So, those who own bikes or scooters will want to get cars. Also, with the price of gas going up, people will prefer to spend money on a car for group travel instead of using bikes for just one person. Finally, many people see having a car as a status symbol. In today's world, where people like to show off, it won't be surprising to see more cars being bought. So, we can expect to see more cars on the roads all over the world soon."}

For example, if you go to a coffee shop and see many unknown coffees, which one do you pick? You choose the one that looks the best, right? That's what ads do. They make things look good. Ads let us show the best parts of anything. We know nothing is perfect. Everything has bad parts too. But ads can focus on the good and hide the bad. Take cold drinks like cola and Pepsi. They are very popular. But why? We know they are not healthy. Still, they sell a lot everywhere. This is because of ads. Ads hide the bad parts of these drinks and make them popular. Some schools now teach how to make ads. They say making ads is like making art. Art makes things more beautiful. That's what ads do for products. They make them seem better and more beautiful. This makes people want to buy them. An ad doesn't just show us how to present something. It also shows us how to make it look even better. In the end, ads make products seem more valuable and beautiful, and this is why people buy them."}

These goals made me work hard in school and college. I did many things that shaped who I am today. I took chances, like moving from my hometown for a better education. But I kept my goals and kept doing what I was good at, math and science.\n\nI see that people do two things: they take chances and they stick to what they're good at. Take the story of a man who was good at selling TVs. He worked for company 'X' for years. Then he thought he could sell TVs with his own business. So he left his job and started a new company named after his son. It was a big chance he took, but he knew he had options and that he would make it because he was good at his job.\n\nThis story shows how taking chances and using what you know can work together. He knew his strengths and tried new things. My own life has taught me to do the same, as long as it's okay to do so. My life is full of experiences, and I take chances every day to keep living.\n\nI don't agree with the idea that 'Successful people try new things and take risks instead of just doing what they're good at.' People control their actions, and success depends on that. You can succeed by doing what you're good at or by trying new things. Either way, you end up doing what you know.\n\nI know my future is in science, but I also know I need to take chances to reach my dream of becoming a Meteorologist. I have to leave my country, knowing it's for the best. That's the biggest chance I'll take next year. But I also know how to talk to people, make friends, and make the most of every chance I get. Success is close, and you can reach it by trying new things or by doing what you do best."}

For example, you can buy a different product, change it, and sell it. This is riskier; maybe you can't sell the product after you change it.\n\nPeople who do well in my country always try new things to reach their goals. They sometimes fail, but if they succeed, they can earn much more money. Look at the biggest Turkish company. It started as a shoe company. They made shoes and sent them to other countries. They knew how to make good shoes. One day, the owner sold everything he had (his factory, his business, his car, etc.) and bought land to grow onions. He knew nothing about growing onions or selling them. It was like a big risk. He met a farmer from the countryside who taught him how to grow onions and how to sell them. They also made small onion packs, like 1-pound and 3-pound packs, and sold them straight to stores. This way was better and helped customers more. Now, the man who used to make shoes has large onion farms and makes 1 billion dollars a year. He sends onions all over the world, which is very successful.\n\nI think trying new things and taking risks is not right for everyone because you also need some luck in business."}

Just like cars need oil to run, communities need young people to be strong and well-run. But, young people don't give as much time to their communities as they used to. This is because of the education they get, the way the people they live with act, and bad things that happen every day that make them feel negative about the future. \n\nFirst, the education we get has a big impact on how we live. People who have learned a lot usually care more about their community than those who haven't learned as much. For example, think about someone who finished college. This person knows what a community needs and can choose the best actions for the community. \n\nSecond, young people are strongly affected by their families. Don't young people often copy their parents? If their parents don't care about the community, the young people might not care either. \n\nThere are other things that can make young people feel negative. Have we thought about how bad news, like wars in the Middle East, might make them feel?

For instance, my friend from France went to Africa last year to volunteer and build a school.\n\nAnother reason I believe this is that young people are more involved than ever. In the 2002 French presidential election, when Jean-Marie Le Pen, who had racist views, got to the second round, students and teenagers were the first to protest. I don't think this would have happened in the past.\n\nLastly, it's important to note that young people often can't show they care. They usually don't make much money.

But if you want to go to Egypt, for example, you will need a guide. A guide is someone who knows the place well, especially the history. When you travel, 'time' matters a lot. You want to see and learn as much as you can quickly. So, a guide can help you do that. A guide knows about history and important spots, but also about good places to eat, have fun, and which areas to stay away from for safety. I remember going to Mexico with my friends. We visited some old ruins with a guide. On the bus to the city 'El Carmen,' the guide told us about the ruins. By the time we arrived, we knew what to expect.

For example, starting a new business, like a restaurant, is a risk for those who don't know much about it. But if they get advice from people who know about restaurants and think carefully about the business, it is okay to take the risk.\n\nAnother example is applying to a university to get a degree. Some people are scared they will be turned down. So they stay where they are because they are afraid of failing. If they don't try hard to get what they want and don't risk being turned down, they will regret it later.

To start, even though money isn't always the best way to judge success, most very rich people started something new. Bill Gates made the Microsoft program to help people use computers better at low prices before anyone else did. To do this business, he left Harvard University to focus on his new idea. That must have been a tough decision because Harvard is a very hard school to get into. Now, Bill Gates is one of the wealthiest men in the world. My dad is also a good example. He was born poor and got into the toughest medical school in my hometown in South Korea by himself. But he switched to engineering, leaving the simple road to success in medical school. After studying engineering, he started biomedical engineering and became the first person in Korea with a doctorate in that field by creating it at his college. If he hadn't done this, he would have been a doctor, but not the first biomedical engineer in the country. I have also taken a big chance to be successful—I came to America. I could have kept studying at top schools in my home country, as a chosen science student before. But I really wanted to try new things, even if it meant risking something important at the time, and I still want to.

Older people, on the other hand, have learned how to enjoy life with simple joys, like eating out with friends or going on a family trip. Young people do have a lot of energy, more than older people. But this doesn't hide their problems. Some older people also don't have fun because they face big issues, like not being able to get a job or feeling very tired.

There are a few reasons for this: being correct, the risks of knowing just a little, and the idea that being a specialist starts with some general knowledge. That's why I support being a specialist.\n\nFirst, if a person knows a lot about what they like, they do their job well and can give good information. For example, a heart doctor can help a patient better than a doctor who knows a little about everything.\n\nSecond, as I mentioned, knowing just a little can be risky. If we don't fully understand one subject, we can't use what we know to do anything useful. We don't know which way to go, and we might have to stop working on an invention or discovery because we don't know what comes next. This can also stop a society from growing.\n\nLast, to become a specialist, we start by learning about many subjects. This helps us understand our main interest better. So, knowing about different subjects is the first step to becoming a specialist. Like I said, a heart doctor needs to know about how the whole body works.\n\nSo, I can say that being a specialist not only makes us better at what we're interested in but also is the goal of learning about many subjects. It helps us grow as a person, become an expert, and helps society grow too."}
{"file_id": "1081543.txt", "output_essay": "I disagree with the idea that knowing a little about many school subjects is better than knowing a lot about one subject. This is because studying one subject deeply helps you understand it well. This deep understanding is important for creating new things and research. It also helps improve society. Most new things we have today come from people studying something deeply. For example, without studying fiber optics closely, we wouldn't have the advances in how we talk to each other over long distances. Life is easier because of this. Studying one thing like management deeply is also important. It helps solve big, complicated problems in the world. By studying deeply, you can help the world a lot. It's simple to learn a little about many subjects. But to do well, you need to study seriously. It's true that learning about many subjects can make you think wider. But you can learn the basics of other subjects easily. Today, with so much information around, you can find out things quickly. Also, we talk and share ideas with others. This helps us learn about different subjects. Today's world is all about technology and science. To help in this world, it's better to focus and study one thing deeply. Even someone who studies society needs to study deeply to help in a big way."}

But scientists who understood the universe didn't believe this. They thought of new ideas and were successful. Trying new things is important for success. It helps us learn more and understand things better. Today's technology means we have to learn new skills. People who learn these skills will do well in today's tough world. Imagine someone who can only use a typewriter. If they don't learn to use a computer, they might lose their job. But if they learn, they can do better in their work. Successful people always look for new ways and work hard in a smart way. If someone doesn't learn new skills, they won't get better jobs or more money. Some people are scared to try new things at work. But we can't find new things without trying. People should try new things to get better. But they should think carefully before they do it. For example, a rich person who puts all his money in stocks could lose it all. So, I think we should try new things, but think about it first. If we are careful, new things are not too risky and can bring good results. We can't get anywhere in life without taking some risks."}

I agree that children need to learn a lot to know about the world and have a good future. But, I think it's more important to understand ideas and concepts. First, having to learn too much can make a student not like the subjects anymore. For example, one of my students is made to go to many tutoring centers because her mother wants her to. She doesn't get to choose what she wants to learn. She studies English, math, and science a lot. But she only wants to stop going to these centers. Also, just learning more than what a student can understand doesn't help. I have a student who has to take 3 classes every day. His mother makes him do this. He spends a lot of time at the tutoring center but doesn't really understand any of the classes. He struggles because it's too much for him. It's true that knowing a lot is very helpful and important. But learning should be done in a way that works well. Students should learn about things in a way that lets them understand what they are studying."}

But, older people had their chance to get used to the world, and they probably liked it. So, I think young people have more fun than older ones. Right now, I am young. I like my life. I enjoy going to school, working out, and seeing new things. Young people need to be brave, healthy, and eager to learn to do these things. But these can be hard for older people. Some still have energy and interest, but many do not. For instance, my grandma only likes her daily tasks. She takes care of her home and talks to friends. Once, I asked her to go on a trip with us. She said no, even though she was well. She didn't want to leave her home and what she's used to. But we, the young, are not scared of new places or lives. We have many dreams. This makes us happier than older people. I think older people should find things they like to do. It could make them happier and more connected with others. If they don't, they might just be sad or bored. To stop this, they should look for things that interest them."}

The number of cars and their impact on the environment often come up in our daily talks and in politics. I believe we will use fewer cars soon. Let me tell you why. First, everyone (governments, families, and businesses) must look after the environment. This will become a must-do soon. We all see problems like global warming. Did you know global warming is melting glaciers? This could make the Maldives vanish in less than twenty years! If we do nothing, we might lose our planet and need a new home. That's scary, right? Cars cause a lot of pollution and are a big reason for global warming. Car pollution also leads to many illnesses. So, we need to use fewer cars. Also, other ways to travel are getting better quickly. Look at Paris. Owning a car there is very hard because of the traffic. Why not ride the bus? Buses are on time. Driving in Paris can take much longer than the bus. Safety is also a big concern. Too many car accidents happen. This is not okay. To end, I'll say we have another choice: switch to eco-friendly cars. These cars are good for the environment. They can use the sun or clean oils. I think this is the best idea because you can't just tell people to stop driving."}

Sometimes they work for a long time and can't take time for themselves. Some work hard because of their jobs. These days, people work hard because time matters a lot to them.

First, young people are busy. Work is important to them. They want a perfect life and to be good to their families. They work hard, and they don't have much time. Their community comes second to their work. Second, young people want time for themselves. They do things to relax. For example, they go out when they have free time. They have hobbies, and some like to be alone. They can take care of themselves. They don't have time for their communities. Finally, young people's lives are fast and always changing. This is because of how they are. Some work a lot, while others are lazy. Also, changes around them affect them. They can change how they act quickly. Some things don't matter to them. They may not be close to their family or friends. Work can change them a lot. They can forget they have a family or friends. In short, it can be hard to find time to help others for many reasons. Indeed, helping others is about our own effort. These days, everyone wants a good life and job."}

They get excited about gifts, parties, and friends wishing them a happy birthday. But older people often feel sad and embarrassed about aging, and birthdays remind them of that.\n\nHow people have fun changes with age. It's different for kids, teens, and adults.\n\nKids are often very happy. They can play with something simple for hours and keep smiling and laughing for no big reason. Kids don't have to worry about big problems because they don't know about them. Their parents protect them from trouble.\n\nAs kids grow into teens, the way they have fun changes. Teens love freedom. They might argue with their parents, but they want to show they can be on their own. Feeling free, teens start new hobbies, sometimes ones they shouldn't do, but they like taking risks.\n\nUnlike kids and teens, adults can't have fun as easily. Being an adult means you have to be responsible. Adults work to make money and have many duties that stop them from having fun. Also, when adults have kids, they work hard to make their kids' lives happy. They give up their own fun for their family.

Others think it's better to focus on one subject and learn a lot about it. I think both ways are useful, depending on what you need for school. When I was in college, I liked to read and go to many classes. This made it easier for me to do well on tests and get good grades. But, when I was studying to be a physical therapist, I only took classes about sports medicine. This helped me get into a master's program and find a good job.

{"file_id": "1088126.txt", "output_essay": "I get why some think learning facts is key, but I think it's better for students to grasp ideas and concepts. There are three main reasons for this belief. First, ideas and concepts help a student get not just one fact, but many. Facts happen once, but ideas can explain lots of facts. Take cooking a cake as an example. If you know how to make one cake, that's good. But if you understand how to make cakes in general, you can make any cake. Knowing a fact means you only know that one thing for next time. But if you know the idea, you can guess what will happen in many similar situations. Second, you learn ideas and concepts first at school, and this is a smart way to learn. Like in math, you learn the rules before you use them. Also, theories are collections of what other people have learned. That's what teachers give you: a lot of experience in a small package, not just one fact. Third, from my own life, I think knowing ideas and concepts first matters more. I started a fashion business with little knowledge about it. But what I learned in class helped me adjust and predict things because I knew the basics of the business world. For instance, marketing ideas work for all businesses. With them, I could overcome not knowing much about the fashion world. In the end, I believe ideas and concepts are more important than facts. But I do understand those who think facts are more important because you need them to use the theory."}
{"file_id": "1084478.txt", "output_essay": "The world has changed, and so have people. Young people have become less responsible; the world has gotten tougher, and young people have started to ignore what's happening around them.\n\nFirst, young people are not acting responsibly. They don't help their communities as much as before. They still help, but not as much as in the early 1900s, when there were big changes. Back then, college students led the way. But today, people the same age are causing trouble and hurting society. They don't have to deal with big problems like wars or big changes, so they get into drugs, crime, and other bad things. They don't take responsibility for what they do, especially rich kids who count on their parents to fix their problems. These bad choices by young people hurt society more than before.\n\nSecond, the world has gotten tougher to compete in. There are not enough jobs, and everyone is trying to get ahead. Young people don't have time to help their communities, except for the help they have to give for school. They need to study a lot to get a job or grow their businesses. If they don't, they will fall behind. For example, in my country in the 1970s, college graduates could pick where they wanted to work. But now, even the best graduates struggle to find jobs. Only 77 percent of them get jobs, showing that it's really hard and competition is strong.\n\nLast, young people don't care about what's going on around them. They have become self-centered, which makes them not care about others' problems. For example, when they see old people standing on the bus while they sit, they ignore them or act like they're sleeping. Young people don't want to get involved in other people's problems, especially if it's risky. I saw a news show where people were asked what they would do if they saw someone acting badly on a crowded train. Most said they would ignore it, thinking it's none of their business.\n\nAs time goes on, the world gets harder to live in. Not many people are helping with problems, even though life is getting harder. I want to tell young people to help their society. When they ask why, I'll say, 'You will see the difference.'"}
{"file_id": "1082728.txt", "output_essay": "KNOWING A LOT ABOUT MANY SCHOOL SUBJECTS, OR JUST ONE? Knowing a lot about many school subjects means students learn a bit about each one, but they can't focus on just one subject. Focusing on just one subject means students learn everything about it, but they don't learn much about other subjects. People pick jobs where they need to know everything about their job's subject. They don't need to know about other subjects. This is how job roles are created. Even though jobs are like this, knowing only one subject can make people dull. Knowing a bit about many subjects makes people more open and interesting. They see the world in different ways. Since we are social, we need some variety in our lives. If people only knew one thing and nothing else, they would be dull. They would only be friends with people who do the same work because they wouldn't share interests with others. If people knew a bit of everything and didn't focus on one thing, they would have to do all tasks themselves. No jobs would be split up. Also, areas like science, history, and surgery wouldn't grow much. No one would focus on one thing, so there would be no new discoveries. To end, I think only knowing one subject or knowing a bit about many without focusing are both not good. But if I had to pick, I'd say it's better to know one subject well. This way, life doesn't get worse; people just become less interesting and only have friends from their own field. But knowing a bit about many subjects could make life worse."}

They do this by making people like the product. So, the product has to look good and please the buyer's senses. Ads need to make people want things in a clever way. \n\nAn ad is a tool for selling. It doesn't just say something straight out; ads are usually fun, bright, and nice to look at. They should never be dull. Ads try to appeal to our senses to make us want to buy things. \n\nTake orange juice ads, for example. They can be aimed at everyone. The ads might suggest that the juice gives you strength, health, or even act like it's a cure. The pictures show very bright oranges, but they add sugar, water, and other things to the juice. There might be a fun scene in the ad, like a party with young people. This could suggest feelings of love or romance. \n\nIn the end, a good ad gets people involved. How well it draws people away from other products, makes money, and gives extra worth are key in creating ads that make things look better than they are."}

I believe ads make things look better by not talking about the bad points. They also often hide the true cost.\n\nFirst, ads want to change what we buy. They make things look better than they are. For example, McDonald's uses pictures of their burgers to draw people in. The burgers in the pictures are plastic because they look better than real burgers.\n\nAlso, ads don't talk about the bad things. Take McDonald's again. It's well known that their food can make people gain weight. But the ads don't say this because McDonald's wants people to buy their food. Toys for young kids are another example. Many are made in China with poor materials. Sometimes, these toys can even be harmful to kids.\n\nAds don't talk about these risks, which I think is wrong. Third, ads often hide the true price. Big airlines offer cheap flights, like a trip from Munich to Berlin for 30 Euros. But this price doesn't include extra fees or fuel costs. The real cost is about 55 Euros, much more than the ad says.\n\nIn summary, ads twist the truth. McDonald's uses fake burger photos. They don't talk about the risks, like weight gain. They show salads, but these salads can have more calories than burgers. Toy companies try to sell harmful toys by making them look good. And often, the prices are not true.\n\nI think we should stop this kind of advertising. People should buy things because they are good, not because ads make them look much better than they are."}

You also save money because group tickets and deals are cheaper. I remember a school trip to New Delhi. We had fun on the train, singing, dancing, and telling jokes. We saw all the sights together and had a great time. But when I went to the same places alone, I didn't enjoy it. Sometimes friends are too busy to travel with us. In a group, you don't miss them. Time passes quickly, and you forget your problems. People like to travel, but they worry about time and money. Alone, it costs more.

But there's a big issue with most ads. The real products are usually not as good as they look in the ads. Ads trick customers by using famous people and not showing the bad points of the products. \n\nWhen a company uses a famous person, they can make a lot of money from ads. Imagine a company hires Brad Pitt. He's in an ad using a new aftershave they made. Then, people think this aftershave must be high quality because Brad Pitt uses it. They also think if they buy it, they might be like him or at least dress like him. Sadly, the products don't live up to what people expect. Just because famous people use them doesn't mean they are well made. \n\nOf course, companies show off the good things about their products in ads. But they often hide the bad things. Many college students have done studies on this. They found that even though laws say companies must tell customers everything, they still hide the bad stuff. They put the bad news in small print so it's hard to read. People usually notice the big, bold words like 'No pesticides' or 'The first of its kind in the world.' Sure, some say making good ads is a must for companies to make money. But they've gone too far. Companies should think about the customers' rights. Customers should be able to choose based on what the ads tell them."}
{"file_id": "1091612.txt", "output_essay": "I strongly agree because I think that if you get the main idea of something, it will stick in your mind. You will remember it for a long time. But if you only learn the facts, they won't stay in your mind as well. Take high school students learning history as an example. If they only learn dates, names, and places, they can only use them for a test. This is unless the topic is very important in history. If they look into the event and understand why it happened, they will enjoy the topic more. They will feel smarter. The dates, names, and places will become less important. This also helps them remember these facts because they can link the reasons for the events to the dates and names. I think learning shouldn't be boring. If you only memorize to get a good grade, you are missing the point of learning. You end up tired and bored. Learning can be enjoyable. If you understand things, you will feel smart. If you only learn facts without understanding them, you will feel bad and less smart. So, I think teachers should help students to do better and get smarter, not just memorize lots of books without understanding. Smart people can solve problems on their own. They don't always need to ask someone smarter. If you have to read something many times to get it, you're just a puppet. Being a puppet is useless.

The same is true when a young person helps someone with disabilities. The main issue is not that they can't do certain things, but that they need to talk and be with others.

Second, too many cars cause traffic jams. This makes people waste time on the road. They can't do what they want on time. So, they will choose buses and trains, which are quicker than cars.

This shows that people are good at different things, and focusing on what they do best is the key to success. I don't agree with the idea that knowing a little about many school subjects is better than knowing a lot about one subject. Knowing a lot about one subject is a surer way to succeed, it helps you focus, and it's less stressful. \n\nOne reason I think this is that knowing a lot about one subject is a surer way to do well in the future. I think that knowing a little about many subjects only helps when you're young. The stress of trying to get good grades in all your classes might make you think it's better to know a little about many things. Knowing a little about many things might also stop you from finding what you're really good at. But I believe what you end up being good at is what matters most, and working hard at it will get you somewhere in life. \n\nAnother reason I think knowing a lot about one subject is better is that it lets you focus more. It's hard to study one subject when you know you have to study for another one too. I think that studying hard for one subject lets you pay attention better. \n\nLastly, I think it's less stressful to know a lot about one subject. For example, I think it's hard for someone to be good at both writing and math. People usually don't like what they're not good at. If you don't want to take classes in subjects you're not good at, you should work hard in a subject you like. My friend, who is very good at art, is not good at math. So, she doesn't take any math classes. In conclusion, I think knowing a lot about one subject instead of a little about many subjects will make you happier."}
{"file_id": "1080585.txt", "output_essay": "At first look, it may seem like a hard question, but if you look more closely, you might think that this topic needs to be looked at. This essay talks about why it is important to know a lot about many school subjects.\n\nFirst, I want to say that it is very important for any student to learn more. Imagine you got your Bachelor's degree in sports and you want to work in another country. But if your university didn't let you learn another language, you can't fully enjoy new places.\n\nAlso, you can only work in a small job area that doesn't let you take on more important tasks. I am sure that you will soon feel unhappy and wish you had learned more in school. Rome wasn't built in a day, and it's clear that you can't learn much more overnight.\n\nIf students who only studied one subject, like sports, took different classes too, it would be easier for them to do well in a world that loves money.\n\nI want to make my point stronger with a quote from Darwin. 'The survival of the fittest,' talks about real things that happened in the early 19th century. You can connect it to our topic.\n\nSo, what about students who took business classes as well as their main subject? Imagine they learned how to plan and reach goals with schedules and lists. Maybe these business classes showed them how to lead people with rewards and punishment or by being kind.\n\nThese skills would really give them more chances to get different jobs, like running sports events or leading a sports company. I am sure that everyone benefits from knowing a lot about many school subjects, as I've talked about before. I was raised to believe that a person never stops learning and that there is always something new to learn every day. Going back to my first point, it is very important to do well in school for these reasons."}
{"file_id": "1075051.txt", "output_essay": "I agree and disagree with this idea. On one side, knowing a lot about different school subjects is usually very good. It's important for someone to know about many areas. We always want to learn more. For example, in college, learning just one subject is not enough. I am a student at La Sorbonne Nouvelle University. It's a top school for learning foreign languages. I am studying English and German. But you can also learn Spanish, Italian, Arabic, Chinese, or Hindi there. After finishing at this school, students often look for work in trade or international business. Knowing a lot about different subjects is very helpful here. If two students who finished college want the same job in international business, I think the one who knows more languages will get the job. My school is also known for film, acting, and communication. You can study languages and film at the same time, or take acting classes. But, I also think that there is a time when students need to choose what they really want to do. They should try to get as many chances as they can to be successful. For example, knowing about too many subjects can confuse students. They try to learn a lot because they like many topics. But if you ask them what they like best or what they would study if they could only pick one subject, they don't know. This is why many students don't do well in their first years of college. In France, many students don't pass because they chose the wrong major after high school. In the end, I think it's good to know about many areas, but students should focus on what will help them succeed."}

But getting the hang of ideas and concepts is hard. For example, when I try to understand a theory, I have to study a lot. So, understanding means studying a lot. This helps you focus better. Also, when you spend a lot of time on something, you don't forget it quickly. Like, if I hear about a theory in class, I forget it fast.

They think successful people always try new things and take risks instead of sticking to what they know. But I don't agree with this for a couple of reasons. First, you can be successful by doing what you're good at over and over. Take Japanese traditional arts like Kabuki or Noh, for example. The artists practice the same play every day from when they're very young, around 3 years old, until they die. We all agree that they are successful in showing the beauty of Japanese culture. This is true for traditional craftsmen and pro baseball players too. They get better by doing the same familiar things every day. These examples show that the first statement isn't always right. Also, even if trying new things can lead to success, 'new things' should be new for everyone, not just one person. If someone keeps changing what they do, they might never really succeed."}

Where you live makes a big difference too. In a big city, you can't join as many groups as you can in small towns or villages. Young people today are busier and have less time than before. They go to school or study a lot. Many also work to make money to live. If they work and go to school, they probably won't work for the community for free. They don't have the time or money to help out. Community work has benefits that many young people don't know. It helps you fit in if you're new. It can help you make friends or get help if you have a problem. It can give you support if you're lost or have nothing else in your life. It's a good option for retired people to stay active and connected. But I do think young people don't spend enough time helping their communities. This is true even though things have changed. The social connections they can make in their community are very important."}

Focusing on one job means you get really good at one thing. When factories started doing this, they made a lot more products. Focusing on one job can have problems, like not knowing much about other things. But it's better to know a lot about one thing than a little about many things. \n\nPeople often find out what they are good at or love after many years in school, like 12 years. They then see that learning things not about their favorite subject is not helpful. For example, if someone wants to be a mechanical engineer, they don't need to know about Shakespeare's writing. \n\nI have chosen to be a research scientist. For me, learning Spanish and Business takes time away from this goal. I enjoy reading about new medical findings, but Spanish only gives me trouble and bad grades. I don't think Spanish will matter much for me in the future. Maybe it could help me talk to Spanish speakers, but I might not meet many. My own experiences have shown me that knowing a lot about one thing is better than knowing a little about many things."}

Knowing about many school subjects is better than just knowing one for many reasons. It makes science richer, gives us different views, and helps us understand more about the world. First, science subjects are complex and linked together. For example, Law and Politics overlap, so a Law expert should learn about Politics too. Also, some sciences like Biochemistry and Economic Law mix different subjects. Next, experts should learn about many areas to connect with other experts. They need to share what they know and their experiences. For instance, a Physics teacher can learn from a Math teacher. This can help them think of new ideas. Also, knowing a lot about different things opens our minds. It gives us information we can't get if we only stay in one place. For example, a Law teacher won't learn about Arabic poets unless he talks to a teacher who knows about Arabic Literature. He can also discover new things and see life in new ways. In the end, I think it's good to know about many things. It has many benefits, helps scientists work together, and makes us more aware."}

Lots of young people help by doing volunteer work. A news story from Taiwan said that more students are volunteering at places like libraries and hospitals during summer break. This might be normal in America, but it's new in Taiwan. In the past, students in Taiwan were told to only think about school. They were taught to care just about themselves and their studies and not to do free work like volunteering. But now, young people are happy to use their time to volunteer. This shows they are helping their communities more. \n\nAlso, young people now care more about others, including animals, in their communities. A bad news story from Taiwan told about a man who hurt cats at his house. He made the cats drink cleaning liquids and took photos of them making bubbles. Then, he put these photos online. The young people in Taiwan got upset by this and worked together to find the man's internet address and where he lived. Because of this, the police punished the man, thanks to the young people who care about animals. \n\nMoreover, many young people take part in local events. For example, my friend joined a dance group in his area. He met many people who like dancing too.

So, some might think that young people have more fun than older people. This is true in some ways because young people have more choices for fun, and there are many new toys and games for them to use. But having fun isn't just about doing things. Being young is great, but we also need to think about our future. Older people have fun too. They know a lot about life because they have lived for a long time.

A student might say that what they learn in school is not useful or important. This isn't true. As you get older, you'll see that what you learned in school helps you in everyday life. So, it's better to learn about many subjects than to know everything about just one subject. \n\nYou might think it's better to focus on one subject if your job needs that knowledge. But this is only for your job. In the outside world, what you know might be so detailed that only you and people in your field understand it. If you want to join in with others and understand more about life, it's good to know about many things. For example, imagine you're at a party with lots of different people. You want to chat, but you only know about your one subject and nothing about what others are talking about. You'll end up feeling left out and lonely. \n\nIn the end, it's better to know about many subjects than just one. Knowing a lot helps you have a better life where you don't feel left out.

Having fun doesn't depend on how old you are; it depends on how you see things, what you want from life, and your attitude.\n\nSome young people are not happy because they don't see things in a way that makes them happy. They believe that small problems stop them from being happy. For example, I know many older people who have fun even if they have some health issues. They go to different events to learn and enjoy themselves. They do this because it fits with how they see things.\n\nWhat people want from life can change as they get older. Older people think being happy is the most important thing. They try hard to be happy in their older years. They know more than young people that life is very short. They try to make the best of this time, which is different from young people.\n\nLastly, how you feel inside is important. Being young is not the key; it just gives some benefits. For example, young people have more energy and can do a lot quickly, but older people plan their lives to do a lot too, like traveling and sports, to have fun.\n\nIn the end, being happy is not just about how old you are.

Older people often don't have the energy to do all these things. When you get older, you might not be as healthy, and you end up going to doctors, getting therapy, picking up medicine, and staying home more because you have to work or look after your grandkids. You also think harder about whether you want to go somewhere. Young and old people think differently about life, what they should do, and what fun is. Older people tend to be more careful.

Society thinks that being peaceful doesn't show as much joy in life. \n\nYoung people have the energy and time to try new things. We feel happy when we find and learn new things. Young people use their strong bodies and minds to look for fun things to do more than older people. And they often reach their goals. \n\nMy grandfather loved to play soccer when he was young. He was so happy playing that he never missed a game. Now, he is 70 and just wants to rest. He used to say, 'Soccer is everything, son. When it's over, you only have your memories.' Now, I play soccer too. It's a big part of me. I wouldn't be the same without it because it brings me so much joy. \n\nI think young people enjoy life more fully. Not to be unfair, but because it's about more than what we can touch. Life is like a cycle. A flower looks its best when it blooms, but after some time, it dries up and dies. People live their lives and finish their journey. Older people might enjoy different things, but they have already had their best moments.

For example, they can travel, ride bikes, run, and have sex. These are things most older people can't do as much because they don't have the energy. And sure, they might have kids or grandkids. This can make them happy. It might be the only thing they enjoy. They feel proud to have done things that younger people haven't yet. This pride might be enough for them. They might not want to try new things. But I can't say that young people always have fun either. In the 21st century, it's hard to explore life. To get a good job, you need a diploma. To get a diploma, you need money. We can't make money appear out of nowhere, so we start working early, either part-time or full-time. We also have to study to finish school. It seems like we only get to have fun when we retire. But by then, we are old. So, who really has more fun, the young or the old? Having fun isn't about how old you are or what you do. It's about enjoying life fully. We decide what 'having fun' means to us.

They set up a charity basketball game with NBA players. Another point is that young people assist older adults. They do this instead of playing soccer or going shopping. Today, young people do give their time to their communities. They throw parties for kids and volunteer at hospitals to help out. They start groups to fight AIDS, poverty, and to support children in hospitals who can't afford care. Often, famous young people return to put on shows to raise money for these causes and to build houses, parks, and stadiums. In conclusion, I believe young people do enough for their communities."}
{"file_id": "1085024.txt", "output_essay": "Yes, I agree that understanding ideas and concepts is more important than just learning facts. It's very important for us to really get an idea, not just know it. If you are good at understanding ideas and concepts, you can think about the facts that go with them. When you use an idea, you can see its good and bad points. This makes us think about the facts that are connected to it.\n\nI think the steps for this idea are: first, coming up with an idea is important. Then you think about it and what could happen. After that, you use the idea and find out the facts from it. So, you can get the facts from the idea itself.\n\nIn my view, learning facts without understanding them is like eating food without knowing what it is. The food might taste good, and you might like it, but not knowing what you're eating is silly.\n\nToday, understanding ideas and concepts is what's happening. So, if the world is moving forward and you're not, that's not good. You won't be doing your job well.\n\nUnderstanding an idea makes you think. This helps you come up with new ideas about the topic. It keeps you thinking. If you get into the habit of understanding concepts, knowing the facts will come as part of the process. It's the real point of studying.\n\nSo, I think it's more important for a student to understand concepts and work on them. He should also learn the facts that come with the ideas."}

Young people can go to different countries easily because they don't have to worry about leaving anyone behind, like kids. For instance, my parents have three kids, including me. If they want to go to Spain when they have time off, they can't because they have to take care of us. But young people without kids can travel easily.\n\nAlso, young people often want to learn and have lots of different experiences when they are young. I remember my brother at nineteen, he went to music festivals, theaters, and traveled a lot. He had a good time because he had time, enough money, and energy. He could also handle tough situations well. I can't picture older people going to a party and a boat trip on the same day.\n\nIn the end, we can't really say if young people have more fun than older people.

But an older person is someone who has finished their work life. First, let's look at how young people have fun. I believe students want to try many things. People say it's the best time to travel. Young people can travel without needing much comfort. Also, they start to become more independent from their parents. They don't have many reasons to stay in one place. So, they really can travel, see new places, and learn about different ways of life. But is this really having fun? It's true they can travel easily, but do they understand their experiences deeply? They don't see things the way their parents would when visiting new places. It's also important for them to learn new things like being in charge and handling money. These responsibilities can limit their fun. Next, let's talk about older people's lives. If they are healthy, I think it's the best time for them. Your kids are done with school; you've raised them. You can now enjoy life and the rewards of your work. You can travel, cook, play sports, and join clubs. You have time to do what you like. But even though you have a lot of time, it feels like you don't. You planned many activities, but it's tough to do them all. Often, you wonder if you can still do these things.

Second, even if you work hard and learn about many subjects, you will probably only know a little about each one. You won't be very good at any of them. For example, think about a doctor who knows a lot about history, computers, and plants. He won't have enough time to learn about medicine, so he won't be a good doctor. Also, if everyone knows a little about many subjects, they can do many jobs but not do any of them very well. In the end, I think people should be experts in one subject.

But I think that cars will become less common over time. This is because of new technology, people using different ways to travel, and changes in how we organize our lives. Technology is moving fast. We've seen new ways to travel like hovercrafts, underground and overhead trains, and very fast planes. These new options are popping up all the time, and people are starting to use them more. So, we can expect to see fewer cars on the roads. Newspapers often tell us about new airline companies starting. Cheap airlines are doing well in Europe, and now they are trying this in places like India. People are choosing these airlines to travel between cities or countries because they are affordable. This is especially true for people who travel for work a lot. They can find the best deals. So, fewer people are using cars for short trips. If this keeps up, we'll see even fewer cars as these airlines become more popular. The way we build our towns and cities is also changing. We're seeing places where people live and work in the same building, and others where they are separate. If this happens everywhere, people will travel differently. In the first case, they won't need to travel much. In the second, they'll likely use public transport like trains because it's faster. This will mean people won't depend on cars as much. So, as things change, people are finding new ways to get to where they want to go. These ways are faster and easier. This makes me think that cars will be used less and less. I just hope that cars don't disappear completely like the dinosaurs did."}

From the time a child starts school, they have to live up to what their parents and friends expect. As the number of people grows and resources get scarce, there are fewer spots in top schools and universities. Students have to fight for a few places. Even after getting in, the school work is so heavy that they have no time to help others. We can't expect someone so busy to make time for the community. Then, when a person starts a job, they must work hard for a better future. Still, I can't ignore that young people do not care much about their community. With cultures mixing and the world connecting more, young people want things and fun. They don't see that they should help the society that has given them so much.

{"file_id": "1068953.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with this statement. I think that students get ideas and concepts better than just facts. It's obvious that students learn more from their own ideas and concepts than from facts in class. So, I agree with this statement. Usually, subjects are split into two groups: science or social studies. In social studies, we study a lot like history, geography, economics, and government. What we learn in history is different from what we see. Imagine some countries are less than 500 years old, but now they are the biggest economies and lead the world. At the beginning of the 1900s, there was no advanced electronic science. Now, we can't imagine life without electronics, computers, and electricity, but it's true. Many things, like ideas and concepts, are very important. For example, in materials, we learn about their chemical bonds, how they conduct electricity, and what types they are. This comes from understanding ideas and concepts, not just facts. Materials are sorted by their features. Let's say we're talking about a science class, and we're learning about the solar system. The sun doesn't move around, but it looks like it moves from east to west. In fact, the Earth spins from west to east. Here's another example: when we ride in a car, it seems like everything outside is moving and we're not. Also, we might think the Earth is flat because it looks that way, but it's actually round like a ball. If the Earth were flat, sunrise and sunset times would be the same everywhere, but they're not. From these three examples, I believe we grasp ideas and concepts better than just learning facts. Here's a technical example. Usually, we don't think about energy changing forms in everyday life, but it does. We might not believe we can turn heat into cold. But it happens: heat in a boiler makes some movement energy; this energy turns into electrical energy with a turbine, and finally, we get cold from electrical energy using a fridge. So, I strongly stand by my point in this discussion. 'Understanding ideas and concepts is more important for students than just learning facts.'"}

This shows why having a guide is best when traveling in a group. It can even save lives. Lastly, I want to talk about an old Chinese tour guide, Xu Xiakeng.

Young people don't worry about society or family duties, so they can try hard things without much thought. When people have a family or look after their parents, it's harder to try new things.

Everyone should work alone, but they should also work for the group they belong to. This doesn't mean a special group; they should take part in public life, like at school or with their family. Teenagers don't understand what they should do as students and family members. \n\nNormally, people learn to be part of a community at home. Kids should learn lessons, be polite to older people, and parents should work for the family and help their kids grow up well. They should also love each other and get along well. But, many young people don't want to be close to their parents. They ignore the advice from adults and pull away from home. They would rather be with friends they don't know well than with their own brothers or sisters. \n\nAt school, young people can also show they are responsible. They should join in classes, study for tests, and learn for their future jobs. But lately, many students treat school as a place to escape from home or to have fun without caring about learning. They think breaking rules is a way to be noticed. So, schools make tougher rules to manage them. This makes the community they are part of weaker. Teenagers should give up a little freedom to have a calm school life. \n\nIn the end, young people should act more like adults to manage their lives better. If they can be good students, friends, brothers/sisters, and children, they can build a better community. They will also like where they are and what they do."}
{"file_id": "1097351.txt", "output_essay": "Even though young people are often healthier and can do more things, I don't think they enjoy life more than older people. Here's why. First, older people have more time to relax because they don't work anymore. But young people are busy with school, homework, and jobs to make money. For instance, I go to law school and spend a lot of time studying. I also work part-time to have money to go out. My parents, though, don't work and travel a lot. Second, older people usually have more money to spend on fun things. My parents, for example, traveled to Peru and Europe last year. I like to travel too, but I don't have much money. So, I just travel close to home, rent a car, and stay in cheap hotels. Third, older people know better what they want to do with their time. They couldn't do these things before because they were too busy working. My dad always wanted to go to Peru and he finally did after he stopped working. It's true that young people are in better shape and some older people can't do much because they have trouble moving. But many older people still find ways to have fun, like joining poetry or book clubs. To sum up, older people have more fun than young people because they have more time, more money, and really want to do things they missed out on before."}
{"file_id": "1088889.txt", "output_essay": "Many people like to travel alone without a tour guide. They want to stay away from crowds, fixed plans, and enjoy some time by themselves. But traveling with a group and a tour guide has many good points to think about. It can make travel safer in other countries, it's easy, and it makes sure we see important places.\n\nFirst, being in a group with a tour guide is safer when we're in a new country. When we don't know a place, we can get tricked or have accidents more easily. For example, some Koreans got tricked by locals when they visited East Asia. They faced murders, thefts, and more. Also, if something bad happens, people often don't know what to do. But tour guides know their country well, so they can keep us safer.\n\nNext, group travel is very easy and shows us the best spots. Tour companies plan everything and book places for us. We just have to follow their plan. For example, we won't have to worry about finding a hotel because it's already booked. And guides know the best and most beautiful places to take us.\n\nAs I said before, a group tour with a guide is better in many ways. It's less risky because we're with others and have a guide. It's also easy because the travel company has a plan ready for us. We just go along with it. So, I think the best way to travel is in a group with a tour guide."}
{"file_id": "1091757.txt", "output_essay": "People often argue about whether it's best to travel with a group and a guide or to go alone. Some say going alone is better because you can look around freely. But I think that going with a guide and other people is the best way to travel. This is because you can see the most famous places quickly and learn how to get along with others in the group. First, with a guide who knows the places, you can save time and see the best spots. Some might not like group travel, but a good guide can plan a trip that most will enjoy. A survey by the Korean National Research Center found that over two-thirds of people who traveled abroad wanted a guide. They said a guide could show them the best places they shouldn't miss and save them time over using a map alone. So, traveling with a guide and a group saves time. Also, being with others in a group helps you learn social skills. These skills are important for success. For example, an adult traveling in a group to India will learn to stay calm and get along with others, even when it's hard. This trip will be a great memory of visiting places and meeting different people. Plus, the social skills learned can help in other parts of life. In short, group travel with a guide is the best because it's efficient and helps you learn how to interact with others."}

A person's actions often come from their life experiences. Family, school, friends, TV, and activities in early life shape who they become. The advice young people get is often not very good. It's true that not enough people help their communities. It's also true that there are not many good role models. Because of this, not everyone turns out as good as they could be.\n\nI know some people really want to help others. But I think these people are few. I care a lot about this issue. Right now, I work at a call center. We help students in my country who have problems at home and can't talk to anyone about it.\n\nThat's why I believe it's very important to encourage everyone to do the right thing and start helping those around us. The best way to start is by being a good example ourselves."}
{"file_id": "1076492.txt", "output_essay": "We don't have any proof about this claim, so we can say many things. When I talk to my dad and we're in traffic, he keeps saying that when he was young, there wasn't all this trouble. Streets weren't packed with cars because each family had just one car. Now, things are different. Every year, we learn from studies that the number of cars is going up. This might be because people are richer now. When my dad was young, Italy was not rich and was just starting to modernize. So the current situation doesn't seem to back up the claim.\n\nHowever, we can think about other things. Our growth can't keep going without hurting our planet. We're running out of oil, and we haven't found good new energy sources to replace oil yet. Hydrogen is there, but it costs more. Also, electric motors don't work as well as the ones we have now. So, if hydrogen becomes our only choice, it might be too expensive for a family to have more than one hydrogen-powered car.\n\nAnother thing that can change the number of cars is what our governments do. As I said, traffic gets worse every year. But we can't keep building new roads forever. There's a limit. We can see this in some big cities' choices. To drive into London, we have to pay. Milan is planning to do similar things. So maybe public transport will get much better.\n\nSome places have found other ways. The Netherlands, for example, has the most bicycles in the world. In Amsterdam, you see bikes everywhere, even outside bars, big stores, and fast food places. This is because the government made bike lanes. So the leaders have made people want to leave their cars at home.\n\nIn conclusion, I don't think the number of cars will go down on its own. There are too many businesses, like oil companies and car makers, that are big parts of our economy. Governments don't want to hurt them. But they, and we, might have to change how we live when things get too bad."}
{"file_id": "1099400.txt", "output_essay": "I don't agree that ideas and concepts are more important than facts for students. In my opinion, facts are just as important as ideas and concepts.\n\nFirst, ideas and concepts need facts to exist. For example, in physics, to learn about force, students must do experiments. They need to see that different forces are everywhere. If a teacher only shows a symbol for force, students will be confused. This could cause the teacher to lose their job.\n\nSecond, to pass tests, students must know both ideas and facts. In a biology test, they need to remember examples of animals to explain how they reproduce. Without facts, a student can't write what the teacher asks for. Some tests let students use books, but knowing facts by heart helps them save time.\n\nThird, knowing facts can help students get good jobs. I study computer science, which has a lot of programming. Math ideas help me understand computer theories. But when I looked for a job, knowing computer facts helped me get hired as a programmer.\n\nIn conclusion, ideas and concepts are important, but facts are just as important for students."}
{"file_id": "1090340.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with the statement because success is more about your attitude than your natural ability. Based on my own experiences as a student and worker, I want to back up this idea. While studying International Relations at a top university in Mexico, I learned about the world we live in. But early on, I found out that to get better at understanding international issues, I needed to study sociology more. Doing a lot of research on this topic has improved my ability to understand, negotiate, and see beyond the obvious. This is especially true when working with different cultures and viewpoints. One of my favorite writers, Dr. Kevin Skandia, talks about leadership and success in his book 'The Clash of Civilizations.' He says to be a leader and an innovator, you must think outside the box and challenge the usual ways to find better ones. Successful people know they might fail when they chase their goals. But they also know that facing failure is the best way to eventually succeed. In my job as a buyer for Walmart, a big global store, I've faced tough challenges. These have taught me that being creative and thinking of new ideas are key to doing well. To be successful, we must always look for new ways to do our tasks. The company often sends us to conferences and meetings, some international, where we exchange ideas. These discussions help us in our daily work. When talking with people from around the world, we sometimes chat about daily life choices. We remind each other to be confident and sure about what we do to succeed. I've always believed that only a few people dare to change their usual ways. These are the people who make changes and achieve their goals. So, I think successful people are those who try new things and take risks."}
{"file_id": "1099361.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with the statement, but I know there are some exceptions. These days, young people seem to only care about themselves. They don't think about people who need help because they don't know that such people exist. Their families give them too much, which makes the young people not know what's happening in their community or the world. Young people are being tricked by some companies, and they suffer because of it. Look at the food industry. They made a new perfect body image for women, and now most young girls worry about their weight more than anything. This silly idea stops them from thinking about helping their community!!! I am part of this generation, and I see that we are very focused on ourselves. Everyone expects us to be perfect, but that's not possible. So, we only focus on ourselves to try to be perfect. I know what I've written might seem a bit off-topic. But if I think about it, it is related. Young people want to be perfect, but this makes them not perfect in their behavior. It's the opposite of what they want. In the end, I do think my generation doesn't spend enough time or care to help others."}

Young people enjoy free time, playing with friends, exploring the world, and trying new things. Take summer break, for example. It's the busiest time of the year. They don't think about school. They play every day or go to the beach. I'm 22 years old. I love life because I can hang out with friends, dance, or go to bars. But I also love it because I have many chances to do things. I want to learn more, have a good job, and start a family. Older people have just as much fun as younger ones, but in their own way. They've moved past the busy part of their lives. They like calm and quiet places. My grandma is 78. She enjoys staying home to watch TV or read books. She loves cooking and chatting with friends. On vacation, she likes to sit in the sun, take walks, see beautiful views, or eat ice cream. Both young and old people enjoy life. They just have different interests and ways of living it.

To do this, they show the product as much better than it really is. So, the way a product looks and what it seems to stand for is now more important than what it does. Ads give us a symbol of status and shape our identity. The product tells a story about its owner, based on the story the ad tells. For instance, a Diet Coke is not just a drink to make you less thirsty or to have with a meal. It is something that makes you look good, slim, and like you enjoy life. Even the brand on your pencil says something about you. It could show you are hardworking and focused or even a rebel. I think ads do make products look much better than they are. They change what the product is really for into a sign of who you are and your social level. They are selling not just the product but also what it stands for. When you buy it, you're not just paying for the product. You're paying for what it represents."}

Others like to spend time with friends the most. But doing more things outside, playing games, or living faster doesn't always make life better. Young people might find fun in dancing at clubs or playing on computers. But these things might be dull for older people. Older people often like calm places. They enjoy reading, gardening, or doing other peaceful activities. In the summer, grandparents might go on trips with their grandkids. The kids usually swim at the pool or beach all day or play with friends. Grandparents often stay in or near their hotel to relax. This doesn't mean they're not having fun. It's not only about what they like. Their bodies need rest. So they choose calm activities, and this makes them happy. When young people see older ones resting or doing nothing, they might think they're not having fun. But that's not true. Teenagers these days spend a lot of time on computers, the internet, or watching TV. They sit in one room all day, staring at screens. Older people might find this boring. But young people think it's great fun. Everyone has their own favorite things to do. The truth is, if you do what you love, you'll enjoy life. It doesn't matter what others think or how it looks.

It's even more important to know how to use them than just to know facts. In high school, I noticed that most students found it easier to memorize facts than to really get the ideas and concepts. For example, I loved putting labels on the heart diagram in biology. But I hated trying to explain Newton's First Law of Motion in physics. However, when a test asked for a written answer, it was easier for students to write something good if they understood the topic, not just the facts. Another time, we had to form a group to tell everyone in school about helping with recycling and cleaning. Many of us did the work, but I'm not sure everyone knew why they were doing it. So, I think that to succeed in school and life, a student must understand ideas and concepts and be able to use them."}

They come back when needed, but ideas stay with you longer.\n\nIn 2005, I went to a Model UN debate. My classmates and I were picked to go for our school. We were new and didn't know what to do. Our strict teacher had us practice by acting out the previous year's debate. It took time, but we finally got it. We cleared up our confusion and got the point. Model UN is more than just a club. It teaches us to think for others, speak for the voiceless, and solve big world issues. We understood this even before we went. When we got to La Ceiba for the Model UN, we learned a lot.\n\nOur teacher could have just given us facts. That might have been a bit helpful.

Knowing a lot about many school subjects isn't helpful if we don't know one subject very well. It's like knowing a little about many things but not being an expert in any. Knowing about many subjects just means you know them. But to be an expert, you need to focus on one area. I think it's better to know one subject well than to know a little about many. Let's look at examples. A family doctor can treat many illnesses but might get stuck with serious ones. A doctor who is an expert in one area can handle tough diseases. In any job, an expert is better than someone who isn't an expert. In today's fast-moving world, experts are more important than non-experts. An expert can work on important research projects, but a non-expert can't. An expert can study deeply in their area and find good results. These results can help improve things for people in the area they studied."}
{"file_id": "1057852.txt", "output_essay": "Some might ask if we will have fewer cars in 20 years than we do now. I don't think so, for many reasons. This morning, on my way to a test, I read 'Le Monde' newspaper. It had an article about California suing car companies to reduce CO2 emissions. The article said California has about 36 million cars for 35 million homes. I believe California shows how important cars are for getting around its large area. California is also very rich and shows what could happen if a country grows and needs more cars. Many people think or worry that China will be much richer in 20 years. If China's economy grows by 7% each year, it could be as rich as California by 2026. China has about 1 billion people, which could mean 400 million homes and maybe 350 million cars for a richer China. I'm not saying China doesn't use cars now, but the number could grow a lot. We should also think about other growing places like India. Europe has many cars and is trying to cut pollution by using other types of transport. This works because Europe is smaller than huge places like India or China. As the number of people grows, there will be more people who can drive and buy cars. Since the 1920s, when the Ford T model came out, cars have been a sign of freedom. There's no sign that people will find a new symbol of freedom to take the car's place soon. If they do, and only the practical side of having a car is left, we might see more people using different ways to travel. But this probably won't happen in the next 20 years. Changing how people think takes time. Lastly, the idea that we will run out of oil soon is not right. People have said this before, but we keep finding more oil. Also, we are making new types of energy like biofuel and electric cars. Cars might be cleaner or old-fashioned in 20 years, but there won't be fewer of them as long as the population and economy keep growing."}

They believe getting good grades is more important than volunteering. So, they study more instead of volunteering. For example, my brother is in high school. When his school asked him to volunteer, he got mad. He thinks volunteering is a waste of time and won't help his grades. Also, young people don't feel connected to where they live, so they don't want to help much. They think they can move away anytime. So, they don't think they need to give time to help their local area. For example, the Korean TV station KBS reported that 70% of young people don't think they need to help their local area. They said it's because they don't feel a part of their communities. In the end, young people don't help their local areas as much as needed.

Knowing about many subjects also lets students find out what they like best and pick the major they want to study more deeply. I think that studying different subjects in the first and second years of school helps students know what's happening in the world. A student who learns about education, social studies, politics, arts, and math will understand the problems of their country and society better than someone who only knows about math. Students in their first year can't make good choices about their future career or major because they don't know enough.

If I had learned the basics of different subjects, I might have made a different choice, or at least I would be sure it was the right one for me.

If they don't talk to their neighbors, they won't think about their part in the community. Even though they learn about helping the community in school, not many actually do it. When you ask them, they say they don't have time. To fix this, we need to make young people's lives less busy. Schools should let out earlier so kids have time to be with their neighbors. Teachers should give less homework on weekends. This way, kids can really help out in the community. Parents should also not make their kids do too many activities or go to extra classes. If we don't change how schools work, they will teach kids to stay away from the community. Some might say that young people will just play on their computers instead of helping out.

Second, not as many people want to own cars as in the past. For instance, my parents really wanted a car when they were young. But now, at their age, I don't feel I need a car. The importance of having a car has changed. Third, we have improved other ways to travel, like trains, planes, and boats. There are many companies offering these services, and it's cheaper to use them now. Some might not agree with me. They might say the car market is still doing well, so the number of cars won't go down. In Japan, the market is indeed still active. I see many car ads on TV. People might still be buying new cars. However, I think the main focus has shifted. The big trend now is cars that don't pollute at all. Also, electric cars, which don't use oil, are well-known and liked.

If you learn from others, you can find the best way and improve your own thoughts. This makes you more sure of yourself. People who are sure of themselves can handle fast changes in society and technology. A study by scientists in an education magazine two months ago showed that about 65% of people are happy with their lives. This result tells us that sure people are more successful and happy. Students might forget what they learn, but if they understand the ideas behind the facts, they can think of new ideas and compare them with others. I have always been curious. This helped me get along well with my teachers and the people I work with. Being curious makes me someone with my own thoughts."}

This might make them less interested in the subject. Also, they won't be able to use what they know in real life. This is a key reason why students study. So, it's not more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts. \n\nUnderstanding ideas and concepts is about getting information from people who have been through them. If students can't see these ideas and concepts in action, they may not find the subject as interesting as they should. If students don't get to see the facts for themselves, they might start to question if the ideas and concepts are real. Not seeing how they work can make them less interested. This can hurt the way they learn. \n\nStudents who can't do things right in real life often don't have the experience that comes from learning facts themselves. As they grow and get ready to be important in society, they need to know a lot. They also need experience to use what they know in different situations. Students who only know about ideas and concepts from others won't be good at finding out things on their own. They won't know how to fit what they learn into the right places. \n\nIt's more important for students to learn facts.

From what I've seen, I believe people were happier as children. They just do what they feel like without worrying about what will happen next. \n\nFirst, I think kids are happier than grown-ups because they don't care about stuff like money. They just live and do what they want. They don't think about if it's possible or not. They follow their hearts. People often say adults are driven by money and their own interests. But kids? They just look for fun and joy. Take a young boy, for example. He doesn't worry about what his mom is doing. But his mom has to look after him, keep him safe, and protect him from harm. \n\nKids are also usually healthy. This means they can enjoy life without worrying about money, work, or other problems. They spend a lot of time playing with friends and not getting interrupted. \n\nFrom my experience, being a kid is the best time in life. You don't have to worry about anything but playing outside. You don't stress about your future or the world around you. But it's not right to say adults can't enjoy life. It's just that they have more to think about."}

After the product is for sale, they need to make it more popular to sell more of it. Advertising helps sell as many products as possible, no matter the quality or how well they work. I want to stress that ads often make products look much better than they are. We've all seen a TV ad for a product that we like because it seems useful or it promises to make us happy. But when we buy it, it's not as good as we thought. Some people feel cheated, but really, the ad is just doing its job: getting people interested in buying the product. Ads want to convince you that their product is the best in quality, price, and how it works. To do this, the people who make ads study what the people who might buy the product do, what they like, and what they dream about. This way, they can show the product in the best way and at the best time. They want to make it seem like you can't live without it. It's true that some products are as good as their ads say, but most are not. We need to be careful and really think about what ads are telling us. Even if the ad makers know what I might want or how I might act, they can't make me do anything. Only I control what I do."}

In twenty years, cars may be more high-tech, but I don't think there will be fewer cars. In Saudi Arabia, families often have about 2 cars each. Cars need to be looked after. They need energy and gas. The only thing that might make us use cars less is if we run out of oil. We know oil won't last forever on Earth. We might run out in 50 years. Still, people are good at finding answers. We might make new cars that use different energy, like the sun. Some of these cars are already being tested around the world. This shows we can find a way to fix problems. I believe cars are helpful, even if they pollute the air. They have helped people for a long time. But if we run out of oil, cars won't be useful anymore. Running out of oil could be the main reason cars might become useless.

This growth means we can't expect fewer cars on the road. The car business is also key to making money for many countries. It's tough to change this business quickly. Experts are working to make better cars with new tech. We are seeing more cars that don't harm the environment as much. These cars could pollute less soon. Some people talk about new kinds of transport that could replace cars, like better buses and trains. But I don't think this will mean we have fewer cars. New industries are popping up and helping each other grow. Finding new fuels, like alcohol or gas, shows that new cars will be very important soon.

Here's why I believe young people have more fun than older people. First, young people have lots of energy. They like sports, trips, and work. They can do lots of things. Even when they're tired, they keep going. After a good sleep, they're ready for the next day. Also, young people usually don't have big health issues. Many older people do, even if they live healthy lives. It's because they're older. Young people don't have these problems as much. Plus, young people and older people live differently. I once went to a place where older people live. Someone who plans activities there told me that my visits could help the residents have less boring days. They often stay inside because it's hard for them to go out alone. So, they might just sit and watch TV. But young people can go out whenever they want. They can choose what to do every day. Older people don't have as many choices. These points show that young people usually have more fun than older people. Young people have advantages that let them enjoy life more. They should have fun. If young people help make life fun for older people, then older people will have more fun than before."}

The job market is very competitive, and education is seen as key for a good future. This means many young people don't have time to help in their communities because they are busy with school or college work. Young people today also have many choices for how to spend their free time. With so many things to do, they may not think about helping others. TV, computers, and the internet are just some ways they can spend their time. With so many choices, young people can feel overwhelmed. Some young people don't help out because they are simply too lazy. The term 'couch potatoes' describes young people who just sit around at home or elsewhere. This could be because their parents are often at work all day and can't guide them. Or it could be because video games and other activities keep them indoors. Another point is that life is better now for many people, and this has made some young people careless and uninterested in helping. They are happy with what they have and don't see why they should help others, including their community. For these reasons, I think young people don't help their community enough. They have many interests that don't involve their community. This could be their friends, media, school, and many other things. They also don't get much guidance from parents or other adults who could show them how good it is to help their community."}

The way we pick to travel depends a lot on where we want to go. I have found that going with a group and a tour guide is best when visiting a new place or city.\n\nThere are a few reasons for this. The main reason is the language. We might go to a place where we don't speak the language. A tour guide can help us with things like booking a hotel and finding places to eat.\n\nAlso, when we don't know much about the local ways and culture, a tour guide can teach us. This helps us get ready for our trip.\n\nAnother reason is that we usually want to see many new things and learn about the history, art, and culture. A tour guide who knows a lot can give us this information. If we go alone, we could do these things, but it would take more time. Lastly, going with a group is safer. There can be dangers when we travel, and the group can help if something goes wrong.\n\nIn the end, if I'm going to a new place, I like to go with a group and a good tour guide.

{"file_id": "1099643.txt", "output_essay": "I believe that ads are the best way to sell things. Selling things and making money from them is part of a very important process. Ads are key in this process because if there is no ad, not many people will know about the product. If people don't know about it, you can't sell much. If you don't sell much, people won't trust your product. If your product isn't trusted, you won't make money. Without money, you can't make your products, and your business will shut down. Look at big companies like Coca-Cola. They are huge and have factories all over because they showed their drink to the world with ads. Even in Turkey, they have big ads. Every month, they make a new 'fun' ad to get people to buy Coca-Cola. They spend a lot of money on ads to keep selling their drink, even though it's not healthy. Fast food ads are another example. We know fast foods are bad for us. They have things in them that our bodies don't need. But when you see a McDonald's ad on TV or a Burger King sign, you start to want a burger, a Coke, and fries, even though they are bad for you. Ads make things look much better than they are. You end up wanting them, even if they are bad for you. This isn't just for food and drinks; it's the same for car ads, video game ads, clothes ads, or almost anything else."}

It doesn't help people get better or learn the real meaning of the facts. For example, in science, if we don't know the main idea behind a fact, we can't see how it links to other facts. If we don't teach our students the big ideas behind facts, we'll just make them like walking books, not smart and effective thinkers. They need to understand the reasons, causes, effects, and growth related to the facts. Knowing a fact alone isn't enough. There's something before and after a fact. If students understand both, it all makes sense and forms a clear picture in their heads. Without this, the information won't stick. Also, students need to know the big ideas to make learning easier. Imagine teaching them about gravity. If you don't explain the causes and just say the earth pulls us, what will they learn? Probably nothing. To sum up, people always want to know the 'why' behind things. That's why it's key for students to learn the big ideas and concepts."}
{"file_id": "1106858.txt", "output_essay": "The statement says that students should focus on understanding ideas and concepts instead of just memorizing them. I face this problem as a student almost every day. On one side, it's important to understand the theory behind all facts and new information. This helps to really know how things work. On the other side, it's also important to learn new words or how things are connected. Without this basic knowledge, it's hard to talk to others because they won't get what you're saying. I think there's no simple answer to whether a student should memorize everything new or just understand the facts. We need a balance of both ways. If you just want to repeat information, then memorizing facts might be enough. But when you need to come up with new ideas and see how different things are linked, it's key to understand the basics of the new information. Today, everyone can get to knowledge through things like books or the internet. It's just about knowing where to look and how long it takes to find it. With so much information online, like on Wikipedia, it's not so important to remember every detail. With these tools, finding the right topic and any information, which is too much to remember all of it, only takes a few seconds. In the end, I hope that in more areas than now, students will learn the 'why' behind the facts. They should learn this instead of just the facts and things they will never use in that situation in the future."}

Some have started to use different things, like hybrid cars. These cars use both electricity and oil. Experts are working hard to use hydrogen (H), which is common on Earth. If they succeed, it could help us rely less on other fuels.\n\nCountries are trying to get more people to use public transport, like buses and trains. For instance, in the United Arab Emirates, they are building a big train system right now. They want to reduce how much we need cars. But not everyone will always use the train or bus.\n\nMany people have jobs that mean they need to go to different places often. Some don't want to use public transport or can't because of health reasons. They will always need their own way to get around that is also comfortable. Cars meet this need.\n\nSo, cars will continue to be used and won't become less common than they are now. New energy sources are being made, and maybe we'll find even more.

First, it's very helpful to have a guide when we're in a new place. A guide keeps us together and stops us from getting lost. This helps the group stay as one and saves time for enjoying our trip. Second, a guide tells us about all the important spots to see. We don't miss anything and don't waste time looking for places to go. Third, a guide knows a lot about the places we visit. They can answer questions about how, why, and when things happened there. This means we learn a lot. Another good thing is talking to local people. Without a guide, it can be hard to talk to them. A guide can speak their language and help us understand them. This stops us from getting confused about things like directions. Also, a guide can help us find cheaper places to stay. This can save us money. So, for all these reasons, I think having a guide is worth it, even if it costs a bit more."}

Often, this makes their products look much better than they really are. For example, if you see a girl enjoying candy or chocolate on TV, you might want to eat that candy right away. If you buy it, you may find it's not as tasty as you thought. But by then, you've already bought it, and the company has made another sale. However, some companies know this trick only works once. If you try the product and it's not as great as the ad said, you won't trust the company and won't buy from them again. So, these companies try to be honest about what their product is like. If customers aren't let down, they'll keep buying from them. To sum up, some ads make products look better than they are to sell more. But other companies want to be honest and build trust for the long run. I believe being honest is the best way. That way, people can trust your company and keep buying your products. Over time, with lots of sales, your company will likely become well-known and last a long time."}

Just studying one subject isn't enough today. For example, to be a doctor, a student needs to study science subjects like biology, chemistry, physics, and math. They also need to study other subjects like politics, economics, and humanities. This helps them understand how things work around them.\n\nI am studying engineering. I've finished most of my science courses, but I've also studied history, art, and sociology. These courses helped me see the value of other subjects. They made me understand topics like politics, history, sociology, and world religions better. I was surprised to learn how these subjects help us understand our society. After studying these, I now see people and society differently, in a good way.\n\nSomeone who only learns about one subject may find it hard to find a job. Their knowledge is limited. Today, companies want people who know about many areas, not just one. For example, a computer programmer who knows about electronics has better job chances than one who only knows programming.\n\nI believe it's very important to know about many parts of life. At universities, it's common for students to have two majors. This means they study two subjects. They do this because they know what companies want after they finish school.

This belief lasted until someone proved it wrong. I completely disagree with this for several reasons. First, these ideas could be incorrect, so it's silly to have students believe them. Instead, we should watch them come up with their own ideas. Also, some ideas can be bad. For example, in my culture, people used to believe that some tribe members could return after death. Another reason I disagree is that students are our future leaders. They will need their own ideas to handle the changing world. In the end, I don't agree with the idea that students should just learn other people's big ideas.

{"file_id": "1098553.txt", "output_essay": "The statement says that understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning facts. Let's first understand the difference between 'ideas and concepts' and 'facts'. Ideas and concepts are the basic thinking or logic behind anything that happens. For example, terms like Uncle, Father, Mother, and so on, are used in different cultures to show not just family ties, but also social status, power, and money situations. Facts are clear examples or things that can be easily understood in their situation. For example, Uncle is a term for a father's or mother's brother. But in many cultures, uncle is also used for any older man, even if they are not related by blood. This means that it is hard to separate 'ideas and concepts' from 'facts'. They are connected in many ways. We come up with ideas and concepts by looking at how facts are alike. If we see that in a culture, all people who give food and safety are called 'Father/Mother', it shows that these terms mean more than just blood ties. It's not by chance that Hitler was called 'Führer', which means father. Once an idea or concept is seen and set by looking at facts, it helps us understand all new facts. It shows whether they agree with or go against the idea or concepts. So, looking at facts starts and refines concepts. With this in mind, it's wrong to think that ideas and concepts are against facts. Both are key for true learning. Students need to understand a 'concept' by taking in facts. At the same time, a concept or idea helps take in many facts. Both are needed for full learning."}

It doesn't matter if you see the ad on TV or in a magazine, it will have some effect on you right away. There are two main ways to explain this effect. One is about what you see, and the other is about how it makes you feel inside. \n\nWe all know that ads try very hard to make things look good. The people who make ads work hard to show their products in the best way. They will try many times and take many steps to make a perfect ad. When they finally show the ad, it can trick people. It makes them think the product is better than it really is. \n\nThe second effect is about how we think and feel. Sometimes, we like things in ads because we can't have them. They might be too expensive for us. We often want things we can't get. So, when we see something in an ad that we can't buy right away, we want it even more. This makes the product seem even better. \n\nIn the end, ads affect us in different ways, but the result is the same. It's not about good or bad. It's about knowing what's real and what's not. People who watch ads need to think carefully and understand what's true. Sometimes, we just think we need to buy something. Later, we might see that it was a mistake."}
{"file_id": "1108762.txt", "output_essay": "I completely agree that in about twenty years, we will see a lot fewer cars on the road than we do now. Even though car sales are rising every year right now, issues like pollution, lack of space, and people knowing more will lead to more people taking buses and trains to get around. As gas prices go up and become too expensive for many people, they are starting to see that having a car costs too much. It's very unlikely that gas prices will go down because we don't have a lot of fossil fuels left. Cars that use different kinds of energy like fuel cells or solar power are still not cheap enough for most people. These reasons make it clear that people will start to depend on buses and trains to solve their problems. Taking public transport is cheaper and studies show it's safer than driving a car. Big cities are getting more crowded, and this means there's not enough room on the roads and in parking areas. People are tired of being stuck in traffic for a long time and looking for parking spots. They understand that if more people ride buses and trains, there will be more room on the roads and it will save time. Bikes are becoming popular again because they don't pollute and they're good for your health. For example, many people in China ride bikes to work every day. So, it looks like the goal of 'Ford', the well-known car company, to have a car for everyone might not happen. The government is pushing for people to use public transport and telling them why having and driving a car is not good. We will sadly see the end of the car era, but it's something we need to do."}

I believe that learning facts is just as important as understanding big ideas. Facts are things we know are true and they form the foundation of our big ideas. It's hard to tell if big ideas are right or wrong because everyone sees things differently. We used to think the Earth or the Sun was at the center of everything, but that's not true. Also, big ideas can shape our thoughts and sometimes lead us in the wrong direction, away from the truth. For example, scientists studying brain cells didn't make progress for years because they held on to old ideas. They thought all brain cells used electricity to send messages and ignored other types of cells. Lastly, facts give us something to look at and can spark new ideas in scientists. When we learn facts, we can think for ourselves and choose the best way to think. It's said that we must go through hard times to get wise. If you struggle with your own thoughts and understand what the facts mean, you will be better at solving problems. This way, people grow up and learn important life lessons, which are not just about how to live well."}

First, let's talk about ads for cell phone services like Hutch and Airtel. They claim to be the best in price, quality, and service. But after we sign up, they charge us extra fees that weren't shown in the ads. This is really like tricking people. Second, many products look great in ads, which makes us think they are the real deal. But when we use them, they don't work as well as we hoped, even though they are expensive. This includes soaps, shampoos, and many beauty products. The look of these items and how they are shown in ads make us want to buy them. Third, ads often use famous people to sell products. People buy these products just because a celebrity they like is in the ad. In India, famous movie stars advertise drinks like Coke and Pepsi. People started drinking them, even though tests showed they had dangerous chemicals. When the news talked about this, people drank less of these drinks. Sometimes, ads make us think products are new and improved, but they are not. Today, the world moves with ads. A product can only be successful if it is advertised well. In conclusion, advertising is a powerful way for companies to sell their products. They do this by making people believe in what they are selling."}

It's true that a tour guide can show you all the popular places tourists go. You're sure not to miss any important spots. But, a tour guide also cuts into your free time. When you're with friends, you want to hang out as you like. You don't want to stick to a tour guide's schedule. Also, in big groups, people often want to see different things. This can lead to fights. Sure, a tour guide might stop these fights by making everyone follow the day's plan. But there's a better way. The group can split up. Everyone can visit what they want. Then, they can meet up later. This way, if people are together too long and start to argue, splitting up gives them a break from each other. The main reason to travel without a tour guide is that it lets you talk to locals and learn about the culture more. When you find your way around a new city by yourself, you learn things a tour guide can't show you. So, I suggest that when you travel with friends, don't get a tour guide.

If being successful means having money, and someone is seen as successful but isn't as rich as Bill Gates, there's no one way to be successful. But even then, the chance for success changes based on what we think success is or how successful they are.\n\nIt seems that the chance for success comes to those who are ready to try something new. This is because in areas where people know they can make money, many have already made money. This leaves little for others, which is like a monopoly. It's similar to how a few places still make a lot of money from oil and gas, but it's hard for new people to get into that business because it's already full.\n\nIn some cases, like how someone looks, how smart they are, or how much money they get from their parents, the best way to have a better chance at success is to go into unknown areas. Even if it's risky because it's new, people who stick to what they know can't keep up with those who try new things and reach amazing success, not just regular success.\n\nI want amazing success, as I said before. To get there, I need to be more creative. I need to be creative enough to find something new and dive into it. There's a saying back home, 'If water doesn't move, it gets dirty.'"}
{"file_id": "1104012.txt", "output_essay": "In a world full of learning and many educational choices, one can pick from lots of subjects. It is better to know a lot about many school subjects than to only know a lot about one subject. A student might want to learn only what he needs for his job. For example, an architect would study Physics and Math because these help with his work. But learning about English books and the environment can also help him in life. Knowing about the environment can help him choose safe building materials. He will know more after he finishes school. When we go to school, we learn about many things like History and Geography. Have you ever asked, 'Why? How will this help me later? Will I need to know what happened in my country a long time ago? Will someone ask me how tall Mt. Everest is in twenty years?' This might seem pointless when you're young. But as you grow up and face life's challenges, you see that this knowledge is important. We remember that Mt. Everest is 8,848 meters tall and gets taller every year. This makes us feel proud and happy that we remember such small facts. Focusing on one subject can help a student learn it well and be perfect at it. This can give the student an advantage. But when we start working and want to change our lives, other people's lives, or the world, we see that knowing about many subjects is better than just one. Knowledge gives us power, and with power comes the need to do good things. We should use what we know to improve the world."}
{"file_id": "1097636.txt", "output_essay": "I believe that people who try to be different can be very successful. Some may argue that these people often fail because they take big risks. But I think most of them do well when we look at what they achieve for themselves. I like the idea that people should do the best they can with what they have. Even if they don't succeed, they still have their own kind of success. This success means that being happy about overcoming their own limits is important. For example, a man left a large company to open a small coffee shop. He was excited to make the shop work, but it closed down. Still, I read in a magazine that he was happy because he learned what he could and couldn't do. I believe that understanding your limits is a form of success because it can help you live a better life later on. Doing what everyone else can do is too simple. In such cases, even if people earn money, I don't think it's real success. Take the car industry, for example. After Henry Ford made cars for regular people, many others tried to do the same. But they were just copying him. Even if some of them make a lot of money, I don't see them as truly successful. They are just doing what the great man did. Sure, these followers can be very successful. They can cut costs and get lots of customers. They might be seen as successful. But in my view, the real winners are those who try new things and take big risks."}

Before I studied medicine, I was a paramedic. I met many people, both old and young. I often chatted with them. Each person had their own story. They liked sharing their views on life and their past with me. Now, I want to talk about two important talks I had. The first was with an old lady, around 80, living in a nursing home. She was very ill but always smiling. We talked a lot when we met. She shared wonderful stories about her life with her husband, Karl, who passed away two years before. She was always happy with herself and the world. I asked her one day why she was so happy. She laughed and said, 'Young lady, I know life can be hard; I've seen it. But that's why I'm happy. I thank God for what I have and enjoy every day. It's all about your attitude.' The second talk was with a girl my age. She wanted to end her life because her boyfriend had left her. She thought her life was now pointless. I believe the original statement is wrong. We must look at each person as an individual. It's all about how you see things!"}
{"file_id": "1085846.txt", "output_essay": "In the past 100 years, advertising has grown into a big and important job for people. It is everywhere: on TV, in the streets, in the subway, and on our cars. We can't escape it. Some people think that 'Most ads make products look much better than they really are.' Is that true? Is advertising really that simple? Do advertisers worry about making customers unhappy when the product doesn't match the ad? Let's think about this. It seems clear that advertisers won't make their products look bad. They get paid to sell things to people who didn't even want to buy them, who sometimes didn't even need them. They have to make customers feel like they need the product and want to buy it. How can they do this without making the product look great, even better than it is, like selling a dream? They don't mean to, but they end up giving people hope. Like when you see an ad that makes you think the product is just what you've been looking for, or that it's way better than any other. That's why in soap ads, the clothes look the whitest and softest, or in shampoo ads, the actor's hair looks the shiniest. But do advertisers always do this? Aren't they scared that people will stop buying a product if it's not as good as the ad said? Some advertisers use different ways to sell their products. They might talk badly about other products to make theirs look better. What matters is that people choose their product over others. Coca-Cola once made an ad where a little girl is upset in a funny way when she gets a Pepsi instead of the Coca-Cola she asked for. Ads can also use tricks to make people curious, like telling them not to watch a movie because it's bad. In the end, I think that even though there are other ways to advertise, most ads make products look better than they are. These days, even when people know ads aren't always true, they still get pulled in. That's how our society of buying and using things has grown so much."}
{"file_id": "1085090.txt", "output_essay": "I really agree with the idea that successful people try new things and take risks instead of just doing what they already know well. Here's why I think this way.\n\nThe world is changing a lot. If people keep doing the same old things, we won't get ahead in life. What if Alexander Graham Bell never tried new things with communication? What if the Wright Brothers didn't take risks with flying? Success comes from thinking in new and creative ways.\n\nStudies show our minds are very creative. They can think about many things in many ways. We shouldn't limit our thoughts to old ideas or always follow strict rules. Sometimes rules are important, but not always. We should start trying new things when we're kids. For example, when solving a math problem, a child should try to find their own way to the answer, not just use the teacher's method. This helps the child really understand and remember the problem, which leads to success later in life.\n\nAt first, people might criticize our new ideas. But we shouldn't stop because of that. Many great people were criticized, like Einstein. To be successful, we need to keep going with our ideas and creativity. We need to try new things, take risks, leave old ways behind, and ignore criticism. We should prove the critics wrong.\n\nSuccess often comes with risk. Nothing great comes easy. We shouldn't be scared of taking risks but should aim for the success that follows. Success that comes from risk feels better than easy success. 'The reward from a big risk tastes sweeter.'\n\nHistory has shown, and will show again, that trying new things, thinking in new ways, and taking risks leads to great success. That's why I stand by my opinion."}

How can you help your community with the time you have? As a twenty-year-old student, I think that you never have enough time for everything you want to do in your daily life. I believe that giving time to others or joining an activity takes a lot of kindness and a strong promise to do so. It's not easy to help our community when you have work, home, and children to take care of. To live well, we must make choices all the time. Also, we can look at the problem in another way. If you live in a big city, it's harder to help the community than if you live in the countryside. In small villages, everyone knows each other. More people living close together makes it easier and quicker to connect and have important gatherings. Clearly, communities grow with the help of young people. I don't think it's true that young people don't give enough time to the community. For instance, at work, your boss might give you big tasks. Even if you didn't ask for them, you have to manage and help your company. But we often forget that this work might be for science research, which then helps the community improve. It's not right to say that young people don't help the community enough; they just do it in a different way. They are still part of this big world."}
{"file_id": "1114907.txt", "output_essay": "Ads usually show the best parts of a product. They suggest the product is really good. But ads often hide when a product is not good. They try to make their product look better than others to make more money. So, products can look much better in the ad than they really are. I think ads make products look better by using famous people like athletes, singers, and actors. But this doesn't mean the product is good. I believe the best way to know if a product is good is to ask people who have used it. If a famous athlete wears some shoes or a singer eats at a restaurant in an ad, they do it for money. They don't do it because the product is good. You should not decide until you try the product or ask others about it. However, if the ad gives some real facts about the product or shares what people have noticed, that could be more useful."}
{"file_id": "1107261.txt", "output_essay": "The writer says that young people have more fun than older people. I think this is true because older people were young once. Young people have more fun because babies don't know about life. As they grow, they go to school and learn things. When they get older, they have fun with friends. Friends are important because they help when you have problems. Sometimes, parents can't help, but true friends can. During special times, friends get together, have parties, and have fun. Young people should enjoy life because the past doesn't come back. On holidays, people watch movies for fun and play games like cricket. Watching movies with friends is fun. They feel happy and dance in movie theaters. Friends meet and spend time together during festivals. In college, there are contests and sports. We can join in and have fun. We can also go on trips with college or by ourselves. We enjoy the weather and study. When exams are near, we study hard. Friends can help if we don't understand something. This helps us do well on tests. Older people can't do all this. They can't eat everything and have to take medicine every day. This is hard for them. They also have stress and rush in life. In the end, I believe that older people were young and had fun too. But it's true that everyone should enjoy their life in the best way they can."}
{"file_id": "1114825.txt", "output_essay": "More and more students are starting to think that it is better to understand ideas and concepts. Sadly, some other students believe that remembering facts is the most important part of their learning. But after thinking about it a lot, I believe that understanding ideas is better. I want to share some reasons why I think this way. First, understanding ideas and concepts helps students learn on their own. This is very important for their education. For example, at the start, students need a teacher's help. Later on, they have to solve problems on their own. They get better at solving problems when they understand the ideas taught in class. Also, when students understand things by themselves, they feel more sure of themselves. Plus, understanding ideas and concepts is the best way to check on students. If they don't get it, they will probably fail their tests. For all these reasons, which are all connected and make a strong argument, we can say that teachers should help students learn to understand ideas and concepts in class. This is the only way to give a good education. It's also the only way to make students more confident and to check on their learning well."}
{"file_id": "1109886.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with this idea for four reasons: color, size, words, and how people feel. The first reason is the effect of color. In fact, colors easily influence me. For example, I always notice the colors in ads. My mind cares about color first, then the type of person I am. Even if something isn't made well, I might buy it because I like its color. The second reason is size. When we look at ads, we can't tell how big things really are. This can be a problem when buying big things like fridges or cars. Even though shopping online is often cheaper, it's easy to be surprised by how big or small something is when it arrives. The third reason is words. Words can really change how we feel. Here's an example: a shop that sells old clothes has 100 items left. They sell a few each day. The owner is confused. One day, he puts up a sign that says: 'Only 50 items left!!' Suddenly, everything sells out in one day. This shows that words are very powerful in ads. The last reason is how people feel, or their personality. On TV, famous people often promote products. The truth is, these ads can do really well or not, depending on the famous person."}
{"file_id": "1120486.txt", "output_essay": "I think that people who do well are those who try new things and take chances instead of just doing what they are good at. I have three reasons for thinking this way.\n\nFirst, taking chances helps you find new chances. I believe the bigger the chance you take, the more you might win. To win, you will have to work hard, and this will make you tougher.\n\nSecond, when you take a chance and try something new, you can see things differently and learn more. This can make you more successful. For instance, I joined the cheerleading team at my high school, which was a big step for me. I was very shy and didn't like being in front of people. But cheerleading gave me the bravery to perform in front of others. The training was tough, and it made me tougher than before.\n\nThird, trying new things lets us meet new people and hear what they think. It also gives us a fresh way of looking at things.\n\nThese are my reasons for agreeing with the idea."}
{"file_id": "1073147.txt", "output_essay": "I think it's better to know a lot about many school subjects than just one. Knowing about many things helps us see the big picture and gives us more choices for what to study in depth later on. Nowadays, many jobs need us to know about different things because they involve all sorts of skills and knowledge from subjects like math, science, and chemistry. This wide knowledge helps us more than just knowing one subject. For example, as lawyers, we need to know about more than just law. We also need to understand money matters and people. This helps us do our job better and solve problems with more information. Also, when we learn about many subjects in school, we have more options to pick what we want to major in at college. Right now, I'm trying to decide what to major in. I've studied different subjects but still don't know which one is the best fit for me. This choice is important because I'll use what I learn in my job after college and make money from it. If I pick a major I don't like or can't do well in, it will be hard for me to succeed later. Knowing about many things makes it easier to choose what I like and do well in my studies. In conclusion, even though being really good at one subject is useful for some people, like artists, I believe that knowing about many subjects is better than just one. It's bedtime, so goodbye."}
{"file_id": "1099127.txt", "output_essay": "The thought that students should learn ideas instead of facts doesn't make sense. I strongly disagree with this thought for many reasons. I believe that young people need to learn facts about life and science in different areas. They need these facts to create their own ideas. If not, they will end up confused about ideas and concepts. It's a step-by-step process. For instance, I can't imagine a student inventing something new without first knowing all the basic facts about how it works and the science behind it. If they don't, they might create a disaster. Another point is that learning facts opens up a student's mind. Then, he can figure out the concepts and main ideas on his own. He learns how things work. Only after learning the basics can he start to explore and connect new ideas and theories. Young students might think they know a lot if they focus on ideas. But this is only good if they really know the facts and how to use them right. Also, education is about doing things. If students don't learn facts and do assignments from a young age, they might not want to help the world get better. We need to teach students all about human knowledge when they are young. If we ignore teaching facts and basic science, we will have an uneducated generation. In the end, I think students should learn facts and the basics of science. This is better than just giving them ideas and concepts. It will help them more in their future jobs."}
{"file_id": "1090338.txt", "output_essay": "Successful people try new things and take chances instead of just doing what they are good at. This is true because someone who tries new ways and takes chances often does well. But, success is not sure to happen. If a person keeps doing what he is good at, he won't lose anything. He will stay the same, with no growth. Some people like to be safe and have a life without worry. But, taking chances can be hard. You can grow by trying new things and coming up with new ideas. It's important to think carefully about the risks and how to make decisions. Many businesses do well because they take chances and use new ideas. These people want to enjoy life a lot and are clear about what they want. They work hard to get it.\n\nI think people should take chances, but they should also be careful. They should know the good and bad points of taking the chance. They should only take chances they can handle. Without taking chances, a person can't get what he wants. He will have to be okay with what he has. People who really want to get something take chances. Some win and some lose. So, you need to plan well to reach your goal and move forward. Taking a risk can have big results. You can either do really well or fail. So, people should take chances knowing what could happen. Taking risks is not for everyone. Those who can't handle losing should not try it."}

First, we need to look at why a person who always succeeds might take more risks than others. When you do well in a project, you're happy. The more you get what you want, the more sure of yourself you feel. It's like a cycle: the more you have, the more you want. For example, if you start a business and it does well, you might think about growing it. If you're already running a big company, you might try new things. That's why big companies like Bouygues work in construction and mobile phones. Virgin makes music discs and also has mobile phone services. These companies take chances by going into new areas. They trust they will do well because their customers support them. But, not all new things come from people who are already successful. Being creative is about who you are, not how successful you are. An artist might not always do well. But they will still want to create. This is why many painters have done great things after many failures. Take Alain Baraton, a well-known gardener at Versailles. He didn't do well in school. But when he worked at Versailles, he fell in love with gardening and made new designs around the castle. Also, you can't always succeed, but that doesn't mean you don't want to try new things. Plus, a person who wants to be known by others and hasn't yet might try even harder. In the end, being successful isn't as connected to being brave as the statement says."}
{"file_id": "1107011.txt", "output_essay": "Travel is important for many families. There are two big problems when traveling: one is going with a group led by a tour guide, and the other is traveling alone to a place. I think it's best to travel with a tour guide. They know the local culture and history of the places we see. Some places can be dangerous for tourists, and a guide can keep us safe from going there by mistake. The best part of having a guide is learning a lot about the place. We can understand the local ways of life and enjoy our trip more. We also get to learn about different beliefs and important symbols. So, I believe it's good to have a tour guide with us. Another point is about famous buildings or statues. With a guide, we can learn about them. For example, if we go to see the Statue of Liberty in Manhattan, a guide can tell us why it's important. Without a guide, we might not get why it's special. In the end, traveling with a guide helps us get the most out of our visit. We learn about different cultures and this can help people from around the world get along better. This could lead to a peaceful and thankful world."}
{"file_id": "1093616.txt", "output_essay": "People don't always succeed by trying new things and taking risks, even though it can be important. If someone knows how to succeed, because they found out how or someone told them, they should keep doing it the same way unless they want to change or have to. Carlo Ancelotti, the coach of AC Milan, a top Italian soccer team, said before the Champions League final, 'A team that wins doesn't change.' The next day, AC Milan used the same players and won the Champions League, the biggest soccer tournament. Just like Ancelotti said, if something works, it's often best to leave it as it is to win again. But not everyone has this chance in life. That's when a person should try new things and take risks. For example, the son of a big factory owner won't have a hard time being successful at work (if that's what he wants) because he inherits a business that's already doing well. But a worker in the factory with great skills doesn't make much money and can't use all his talents. If he never risks anything or tries something new, he'll always work there and may never be very successful. If he starts his own business, even though it's risky, he has a better chance to succeed. Still, when we look at all of society, taking risks might be needed to succeed and grow. Competition is a big reason for this. Often, people are pushed by others who want to succeed by being creative. Sadly, sometimes one person's win means another's loss. This keeps going on forever. But the good part is that society will always get new and better things. So, success doesn't always come from being new and risky, but sometimes that's what's needed."}

The earth is in trouble because of all the dirty air. A big cause of this dirty air is that there are so many cars. Cars are a popular way to get around. But in many places, they are not used well. For example, often only one person rides in a car when there could be three or four. We need to change this. It's not hard. We need to act better when it comes to environmental problems. One thing we can do is ride buses and trains more. If we do this, we won't need as many cars. And with fewer cars, we'll have cleaner air. I'm sure this is why we'll have fewer cars in twenty years. I imagine a future with not as many cars, cleaner air, and more care for the environment. I picture happy children playing in city parks, yelling and laughing, and people with big smiles.

If people only do what they are good at, they can be successful to a point but won't reach the very top. Everyone sees success differently. It depends on how much risk they want to take. For some, success is being happy and at peace. For others, it means being the best in the world. They will take more risks. Take cricket, for example. A batsman who wants to score fast must play risky shots. He might do well or he might not. It's about whether he is willing to risk it for success.

I fully agree that 'it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts,' for two reasons.\n\nMy first reason is that we can't teach every idea and piece of information at school. There isn't enough time. This is why students should learn to grasp ideas and concepts. For instance, I had a math class last year. We talked about different theories. There were many theories, but we only had class once a week for a few months. The teacher made sure we really got the subject. Then, we could figure out other theories on our own.\n\nMy second reason is that school teaches us to use ideas in our life after school. If we get the ideas and concepts at school, we can use them later in life. This makes all the information and ideas valuable. For example, I am working now, and last week I faced a tough problem at work. My time at university with my math project really helped. I had understood the idea in the project well. I also felt that my time at university was well spent.\n\nIn conclusion, it is more important for students to get ideas and concepts than to learn facts. This understanding helps them later on.

Sometimes, ads can even be seen as cheating if they include lies about the products or make promises they can't keep. Companies and sellers should only talk about the real benefits and features of what they sell. They should make their products look good without lying. A good and truthful way to show products in ads is to list the parts and materials used to make them. If a company uses high-quality materials, they can say how good these materials are. Fair ads also show the hard work that goes into making products and the careful planning needed for quality. Some ads use cultural sayings or ideas to connect with customers. For example, putting children's toys in bright boxes is okay because it doesn't lie about the toy. Around the world, companies are naming their products in ways that sound great, but this isn't tricking decision-makers. Ads that focus on what customers need and promise to meet those needs are also fair.

Take billboards for example. We see fast food ads with a big burger. They say buy one, get one free. We go to the restaurant excited for the deal. But the burger is so small! Even eating 10 won't fill us up. The ad's big letters tricked us. Then there's skin cream. Ads say it will make your skin white in 4 weeks. People buy it and use it for a month. But they see no change. We wonder if it's us or the cream that's the problem. There are many more examples. Like the 'best seller' on TV. They show many products. They look good on TV. But when we buy them, they break in a week. They are poor quality. Laundry detergent ads are another example. They spill things on a shirt. They wash it and it's perfectly white. It's like magic. Ads for clothes, electronics, and cars also have a big effect. Some people buy things just because a famous person is in the ad. I think good companies don't need to push their products hard. Some companies make a lot of money without TV ads. People buy from them because they trust them. We can tell if a medicine is good or not. If a company advertises a lot, it might mean their medicine isn't that great. Ads are needed but should be more honest. It's better to be truthful than to sell a dream."}

We must come back when the guide says, even if we have free time. We can't stay longer to see more. We can't visit places we like if they are not part of the tour, even if they are close by. If we travel on our own, we don't have to worry about time. We can stay as long as we want at a place. We can also plan our trip the way we want. This means we don't have to go to places we don't like. We can just visit the places we are interested in. I think planning the trip is part of the fun of traveling. We might run into some problems if we plan it ourselves. But when the trip is over, we feel very happy. So, I don't agree."}

So, what do we lose if we learn something new? By learning from life, we become more open to new ideas.\n\nWe read about the richest people in the world every day. They are examples of success. They have a job and a business. They know life is hard, so they learn every day to make it better.\n\nI agree with this because I have my own experience. A long time ago, after I finished University, I was looking for a good job with a high pay. After some time, I found what I wanted. It was a good job at a normal company in my country. I earned a lot every month, but I wondered if it was enough to reach my goal. It wasn't, because I needed to save for my wedding. I had to buy a house, a car, and pay for the wedding. Later, I decided to invest in the stock market. It was the biggest risk I had ever taken. It is also good to learn about new things and how to be successful.\n\nI came to the U.S. to get a Master's Degree, but not in my old subject. My subject is Mining Engineering, and I will study Environmental Engineering here. I do this to have more chances. I can work in Mining or Environmental fields.\n\nIn conclusion, a person can be successful, but he won't lose anything if he tries to learn something new. Also, life teaches us many things every day; we just need to be willing to learn."}

Sometimes I want to play with dolls, but I stop myself because of my age, especially around others. I know I'm young, but not without limits. Still, I can do things my mother can't, like using computers. And there are things my grandmother can't do, but my mother can, like cooking. We can't escape getting old. As people age, they lose a lot of what made their life full. But if you look at what old people have, you'll see they still find their own joy and fun. To be honest, one day I'll have had enough fun and hope to see joy in my children's eyes. It doesn't need to be about what I do. Young people probably have more fun because they have more time to try new things and many blank spots in their memories to fill. Fun is good, but searching for it is even better. I'm running out of time, but I'm still trying to make the most of it. It's tough to chase after fun."}

The older folks around me are saying the same thing. But I don't agree with them. I think young people want to help out with charities, but they are too busy because life is so fast-paced today. Young people have a lot of work and not much time. Still, they do spend time in their communities. For example, they visit their families during every holiday. If they have extra, they give to those in need. Just last night, I saw on TV that many people donated money to plant trees, and most of them were young. There were no old people there. This is important to note. Some say young people are to blame, but maybe it's the older ones who are. There's an old saying from the Hittites. In an ancient text, an elder was upset with the youth. This shows that complaints about young people are old. People in the future might complain about the youth as well. But this doesn't mean young people aren't doing enough. In the end, young people today do help their community, even with their busy lives. We can see it on TV shows, or by looking at history, we find the same old complaints. It's a common thing, so it's time for the older generation to stop complaining."}
{"file_id": "1106076.txt", "output_essay": "I think that traveling in a group with a tour guide is the best way. Most people travel to relax and learn about new places. Without a tour guide, it can take a long time to understand a place. Traveling alone might not be as fun because you can't share what you think about what you see. But with a group and a guide, the trip is fun and interesting. The guide can tell you about the places in a simple and fun way, which helps you learn a lot. \n\nWhen you travel with others, you can talk about what you see and hear what they think too. Tours can be long, during the day and night. The guide knows where to stop if there's an emergency. If someone has a problem, the group can help. With a guide, everyone can help each other and make the trip better. \n\nOn the trip, there might be problems with food, places to stay, and changing clothes. In a group, people can help each other with these things. If the car breaks down and needs fixing, the group can enjoy the wait by talking and making memories. \n\nIt's up to the person, but being in a group makes the trip happier and you learn more. For example, engineering students visiting Tata Motors in India should go as a group. They can remember what they learned in class better. The professor can help like a tour guide. In a group, students can share what they know, making the trip more fun and full of learning. \n\nIf office workers want to get better at their jobs, they should visit better places and take notes. This works best with teammates and a guide. They can find good ideas by talking with each other. They also don't waste time trying to learn by themselves because they have a guide. \n\nSo, I really think the best way to travel is in a group with a tour guide."}
{"file_id": "1131786.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with the statement. There are three main reasons for this. First, ideas and concepts come in more types than facts. Facts are often the same, but every idea and concept is different. They are made by the people who think of them. Second, it is easy to learn, but hard to understand. Students should work hard and not look for shortcuts. Lastly, if students get the meaning of ideas and concepts, they can use what they know in their future life. Just knowing facts is not helpful. So, I believe that students should work hard to get the meaning of ideas and concepts, not only to learn facts."}

Even a normal high school student today knows more about physics than Newton did. Because we know so much, scientists feel a strong need to focus on just one area to help it grow. There are two main points about this topic. First, we have learned so much about each subject that you can't discover new things without knowing everything that came before. For example, many people find Einstein's Theory of Relativity hard to understand. Yet, some scientists spend their whole lives studying it and have even created new ideas that go beyond Einstein's work. It looks like focusing on one subject is the only way to study science seriously. Second, it's true that you need to know about many areas to work on one thing because all areas of science are linked. You have to learn a lot of general things before you can focus on one special area. But subjects are now so hard that you can't spread your time across many topics. Most countries have schools where you learn a bit about everything first. Then you go on to study one thing in detail for research. In the end, deciding whether to know a lot about many topics or to know a lot about one topic is a big question. Both choices have their benefits, but it looks like you have to choose one area to focus on because science is so deep and complex. Focusing on one area is something every scholar needs to do, but they should not forget the basic knowledge they need first."}

They will find new ways to travel that could replace cars. Right now, flying is the biggest way to travel. As it gets more popular and people know more about it, cars might become old-fashioned.

Even when they are busy with other things, they still make time to help others. For example, young people can do many things to help their area, like looking after sick people, elderly people, or helping children after school. \n\nWhen I was in high school, my friends and I helped at the 'Red Cross'. We took care of sick people. It was a very special time for me because I got to be with people who really needed me. It felt good to help them. I didn't do much; I just gave them my time, talked with them, and even if it seems small, it meant a lot to them. \n\nAlso, I like to spend time with the old lady who lives next door. She is often by herself. Sometimes, my boyfriend and I keep her company. For example, if she needs something from the store, we go and get it for her. I try to help her when I can, and she always thanks us. \n\nAnother way to help is to take care of children. In high school, I also watched some kids in the afternoon at my church.

{"file_id": "1105047.txt", "output_essay": "People often debate whether learning facts or understanding ideas is more important in education. If I had to choose one, I would pick understanding ideas. I will first explain why this is important. Then, I will show how both facts and ideas are important for a good student. As a student and a young researcher, I care a lot about this topic. I think understanding ideas is more important than just knowing facts, which you can learn outside of school. For example, in my study of how Harlem is changing, I focus more on the big picture and the main reasons behind the changes, not just the small details. Schools should teach students to think on their own. They do this by giving them the tools to understand and solve problems. But, there is a problem with saying ideas are more important than facts. How can you understand an idea if you don't know any facts about it? Facts are still needed. For instance, if I don't know how many people are affected by the changes in Harlem or how much rents have gone up, I can't really understand what's happening there. I believe that ideas and facts go together. This connection helps us really get what ideas mean. In the end, understanding ideas might seem more important, but you can't do that well without knowing the facts. The real world is complicated, and to get an idea, you need to know the background and the facts."}
{"file_id": "1122810.txt", "output_essay": "I agree that successful people try new things and take risks instead of just doing what they are good at. For example, in business, a company must create new products or use new methods to stand out from others. If a company can do this, it can attract customers with unique products or services and make more money. In baseball, every player should try new things. Having nine strong hitters or only fast runners doesn't work. A good team needs a mix of skills to win. So, each player must learn different and new skills. For investors, it's not smart to invest like everyone else. To get ahead, you must invest in a different way. This is risky, and you might lose money sometimes. But you must understand that risk comes with investing differently. From these examples, I believe that we must try new things and take risks if we know the risks involved."}

Let's talk about the harmful part. More cars are making our lives harder. For example, in Dubai, it can take two hours to get to work when there's a lot of traffic! Governments are taking this problem seriously. They are building a subway that will let you get anywhere in the city quickly. When it's done, many people might sell their cars because they won't need them. London is another city with too many cars. By the 2020s, people there might stop using cars and start riding bicycles instead. In 20 years, science will have moved forward a lot. Scientists may make flying cars with their own paths stacked up in the air. This would save space. We might also see advanced and safe motorcycles that could replace cars. I hope by then, all countries will have found ways to travel as fast as light. This means no gas, no pollution, more space, and a healthier planet."}

In fact, they know more about the problems of people around the world than before, and more and more young people are helping out in society. Young stars in movies, music, and sports are loved by many. They make a lot of money. Many of them give a good part of what they earn to charity. For example, Bill Gates set up the 'Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation' a long time ago. He and his wife did a lot to help with AIDS and cancer. If we look at school kids, we see that they like to do community service. They feel proud when they help someone in need. Schools and colleges now think social work is important when they decide who gets in. This makes kids want to help out. Even if they do it for their own reasons, it helps them feel the happiness of giving and makes them want to do more. There are many engineers and doctors from top universities who could make a lot of money. But more and more of them choose to work in small towns and villages. They want to help their own country and fix its problems. So, it's not true that young people don't help their communities enough. This idea doesn't recognize how much young people do to make society better."}
{"file_id": "1115147.txt", "output_essay": "I partly agree that knowing a lot about many school subjects is better than just focusing on one. I think it's not enough to only know a lot about one subject. People can become closed-minded if they don't learn about anything else. Take a mathematician, for example. He can make a math model about how a sickness spreads, but he needs to think about unusual things to make it really match what happens in real life. Also, everyone needs some basic knowledge to talk about everyday things or to have opinions about politics. Employers also look for people who know the basics, like what's happening in politics and the economy right now. So, it's very important to know about more than just one topic. But, it's clear that students need to focus on one subject to be good at it and get a job. They need to know a lot about that one subject and keep up with new things happening in that area. Besides being good at your job, knowing only a little about a subject can be risky. For example, a doctor who knows a little about many parts of medicine could be very dangerous. Also, the service industry works because people are experts in one area while others are experts in different areas. No one can learn everything about every subject, or we wouldn't need experts. In the end, students should get really good at one subject but also try to learn about other areas. Everyone should use their skills as best as they can."}

There are two reasons: trying is good for us, and new things often have mistakes that we need to fix to get better. First, trying new things can help improve technology and growth. For example, when people worked on space technology, they had many rocket launches that failed. But they kept trying, and that's how they got better at it. Second, if you only do the same easy things, you won't learn or grow. For example, you might learn something in school, but if you don't use it, it's a waste. People want to learn and add to what they know. If they don't try new things, they won't have many different experiences.

This way, you don't waste time choosing where to go or if it's a good place to see. The guide knows a lot about the places you visit. He can make the trip more fun and interesting, which you can't get from a book.\n\nLastly, the trip is more fun because everything is planned out. You don't have to worry about planning or surprises. The guide and the travel company take care of it all.\n\nBut, going with a group and guide can have downsides. For one, you can't decide how to spend your time. You can't just do what you want without being rude. You have to think about what others want. And it's really annoying to listen to someone complain all day because they don't like the plan.\n\nAlso, with a tour, everything is set. You can't change plans last minute or go to places not on the list. This can make the trip less exciting. If the travel company or guide isn't good, you might not enjoy your trip. And I don't like it when tour companies or guides take you to places where they want you to buy things because they have a deal with those places.\n\nMy best advice is to pick your travel company with care. Use advice from friends to find one that fits what you want and need. With the group, try to go with the flow and focus on what you enjoy most. Ignore the small things that bother you."}
{"file_id": "1093902.txt", "output_essay": "I have been a student for 12 years, so I think I can talk about and judge the school system. I believe our schools care too much about success and not enough about values. Students take many different classes and have to take tests in each one. But often, they don't have enough time to study for these tests. So they just memorize the most important things to pass. Sadly, they forget these things quickly, and after a few months, they can't remember anything. They keep very little of what they learn at school. This doesn't really prepare them for life, because school usually just teaches them to remember things about a subject for a short time. If students learn in fun ways, like working in groups or acting out roles, they remember the main points better. This makes learning less about memorizing quickly and more about having fun. When learning is fun, students are more likely to remember what they learn. Teaching ideas can show good behaviors that just learning facts can't. Students can learn about values and ways of doing things that will help them later in life. If they understand the reasons behind what they learn, they can use these ways of doing things every day. This is what I think education should really do. Schools should get students ready for the future. They should teach values and good qualities, especially because parents often don't. It's clear that you can't teach values by just saying facts or memorizing things. Values come from doing things over and over. So I agree that it's more important for students to understand ideas than to just learn facts."}

It will be hard to find cars on the road, even though this is good for the environment. At the same time, even with more people, there will be fewer cars because of government rules. The challenge will be too many cars and not enough room for people walking. To cut down on pollution, only a few cars will be allowed. I think there will be fewer cars, not more. This might be balanced by bigger buses and other ways to travel, like trains. These are better for workers and the government because they are easy to use, cheap, and fast. Travel will be well-planned. People will need to buy tickets to ride the train from one place to another. This will lead to less traffic and help solve the big problem of pollution. By choosing certain ways to travel, we will make less pollution and control it better. We must think about what is best for everyone in our society."}

These sports can be hard for older people. Usually, only young players are stars in professional sports. Also, older people can't play as many sports and might get hurt more easily. The risk of injury is greater for them. Second, young people can travel better than older people, especially abroad. When we travel, we meet people who are different from us. We need to be open to these differences to get along with them. Also, we might need to speak the local language. Young people often learn languages more quickly because they think in a fresh, flexible way. Third, young people have more time to follow their dreams. Older people usually have more duties, like taking care of children. This makes it hard for them to find free time. Fourth, young people have more chances to change their lives as they like. For example, it's easier for them to get new jobs than it is for older people. They can learn new things about the job and can work longer hours because of the laws. Right now, it's hard for people over 60 to get jobs. Some who want to work can't find jobs. But for young people, getting a job is up to them."}

If each person only knew one subject well, it would be hard for us to talk about general topics together. Our society is always changing, and we need people who are good at certain subjects.

And those who can might not be able to tell us how education can make violence less in poor countries. I believe these experts are the best teachers of what they know. But it's also important that they don't get too narrow-minded. Even if we know a lot about one subject, we should try to understand other views. Our society keeps changing, and this brings up a question. What happens to experts when their subject is no longer popular? Do they lose their skills? What can they do? The answer is that people should be ready to work, learn, and think about new subjects. For example, some technology will be outdated in five years. People working with this technology should be able to move to something new. In the end, it's good to have experts in certain areas."}

So, I think they should get more praise than those who just stay in one place and do the same things over and over.\n\nIn my view, successful people always work hard, keep learning, and keep trying to get better. As the world changes and gets better every day, we must keep up and keep trying to come up with new ideas.\n\nIf a person stops trying or slows down, they will fall behind in the race.\n\nTrying new things can have downsides. For example, when you try something unknown, you might fail, and this can cause big problems for a person or a business.\n\nBut I think the chance to win from trying new things is often worth the risk, because you're more likely to succeed than to fail.\n\nThere are some good things about sticking to what you know, like not taking risks and staying safe. People who don't like competition or are not very tough might choose to keep doing what they're good at.\n\nTo sum up, successful people are always looking for new ideas, while those who like things to stay the same keep doing what they know.

{"file_id": "1101246.txt", "output_essay": "I don't fully agree with the idea that young people don't spend enough time helping their communities. Some might say that today's youth are less involved in social and political issues than those in the 1960s. But I think young people want to help where they live. Young people know about the problems in their communities because they are part of families there. The more they are with their families, the more they help out. For example, in villages or among minority groups, young people often join in charity work. They visit hospitals and assist the oldest people. They also join groups to support or fight for community needs. Still, we must admit that some issues make young people less connected to their communities and families. Globalization creates a world culture that can pull them away from local concerns. This makes it hard to keep young people interested in their communities. But this doesn't stop their desire to help. So, we can say that young people might focus more on personal and worldwide goals than on local ones. However, they still take part in community work. They find time to help even when they are busy with school or jobs. In short, young people today do help their communities, even with the challenges of a global and online world."}

You need someone to show you around, tell you where to shop, eat, and stay. A tour guide can help you avoid these problems because they know more about the country. Second, it's safer to travel with a guide, especially with your family. Once, my family went to Italy and met some bad people. My dad handled it, but it would have been easier with a guide.

{"file_id": "1120829.txt", "output_essay": "Teaching, learning, studying: it's all a way of getting knowledge! In our school and college days, we've all seen many ways teachers teach through our teachers. Some teachers think it's more important for students to get the main ideas, while others think knowing the facts is what counts. In class, teachers try to share a certain main idea with their students. Sure, classes can be very bookish and not very fun, but they are still important. What will a student remember for his test from his classes? What should he remember? I think that to enjoy studying, we need to understand what we are learning. When we understand it, it sticks in our minds in a clear way. To get a lesson, we need to start with the main ideas. They are the heart of what we are learning. But to get these main ideas, especially the hard ones, it helps to learn the facts first. Knowing the facts helps you get the main ideas more easily. For example, if a student wants to get Einstein's idea of relativity, a big new idea in physics, he should learn the facts first. After he gets the facts about relativity, he can better understand the whole idea. So, I think that getting the main ideas is just as important as learning the facts. The two go together and lead to a better understanding of what we are learning."}
{"file_id": "1105857.txt", "output_essay": "People go to school because learning is key for young people. This means that hard math problems or dates of important past events are not used directly in everyday life. So, if I had to pick between getting the hang of ideas in a subject or just remembering facts, I'd go for ideas. I agree with this for two reasons.\n\nThe first reason is that if you focus on ideas, you can learn faster and easier. When you make ideas your own, paying attention is easier because it's fun and grabs your interest. For instance, when I look at my school report cards, I see two kinds of subjects. I got good grades in subjects where I really got the ideas. I got bad grades in subjects that were dull and made me watch the clock. My experience shows that understanding ideas leads to better results than just memorizing facts.\n\nThe second reason is that ideas you understand stick with you longer. Many people get this. For me, I still remember the math formulas from high school. When you really get an idea, you can use it in different situations. This helps you keep using and remembering the information, even as you get older.\n\nIn conclusion, the reasons above explain why getting ideas is better than just knowing facts. Understanding lets you learn quickly and with a good attitude. It also lets you use what you've learned in many ways. Having seen many examples of this in high school, I strongly believe in this idea."}

The goal of an ad is to sell a product. That's why ad makers will say anything to get you to buy. People who make ads don't have to be honest; they just want to sell. So, can we trust ads? Let's look at McDonald's as an example. Their ads might make us think the food is healthy and the pictures look very good. But the movie 'Supersize Me' shows that this food is actually unhealthy. Now, think about makeup ads. The women in these ads are models. We won't look like them if we use the makeup. Also, the mascara looks great on her, but it doesn't work the same for us! It's often like this with laundry products too. They say they'll make our clothes super white. But remember, the world of ads is a make-believe place where everything is perfect. It's not real. Ads sell us dreams. When we buy something we saw in an ad, we're buying those dreams. In ads, everything is changed to look perfect; people look happy, and all things seem great. In the end, ads often show products as better than they are. Their main job is to sell, not to tell the truth."}

Maybe young people don't need to help their communities. Maybe they should just focus on school or having fun. But I think that's wrong. I believe there are good reasons for young people to do community work. They should spend more time on these activities. \n\nFirst, communities get a lot of help when young people pitch in. If many young people help older folks, teach younger kids for free, or clean up parks, the community can save money. Then, they can use that money for other good things. \n\nAlso, when more young people help out, it makes the community stronger. Working on projects with others can keep them from doing bad things. This includes small crimes or breaking things for fun. \n\nLastly, the young people who help out also get something from it. I didn't see it at first, but after doing community service for a while, I learned a lot. Talking and helping older or disabled people changed how I see the world. I learned from an old man who lived through two world wars. I also learned from a blind teenager's views on love and dating. Plus, by doing community work, you make a lot of"}
{"file_id": "1114626.txt", "output_essay": "I fully agree that the best way to travel is with a group and a tour guide. This opinion comes from a few reasons. First, when we travel, we want to see the place and its beautiful sights. It's important to have a guide who knows the area well. A good guide will take you to spots that tourists love, like amazing views and natural wonders. For instance, on a trip to Egypt with my family, we had a tour guide. She was great at picking places to visit. We were very happy with what we saw and did. We saw amazing things in Giza, like the Pyramids, Sphinx, and museums. We even learned a bit about hieroglyphs. A local guide tries hard to make you love their town. Second, a guide can help you avoid problems. Guides often have security guards. They know how to handle things that might upset tourists or put them in danger. This includes heavy traffic, getting lost, dealing with beggars, or crime. That's why I think having a guide is better than traveling alone. Without a guide, you might not enjoy the visit and think badly of the place because of your bad experience."}
{"file_id": "1116877.txt", "output_essay": "I think ads often make things look better than they are. This happens because ads don't show what it's like to use these things in real life. Also, ads make things look really good to stand out from similar things made by other companies.\n\nFirst, ads make things look better because they don't show real-life use. For example, a bike ad might not show the bike stopping or just running without moving. They say the bike can go a long way on a little gas. But in real life, it can't go as far as the ad says. So, the bike looks better in the ad than it really is.\n\nSecond, companies make their ads better to be different from others. They want their thing to seem special, even if it's like other things. Look at laptop ads from Acer and HP. They say their laptops are easy to use and won't hurt your eyes. But in truth, they can hurt your eyes and are like other laptops.\n\nIn the end, ads make things look much better than they are."}
{"file_id": "1114595.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with this idea for a few reasons. First, a person who is already doing well will take bigger risks because they have a safety net if they fail. If they try something new and it doesn't work out, they still have what they earned before. So, they are not risking as much as someone who could lose it all by trying new things.\n\nSecond, the more success a person has, the more they want. A successful person knows there is more to achieve. Doing the same things will only get the same results. To get more, one must try new ways that might be risky but could also bring greater rewards. A person who likes to take risks won't just stop after one success; they will keep looking for more all their life.\n\nThe third point, which I think is the most important, is about experience and not being afraid of the future. If a person has succeeded by taking a risk once, they have made a big step. Once they have done it, it will be easier the next time because they can imagine what's on the other side. You can't predict all risks; there will always be surprises. But the person knows how to deal with the unexpected, so they are not as scared of it.\n\nThese reasons explain why you can't reach high levels of success without taking big risks. That's why I agree with the statement."}

Every day, our streets get more packed with cars, and our air gets dirtier from car pollution. There's only so much our roads and bridges can handle. What will we do when there are too many cars and no space to drive? This is a scary thought. But, in twenty years, we might have fewer cars than we do now. You might think this is hard to believe. The world's population is growing, and as people get richer, they usually want to own more cars. But, if we look at what's happening now, we might see fewer cars in the future. Many countries are working hard to make their public buses and trains better. This helps with city travel problems. Public transport is cheaper and makes life better by cutting down on traffic and pollution. So, it won't be a shock if more people start using buses and trains. Also, gas prices are likely to go up a lot in the next twenty years because we're running out of oil. When that happens, it will be cheaper to take public transport. We can see this change in places like India. The Delhi Metro is a good example. It offers great service for a low price. So, even wealthy people in Delhi leave their cars at home and take the Metro to busy parts of the city. Bus systems in cities like Indore and Bhopal are also getting more popular. So, there might come a day when you're the only one driving on the road! Actually, if we want a better life for everyone, we should hope this happens."}
{"file_id": "1088862.txt", "output_essay": "In today's world, some people like to do the same tasks every day to be successful, while others like to make new things to be successful. I think that successful people make new things and take some risks instead of just doing the same tasks every day. First, people who make new things and take risks usually make more money in business. These days, most companies want workers who can think of new ideas. New ideas can be new products or services. The new products made by companies, especially by the workers, do well. So, these companies make more money. Coming up with new ideas can help a worker be successful. For example, I worked as an intern in my country two years ago in the summer. I saw that the big bosses always talked about new ideas. They told me I should be open to new ideas too. The second point is what people want in the world. Now, people want better products and services. When someone buys something new, they might get tired of it in two or three months. To keep making new products, the market needs people who can take risks to make new things and be successful. Take Bill Gates, the man who started Microsoft, as an example. When Bill Gates first made Windows, he tried to sell it to IBM. But IBM said no, and he started his own company. Now, he owns one of the most important companies, and his products are used everywhere. He is successful because he took risks and made new things that help people. Another point is about being happy in life. People want to live and make new things. Everyone can make new things. So, they use their skills. In conclusion, successful people always think of new ideas and take risks for what they do. Most of the time, they are successful and happy. Doing the same tasks every day is dull, and people who do that often don't feel very satisfied with their lives."}

For example, you won't be scared in a new country; the tour guide will take you to all the important places to see and tell you about them. \n\nWhen you travel with others, it feels safer and more comfortable than going alone. You make new friends and learn about different ways of life. Also, it often costs less because the tour companies work with hotels and bus companies to give you a better price. \n\nYour trip is well-planned, and if any problems come up, the guide, who knows a lot about the trip, can fix them. \n\nBut there are some bad points too. You might not get much personal help from the guide if he has to look after many people. Sometimes you might think the trip is too expensive because the tour company adds their own fee to the price. \n\nEven with these issues, I believe that going with a group and a guide is still the best. You have more fun, and they take care of hard things like money exchange and visas. \n\nAfter all, as people say, 'The more the merrier.'"}

I believe that young people today don't give as much time to their communities as they used to. Now, there are lots of things that can take up a young person's time.\n\nFirst, many young people spend too much time on computers. Computers were made to help us, but now they are often used for playing games. No one stops this because games make a lot of money for the people who make them. For instance, young folks could use computers and the internet to learn about their country's place in the world and what might happen in the future. This could make them care more about their neighborhoods.\n\nSecond, I feel that young people don't take school seriously. School teaches important things like history and geography, which help you understand your community. I think everyone who is part of a community should know about their country's history. Geography is important too if you want to help your community. These are just two ways school can help you do good for your neighborhood. Also, school teaches you to love your country, almost as much as you love your family. People know this, but they still don't take it seriously and often act like school is just for fun.\n\nYoung people are like uncut gems. They need to be shaped. If not, we can't expect much from them. They have to be guided to become leaders in the community. So, if a young person isn't spending enough time helping their community, their family should help guide them."}
{"file_id": "1121417.txt", "output_essay": "I don't think that going on a group tour with a guide is the best way to travel. There are two reasons for my view. First, you can't choose where to go on a group tour. If you want to see a place that isn't famous, you don't have many options. I remember when I was in high school, we went to Kyoto. I wanted to see the Sanjusangen-do Temple, but it wasn't part of the tour. So, I couldn't go there. Second, on a group tour, you don't have much time to explore. You need time to really learn about a place's history. On a school trip to Todai-ji Temple, I couldn't read about the temple or look at the statues closely because we were rushed. Also, when you walk around by yourself, you might find nice things that you miss on a group tour, like friendly people or tasty food. Once, I was in Tokyo by myself and got lost. Some locals helped me. That was a very special experience."}

Successful people don't stop when they face tough times and big problems. They work to fix these problems. They are very passionate and inspire others. They work hard to reach their goals and dreams. They are always searching for new things and they don't rest. They keep moving towards their goals. Successful people are not like others. Maybe they don't have a good environment or the situation is hard. They spend a lot of time working on their goals. They read many books and learn a lot. They can learn from what others have gone through. What others have done helps them to try new things, even if it's risky. Also, learning from others gives them chances to try new things. Trying new things is hard because they need to get used to new situations and solve problems. So, successful people don't quit when things get tough. They keep working to make their dreams and goals come true."}

I know there are examples that might show the opposite, but I believe these are not common. A young person is usually stronger and healthier than someone older. Also, they have less to worry about. When you don't have many worries, life is instantly more fun. So, less responsibility means less stress. Another point is how fit a person is. When you get older, it gets hard to do many things. Even easy things like riding a bike or running can be tough. If you can't do simple things, you can't do harder things either. Health is also key. Who likes going to the drugstore or, even worse, the hospital? Older people often have to look after their health, maybe by taking medicine or getting other treatments. And if you're not doing that now, you know it will happen eventually. But the mind is just as important as the body. Studies show that as people age, their mental skills get much worse. This affects everything they do, but let's just talk about the mind. Even things that don't need physical effort become hard. Playing chess, doing puzzles, and stuff like that. These issues I've talked about don't happen to young people usually. So, the point is, when you're young (and don't have any big problems), you have every chance available, but these chances go away as you get older."}

The best part of travel is experiencing and understanding different cultures and values. This usually happens when you explore on your own. When you travel with a guide, you often miss out on the fun of discovering things yourself. \n\nFirst, it's true that traveling with a guide makes it easier to learn about the place you're visiting. You don't need to buy a travel book or look up information online before your trip. The guide will tell you everything you want to know, like where to eat, fun theme parks, or pretty places to see. But if you don't have a guide, you have to find out all this on your own. This helps you learn more. \n\nSecond, to really feel and understand a culture, you need to meet local people. On a guided tour, you don't get many chances to do this. The guide usually plans most of your time. Also, when you're with a group of people from your own country, it's harder to meet locals."}

I think having a tour guide is a good idea for three reasons.\n\nFirst, you can see the best places to visit. For example, if you visit a city and know nothing about it, a tour guide will show you around. He knows the city better than you because he lives there. No visitor knows your city better than you.\n\nSecond, you won't get lost, which means you won't waste time. For instance, my friends and I went to Los Angeles and knew nothing about it. We spent 3 hours looking for our hotel. If we had a tour guide, we wouldn't have lost all that time.\n\nThird, you can stay away from dangerous areas. Big cities have unsafe places. If you don't know where they are, you could be in danger. Crimes happen often, so you need to be careful in a new city.

{"file_id": "1107562.txt", "output_essay": "I think that the best way to travel is with other people and a tour guide leading the way. People travel to have fun and take a break from their daily life. Many travel for fun, but mostly to see new places and meet new friends. We can't make new friends if we don't travel with others. And to really understand new places, we need someone to tell us their stories. A person who knows a lot about a place's history can make our trip better. A tour guide is the best person to teach us about a place. Traveling by ourselves doesn't really do what travel is meant to do. We go to new places to see them, but we can't do that well if we don't know our way around. A tour guide takes us to the best spots and shares facts we wouldn't know on our own. This is true for old buildings with a lot of history. Without knowing their stories, visiting them is like not really reading a book, just looking at the pictures. A tour guide can really help us understand a new place. We often hear 'the more the merrier,' and this fits group travel well. Traveling with others lets us meet them and make friends. They also make the trip better by sharing their own stories and cultures. This makes the trip much more exciting. Traveling alone doesn't give us as many good experiences as traveling with a group and a guide. Alone, we don't meet as many people, make new friends, or learn about the places we visit. For someone like me who likes to chat, make friends, and learn from traveling to new places with new people, there's no better way to travel than in a group with a guide."}

Young people have grown up in a world that is all about 'me.' Life is fast, and we all have plans we want to follow. Everything is scheduled, and there's no time to think about others. Also, because people from all over the world are coming together, it's hard to know who belongs to which group. Different groups fight against each other. There's no togetherness in the world. Why should young people try to change this? How can they help? Many young people only care about themselves. But some want to help and be part of something good. Some young people help older or disabled neighbors by shopping for them. Others join groups to make their community better. There are groups with good goals that young people want to join. I want to help Black people in France be seen more, even in the media and in smart jobs. So I joined the Boucle d'Ebene group. They support African and Caribbean business people. I do this even though I'm busy with school and other things. In the end, I think young people don't want to join in community work. They are too busy with school, jobs, friends, and taking care of kids. Young people today have more to do than they did fifty years ago!

I never went to museums or music shows. But when I got to college, I changed my mind and started to learn about these subjects. This helped me become someone who can talk to anyone about different topics. Second, people can find the best ways to do things when they try something new. Four years ago, I joined a new project at work that I was not sure about. I had been a salesperson for five years, but I decided to work in the production part of a computer company.

But to learn new things, you must be brave and step away from the safe path to search in the unknown. Taking risks is part of this search. To be successful, you must stand out from others, and this means taking some risks. You can do this by trying new ways, making something new, or getting new skills. Successful business owners often take risks. They create new things and improve things. Their success changes our economy and society. Bill Gates is one of these people. He started in a small garage, working on what others thought was 'crazy' and 'useless'. He tried something new, and it made him very successful. The stock market shows that success and risk go together. Taking risks can lead to rewards. But risks can be understood and managed. To succeed, you must also learn.

People usually think they'll have fun when they're old because they work all the time. But this is risky if they can't enjoy their old age after working so hard. Young people have fun by going to dance parties and trips with friends. They use the newest tech like iPods, phones, and games. They live a fancy life. They also like sports and can play them.

Also, many new things in the world start as ideas or concepts. I also think that students should know facts, which are things that are usually true.

I believe that grasping ideas and concepts is key for a student, more so than memorizing facts. First, to grasp a subject, like light in physical science, we need to know the basic concepts and ideas, such as where light comes from. This is enough to understand the subject. Concepts, like the laws of reflection and refraction, should be clear for further study. We don't need to focus on where these concepts came from. From a student's point of view, we should get the concepts and basic ideas right first. These ideas are like taking our 'brain to new places' about the subject. Coming up with ideas is a way to think hard and boost a student's confidence. On the other hand, if a student tries to find a fact, they will likely fail 9 times out of 10. This failure can make them feel bad and think negatively. This could hurt their future. Facts are something we look for after getting a bachelor's or master's degree. So, as students, we should focus on learning concepts. Another point is that in school or college, teachers focus more on teaching concepts than on finding facts. I know facts are important too, and we should know them, but we should focus more on concepts and teaching students to think big. In summary, concepts help students understand subjects better and judge them well. These concepts support students in thinking more, coming up with ideas, and achieving better results.

I believe this because young people are stronger, less scared, and tougher than older people usually are.\n\nFirst, most young people have lots of energy. They don't get tired quickly. Older people often feel tired after doing just one thing. But young people, like students, can do many things in one day. After a long day at school, they can still do sports or clubs, then go home to do homework and housework. Older people, however, might get tired just by cleaning their house. Doing lots of things makes you feel good and happy. So, young people with more energy have more fun than older people.\n\nAlso, young people are usually braver and take more chances. Taking chances makes life exciting because you don't know what will happen. But most older people like things to stay the same and don't take chances. For example, many young people travel far away to learn new things. Older people often stay where they are. So, older people's lives can be boring and the same every day, but young people's lives are full of surprises and fun.\n\nPlus, young people can think better than older people. When people get old, it's harder for them to focus or learn new stuff. But young people can learn a lot, like a new language or how to cook something new. Learning is fun, and young people who can learn easily have more fun than older people.\n\nOlder people can't do things for a long time because they are not as strong and get tired easily. But young people are strong in their bodies and minds, and they are not as scared. Their lives are exciting and enjoyable, which means they have more fun than older people."}
{"file_id": "1105098.txt", "output_essay": "Many people are caring less about their communities every day. They also don't want to help out. It looks like the ones not helping are mostly young people. But I can't blame them because they should learn to help others early on, like in elementary school. Families should also focus on this problem.\n\nI want to say that you don't need money to help your community. Young people think helping others or joining a charity is a waste of time. But it's not their fault. Their families don't talk to them about why it's good to help others. Also, schools don't push them to help their communities. For example, when I was in high school, our teacher took us to visit old people and plant trees every month. But the school stopped because it was too expensive. I think young people don't see how helping their community is good for them.\n\nAnother reason young people don't help is that they are too busy with school. They have to study and pass their classes. This makes them stressed. But they could help out in their free time. I believe many young people use their time to play video games, chat online, or follow famous people. They could join a group that helps others instead.\n\nIn conclusion, I think young people don't help their communities enough. But it's not really their fault. Someone needs to teach them how important it is to help out, like their parents and teachers."}
{"file_id": "1091720.txt", "output_essay": "Young people are full of energy and motivation, so they should use their skills in a good way. They are expected to be excited about helping the place where they grew up. But what does 'helping' our community mean? Doing volunteer work at charities is often the first thing that comes to mind. Simple acts of kindness, like helping an older person cross the street, are also good ways for young people to help others. I think that any job, whether you get paid or not, is helpful if you do it with a good heart. However, I see that young people today do not spend much time helping others. I know some who have never volunteered. They do not care about others and do not see why they should help their family or friends. They only think about themselves, so they do not help the community. Many smart young people know they should help out, but they get distracted. Friends, new gadgets, TV, and music often tell them to focus on themselves and to live for fun and things. It is sad because these things pull them away from doing their duty to the community. No matter how much their parents tell them to help, it does not work if they are too distracted. Some young people do help by doing community service, but it is not enough. Even when they work for free, many are waiting for some kind of reward - points for school, something good to put on a job application, or a prize. If they only want these rewards, they will not help much. Also, they will soon lose interest in helping. It is okay for young people to choose other things over helping sometimes. Students need to focus on school, and young people want fun and new things. They have the right to think about themselves a bit. In fact, if they use their creativity for good, they can help the community a lot. This needs more understanding than young people have today. But it shows that helping is not just about time. It is about caring and being aware."}

I believe that the best way to travel is not with a big group. People often join groups for safety or agreement, but this may not be the best idea for travel. Being in a group can limit your freedom. This is true when a guide decides where to go and when to start. This can lead to fights and complaints, ruining the relaxing part of travel. Some might say that a guide can give good advice for a better trip. But there are many stories of tourists getting tricked by guides for their own gain. I'm not saying tourists are better at avoiding scams on their own, or that all guides are bad. But it's worse to be tricked after trusting and paying a guide. Travel is different for everyone. Some want to get away from busy city life, some want to see new places, and some look for adventure. None of these goals are easy to reach if you're following a guide who must watch and control the group. There's no clear answer to whether group travel is good or bad. But we should always be able to go after what we want when we travel."}
{"file_id": "1092270.txt", "output_essay": "Everyone is scared to try new things. No one likes to fail, and the easiest way to avoid failure is to do nothing. However, history shows us that to get better and succeed, we must try new things and take chances, even if it's tough or hurts. The world we live in now was shaped by the industrial era. That time in history saw big factories, better products, and improved living because people took chances and failed many times before they found answers. The invention of airplanes is another example of taking risks. We've all seen old films of the first airplane designs. They were odd machines that looked like toys. But after lots of attempts, someone made it work. Now, we can fly to faraway places in just a few hours. I have my own story as a Wine Brand Manager. No one thought we could make wine as fun as beer. 'Wine just isn't meant to be fun,' said a big boss. But my team and I believed we could. We made many mistakes, but we created 'FRESSCO,' a new wine mixed with fresh fruit in unique packaging. The outcome? FRESSCO is now one of the top 3 wines in Chile and a strong beer rival. To sum up, even though trying new things is hard for everyone, we must remember that being creative is the only way to move forward. Yes, mistakes hurt, but the joy of making something new is worth it."}
{"file_id": "1120968.txt", "output_essay": "I think that most ads make products look better than they really are. Ads are made to draw people to a product. The product always looks good to the person watching. Often, the company that makes the ad will overdo it. They make the product look too perfect. Each ad aims at a certain age group. For example, toy ads on TV use fun sounds and bright colors to get kids' attention. This makes kids want the toy. Then, the parents end up buying the toy for their child. Ads are a powerful way to influence kids' thoughts. Ads don't talk about the bad points of the product. The product is always shown as perfect. The main goal of the company that makes the ad is to make money. They don't think about quality or helping customers first. It's not common to find a product that is as good as its ad says. In the end, I want to say that we have a problem today. We let these fake ads get to us, but we can't escape them because they are all around us. We see them on big signs in the streets, on TV, and hear them on the radio. We are just people, and even small things can influence us!"}
{"file_id": "1127080.txt", "output_essay": "Do young people have more fun than older people? It's hard to say because each person has their own way to have fun. But I think older people have more fun than young ones for a few reasons, so I don't agree with the idea that young people enjoy life more. First, older people have lived longer, so they know how to have fun better. Young people don't have as much experience. For example, a young person might do something fun that is actually bad for them without knowing. Later, they could get hurt. An older person probably knows it's bad because they've tried it before and won't do it again. Second, young people have many choices for fun, but they also have a lot to worry about. They think about their jobs, businesses, families, health, and other parts of life. Older people mostly just worry about their health. For example, a young person might be at the gym having fun, but then they remember something worrying and leave, losing their fun time. An older person will only think about having fun and staying healthy. Finally, it's true that everyone likes to have fun in their own way."}

Young people don't worry about life or money problems, unlike older people. Even though young people are strong, they don't care about issues like the country's money matters, dirty air and water, or people going hungry. They always think about fun things. Also, young people spend twice as much money as older people. They don't want to talk about schoolwork. On the other hand, older people enjoy trips, looking into things that happen, reading, watching what's going on, and listening to love songs.\n\nIn the end, being young is fun.

But as people get older, they lose the joy and spontaneity of life.\n\nWe often think this way because we see young people studying and playing sports or helping in their community. They are not working yet. We believe getting old means following society's rules and acting properly. We see growing up as becoming more aware of the world's problems and duties.\n\nOlder people are seen as more serious and wise, but also sadder than young people. Young people are seen as bold and carefree.\n\nHowever, I believe things are different now. Today, there are many chances for older people to stay active in body and mind. We see many older people who are good examples in our society. This shows that times have changed.\n\nI know many people older than me who love life just as much as I do.

Knowing a lot is good for my kids. If I know more, I can teach them better. My dad taught me things I didn't learn in school. For example, he explained why a glass of cold water gets wet on the outside. I was curious, and he had the answer. Like my dad did for me, I want to teach my kids. Also, knowing many things can help me get a job. Imagine I studied shapes, living things, and how people think in college. I didn't just focus on one thing, but I know a lot about each. I could teach math, work at a science museum, or help kids at school with their problems. What if I only knew about shapes? If I can't teach shapes, I'd have to wait for another chance. Later on, I can choose one subject to learn more about. I'll try out different subjects and see which one I like best. After learning a lot, I'll know what I'm interested in.

{"file_id": "1114178.txt", "output_essay": "Some people think that young people today spend a lot of time helping their communities, but I don't agree. There are two main reasons: their attitude and not having enough time.\n\nFirst, young people today don't want to help their community because they see no good in it for themselves. They think they don't need to help because someone else will, or they feel it's a waste of time. I think they don't get how important it is to support a community that needs help. Also, young people today are lazier than before. They don't want to help because they see it as work, and we know young people often don't like work because it's not fun. Schools also make them work a lot, which they have to do, so they don't choose to do more.\n\nSecond, the world is getting more competitive and interesting. This makes young people busy with other things and their schoolwork, not helping their communities. They might want to get into top colleges or just have fun and relax. I've never met a young person who really wants to spend time helping their community. So, since young people like to use their time in other ways, very few think they should help their communities.\n\nIn conclusion, young people don't help the community because it's not fun, and they have other important things to do. So, young people today don't spend enough time or effort helping their communities."}
{"file_id": "1113190.txt", "output_essay": "These days, young people are different. Their education is different, and they change with it. They are supposed to get a more open education with less rules and more freedom. But maybe we are giving freedom to those who aren't ready for it yet. What I mean is that young people now spend more time focusing on themselves than on being part of society. Maybe they do this because society doesn't give them what they want. So, they don't feel like joining in their communities. We live in a time where we can communicate easily. You can live without meeting people in person. Without leaving your house. Many young people think their community is too small. So, they go online to feel part of something big, to feel important. They don't care if their neighbor needs help or if their town is clean. They think they are too good for that. For example, I read about a new culture in Japan in a magazine last week. This new lifestyle is popular there. Its main idea is to not have any face-to-face contact. People leave their families and friends. They start living alone. They use the internet for everything. For work, shopping, making friends, and all the usual things we do in life. When I hear about this, I still hope that in the future young people will help their communities. These might be online communities, but the key point is to be part of something."}

I think they don't realize what they should be doing. Take a student who studies hard, while another doesn't. Why not? The second one is lazy and finds it easier not to work.

{"file_id": "1116768.txt", "output_essay": "I agree that ads often make things look better than they are. I only buy things I see on TV ads. When something new comes out, it needs ads. Without ads, no one knows about it and won't buy it. Ads help people know about new things. Some might buy them. If they like them, they'll keep buying them. Big brands spend a lot of money on ads. This shows ads are important for new things. Ads have been around for a long time. In the past, ads were carved in stone. You can only know if something is good after you use it. Even with many ads, if something isn't good, people won't buy it. The thing itself must be good. No ads can sell a bad product. For example, my dad bought a car he saw in an ad. But it had many problems. He told his friends not to buy it. The car didn't do well in India. Today, ads are a huge business. They use famous people to sell things. Kids want to buy what their favorite stars sell. Every kind of product needs ads. Movie stars do ads before their movies come out. Models show off new cars and store openings. This gets people excited about the products. Some even talk about them. This means the ads reach people. In the end, you can only know if something is good by using it. All this means you can only want to buy something if you know about it from ads."}

So, it's not likely that we will have fewer cars in 20 years than we do now. Another reason I think this is because new car models come out often—sometimes every month or once a year. Also, some people like to get a new car soon after they get their first one because they like the better look and features of the new models. So, it makes sense to think that in 20 years, we will not only have more cars than we do today, but we will also keep seeing more and more new cars."}

Going to college is not a risk. It is a safe choice for a better future. College may seem new at first, but it is really just learning more. With a degree, people learn to do things well.\n\nSecond, I think success must be built over time. It does not happen fast. It takes daily work and being stable. Jumping from one idea to another does not lead to success.\n\nLast, trust from others is very important for success. Taking risks is not a good way to get trust. Trust must be built over time. To be trusted, you need to know what you are doing. People won't trust someone who is new and does not know their stuff.\n\nSure, some people who take risks might succeed, but it's rare, like winning the lottery.

{"file_id": "1112538.txt", "output_essay": "Many people believe that we will use fewer cars in the future. Cars cause a lot of environmental problems. Pollution is a big issue for us. To deal with this, governments are trying different solutions, like limiting cars in cities. For example, London's mayor started a fee for driving in the city center to reduce cars. I think this is a good idea because it has lowered the number of cars in London. Also, many governments are making public transport cheaper. In France, the underground is very cheap. I prefer to take the bus or the underground instead of driving. Plus, getting a driving license has become more expensive. So, more people are using buses and the underground now. But, growing countries like India and China are not cutting down on making cars. Their economies depend on car production. So, they don't focus on environmental problems. Even though they know about the pollution cars cause, they don't take steps to fix it. Still, there are efforts to tackle pollution. The Kyoto Protocol is one way to handle the pollution problem. But, many big countries did not agree to it. In the end, I believe we can hope for fewer cars in the future. Governments are telling us that cars are bad for our society. They have started and will continue to start actions to cut down on car use. However, even with these efforts, the number of cars might go up because poor countries rely on car production to make money."}

Many people get sick with things like cancer and lung problems because of dirty air and not moving enough. Now, more people worry about their health and know that cars make it worse. They also want to protect the environment, like the ozone layer and the air we breathe, from car smoke. Keeping a car costs a lot. You need to buy gas, which is getting more expensive. You have to pay for car insurance and a place to park. Cars cost money every day. To save cash, it's better to ride trains, buses, or bikes. These ways are easier than driving. Trains are often faster and cost less. Thirty years ago, having a car was a big deal. But today, caring for the planet is popular and cool. Also, owning a car can make you lazy. In America, many people drive to work or school, and this is why more people are overweight. I think the best solution is to walk more. We shouldn't depend too much on cars."}

Second, a tour guide knows the best spots to visit. They can show you what to see so your trip is good. You won't feel like you wasted your money. Third, in a country where you don't speak the language, it's hard to buy things or ask for help. A tour guide can help you with this.

For instance, without scientists, we wouldn't have ways to study or experiments to learn about at school. Scientists wouldn't have discovered and created all those theories without trying and experimenting. Another example is in business. If someone wants to have a successful business, they won't get there without trying new methods and ideas to make their business grow. Also, without trying new things, technology wouldn't be as advanced as it is now, and people would keep doing the same old things without the chance to try new experiences. Technology is improving every day because of scientists and others who work to create new and better things from what used to be nothing.

Young people with a good life worry the least. Their parents help them and fix their problems. They don't realize that one day, their parents won't be there to help. I know this way of thinking is not good, and our parents have taught us this. For example, we might drop paper and not pick it up, or someone might spray paint on doors. They don't think about it; they just do what they want. I wish young people were more thoughtful and thought before acting. They should know that bad things in society are also bad for them.

The main reason is that there are too many products because of how much we buy. In the past, there weren't enough goods for everyone. So, no one needed to advertise. But now, with so much new technology, companies make more things than we need, just to make money. They have to make their products look great so they can sell them. Another big reason is that people always want the newest and 'best' stuff. Companies have to keep making new things that are just a little bit better. They also have to make these small changes look important. Take computers, for example. Computer companies update their models three or four times a year, even if the changes are small. They do this because people expect it and because their competitors do it too. A computer company can't keep selling the same computer after a year. So, they have to make the new ones look much better, even if they're not that different inside. In the end, I agree that most ads make things look way better than they are. This happens because we always want more and 'better' things, and this makes companies show their products as much better than they are, even if the changes are small. We can't really change this, so people need to be smart and not get tricked by ads."}

It must show what's in the oats and how they are good for everyday eating. It must also show the oats' logo. This ad should be seen by people all over the world. \n\nWhen you advertise something, you show people what it's for. The thing you're selling should be wanted in other countries too. Good ads can make people want it more. People should get the right idea about what they're buying from the ad. The ad needs to make people want to buy the thing. Ads need to reach people everywhere who might buy it. \n\nAds should have a clear message that makes people want to buy. You can also sell things by offering gifts or coupons when someone buys your product. The ad should grab attention and make more people want the product. \n\nAds are important for selling because they show the product as it is. But sometimes, there's a warning in small print that says experts did the ad, so you shouldn't try the same thing. This shows it's true but not quite real. \n\nA good example is cigarette ads.

In Korea, most young people are students who are very busy with school. They go to school at 7 in the morning and don't get home until midnight.

People are asking if it's faster to walk or drive the same distance. This is a big worry for us. But every problem has a solution. Humans tend to solve problems they create, but this often leads to new problems. I think this is true because we are already trying to fix traffic issues. We are making it cheaper to use buses and trains, and we encourage people to share rides. New subway lines and trains are being built to get people off the roads. In twenty years, there will be fewer cars because people won't rely on just one way to travel. Some cities show that public transport can reduce the number of cars. London is a good example. There, people don't have to sit in traffic after work. They can take the subway home. This has made London's roads less crowded over the years. Other countries might do what London has done. Tokyo also uses public transport, but it's not working well. They have subway stations, but too many people use them. This means fewer cars on the streets, but too many people in the subway stations. These examples show that in twenty years, there might be fewer cars. But that alone won't fix the main issue. Cars don't cause traffic; the people driving them do. When public transport works well, it spreads people out on different routes. But if it's not good, people just move the problem from one place to another.

It uses ads and other ways to show us what it wants, but not the full truth!\n\nI think it's hard today to not be fooled by the looks of things around us. But I also think that to avoid being let down, we should try to see past how things are shown to us. We need to understand what they truly are!"}
{"file_id": "1122978.txt", "output_essay": "Learning about different school subjects is good for everyone. It helps us know about all subjects and talk about our ideas with people who have different experiences. But being an expert in one area is also good because it lets us understand a subject better. After thinking about it, I like being an expert in one area more. First, being an expert lets us learn the basics of a subject well. This means we can find new things from the basic facts. This only happens if we know the basics well. When I was studying BTech, I found a new computer code about colors in Java. I learned all about it during the summer, and that's how I found the new code. My teachers at college were very happy with me. Second, when we are experts, we can see the problems in a subject. This helps us think of ways to fix them. We can try to make these problems smaller if we can. For example, scientists want to make less damage to the 'ozone' layer. They know a lot about this area and are trying to make less damage to the 'ozone' because they know the good and bad points of the subject. Third, only someone who knows a lot about a subject can understand it fully. I have a sad story about this. A few months ago, I hurt my leg in an accident. I went to a hospital where the doctor did not know much about bone injuries. He said my leg was not hurt, but I felt something was not right."}
{"file_id": "1119584.txt", "output_essay": "Everyone has dreamed of making something new that would make them rich and successful. I believe in our smarts. I think we can all make something that will make us wealthy. So, I agree with this idea because success comes after you try new things. When you try new things, you do it because you think it is worth your effort. You are willing to do what it takes to finish what you started. You are very motivated, and that's why you do well. This drive shows your desire to succeed, and that's how you will make it. For example, the movie 'Beatrix Potter' shows why she got famous; she knew her idea was good and she was motivated enough to deal with rejections and her father's disapproval. After you succeed, you want to feel that way again. You feel unstoppable, like Leonardo DiCaprio in 'Titanic', you feel on top of the world. If you try something new or make something, it's because you don't want to always do the same thing, even if you're good at it. It's more exciting to create something, to think all the time about how you can make an idea come to life. In the end, you try new things because it makes you successful. You don't want to be like everyone else; you want to stand out. And even if you do something well, you should try new things or new ways to do it. It shows you don't just depend on what you know. It shows you really want to get better. Mozart is seen as a genius not just because he could play music when he was very young but also because he wrote symphonies when he was very young. In conclusion, I would say that everyone should try new things; it's not good to just use what someone else made for us. We should try something new too."}
{"file_id": "1122260.txt", "output_essay": "I believe that most people think young people have more fun than older people. I agree, but it depends on what 'enjoy' means. This idea has many sides, so it's hard to say one clear thing about it. For example, if you like playing football, you might not have fun if you're old. A young boy is stronger and can play for a long time. An old man will get tired quickly and won't have much time for a fun game. But if you like playing the guitar, age doesn't matter. You can have fun whether you're ten or seventy. A young boy might not worry as much as an older person. His carefree mind might let him have more fun. An adult has many things to do and might not have free time. A young child can do what he wants and have fun. The adult's life has more problems, so he can't have as much fun as his child. Money is another part of this. Older people often have more money than young people. They can do more because they have the money. For instance, if you're twenty and want to go yachting, you might not afford a yacht. You might buy one when you're older. Lastly, getting sick when you're old is a big issue. It makes me think that young people enjoy life more."}

Even though people around the world are thinking about the environment and we are running out of oil, I still doubt it. I know that there have been deals made about the pollution from cars. Cars harm the environment because they use gas, which dirties the air. Many countries, including Japan, have said they will cut down on car pollution. But I have never seen this work. People who drive don't seem to care much about it. I've also heard that we can't keep taking oil out of the ground forever. Right now, most cars use oil. Yes, there are electric cars, but they are hard to use because they take a long time to charge. So we keep driving oil cars. I think we will still have some oil in twenty years. Cars are very helpful. We can go anywhere, anytime with a car. People in big cities might not need cars, but those in the countryside do. They live far from stores, malls, and jobs. Clearly, we need our own cars. We can't depend on buses and trains because they might not be quicker than driving. Also, most of us will keep driving our own cars. I believe there are no good ways to cut down on driving because we don't care enough about the environment; we care more about ourselves. Electric cars aren't easy to use, and I don't think they will be any time soon. In truth, people really need cars."}
{"file_id": "1122148.txt", "output_essay": "I think not everyone can know everything. It's not great to know a little about many things but not a lot about one thing. Deep knowledge is really wanted in work and school. In medicine, for example, regular doctors are important, but experts like heart doctors or brain doctors are needed for certain treatments. Knowing a little about many topics can be too simple and not help much with hard problems in special areas. Take science, like biology. Knowing a bit about all parts of biology is needed, but someone who studies living things' names and someone who studies the physics of life don't have much in common. They can't help each other with their own problems. Still, knowing a bit about many things is useful because sometimes you need to use what you know from one area in another. Like using math in biology. This works best when a biologist and a mathematician work together. Also, I think our memory can only hold so much, so we should focus on learning about one area. Learning too much that we don't use can fill up our memory. So, it's good to know a bit about many things, but only knowing a little about many things isn't helpful. To really use what you know, you need to learn a lot about one thing."}

Some think ads lie about how good a product is, while others feel they know enough to not be swayed by ads when buying something. I believe ads do not change what I choose to buy. This view matters because we usually know what we want. Take buying a car as an example. You look up the car you want and don't just go by what the ads say. Also, ads aim to show that a company is the best, not just to change what people buy. If you want a certain car, you often have options from different companies. Some say ads mostly affect young boys. But they don't buy things themselves; they ask their parents. Parents usually don't just buy what their kids want. They think about what's best. Even though we should think hard about product quality, knowing what we want and the company's goal to be seen as the best make me believe that ads don't make products look way better than they are."}

Trying new things gives you new experiences, helps you learn, and makes you more creative. If you only do what you know, you will stop being creative and get bored. First, successful people try new things to get new experiences. Taking risks opens your mind and leads to new opportunities. The more you try, the more skilled you become. Second, successful people try new things and take risks to learn more and grow as a person. Trying new things makes you smarter in different areas because you go through many experiences and learn about many things. Also, trying new things helps you grow because you learn how to handle different people and situations. Third, trying new things and taking risks makes you more creative. This is very important for your mental growth. Trying new things keeps you from getting bored and makes your life more interesting. In conclusion, I strongly agree that successful people try new things and take risks. This helps them get new experiences, learn more, and become better people."}
{"file_id": "1127260.txt", "output_essay": "Everyone knows this: young people have fun, but older people don't. I don't think this is always true. Let's look at why. Young people know how to enjoy themselves. They hang out with friends and laugh a lot. Older people seem to forget how to have fun. They were fun once, but now they have grown up. Grown-ups have many things to do. They think about work a lot. They worry about many things. When they get old, they worry about dying. They talk about their youth, when they had fun! Young people have fun because they don't worry about the future. They live for today. But, older people who plan can also live for today. Some say you have the best time when you stop working. Think about grandparents who travel and start to really live. I believe people in the middle age enjoy life the least. They have too much to remember and do. Young people have fun because they don't have much to worry about. They go to school, see friends, and date. Yes, they have homework, but life is not too bad. They have fun because their life seems perfect. In the end, I think even though young people's lives seem perfect, they don't always have fun. Teenagers are often upset. They complain and disagree a lot. They don't care about much. But older people, even with harder lives, understand life's value."}
{"file_id": "1109974.txt", "output_essay": "I think that learning by doing is the best way to get better at something. This idea is like the saying 'Practice makes perfect.' To do well, you need some experience, like learning from a past mistake or a choice that didn't work out well. Let me tell you about my own experience. In 2007, I hurt my knee in gym class. We were playing kickball. When it was my turn, I slipped on the wet floor and hurt my leg badly. It took a long time to heal. The doctor told me not to play sports anymore because I could get hurt again. But I didn't listen. I started playing basketball as soon as I could. I even made it onto the school team. The season is done now, and I'm happy I didn't listen to the doctor. Even if I get hurt again, I won't regret it. I'll just learn not to ignore advice from my parents and doctor next time. Another time I tried something new was when I joined the chess club. I had never played chess before. But after I joined, I got better at thinking things through. I like playing chess a lot now. I'm glad I joined the club, even though I was nervous at first. Some people don't like seafood, but others love it. I think it's about what you're used to. I love seafood and eat Japanese food a lot. Sushi is my favorite. I eat it every week. Some of my friends don't like sushi. One of them had never tried it but was curious. So, I took her to a Japanese restaurant. She didn't want to try sushi at first. But when she did, she loved it. Now we go there together every week. I think experiences are unique and can teach us a lot. I believe that trying new things and taking chances, like traveling or going on fast rides at a theme park, can make us smarter and more open to new ideas."}
{"file_id": "1127176.txt", "output_essay": "Talking about right and wrong in marketing is very important and should be taught in some parts of universities. I see many ads on TV or in papers that say the product is the best answer to people's needs, but often it's not true. I think that most ads make things look a lot better than they are.\n\nWe see these kinds of ads in every area. Cars, computers, or things we buy for daily use, it doesn't matter the area, all use ads to make people want to buy things. They focus on some good points but leave out other facts that might change someone's mind. For example, an MP3 player might be shown in a paper as having 1 GB and a radio. But many don't know that the radio might not work well in all places and they don't know how many songs it can hold. Some people buy it without thinking, while others find out the truth when they ask the salesperson.\n\nAnother trick is with prices. They show prices without tax, and when you find something you really like and go to buy it, it's often too late to think again, so you just buy it.\n\nIt's clear that many ads make things look a lot better than they are. But if we focus more on teaching about marketing and what it should be like, we can stop these wrong practices. Also, these classes should be required, not just an option."}

I agree with these people because if they do well, they can come up with new ideas. Clearly, trying new things can be risky. But if we are scared of taking chances, no one will do well in life. For example, scientists make new things by taking lots of risks. If they were afraid their work was too risky, we wouldn't have lights, radios, TVs, satellites, and many other things we use every day. So, to get something done, people take many risks. People who do well are those who can see what the future could be like. They take many risks to get things done. For example, if we are happy with what we have and don't try for a better future, we won't do well in life. In the end, I think it's good to agree with people who work hard and do well. This is because if people don't do well, they can't make plans for their future. So, to do well, people have taken many risks.

{"file_id": "1126329.txt", "output_essay": "I agree because ads often make a product seem better or work better than it really does. It's like a store salesperson trying to sell you something. Many brands push their ads hard. They want to beat other brands and show that they are the best. Take the Walt Disney Company as an example. We have seen a lot of their ads on TV, online, in movies, and in letters. They keep showing us these ads, telling us about a 'dream that may come true.' But this isn't true when you go on a vacation to Walt Disney. They don't mention the long lines in the hot sun for rides or for food at restaurants. It's a big problem when ads grab our attention and seem better than the real thing. This shows how ads can trick people. They get to 'Walt Disney' and it's not what they expected. Ads for food or diet plans do this too. They show people reaching their goals with a plan, but they don't tell you the real cost of joining. In truth, they twist facts, sell dreams, and take money from people who don't reach their goals. I think people should be smarter when they like an ad. The ad just wants your money. It doesn't care if you're happy or if it meets your needs. This is what marketing is all about."}

In Spain, where I'm from, I mostly agree with this idea.\n\nThe reason why fewer people in Western countries like Spain care about their community is, I believe, because of two things: better lives for average families and smaller families.\n\nSpain has changed a lot in the last thirty-five years. A long time ago, many people were poor, but not anymore. More people are now in the middle class, and wealth is more evenly spread out. With fewer differences between rich and poor, young people don't see as much need to help others.\n\nAlso, families in Spain used to be big, but now they're small. Most families have just one child. Parents with one child often give them a lot of attention and protection. These kids may not think much about helping others in society. When they grow up, they might not see why they should help their community.\n\nThese are just my thoughts and are pretty general. There could be many other reasons why young people don't help out more. But I think these two reasons are the biggest. Still, some young people do a lot for their communities, and a few even work full-time to help others. But I feel this isn't what most young people do."}
{"file_id": "1114229.txt", "output_essay": "Yes, I agree that it is better to travel with others and a guide than to go alone. Nowadays, people care a lot about being safe. So, it is smart to travel with others. For example, if someone goes to a new place and knows nothing about it, it's better for them to be with a group. This way, they won't get lost. A person might have trouble finding a place to sleep, getting food, or speaking the language in a new place. So, having a group and a guide is useful. Going with a guide is great because they know the local language and culture. This makes the trip more fun because the guide can tell you about the places you visit. Also, it's cheaper to travel with others. When in a group, everyone pays a part of the cost, which is usually lower than going alone. It's not smart to explore a new place by yourself because you might face small safety issues. For example, if someone is alone at a train station and their wallet gets stolen, they will have a big problem. Thieves often go after people who are alone and new to the area. But in a group, thieves are less likely to steal from you, or you can get help from your group. Traveling alone in a new place is risky. You have to watch out for yourself and your things. But being in a group keeps you safe from these small issues. In the end, it is a good and smart choice to travel with others and a guide. It keeps you safe and lets you enjoy the trip."}

It helps you see what the whole lesson is about. For example, when I was in college, I focused on getting what the lesson was about. I understood the main point. This way of learning makes studying and remembering easier. It also cuts down on study time. You can pick up more stuff faster. Knowing facts is fine, but we don't always feel like studying them. We don't want to waste too much time on them. When we don't want to study, knowing how to get the big picture helps a lot. It takes a lot of time to just learn facts. But understanding the big picture is always useful. Like when I'm getting ready for a test, I first look at the topic, then get the main point. I always study like this. It lets me learn more in less time and saves time too. This way, I did well on my tests. Take reading a passage, for example. We start by quickly looking for the main point. This makes reading easier. If not, it's hard. Learning this way gives students more chances to learn and think better. Remembering facts without the main point is hard. So, I really agree with this idea. It helps a lot in school and in the future."}

But as I thought about it more, I saw that it is sad, but true. Young people are so busy with their own stuff that it's hard to get them to care about things they don't think are 'fun' or 'cool'. You can see this in how little time they spend with their families. We often use quick ways to talk, like emails and texts, even with our parents and brothers or sisters. We don't talk to each other as much anymore. So, how can we expect them to help their communities? But I believe the real issue is that many young people don't know how to help. They might also be scared because they think they have nothing special to offer. If we can show them this isn't true, I think more will enjoy and feel proud to help their community. Young people have lots of energy and new ideas. They can help in easy but important ways. They can teach younger kids, visit an elderly person, or even plan an event for everyone. So, while I agree with the statement, I also believe young people can and will put down their iPods and spend time helping their communities. Forcing them won't work. It's better to show them by doing something. I think we can do this by starting a project that everyone likes and feels proud of."}
{"file_id": "1077659.txt", "output_essay": "I think that young people today do not spend enough time helping their communities. This lack of kind and giving behavior is because of money and social issues. Many young people do not see a good social reason to get involved in community service. Even though most people in the world are very poor, those who can help are often separated from those who need help. So, young people do not know about these needs and do not help. I have seen fewer young people in my community willing to help. As the leader of Key Club, a group for community service at my high school, it gets harder each year to find new members. There used to be about 40 members, but now it's hard to get even 20 to come to meetings. Most only help to make their college applications look better. I think most feel this way. As the number of Key Club members goes down, the money we collect goes up. This shows that young people today do not spend enough time helping their communities. We are taught to expect something when we give. But when young people help their communities, they do not get something they can touch. So, they do not want to help. Those who can help find it very annoying to spend time helping others. They think giving money is enough. But sometimes, even giving money is hard because people are greedy. It is sad to see that young people, who will be future leaders, do not want to spend their time helping when they can. Society needs to make young people more aware and willing to give their time to others. If young people can stop being lazy, get over their fear of helping, and learn that feeling good about helping is the best reward, it will be a big step in getting more young people involved."}

I am certain of one thing: understanding the main idea is more important than knowing the facts. I will talk about this in two simple parts: first, how a fact is just one example of a main idea, and second, how we can grasp a main idea better than a fact. \n\nFirst, the main idea is key because facts are just examples of it. Teachers often use examples to help us get the main idea. For instance, to understand that music makes people relaxed, it helps to know that many hospitals play classical or jazz music. But learning the example is not the main goal. It helps us understand the bigger picture. \n\nWhen we form our own thoughts, we think with the main ideas we remember. This shows why main ideas are more important to learn than facts. If we think about music's role in the world, we might say that since music relaxes people, without it there could be more wars and many people would be unhappy. This is how I see the value of main ideas. \n\nAs I have shown, to learn well, we should focus on main ideas more than facts. But we still need facts to get the main ideas.

That's why in many cities, you can't drive every day. For instance, in Bologna on Mondays from 8:30 in the morning to 6:30 in the evening, driving is not allowed.\n\nDriving at certain times is also a big issue. You waste a lot of time stuck in traffic, like when you're going to work. And after being in your car for so long, it takes even more time to park because there are no spots available.\n\nI hope that in twenty years, things will be different.

People who are not careful or are too easily swayed buy things because of ads.\n\nFirst, ad companies usually have a lot of money. This lets them create nice, eye-catching ads. They use many ways to get the attention of buyers. TV ads are the best way to get someone to buy your product. Ads in newspapers are not as good because they don't interact with you. In TV ads, you can see people using or eating the product that is for sale. These ads connect with buyers more easily.\n\nSecond, ads are made to make products look better than they really are. Take a frozen pizza ad, for example. The pizza in the ad always looks hot and tasty. You can see the cheese melting. But when you buy and cook it, it's just a regular frozen pizza, not like the one in the ad.\n\nThird, ads trick buyers. People buy things based on how they look in the ad, not how good they really are. Sometimes ads lie about what the product can do. For example, they might show toothpaste that makes your teeth very white or soap that gets rid of all skin problems.\n\nIn conclusion, ads make products look much better than they are. This is because the main goal of ads is to sell. But to sell a lot, you have to make the product seem special and better than others, eye-catching, or even exaggerate what it can do."}

I will talk about my own ideas and give clear reasons for them. First, young people spend a lot of time on fun things like watching TV, playing video games, and doing sports. Young people use a lot of the world's fun stuff. Older people usually stick to their own hobbies and don't mix much with others. Also, older people often don't have the energy to have fun because they are older. But young people are different; they have lots of energy to play outside and have a good time. They like to play and talk with friends. Second, young people like new and trendy things more than older people, which helps them enjoy life. For example, young people enjoy skateboarding, which is a new trend in sports. Older people might not try this sport because they worry about safety. So, they miss out on this fun. They usually stick to simple, old-fashioned games. Also, most older people like to stay home instead of going out to play. But young people love to be outside. These days, being outside is a big part of having fun. So, many older people who stay inside miss out on a lot of fun. In the end, young people are into different kinds of fun and are more open to new trends than older people. Because of this, young people have more fun than older people."}
{"file_id": "1118709.txt", "output_essay": "Nowadays, colleges have many courses for students. Each student thinks differently about learning a lot about many subjects or just focusing on one. I believe focusing on one subject can lead to more success in that area. First, if you study many subjects, you can't learn about any of them in depth. For example, when I was in high school, I studied many things for three years. There were too many topics, and I couldn't focus on one or see how they connected. So, learning many subjects didn't help me. I prefer to study just one subject deeply. Second, today, we have experts in each field. If you know a little about many things but not much about one thing, you can't do much in our world. People work hard in their area and become experts. If you focus on one subject and learn a lot about it, you can help others who need your expertise. But if you learned about many subjects, you didn't learn enough about any of them. Third, we don't have enough time to learn everything in life. There are many subjects, and if you pick one, you should stick to it because there's not enough time to learn even one subject well. For instance, I'm studying nursing. I always think about how to care for patients and learn a lot for them. I don't have time to study many subjects because I'm not perfect at learning everything about one subject. One subject has so much to learn, so I chose to focus on nursing. By doing this, I can get better at caring for patients. So, when I finish school, I'll be a better nurse. I think focusing on one subject makes you more skilled in that field. In conclusion, we have many subjects in life. We all want to learn everything, but we can't because each subject has so much to learn. I think it's better to specialize in one subject than to know a little about many. If you focus on one subject, you can learn a lot more about it."}

While ads are useful for selling and showing off new items, they can also make people think too highly of the product. This happens for three main reasons: ads are meant to sell, not just inform; people have different wants; and ads play on our feelings to make us buy things.\n\nFirst, ads today aim to make people desire things. They focus less on just telling us about the product. For example, ads are made by marketing teams to increase sales and make money, not just to announce a new product. The growth of ad agencies and the money in advertising show that it's all about profit. Often, what the customer really wants is overlooked.\n\nSecond, everyone looks for something different in a product. One person might want it to last long, while another looks for a low price. Ads have to appeal to everyone, so they might not talk about the bad parts of a product. This can lead to buyers being let down.\n\nThird, ads have been around for a long time and they know how to get us to buy things. For instance, if I see someone drinking or eating, I start to feel thirsty or hungry. This makes me want to buy what I see in the ad. But I might end up unhappy because I bought it on impulse.\n\nAds play a big role in selling and making new products. Every company uses them for almost everything they make. It's obvious that ads work, or else businesses focused on profit wouldn't use them. But when ads make people want to buy things, it raises their hopes. So, when the product doesn't meet these high hopes, people are more likely to be disappointed."}

But I think it's not the best way because it can be dangerous and takes a lot of time. Traveling with others and a guide is safer. The guide knows the place well and can keep us away from bad areas. In a group, we're less likely to get robbed, run into bad people, or get lost. For instance, I got lost in Hong Kong alone because I couldn't speak Chinese. I was very scared and cried all day. Also, going with a guide saves time. We don't have to plan everything, like looking up famous spots, booking hotels, or checking buses. We can just follow the guide. This lets us enjoy talking and sharing with others more. A study from Korea's Labor Department in 2007 found that 75% of people had a better time with a guide because they didn't have to look up trip info. So, traveling with others is better for fun, saving time, and feeling safe. People should think about this before they travel alone."}
{"file_id": "1114472.txt", "output_essay": "Going on a trip with others and having a tour guide can be good and bad. Whether it's the best way to travel depends on different things. Imagine you work a lot and want to use your vacation time. You have a week or two and plan to go somewhere. Most people look for ease in such times, and they want to see the main attractions. Here, a planned tour with a guide is the best choice: the travel company takes care of everything—all you do is have fun. The guide tells you what most visitors want to know, so you don't need a book to learn about the place you're visiting. You don't have to worry about the problems and risks of traveling alone. But, going with a group and a guide can limit you. This can be annoying if you want adventure or something very personal. I know this because I visited a Turkic tombstone in Mongolia with a group. I love Turkic history. The stone had writing on it, and I wanted to read it myself (I had tried to learn the old letters before). But we only had two hours there, and I had to leave with the group because they weren't as interested and we had to be back at the camp by 4 PM. I was so upset that I decided to go back alone later. This shows the bad side of guided trips—you can't choose where to go or how long to stay. You can't fully 'live' the activity and place because it's not just your experience; it becomes a group thing and you miss out on the joy of finding, thinking, or feeling something by yourself. So, I like to travel alone when I have time. But I also think that planned trips can be good and fun if you're short on time or not very excited about where you're going."}

If people know about many topics, they can understand the news better. They can also talk about many things and meet new friends. If they only focus on one subject, they might miss out on these chances. Knowing a lot about one subject can help with jobs in the future.

This is not a simple question, but it is the right one to ask to figure out why ads have this effect. I think the main way marketers work is to play on people's weak spots. Most of us want to fit in with our friends or coworkers. This happens without us knowing, and we can't stop it. Because of this, we buy things that we think will make others see us better; we want anything that might make us look good. Let me give you an example. If I see that David Beckham uses a certain aftershave, I might think that using it will make me as popular as he is. This is why ads often show famous people using a product: because deep down, we want to be like them. But is there a way to fix this issue? It is a problem because it shows a weak point in our society. I think the first step is to know about this. If we do, we will think more about ads and their products won't look as good as we first thought."}

First, ads are made to sell things, so they only show the good parts of the things they are selling. They don't talk about the bad parts or problems, which makes people only see the good things and then buy the product. Second, when more than one company makes a similar product, they compete. Ads are a big part of selling, so companies try to make their stuff look better than the others. They might say their product has special benefits that aren't really there just to win over customers. Even though good companies usually don't do this because it could hurt their name, it still happens sometimes. Third, companies will only spend money on ads if they think they will make more money back. If the ad doesn't make the product look like something the customers want, the company won't use it. The last thing is that ads are all about making a product look way better than it is. Look at movie and video game previews. They are made to get people excited to watch the movie or play the game. But often, when people actually watch the movie or play the game, it's not as good as they expected."}

Being young means they have a lot of energy to have fun however they like. Take someone who loves playing outdoor games when they have free time. If this person is young, they can quickly grab their gear and start playing. But if an older person thinks about this, it's not so simple. They have to remember what their doctor told them not to do. Also, they might not have the energy to play even if they like to. Instead, they might just watch TV or have dinner with family, which is a simpler way to have fun that many older people enjoy. \n\nAnother reason I agree is because of travel. Many people enjoy going on trips. When friends plan a long trip, it's easy for young people. They can handle problems like bad weather or walking a long way if their car breaks down. But older people might struggle in these situations. They need their medicine when the weather changes, and even with medicine, they might not be sure their body can handle it. \n\nIn short, young people can have more fun because they have the energy to do what they want. But older people have their own ways to enjoy life too. They had their own fun when they were young."}
{"file_id": "1131180.txt", "output_essay": "I believe that knowing ideas and learning facts are both key for students. But if I had to pick one, I'd say understanding ideas is more crucial than just knowing facts. When you grasp the idea behind a fact, you can understand many related facts. For instance, kids learn to add by understanding the concept of addition, not just memorizing that 2 + 2 equals 4. Once they get the concept, they can add any numbers. This means that knowing a concept helps you get many facts of the same type. However, I also see a big problem with focusing too much on ideas: we might ignore the real world. The real world matters because it's what we aim to explain with our ideas. Without it, we'd be talking about things that don't matter, which isn't helpful. We need a mix of both ideas and facts. A good way to teach a theory is by giving examples from real life. This helps students understand the idea better. Also, when a teacher talks about a fact, he should explain the idea behind it. This way, the student will really get the fact and its effects, like why a war started. Plus, they'll be able to understand other similar facts by spotting the same ideas."}

I really agree with this because it has more pros than going alone. First, let's talk about going alone. People like to visit new places and want to learn everything about them. They look up information before they go, but it's not much. They often miss out on great spots nearby. No one is there to tell you about the place's history or culture or why it's special. Locals or regular visitors usually know these things. Now, let's think about traveling with a guide. They know a lot. I'll share my own story to show why it's good to have a guide. In college, we went to North India and saw a few places. At the Taj Mahal, we saw the most amazing building. The guide told us when it was made, who made it, the culture back then, and other cool facts. We learned we knew very little before. We were thrilled to learn so much; it was like we could see the building being made. We thought the Taj Mahal was the only spot to see, but the guide took us to another great building nearby. We didn't know about it before. Later, we had some issues with time. Our guide was super helpful. He made sure we saw everything and didn't miss out. Since he was from the area, he also knew where to get tasty food. The whole trip with the guide was fun and useful. We learned a lot, like history, that we didn't know before. In the end, I think you can't really understand historical places just by reading or hearing about them. Having a guide is very useful. You learn more than if you go alone."}

They also know they have lived most of their life. This is not a happy thought. So, it's true that many older people can't enjoy life much. But some don't want to. I've seen healthy and rich older people who stay inside and feel sad. But young people are just starting their lives. They have to work hard to find their place. This isn't always enjoyable. They study hard in school to get better jobs. This goes on in college. When they have free time, many waste it playing computer games. Some young people are unhappy with society and live on the edge. Meanwhile, some older people have good money or are retired. They take fancy trips and don't have to succeed at work. They don't have school stress. They can play with grandkids or walk with friends.

IBM, however, relied on their strong spot in the market for big business computers. They thought their big business customers would also buy IBM computers, so they didn't keep making new designs or software. They believed these clients didn't need it. Because of this, IBM lost its edge and market share when other companies made cheaper and better versions of IBM computers. IBM stopped selling computers after losing a lot of money. Apple, however, kept making new things and now has a big group of customers for their Macs. They also took big risks by making completely new products like the iPod and iPhone, which were very successful. Apple even changed their name from 'Apple Computer' to 'Apple' to show they were moving from just making computers to the entertainment business.

The tour guide is very important for making our trip fun and full of adventure. He shares stories about the area and gets us excited to see more. I went to Agra, India with my friends. We decided to join a guided tour to see more and learn about the history. Agra is full of history, and I wanted to learn it properly. I knew a tour guide could help, and I was right. He told us all about the history of the famous places there. The Taj Mahal, one of the Seven Wonders, is in Agra. Hearing its history was moving, not just for me but for everyone. If I hadn't been with that guide, I wouldn't have enjoyed Agra as much. I wouldn't have learned so much about the Taj Mahal. Now, I prefer to travel with a guide. I think everyone should try it. You learn a lot about the place. If you like it, you can go back alone later. But for the first visit, go with a guide. They handle hotels, travel, and tickets. With a guide, we just have fun.

I believe that ads often don't live up to what they promise when you actually get or see the product. Ads are often far from the truth for many reasons, which I will talk about from my point of view.\n\nFirst, there is a lot of competition for almost every product out there. This makes companies say their products are the best and much better than others. When I was young, I was often sad because the toys I got for my birthday were smaller in real life than they looked on TV.\n\nNext, let's talk about quality. Often, the quality you get is not as good as what the ad shows or hints at. For example, the sports shoes I buy don't last as long as the ads and the price suggest they should.\n\nAlso, there's the problem of customer service after you buy something. Ads often talk about how good a company's service is. But most of the time, it's hard to get a good answer or help with a problem. I've had trouble with phone company call centers, wasting time and money on calls that didn't help.\n\nAds also use tricks to grab your attention. Usually, on TV, they show very attractive people or loud music. You end up paying more attention to the person or music than the product. This happens a lot when they use famous people in ads.\n\nIn conclusion, I don't trust ads because they make products look more appealing than they are. Ads often don't tell the truth."}

This makes others want to buy and use the same things. But often, people forget they don't look or live like the models. This is a mistake. When they get the product, they may feel let down because they didn't really need it.\n\nAds also look good because companies work hard to beat their rivals and sell more. They spend a lot of money and time on ads. A study found that 90 percent of fashion companies think it's important to invest in ads. For instance, hiring a well-known designer can be very expensive, costing as much as ten times what one worker makes in a month.\n\nSo, ads can end up being better than the product.

By the time we finish school, we know a little about each subject. Then we can choose which ones we want to study more. It's good to know about many subjects instead of just one. We use all these subjects in life, so we should know the basics of each. Once we have learned a bit about all subjects, we can focus on one. This helps us feel confident and get better at it. We can learn from what others have done in this subject. We can try to solve problems they didn't solve. This helps us learn more and get better at the subject.

This way of learning comes from Japan's long history of education. So, it's an important step for students to learn facts first. The second reason is that knowing facts is needed to think of right ideas. If students don't know facts, they might not really get the ideas. Like in food science, if students don't know about nutrients, they can't understand how their body uses food. They also can't think of new ideas about how the body works.

These distractions keep them away from fun activities and important duties, like helping in their communities. This problem has been growing for years.

One reason for this might be the way parents and schools teach them. It seems more important to learn about the internet than to talk about the last book they read. Also, communities should offer fun things to do to get teens to come and take part. They could have concerts of all music types, soccer matches, or other sports. They could set up a library with the internet, books, CDs, and DVDs. They could put on plays or go to the theater. Teens should learn more about where they live and the world around them, not just their own group or city.

This means that people who do well don't always need to try new things and take chances. We often hear that people who do well always try new things and take chances. This seems too quick to me. We think this because we only see the ones who make it. We hardly ever see the ones who don't. Trying new things and taking chances can also lead to failure. So, many people choose to stick to what they know. They work hard to be better than others. Trying alone is not enough. We need to put in more time and effort to make our new ideas better. And making things better is hard and complex. If someone only wants to come up with new things but is too lazy to make them better, they won't do well. But if someone is ready to work hard to make things better, they are more likely to do well than the person who first thought of the idea. Look at Japan. The Americans made cars first, but they didn't work to make them better. The Japanese did work hard and spent money to make cars better. Now, Japan is the top car-making country.

My cousins and I ran, played in the water, swam, and surfed. We had a great time. Then, my aunt told us to stop. We were shocked. She did this because my grandfather had passed out. So, older people are not as healthy and can't have as much fun. \n\nSecond, young people know more about fun places than older people. Most 14-year-olds like me know where to have fun. Older people often don't know where to go. This happened to my friend's grandparents. It was a sunny day, and they were free. They wanted to go out but didn't know where. They called my friend for ideas. I was surprised, but then I got it. They lived differently when they were young. \n\nThird, we young people can move around better. Even if grandparents have time, some can't drive. They lived in a time when not many learned to drive. But most college students can drive now. We can also take buses, trains, and skytrains. Sadly, older people need to sit, and there aren't always seats for them on public transport. \n\nIn the end, young people can have more fun than older people.

As they get older, they use this knowledge to make the most of their lives. Also, older people often have more money to spend on themselves, which can add to their enjoyment. Some say that you only start to enjoy life when you reach a certain age. But others see it differently. Young people usually have fewer worries. Their parents take care of the hard stuff, so they can focus on growing up. Young people have lots of time to find out what they like. It's true that older people know what they enjoy and don't need to try new things. But young people get to explore and learn, which is exciting. They get to feel and learn about things they didn't know before. For instance, most people remember their first kiss more than their last one. To sum up, I think you can enjoy life when you're young and when you're old, but in different ways. The early part of life is for exploring and finding what you like. The later part is for using what you've learned to enjoy life."}

For example, imagine going to a place known for its amazing views. You decide to visit it. While walking, you find yourself stuck and can't move. You're in a swamp. In this case, there's no solution, but this wouldn't happen if you were with a group. \n\nAlso, in a group, people share the work and everything is more organized than when you're alone.

I think that successful people do many things and like doing them. They usually don't worry about the results of their work. Instead, they focus on how hard they tried. This is what makes them interesting. If they don't try new things and only do the same work they are used to, without taking any risks, we wouldn't call them successful. Take a scientist who studies living things, for example. He picks one area to study and does tests, makes guesses, and keeps going until he gets it right. He travels and has many adventures to learn about a certain kind of animal. He watches how different animals act and then figures out what it means. His work is hard and takes a long time. If his ideas are correct, he has done well in his study. But he doesn't stop there. He moves on to study other animals. His work never ends. If he only studied one thing his whole life, it wouldn't be as good. Things change, and animals can live in new places. So, he needs to keep succeeding. This is also true for a business manager or owner. A business person who makes a product that sells well and makes a lot of money is successful. But he won't just make that one thing. He will try new things and make new products. If the new product sells, he has done well. Even if it doesn't sell, he is still successful because he will learn from it. Another point is that success isn't about doing the same job every day. Everyone should try new things because there is so much to learn in the world. If our new ideas don't work out, it's okay.

Those who do well in their jobs try to make new things and take chances. This is because doing well pushes them to do better in their area. When someone does well and reaches his goal, he will try new things. He will want to learn more in that area and use what he knows in other areas too. Think about Sir Isaac Newton. If he had stopped after finding out about gravity, we would not know many things we know today. He used his ideas in math, physics, and science. Imagine if Newton had stopped taking chances and looking for new ideas. Then, we would not have made progress. Science would not have moved forward. Let's also talk about Einstein. He came up with the idea E=mc^2, the theory of relativity. He used this idea to explain things around him, which amazed everyone. These great people did not stop when they reached their goals. They used their success to find out more new things. If someone who does well does not want to keep learning in his area of interest, then his success is not that important. Doing what is already known can be done by many. But only a few can use it in new ways. These few see their success as a way to find out what is not known. It is smart to use your ideas in different ways. But to really do well, you need to use your ideas in many areas. People who do well will always try to make new things and take chances.

They all say they can get rid of many stains, make clothes bright, and keep the color for a long time. But these claims are often too strong. Look at soap ads. They say soaps can make people more beautiful and even healthy. I have never seen this happen in real life. This is true for ads about clothes, cars, food, and more. They all say things that are not quite true. Car makers say they have new technology that people have not heard of. Food products say they have all the vitamins and proteins people need. In the end, ads often make products look much better than they are. So, I think it is fair to say that ads usually exaggerate how good products are."}
{"file_id": "1121216.txt", "output_essay": "I think it's more important for students to grasp ideas and concepts than to just learn facts. I feel this way because the idea and concept of something are usually more important than just the fact. This is especially true in subjects like technology, philosophy, and math. In these areas, you need to think about the fact with the help of ideas and concepts. So, understanding and thinking about ideas and concepts is key to really getting the fact itself.\n\nFirst, we study many subjects in school that are about facts. But we won't fully understand these subjects if we don't know the ideas and concepts behind the facts. Take, for example, a class on how airplanes are built. We learn the fact that airplanes exist. But if we also learn why we use certain materials or why parts go in certain places, we get a better idea of how to make the airplane fly well and efficiently. Like, we use aluminum instead of iron for the plane's frame because it's lighter. This is a key idea to understand about airplane design.\n\nSecond, ideas and concepts matter more than facts when we solve math problems. To solve a problem, we need to know the ideas and concepts behind it. If we only know the fact, we won't find the answer. In math, we use both facts and ideas to think about these facts.\n\nLastly, ideas and concepts are important in how we see life. Our life views are based on facts, but we need to understand the ideas behind these facts. For instance, it's a fact that people should get married. But we need to understand why. The idea here is more important. We should marry not just because we want to, but because humans are social and need partners and children to be happy."}

They might say that you can explore on your own if you don't have a tour guide. This might be okay if you are by yourself, have a lot of time, and are in your own country.\n\nBut think about going to a new country where you don't know anyone. You don't know the local people, their ways, or their history. You don't know the important places or how to find your way around. How can you have a good trip if you are always trying to figure out where to go and how to get there?\n\nGoing with a tour guide and a group has many good points. You meet people who like the same things you do. You can talk with them and share useful information. You can learn about where they are from. Maybe they can show you around their country later, and you could do the same for them.\n\nTour guides know a lot about the places you visit. They can take you to special places that you might not find on your own. They can help you talk to local people and tell you where to go and where to avoid.\n\nMost importantly, tour guides help you make the most of your trip. When you visit a new country, they make sure you see all the famous and important spots. Without a guide, you might miss out on these places."}

The main reason is that the guide knows a lot because they have been there before and know a lot about the place. If I wanted to go on a trip with my friends, the first thing we would do is get a guide.\n\nThere are many reasons to choose a guide for our trip. The most important is their knowledge of the area. If I tried to book a hotel, I wouldn't know the prices. Also, finding transport could be hard. A guide is useful because they know where to stay for less money. Nowadays, guides often work with local drivers. This helps travelers have their own way to get around and see different sights. I know a travel company that has guides to help travelers have a great time.\n\nGuides know the local area well. They can show us the real local culture. There are special places to eat where we can try the true taste of the area. We need someone to take us to these spots. A guide is like a local friend. They help us stay in good hotels without spending too much. They also help us eat the best food and see the best places.\n\nTo finish, I believe a guide can make our trip exciting. They help us plan everything for a small amount of money."}

I want to share examples and my own experiences to back up my view. When you travel alone, you can make your own choices. With a tour guide, they often decide what you see, not you. On a school trip, we had a bad time with our guide. He took us to places we didn't like. He also booked us into an expensive hotel to get money from the hotel for bringing us there. We had more bad times because the guide wanted to make extra money. If you travel alone, you can learn about places by talking to people who live there or by using a local travel book. Now, we can also use the internet to find out about places. There are good travel books in many languages that teach us about local life. I want to finish by saying I made up my mind from what I've been through. My trips were better without a guide."}

In truth, anyone who is open to new ideas, plans their time well, and works hard can have a good life, no matter their age. Young people with a lot of energy might want to learn more and see the world. They are excited to learn about things they care about. They often go to parties, concerts, and sports events, and they make friends. But a young person from a troubled family who is closed-minded might not feel like learning or having fun. They could become sad and be in bad situations, wasting time with drugs or other bad choices. They might leave school and not know what to do. They don't plan their time or their life well, so they can't enjoy it. Older people, on the other hand, might stop working and have money saved up. They know how to live well. They might start their day with a walk in the park, read the paper, and sit in the sun. They plan nice trips and visit friends sometimes. They also start new hobbies to fulfill their childhood dreams. But some older people who didn't plan well when they were younger might have money problems. They might be sick and can't go out. Being ill can make life hard and unhappy. So, it doesn't matter if you're young or old. People can have a good life if they value it, plan their time well, and stay open to new things."}

I believe it's very important to know a lot about different subjects to grow our overall learning. These days, it's essential to know about many topics. For instance, we should be able to discuss politics, the environment, talking to people, and business. We can't do this if we don't know a lot about history, science, or math. If we don't, we won't care about big issues that are part of our daily life. That's why we need to learn as much as we can while we're in college. After learning about many things, you can then pick the one thing that fits you best. You can then learn more about it to show your true self in the best way. If you weren't interested in other basic subjects before, it might be hard to see things in a smart and full way.

As time goes on, more cars are made and bought around the world. This is happening because more people are being born and cars are cheaper, so more people can afford them. The number of people is increasing, and these people want cars. Cars are also cheaper to make now because of new technology and materials. This means even more people can own a car. Better roads and highways are being built everywhere. This makes it easier for people to go to different places. In some countries, like Italy, public transport isn't very good. So, more people want their own car instead of using public transport that doesn't work well. People also like to be on their own more than in the past. They want to move around by themselves, and a car helps them do that. People need cars to go to work, travel, and enjoy driving. They like the freedom it gives them. For all these reasons, I think more cars will be made and sold in the future. So, in twenty years, we will see more cars, not fewer."}

They believe that because our lives are so busy, we can't find time to assist the poor, spend time with lonely elderly people, or work towards peace in some countries or families. It's true that we're very busy and don't have much time to give to our communities, but that doesn't mean we don't want to help. In the past, young people didn't do much for their communities, but now, more and more of us are getting involved in helping out. We see more non-profit groups these days. The people in these groups work for free. They have many different goals. Some help the poor who have nothing to eat. Others help people addicted to drugs. There are groups like Greenpeace that protect the environment and groups like UNICEF that help kids. Some fight for women's rights and against illegal prostitution. There are many groups working to make our communities better, and they are getting more helpers. In conclusion, even if we don't have as much time as we'd like, more young people are finding time to help others. This effort makes us better people."}

This is because countries like China and India are getting richer. This wealth lets their people buy more cars. Also, cars are becoming cheaper. This is due to American and Asian car makers competing with each other. Plus, cars are being made to last longer. We also see more roads and highways being built to handle the growing number of cars. \n\nIn the West, the number of cars will grow a little. But in the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, and China), which are still developing, the number of cars will grow a lot. \n\nCar prices are dropping. This is because American and Asian companies are working hard to be the best in the world. \n\nGovernments are also doing their part by building new, faster highways. \n\nIn the end, I think that there will be more cars in the future. This is true even though we have problems with the environment and oil. \n\nNew roads are being made for the extra cars. These cars will be safer and use less fuel.

{"file_id": "1135299.txt", "output_essay": "I fully agree that young people have more fun than older people. Being young is like being fresh. Age plays a big role in how fresh you feel to have the most fun in life. \n\nThe main reason for this is that young people don't have many responsibilities or daily problems. They rely on their parents or have some help. This freedom makes them feel free and adds to their fun. Older people, who have more experience, have families to care for. Their lives revolve around their families. So, they only have fun with family, workmates, and close friends. Also, as time goes by, they feel more content with life. They need less and care more about emotional support than having fun. For example, in countries like India and Sri Lanka, older people enjoy spiritual things more and often choose to live simply, without much fun. \n\nAnother reason young people have more fun is that they are usually healthier than older people. When you get older, your body can't do everything it could when you were young. For instance, young people can eat lots of chocolate without worrying, but older people can't. \n\nYoung people like to try new things, face challenges, make new friends, and grow their social life. Older people don't make new friends as easily and stick to the friends they already have. Another point is that older people have had their fun already. They feel they have done enough and don't want to have more fun. So, it makes sense to say that young people have more fun than older ones."}

The things from school that stay in a person's mind are the things they really understood. About 14 years after finishing university, it's interesting to see that I can still explain most of my knowledge to my son. I understood this information well, instead of just memorizing it. After a few years, even people with good memories won't remember things they didn't understand. As a child, I learned many Bible verses at school. But now, I've forgotten many because I don't say them often. I learned them for a good grade, not to understand them. The verses I remember are the ones that were explained to me and that matter in my life. I believe that education should teach by explaining things, not just by having students memorize them.

{"file_id": "1126528.txt", "output_essay": "I love to travel, but people often argue about the best way to do it: alone or with others. I believe it's better to go alone, and here are four reasons why. First, I want to visit many places. Having a tour guide can be helpful in new places because I might not know which areas are unsafe. But on guided tours, I sometimes have to see things I'm not interested in. Also, planning my own trip is important. We don't have much time to travel, so planning is the first step! Second, travel lets us learn more about the world. I've been to Brazil many times and met many different people. Learning about their lives and thoughts was very exciting. I enjoy meeting people from other countries, like Brazilians, and talking with them. Travel is about learning and making new friends. But this only happens when I travel alone. I wouldn't have these experiences if I only traveled by myself. Third, travel helps me think about my life and future. Where I live, I don't get new ideas and it's not good for me. But in new places, I feel refreshed and curious. Finally, I find traveling with others, like friends or family, less interesting. When I'm with a group, I can't explore or think on my own. It's a chance for me to go, think, and have fun by myself. I want to travel alone every year, go wherever I choose, and grow as a person."}

Older people often don't work anymore and have more time and money to travel to different places. Young people, however, usually have to study a lot and don't have as much money to travel a lot. But, they do like to explore new places and try new things. Older people, who have done a lot already, sometimes prefer to go back to places they know instead of seeking new adventures. But, older folks may have health issues that make it harder for them to move around. Young people don't have to worry about their health as much. So, older people often care more about their families. To me, watching your grandkids grow is better than going to dance clubs and staying out late, which many young people enjoy. In conclusion, I don't think young people have more fun than older people. There are many things older people can do that young people can't. I believe older people have fun in their own way, just like young people do, and one isn't better than the other."}

It's true that some young people only think about themselves and don't help out, but there are also many who do get involved in helping others. I know many young people who do things to support their communities. They are part of groups that do good work. For example, they help kids with family issues with their homework after school. They play music in church on Sundays. When I was younger, in high school, I did many things like this. Now, I don't have as much time, so I try to do other things. Like many others, I'm with the Red Cross. So, twice a year I go to the hospital and give blood for free. This helps many people who need blood every day because of different health issues. To end, I think it's true that some people today don't help their communities enough. But I want to point out that many young people do care. They are active in social work and spend a lot of time helping others."}

People work there for free, and many young people join them. I say this because I have friends, and my girlfriend too, who do these kinds of things, and I really look up to them for it. For example, my girlfriend helps out at a first aid group. I know they do a lot, like taking care of old people and helping at accidents. Young people often help at sports or music events too. Whenever there's a soccer game in my town, young helpers from first aid groups are there to help. I would like to help too, but my college work takes up most of my time.

Young people, on the other hand, have the energy and strength to do tasks. They are excited by new experiences. They try everything and experience life fully. They are always discovering, learning, feeling, and doing more every day. Feelings are important for everyone. Old people know they are getting old; they realize they don't have much time left. Some worry about death and losing family and friends. Young people, though, see life as full of chances to take. They look forward to the rest of their lives. Thinking can be hard for older people. They slowly lose the ability to think clearly and remember things, which is tough for them. They know their brain is getting weaker, but they can't stop it. Young people, however, are at their smartest. They are full of new ideas and things to learn. They have a future to plan for. So, young people don't worry about their minds as much.

After their day, they are tired and just want to watch TV or rest. They rarely think about their community. In the past, our ancestors and grandparents cared a lot about their family and community. They did not have much, but they used what they had well. They talked and spent time with others, unlike people today who are too busy to visit old friends or family. I think we should teach people to care about their society and those who live in it. They should see people who have nothing and are sleeping on the streets. They should give some time and money to help and care for them. I remember in college, I saw a man who was hurt in an accident on the road. No one helped because they were too busy. The man died there. This should not happen again. Everyone should help their community as much as they can. This shows they care and are willing to help. We should teach children about being good and caring for their community. A person with good values will not ignore their society. Everyone should spend time helping their community. I have seen many older people do a lot for the community. Where I live, we had no medical services. Some older people, all over 55, asked our local leader for a hospital. This was for our children and everyone here. They did this for the community. But the young people did not care. They were too focused on their jobs and lives. They were selfish. I think everyone should do something for society. It makes you feel good, which is very important for a person."}
{"file_id": "1134057.txt", "output_essay": "I totally agree with the statement. Also, I think that good ads should make products look more effective to have a big impact on buyers. Ads for skincare items are really good at changing what's real. They often use models with perfect skin, no matter the product. They show the model using the item and say how much it changed her skin. People quickly respond to this cause and effect. But the truth is, the product likely did nothing for the model's skin. She already had great skin. And I'm not even talking about the digital touch-ups... But, I think we must understand that the ad I talked about did its job. It made people think about the product, and they will buy it. That's the main goal of marketing: to make sales. I believe it's mostly up to the buyer to learn to ignore ads. We know they are not true, so why do we trust them? Don't misunderstand me: advertising is controlled and should stick to what society says is okay. There are laws against lying to customers in ads. Going back to my example, if the skincare item can really help skin look a bit better, then it's up to the buyer to figure out what's true and what's just for show. As long as the ad doesn't promise the same results for everyone, the marketing company is in a good place. I'll end by questioning the opposite opinion: how can anyone not agree with the idea that ads make items look way better than they are? That's just how it is.

There's also a group I know called 'Guardian Angels.' This group has about 50 young members. They walk around downtown, and if they see someone who needs help, they help or give advice. For instance, if they meet girls who are 18 or younger out late at night, they talk them into going home earlier. Another young woman I know is helping her community's tourism. She works at a local travel agency. She wanted her town to be more popular, so she set up a festival. The people in her town helped her by bringing food, handmade items, and local things to sell.

This happens because we don't chat with our neighbors as much as we used to. In my community, there was a chance to visit a home for old people. This was only for kids, but just two showed up. The others didn't come because they were scared to meet and talk to new people. Another reason is that young people today don't care much about helping communities.

First, I once bought a lotion that said it would help a person lose inches from their waist. The ad had the usual before-and-after photos. But after I used up the lotion, nothing changed. I didn't lose any inches. Second, some companies make their products look better by leaving out important information or by putting it in small print. This can be key details like side effects or when not to use the product. However, if companies don't make their products seem great, they can't keep up with others in the market. They need to do this to stay in business. In the end, companies today have to make their products look very good.

I always got A's in my Korean classes. I enjoyed studying Korean books and was good at writing stories and poems.\n\nOne day, my dad said I should study in America. He believed I could learn about a different culture and a new language. I was worried when I heard my dad's idea. I thought I could only learn Korean. The idea of moving to America seemed very hard. I spent a lot of time thinking about the good things I could get from America. I could learn a new language and get to know Western culture.\n\nAfter three months, I made up my mind to leave South Korea. I took a chance and went to America, ready to face new challenges. When I first got to Dallas, I was surprised by how big my high school was. There were many smart students and teachers. It was hard for me to keep up in class, but I didn't quit. I studied a lot after school and talked to students from other countries. This made my English better.\n\nI studied very hard, and now I am happy with myself. I get good grades and have many friends.

{"file_id": "1124369.txt", "output_essay": "Students get ideas and learn from facts. I think it's important for students to get ideas before they learn facts. There are many reasons for this. I will explain some with examples below. It's very important to understand the ideas of a topic before learning facts. Take a chemistry lab experiment as an example. What would happen in the lab if you didn't know the idea of the experiment? If you tried the experiment without understanding it, there could be accidents. This is because you must be careful with chemicals. If you're not careful, the experiment will go wrong. For instance, H2SO4 is a very strong acid. In college, a student didn't know the details of an experiment. He mixed water with H2SO4, and it exploded. Our teacher got mad at him, but that's a different story. Not knowing what you're doing in an experiment can be dangerous. Think about nuclear experiments in some countries. If they go wrong, on purpose or by accident, there could be a huge explosion. We need to know the ideas there. Without this knowledge, we can't do anything. Nuclear weapons have more energy than anything else. Even the Sun's energy comes from nuclear reactions. Also, understanding ideas gives safety and full information about what a student wants to learn. If a student knows about ideas, he gets the whole point of what he wants to learn from the facts. This makes sure nothing or no one gets hurt when using knowledge. But, knowing facts without the ideas behind them is different. In my view, we must know the ideas before we try to learn the facts."}

They might not spend much time helping their communities. This could be because they are busy and have different things they think are important.\n\nThese days, young people think about themselves a lot. This is because our society cares more about each person than about groups of people. In the same way, young people care about their own lives more than helping others in their community.\n\nI am young too, and I know that I don't care much about communities. I have lived in different countries, and I've noticed that young people act very differently in each place. For example, in Sweden, young men are very independent. In Spain, they are not as independent. Spanish young men might care more about their communities than Swedish young men. So, we need to think about where and how we are talking about this issue.\n\nSociety is to blame for this because it is built to focus on each person. The rules are made to be good for each person, so they become the most important. Still, we can see strong groups in Europe that care about their country and community. If these groups get stronger, young people might start to spend more time helping their communities.\n\nIn summary, I agree with the statement, but we need to think about some things first. Young people act very differently based on where they are from and their culture. But overall, it seems that young people don't spend much time helping their communities."}
{"file_id": "1124783.txt", "output_essay": "People who take chances are more likely to gain from what they do than those who do nothing. This makes sense and is proven true around the world. Many of the world's wealthiest people started as regular folks with great ideas. Take Bill Gates as an example. He didn't just make old tools better. He made something new, the personal computer. It changed how we work and have fun. He could have wasted years on something that might not work. But now we see he used his time well and is thought of as a genius.\n\nOthers have done well by taking their ideas to countries with different ways of life. Starbucks coffee is one example. It's now sold worldwide, even in China where people usually prefer tea. The company's leaders must have faced tough choices. Yet, now many Chinese youth enjoy Starbucks coffee to feel connected to American culture.\n\nOn a personal level, we can see that taking risks gives us a better shot at getting what we want and being happy. For instance, you might choose to study in the United States. It will be hard at first because of the new language and being far from loved ones. But if you keep going and get past these hard times, you will get a degree that's worth a lot. This can lead to better jobs and more money.\n\nTo sum up, I believe it's always good to try new things and take chances. We must not forget that we get just one life, and we should try our hardest to be happy and to make others happy too."}
{"file_id": "1140289.txt", "output_essay": "I agree that for students, it's more important to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts. As a student, I think it's key to first get the ideas and concepts before the facts. If someone doesn't get the why behind the facts, I feel it's not helpful to know them. In my own studies, I always look for the reason behind things. I believe that knowing the basic idea makes it easier to remember the fact. I study criminology. In my field, it's crucial to know why something happens, not just what happens. For example, I need to know why a person behaves a certain way, not just what they did. This approach is not just good for criminology but for all areas of study. Like in science, it's very important too. Scientists need to understand why natural events happen, not just the events themselves. In the end, I think if someone really wants to grasp facts and not just memorize them for school, they should ask about the ideas and concepts related to those facts. Even if the fact is about something bad, they should look at it in a new way."}
{"file_id": "1123293.txt", "output_essay": "I read an article about a person who did well because they tried new things and took chances. It made me think about how to do well in our field. We should use our ideas to create new things and be willing to take chances. I agree with this and want to explain more about it. Let's talk about trying new things first. Growing up, I learned about people like Edison and Nobel who did great things. They used their ideas to make new things. Making new things is important because people like to have things that are fun, useful, and make life easier. When we make new things, people will buy them and be happy. Making new things can make us money and sometimes make us famous. So, it's a good way to do well. The second point is about taking chances. Taking chances can be scary. For example, if we try to make something new and fail, we could lose a lot, like our home or family. But if we get ready for these chances, we can make them less scary. We can't make new things without taking some chances. Even though chances can be scary, we still try to make new things. We also need to be careful and always get ready for when things go wrong. By doing this, we can make the bad things less bad if they happen. We want new things more than ever in our lives. Even if it's risky for the person trying, it's a faster way to do well. Sometimes, by getting through tough times, we can become important. For these reasons, I think trying new things and taking chances can help us do well. These actions also make us positive and thoughtful."}

Ads often talk about the bad products. Ads are all around us. When you watch TV, you see ads with some shows in between. You see ads on your computer, on the street, and everywhere else. You can't escape them. Why are there so many ads? The answer is simple: to sell things and make money. Ads usually come from products that aren't doing well but want to be popular. Why do you need to advertise if your product is really good? I remember loving a chocolate that never had ads. Then one day, it had an ad saying it was new and better. I bought it and found out it was more expensive and just had a shiny wrapper. That's how ads work; if a product is good, it doesn't need ads. Ads attract us with 'free' things. I've seen crowds at stores because of a 'free' deal. But 'free' isn't really free. We often miss the hidden truth, like lower quality for the 'free' item. My mom once bought oil that was advertised at a low price. She later saw it was past its expiry date. Sometimes, ads just lie. Famous people in ads don't actually use the soap they're selling. It's all to boost sales. I've often ended up with bad products because of ads. So my advice is: 'don't be tricked by ads.'"}
{"file_id": "1133961.txt", "output_essay": "I think most ads trick people by making things look better. They do this in two main ways: by changing the color of the item's packaging and by giving it a new name that sounds fancy. First, ads use brighter colors on packaging to draw in buyers. People often think dull colors mean old tech, while bright colors make them think of new tech. For instance, in Turkey, people usually like pencils with bright colors more than ones with dull colors. So, advertisers push companies to make pencils with bright colors to sell more. Second, ads make companies rename products to sell more. In Turkey, they sometimes use foreign names instead of Turkish ones to fool buyers. Buyers might think a product is better if it has a foreign name because some Turkish-made items are not that good. There's an example of this in Turkey. A company that makes spaghetti changed its name to an Italian one a few years back. They did this to make people think it was from Italy. As a result, they sold more. This is how they make their items look better, even when they're not. In conclusion, advertisers often make things look better using these methods. Sadly, these tricks are so common that it's hard for buyers to find products that show their true quality."}

Some people prefer to avoid risks. They like to stay where they are, keep the same job, and eat the same food. These people may not often succeed. \n\nBeing brave enough to take risks is key. But you should also be smart when you make plans. Let's say someone wants to start a business. They need to plan a lot. They should first understand the market and how their product fits in. They also need to manage their money well. Starting a business takes bravery because it might succeed or fail. \n\nYou should be confident and brave to compete and do your best. If you fail once, it doesn't mean you'll always fail. Keep trying until you make it. Learning from your mistakes is also important. Don't let one failure stop you from trying again."}

Knowing about many topics makes it easier to talk with all kinds of people. You won't find it hard to chat because you'll know something about what the other person is saying. \n\nIt's also key to learn about different subjects because we can't predict when we'll face tough times. To get through any situation and to keep working during hard times, we need to know at least a little about many areas. This helps us to keep working and not get stuck in life. \n\nIf we only know a lot about one area, we might not be lucky enough to succeed in that area. To always have chances, we should learn about many things. Think about a clerk who used to write in a book by hand. When his company starts using computers, he will need to use them too. If he never learned about computers, he could lose his job to someone who knows how to use them. But if he kept learning about new things, he would find it easy to use the computer and do his job better. \n\nThis is a simple but clear example of why we should keep up with what's happening around us. As the saying goes, 'a little knowledge can be dangerous.' With this in mind, I strongly say that it's better for us to know about many areas, not just one."}
{"file_id": "1140603.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with the statement because I see more people helping out through their own work or by joining groups that are not part of the government. They help communities that are much poorer than their own. Some might think that the race to be successful would keep young people too busy to help others. But young people are helping, just not always close to home. When communities get richer, they need less help. So, people who want to help look for those who really need it, like after natural disasters or in places where people are always poor. More and more groups are collecting money to help poor people in countries that are not as developed. Groups like the Red Cross and Oxfam have projects in these places to bring water, health care, education, and food. Many of the volunteers in these groups are young people who want to help where it's needed most. This help goes to faraway places because we now have better ways to communicate and know what's happening all over the world. Everyone knows we should help others, even if businesses are usually focused on making money. For example, companies care about how people see their role in society. Being responsible in society is now very important for companies that want to be seen well. They improve their image by giving money to these groups so they can send people to help, not just in their own community."}
{"file_id": "1120953.txt", "output_essay": "The question of whether young people have more fun than others is widely debated. Young people are full of dreams and look forward to the future. They can easily learn about new technology and are open to gaining experience and learning about culture, science, and society. They are healthy and can enjoy entertainment, make new friends, and keep them. But do they have the support they need to do what they want? For example, a young couple might want to take a long break from work to travel and enjoy their time together, but they might not have enough money since they are just starting their jobs. Also, taking a vacation could slow down their job progress. Plus, they often have to care for their parents or children. Many young people don't have enough money for fun activities, or they must follow the rules of those who support them. Young people face stress and don't have much experience with solving problems. Older people, however, have many friends and family who help and look after them. They also have their own money and property. But some may have health issues, though many of these can be managed. An older couple can relax without worrying about others. Many believe that whatever will happen, will happen, or they just don't worry much about what's next. An old man once said that life has three parts: In the first thirty years, a person is healthy and likes his job. He has time for fun but not much money. In the next thirty years, he has health and money but must work hard and has little time. Later in life, there is time and money, but health may be gone. To sum up, I enjoyed my youth with friends, excitement, and love, and starting a family made us very happy.

Or do they make promises that aren't real? I think most ads make things look much better than they are. Just watch TV ads and you'll see they often offer more than the real product can give. Take the beauty and diet industry. We always hear about new skin creams or weight loss pills. I've tried many and they never worked for me. Food ads are another example. The food looks much bigger on TV than in real life. People use computers to make their food look better in ads. They have special tricks to make us want to buy their food. Politicians also make ads that aren't true. They promise to do great things and put these promises on big signs to get votes. From what I've seen, they rarely keep these promises. So, I think we should be careful with ads and their promises. Many don't tell the truth. I believe lying is a big part of ads. They only want to show the good sides of what they're selling.

Older people usually think they had their fun when they were young. They want their kids to have fun now because they feel their own lives are almost over. As people get older, they often have health issues like heart problems, high blood pressure, diabetes, and weak bones.

Also, cars are comfortable to use. Another important point is that there are no other good options. Plus, nothing will likely change our need for cars in the next twenty years. \n\nMany people must use cars to go to work. My parents, for example, can only reach their jobs by car. The bus or train doesn't go where they need, and the places are too far to bike. \n\nIn big cities, you can't always rely on buses or trains. In smaller towns, public transport might be limited or not there at all. So, you really need a car. \n\nI also don't see anything changing this in the next twenty years. \n\nCars are usually the quickest way to travel, which makes them very comfortable. People like comfort and won't give it up easily. Anyone who has had a car knows how nice it is. I don't think this will change. \n\nWe also don't have a better way to travel. Cars are important for jobs too. If people stopped buying cars, it would mean a lot of lost jobs. Many people work in car factories. If these factories closed, it would be very bad. The oil industry also creates jobs and they want to keep selling oil. \n\nPoliticians might not be able to change this. \n\nCars are still being sold a lot, and I think this will continue.

{"file_id": "1130868.txt", "output_essay": "These days, we live in a world where people think about themselves a lot. In the past, during our parents' time, things were different; people helped each other more. Now, things have changed. I believe that young people don't spend enough time helping their communities. I can use some examples to show why this is happening. First, young people go to school for a long time. A student might be in college for four or five years. That's a lot longer than in the 60s or 70s. Young people say they are too busy to help others. Even at 20, we feel like we have too much to do. We have homework, group projects, sports, and more. We don't plan to do anything else. But we still make time for movies or to see friends. For instance, we might choose a 3-week vacation over spending one week helping a charity. So, there must be another reason why young people don't care as much. Second, as I mentioned, we care more about ourselves these days. Young people don't believe in God as much as they used to. This could be part of the reason. There aren't many religious events. But religion can bring people together to support a good cause. This lack of community is because of how society is now or because we're not taught the right values and education. Today, parents don't teach their kids to share as much. In short, it's not right, but it's true; young people don't help their communities enough, but I am sure of it."}

Because of this, some think that young people don't spend much time helping their communities. As a young person, I want to share my view and give examples to show I don't agree. I believe young people don't help their communities not because they don't have time, but because they choose not to. For example, I can help my friends when they need it, even when I have my own studies. If I care about a friend, I help them in any way I can. But this means I might have to skip playing on the computer, taking breaks, going to the mall, or running. I think the people who say young people don't help only know selfish ones who only care about themselves. But at college, for instance, students spend lots of time together. They go to the same classes, chat during breaks, eat together, and become like a family. In a family, when someone has a problem, the others help. This is the same at college. Helping each other can make exams easier and college less scary. Also, at home, young people often help a lot as they grow up. They understand that it's important to help their parents. They might work in their free time to make money for themselves so they don't have to ask their parents for it. Or they might clean the house or their room. Sure, there are many young people who don't help their families in these ways, but I can't say that's true for everyone.

This idea means different things to different people. Everyone tries to make their life fun in their own way. If having fun means going to parties, then young people might do this more than older people. But older people also join in celebrations just like the young. I sometimes agree because young people often have better chances to have fun. They are full of life, active, and have the energy to enjoy sports by playing and watching. They love to see new places. Young people who like movies watch them when they can. They go on picnics for a change, and many love to dance for hours. They often try different kinds of food. This is what we call having fun. If we agree with the idea, it would mean that older people don't have fun but just keep living. The things young people do now were once done by the older people, so they may not find them exciting anymore. They also may not have the energy to do these things all the time. But they have fun in other ways, like sitting in the sun, reading the paper, and giving advice to the young. They might not try different foods because of health reasons, but they still enjoy it secretly. They lead the family and have duties to look after. This is also having fun, just a different kind.

Every day, we use more and more gas because there are so many cars and factories that need it. As we have less gas, it will get more expensive. Soon, gas will cost so much that many people won't be able to buy it. They will have cars but no gas to run them. Isn't that strange? Meanwhile, many scientists are working hard to stop this problem before it gets worse. They are looking into other types of energy like solar and electric. These two are getting the most attention. But, these energy types have problems too. The sun is great for energy, but we can't get it at night. Electric energy is also good, but right now we make it using machines that need gas.

Young people can do many things that older people can't, like skydiving, snowboarding, and rock climbing. Young people also see life in a bright way. They haven't made many mistakes or had bad experiences like broken relationships or failures. They feel things deeply and love new experiences. Older people often remember sad things, like losing someone they love or things that didn't work out. These memories can make them feel tired and less able to enjoy life.

Sometimes students learn facts because they think it's an easier way to study; but this is not true.

We must learn facts well because if we don't know them, we can't really get an idea or concept. We might mix up different things with the idea or concept.\n\nThe first point is that we need to know facts better than concepts to really get an idea.

If we learn only about the big damage in different countries during World War II, these are facts. But they are very detailed and can make us confused. We might not know if we are learning about the damage to each country or about World War II as a whole. To avoid confusion, we must learn the facts first.\n\nIn my opinion, we should learn facts before ideas and concepts to understand what is important and get the main idea.

If you only use old ways to fix a problem, you might not find a solution. This means if you're not scared of the problem and you face it, you'll see it's not so hard. For example, when I was young, I had to wait for my mom to take me home after school. One day, she couldn't come because my grandma was sick and needed to go to the hospital. We didn't have cell phones to talk to each other. My mom was worried she wouldn't find me. But I decided to go to the library and there I found my brother.

These plans are easy because we don't have to plan anything ourselves, and a guide with a booked bus leads us. But I don't think the best way to travel is in a group with a guide. Here's why.\n\nFirst, we miss out on the fun of planning our own trip if we use a travel plan with a guide. I learned how important and fun it is to plan my own trip when I went to Europe last summer. I traveled with two friends. We met often to choose where to go, what to eat, and what souvenirs to buy. Planning our trip was just as fun, or even more fun, than the trip itself. When a travel agency plans the trip, we can't make our own special choices.\n\nAlso, when we're in a group, we have to do what the group decides, even if we want something else. For example, we might get to pick our food in a group. But we have to go with what most people want. It's sad we can't try new foods we really want when in another country. Plus, we can't use public transport because the bus is already booked. I loved using the subway, trains, buses, and trams in other countries. I would have missed that if I traveled with a guide.\n\nIn the end, I believe traveling with a guide in a group is not the best way. Planning our own trip is more fun and exciting. We can do what we want when we're not in a group. We can eat what we like, go where we like, and even take risks or have adventures on our own. We can also do everyday things like the locals, such as taking the bus or walking by rivers and streets. These are the big benefits of traveling alone."}
{"file_id": "1141674.txt", "output_essay": "Thinking about how many people there are in the world today and how much money people make in different countries, it's tough to say how many cars we'll see on the roads in twenty years. Let me explain why I'm not giving a clear answer. First, the world's population is growing fast. This might make you think there will be more cars because there will be more people. This is what's happening in Turkey. I've seen that car dealers in Turkey make a lot of money and they sell more cars every year. But, looking at it another way, it might not be true. Many people are being born in poor or developing countries where they don't make much money. So, people in these places might choose to ride buses or trains because it's cheaper. In India, for example, it's easy to see this. Second, when more people live in a city, they might start using public transport. Not because they can't buy cars, but because they don't want to waste time in traffic. Look at New York City. Even the mayor rides the subway to avoid traffic and to encourage others to do the same. But then there's California. Almost everyone, no matter their age, has a car and drives. In Los Angeles, the city is spread out, so it's very hard to get around without a car. It's not as packed as New York, but places are far apart. From what I've seen, there are reasons to think there will be more or fewer cars. In the end, we can't be sure. The world is full of surprises. Maybe someone will invent something better than a car that saves more time and energy. Who knows?"}

Ideas are how one can learn about something from what they already know, their experiences, or their imagination. Concepts are the basic parts of learning things. Let's look at a car and an airplane. Both are used to move people from one place to another. The idea to make them was to have different ways to travel that meet people's needs. The simple ideas used to make them include the rules of how things move and basic science. A car is for traveling on roads, and an airplane is for flying in the sky. Students should understand the ideas and concepts before they learn the facts. They can learn facts after they know the ideas and concepts well. If students only know facts and not the concepts, they won't learn much. If they keep learning by just knowing facts, they won't be able to use what they have learned. It is better for students to learn ideas and concepts first. These will lead to facts. For example, a student who knows the basic idea and concept of how things move will automatically understand the facts about it. Ideas and concepts, as well as facts, are ways to learn. But ideas and concepts are the main supports of your knowledge. The strength of your knowledge is in these supports, not just in knowing facts, which only give a basic idea of how strong your knowledge is."}
{"file_id": "1147675.txt", "output_essay": "I agree that ads often make products look better than they are. There are two main reasons for this. First, ads want to sell products. Sellers will always try to show their products in the best light. Second, ads can make people think that having the product will make them feel or be different. Ads aim to sell by making products look good to buyers. This can change how the real product looks. Take food ads, for example. They need to show taste through pictures. So, they might change how the food really looks. This can make the food seem different in size and look. Another point is that ads can make people think they will feel or be different with the product. Like with shampoo for women, ads show perfect hair. A buyer might think her hair will look like that if she uses the shampoo. This doesn't mean the product is better than it is. It means the buyer is guessing what the product can do. This guessing comes from the ad's pictures. In the end, the makers' wish to sell might make the product seem much better. This is because of what buyers think they see in the ads."}
{"file_id": "1145300.txt", "output_essay": "Advertising is about getting people to buy things. It's clear that ads don't tell you everything about a product. They're not meant to, even though they can sometimes give helpful details. There are other ways to learn about products, like websites that review different models of the same item. Ads don't have to tell you everything, but they do talk about some product features. They can't lie about facts because that's against the law, and they would get in trouble. So how do ads trick people? They can be very tricky in how they show a product. For instance, if an ad shows a car with a very attractive person driving it, it's not lying. But it makes you think the car is better than it really is. This is like trying to impress someone. When you go on a date, you don't wear your normal clothes. You dress up to look 'much better than you really are.' This is also trying to impress, and no one seems to mind these 'little lies.' I believe that ads do make products look better than they are. But it's not a big deal because we all know ads are not fully true. It's like a game where companies try to impress customers. We need to understand this game and play along. I think life would be boring without these kinds of tricks that go beyond just the facts."}

By doing this, a person can improve his own thoughts and create better ones than someone else. So, I think it's more important for students to grasp ideas and concepts than to just learn facts. Here are my reasons for this belief. First, when we grasp ideas and concepts, we see things more clearly. Take studying a subject, for instance. We need to grasp the main point and the ideas behind it. If we just memorize the subject without understanding, it will stay confusing, no matter how much time we spend on it. Second, understanding ideas and concepts helps us live with others in society. It means we can solve problems and work with people. For example, to drive a car, we must first understand the basics, like starting the car, speeding up, and changing gears. Knowing these things and then practicing makes driving easier. Learning alone isn't enough. Third, when we come across new software or topics, it's better to understand the main point and what's better about it. Then, the software will be helpful to us. In the end, we should learn facts but also understand the ideas and concepts we learn. Only then will it be useful. Just memorizing won't help us."}
{"file_id": "1118487.txt", "output_essay": "Many people learn in different ways. But some ask if it's better to know a lot about many school subjects or just one. What's your view? I think it's better to know a lot about one subject. I will give examples and reasons to explain why I think this way. First, knowing a lot about one subject saves time and energy. We can't do everything well because we don't have enough time. If we focus on one subject, we can spend more time on it. This means we can do better in that subject. For example, a computer science student who also studies art won't have much time for his main subject. This can hurt his grades. So, it's better to use our limited time to study one subject well. Second, knowing a lot about one subject helps with jobs in the future. We all want to find a job we like. We should focus on a subject that interests us. Then, we can get a good job because we know a lot about that subject. For example, if we study biology, we learn a lot about it. This helps us in job interviews. We can talk about what we know and make a good impression. This makes it easier to get the job we want. Some might say knowing a little about many subjects is good. But if we don't know much about each one, it's not helpful for our future. So, I believe it's better to focus on one subject we like and can gain from. In conclusion, after thinking about it, I believe it's better to know a lot about one subject than a little about many. I hope more people will see the benefits of focusing on one subject."}

Even though cars are the main way we get around today, new technology could bring a new kind of vehicle that takes the place of today's cars. Also, we might have to use fewer cars because we are running out of resources.\n\nRight now, cars are very popular around the world. The more cars we have, the more fuel we need. In a few years, we might not have enough fuel for all these cars. This could make us stop using cars when there's no more fuel. So, people will probably look for cars that use different kinds of fuel. This could mean we'll have fewer cars in twenty years.\n\nNew technology often takes the place of old technology. People always want to find new things. Cars are quick and comfy for getting around cities, so lots of people use them. If a new, faster car comes out, everyone will want to buy it. We might even see a new vehicle, like a small plane, that people will want more. Then, they will stop using their old cars. So, the way we get around might change with a new way to travel, and cars might become less common.\n\nNew technology, what people need, and the world around us might make us use fewer cars in the next twenty years."}

I agree that young people enjoy life more. I will explain why I think this in my essay. \n\nOne reason young people have more fun is that they are young and have many things they want to do. Young people want to feel new things because they are young. They may want to start a family, so they look for a good partner and enjoy every chance to meet this goal. They also want to work. They try to like the jobs they get and value them because it's their first time working. \n\nYoung people might have more fun than older people because they have more energy. Young people like sports, like soccer or basketball. These sports are important and need a lot of energy, which older people usually don't have. Young people also have the energy to do fun things like go on trips or to parties. These activities help them have a good time. \n\nIn the end, I think young people have more fun than older people. They want to try new things in the future, and they have the energy to enjoy the best parts of life."}
{"file_id": "1142774.txt", "output_essay": "This is a very common topic for these times. Young people usually don't want to help or make their community better. Only a few of them are really interested in this. Often, the new generation only thinks about themselves and what they need. They don't think about helping their community. I've noticed that a lot has changed over the years. In the past, people cared more and worked harder to improve their communities. My parents and grandparents truly believed they could make their home a better place. They put in a lot of effort to do things that would help everyone. They believed that caring about what's around you could make a difference.\n\nNow, I feel that young people don't think it's their job to look after the community. They believe that only the government should do that. Also, they don't care about helping because they don't see how it will give them money or things. This generation has stopped seeing the value in believing in ideas. They only fight for themselves, not for ideas.\n\nMy grandfather once told me a story that shows how things have changed. In the 1940s, he cared a lot about our town's problems. He worked to make our city's economy better and to bring people together. Back then, we didn't have a cinema, and people really wanted one because it was new and exciting. My grandfather was the one who spent money to open the first cinema in our town. Everyone remembers him as a kind person and someone who tried to improve the community."}
{"file_id": "1140214.txt", "output_essay": "I think it's more important for students to understand big ideas than to just learn facts. Some people say facts are true and don't change, but not everyone agrees. For example, I'm from an Egyptian family. They have beliefs they call \"facts,\" but I don't agree with many of them.\n\nI was born in the US, but I traveled between Egypt and America a lot. I've lived in both places. One belief they have is that a young woman shouldn't leave her parents' home unless she's married. They think this is a fact, even if she's leaving for college. I don't think this is a fact, but my parents do. They say it's a fact because it's been that way for a long time.\n\nAnother belief from my Egyptian background is that Egyptians should only marry other Egyptians. They say it's a fact. When I ask why, they just say, \"That's how it is.\" This makes me question if it's really a fact. In Egypt, I was told a man can marry anyone, but a woman must marry an Egyptian. They say it's because the kids will be like their father. For example, if the father is Ethiopian, the kids are too. If he's Christian, the kids will be Christian. But I don't think that's true. You are who you are, not just who your parents are."}
{"file_id": "1115678.txt", "output_essay": "How can a person enjoy life? What do you need to have fun in life? Young people often have fewer problems. When they are very young, they don't worry much. Their parents take care of everything for them. They also don't know about things that could make them worry. Since worrying stops you from having fun, very young people have more fun than older people in this way.\n\nBut to really have fun, you need to be worry-free and also like what you're doing and where you are. Young people, because they haven't lived long and have good parents, don't know how to value things as much as adults. Someone said, 'You don't know the value of sugar until you've tasted salt.' Older people have tasted salt. They know how to enjoy sugar.\n\nHaving fun in life can also mean making your dreams come true. This could be having a family, a good job, or owning nice things. Young people can't get good jobs yet, can't drive, and usually can't buy their dream car because they don't have enough money. If they are really young, they might not even think about these things and so they don't miss them. But as they grow up, they start to dream, and many dreams don't come true because they don't have the money, age, or knowledge. Older people have had time to work on their dreams. They are more likely to have made their biggest dream come true.\n\nHowever, this happiness can be stopped. This happens when older people think about what they didn't do instead of what they did. Young people don't often think this way. They remember the good times first.\n\nAlso, young people get happy again quickly when they are upset. For example, if a child drops his ice cream, he cries. But if he gets a new one, he stops crying and is happy again. An adult might think about the money wasted all day, feel silly, and let the bad moment ruin the good one of getting a new ice cream.\n\nI can't say if I agree or disagree with the idea completely. To me, it's about the person's attitude. But if it's someone who looks ahead and sees what they've done, then they enjoy life more than anyone else."}
{"file_id": "1142027.txt", "output_essay": "I fully agree that to do well in any part of life, you must take risks. We see this in many examples. Take marriage, for instance. No one can be sure if the person they are dating is the right one to spend their life with. So, choosing to marry is a big risk. If you don't want to risk anything, you could stay single forever. But if you avoid marriage just because you're scared, you might end up alone forever. In careers, deciding what job you want is also key. You might like a certain job but think you're not smart enough for it. So, you might stay put or pick an easier job, or do something you know about. But it's not good to shut yourself off from trying the tough career. It's okay to fail after you've tried. I don't agree with quitting on things that could improve your life. Instead of being negative or doubting yourself, it's better to stand up, look ahead, and go for the chances out there. There's no place for those who don't risk."}

I think we should judge a product as good and decide to buy it based on its quality. Ads should tell the truth about the product's quality and not make it look better than it is.\n\nThe big problem with this way of selling is that bad products are taking over the market. Shoppers can't tell the difference between something that's actually good and something that just looks good in ads. Also, these bad products often cost a lot more.\n\nTake Timberland shoes as an example. In my country, many people buy them just because of the ads. These shoes cost almost three times more than other good shoes you can find in a store. The only reason for this is the ads that trick people. I'm not saying Timberland shoes are bad, but the only real difference is the price.\n\nI could have given other examples, but the issue is the same.

I think that students need to know why they are learning and what skills they are getting. Students who learn from a teacher want to take in as much as they can. This means they need to get what the teacher is trying to teach them. It is clear that during school, students should understand the lessons and ideas they get from their teachers. First, students who study with a well-known teacher should learn from him. This can help them with their research and tests. They also learn about what he has done in his work, including his thoughts and what he expects from them. So, in class, they can get a lot of knowledge from him. Second, students who want to do research should think about what the research is about. Research takes a lot of time and can be hard for some. Also, those who want to do a test need to be ready to wait for a long time. When students start research, they need to learn about the system they will use. Then, they can become good researchers from doing these studies. To sum up, for the reasons I've talked about, understanding the lessons and ideas is very important for students. When they understand these things, they can get many good things that they can use in their own lives."}

History shows that only bold and creative people have really changed our lives. Take Thomas Edison, for example. He made light bulbs. He tested thousands of different materials. He didn't win until he found the right one. He wasn't even sure he would find it. He took more chances than most people would. Because of his bravery and hard work, our lives are different. \n\nSecond, people are scared to try because they don't want to fail. But failing is how we learn to succeed. They might fail after trying hard, but what they learn is very valuable. This new knowledge helps them reach their goals. This is how success usually works. Without trying, you can't go through this process. \n\nThird, if you don't move forward, you'll fall behind. In the 21st century, everyone is working hard to reach their goals. If you stop learning and only do what you know, you'll be left behind. So, taking chances and being different is the only way to keep up in this tough world. \n\nIn conclusion, when looking for success, trying new things and taking risks are important. As people work to get better, those who don't change will end up last in life's race. Only getting better brings lasting success."}

Inventors who create new things can't know what will happen; they take a risk. But if they make something new and it works, they get more praise than if they did nothing because they were scared of failing.\n\nRemember, 'failures are steps to success.' They might learn from failing, which will help them later. Next, think about finding a new way to fix a problem. If the Indian president A.P.J. Abdul Kalam hadn't risked sending a rocket into space, we wouldn't know as much about other planets or space. Even though it failed at first, he didn't give up. He kept trying, and he became very famous.\n\nThird, look at how scientists found new metals. They did dangerous experiments, but they became successful and famous, even long after they were gone.\n\nThese people didn't just stick to what they knew. They took risks for their discoveries. To end, I believe that everyone should always try new things and take risks. This will lead to better things."}

For instance, if you're scared of high places, you might decide to go bungee jumping. You may ask how this will help you. It will make you more confident and proud of yourself. It will make you strong and brave. Another example is if you work from home doing things by hand. You might be good at it, but it can get boring and make you unhappy. If you think about using a computer but are scared of new technology, it might worry you. You should still learn about computers. This will make you and your business do well.

I think both are key for students to have while they are learning. They are also very important for people who want to think in a smart and original way.\n\nFirst, I think that learning ideas and concepts from past smart people is important for students who are still figuring out how to think. They are young and can change easily. They can learn from what others think and decide which ideas they like. They can use these ideas in their everyday life. For example, a student can see if working with others is better than working alone while doing a project. If the student finds out that working together is better, they might want to do it again in the future.\n\nSecondly, I believe that we can look at one thing or object in many different ways. This means we can think about a fact in many ways using different ideas and concepts. When students learn a fact, they can use what they have learned before to think about it. By looking at things in many ways, students will start to see how every fact is different. They will learn to think in a smart and flexible way. For example, a student might learn that working with others is sometimes good, but it can also have risks.\n\nFinally, it is always important for us to have our own ideas and concepts about the world. We need to come up with our own way of thinking and find our own ways to look at facts. We learn from what others think; we use these ideas in our daily life; we check them against facts to see if they are right; and finally, we create our own way of thinking.

We see what is different from everyday life, something special or new. Taking chances is important for success. Oscar Wilde once said that if an idea isn't daring, it's not really an idea. To show this is true, we will list some main points and end with a summary and warnings.\n\nFirst, we think of people as successful if they have worked hard to get to a certain place in society. What counts as a successful place can change in different cultures. But we only see someone as successful if they have a job or role that is not ordinary. Success comes from doing something out of the ordinary, like finding a new way to do something.\n\nSecond, we only see success when it's clear to us. If we can't see what makes something different from what's normal, we can't tell them apart. We won't see the new in the usual. So, success is also about being different and unique. In simple terms, new things.\n\nThird, since success is about being different and having new ideas, it's also true that new ideas come from taking risks. When you try something new, you can't be sure if it will be seen as truly new and liked by others, or if it will fail to show how it's different. This unknown is about taking risks. To be seen as different, an idea must be new and therefore, daring.\n\nIn conclusion, we have shown that success is about being different from the usual; it's about being special and taking risks. The last part, taking risks, might be the most important part of success, just like Oscar Wilde said."}

They have energy and fresh ideas to improve it. When a country supports its young people, it is proud of what they achieve. Young people help in many ways. They teach, build, heal, and make things. This helps raise new young people who will take care of the country's future. Look at Lebanon, where war is hurting people and breaking buildings. Young people are there helping in hospitals and places hit by war. They share in the pain and fear. Some defend their land from the war. Young people risk their lives for their community. The country should lead by example for young people everywhere. In the end, we judge nations and communities by their young people and what they do. Stronger young people mean a stronger country.

For example, some ads say vitamins are all you need if you're tired or weak. But they don't tell you about the dangers of not seeing a doctor. Some people have even stopped their medical treatments because of something they saw on TV. Another example is when a ladder or tool is not as strong as the ad says. This can break and be very risky.

Working on the same project over and over won't help you. This is because others will also get good at it and might do better than you. Trying new things, like starting a new business, can fail. In this case, the other opinion seems better. But we know that 'failures are the stepping stones to success.' History shows us that trying new things is good. Take scientists, for example. Those who tried to make new things are the ones we remember. What if Einstein had just agreed with old theories? We wouldn't have the theory of relativity, and Einstein wouldn't have won the Nobel Prize. There are many other examples. Leaders, business people, and researchers who were successful because they brought new ideas. Like Mahatma Gandhi, who led the Indian freedom fight.

For me, it's clear that taking chances is important to reach one's goals, especially when starting a new business. Making your own business successful is not just about working hard but also about being willing to take chances. Trying new things has many benefits. For example, the business might not have as much competition. Also, customers often like new ideas and products. So, going into new areas, along with hard work, could help you reach your goal. \n\nThink about a business owner who wants to succeed just by working hard and using an old idea. They will surely meet a lot of competition. But if someone works for a company, it might be better to focus on what they are good at and what their job needs. In fact, people who work on their skills and get better at them are more likely to get a higher position than those who always try new things. But since getting promoted isn't the most important thing for a worker, I don't agree with the idea mentioned before. \n\nAlso, people who want to be powerful in a big company should learn how the company works well, instead of trying to change it completely. \n\nIn the end, success means different things to different people. But to be successful, one must know about many things. They need to have different skills, but each business has its own rules."}

The first is that ads draw people in by showing them what they want. Then, people end up wanting and buying the product. This is key for a business because they want to make more money. So, they try hard to make the product look great in the ad. This causes a lot of problems. Most ads on TV and in magazines only show the good parts of a product. They make it seem like the product has no bad points and is totally perfect. But this isn't true, and that's why ads can be bad. The worst part is that many people believe these ads. They end up spending money on these things. For example, I saw an ad for a cell phone and thought I had to have it. But after I bought it, I realized I didn't really need it. That's why I agree with the idea that ads can be misleading."}

You can go to any place and stay as long as you like. If I feel like shopping, I don't need to think about what others want. I can explore little stores and areas that interest me. This gives me the freedom to enjoy my trip my way. \n\nTraveling alone is also more thrilling. For instance, when I went to Italy last year, I stayed in a place for young travelers. I met people from different countries and we explored the city together. We visited famous spots, ate at restaurants, hung out in parks, and walked by rivers. I still email one of the friends I made. I also went to a concert that I hadn't planned on. It was unforgettable. \n\nThis is why I think traveling alone or with just one friend is the best way to go."}
{"file_id": "1129154.txt", "output_essay": "I think this statement shows what I believe and do. I've always thought that you need to understand everything you learn. This is a big debate, but I think my ideas are clear. The first reason I agree with this is that just knowing facts doesn't make you happy with a subject. Ignatius of Loyola S.J. once said, 'Knowing doesn't fill the soul, but understanding and feeling the things does.' This means a lot because when you learn a fact, you don't fully get its meaning; something is missing. For example, in philosophy, you can know what each philosopher thinks, but if you don't get it, you won't know what they truly meant. The second reason is that our brains often forget things we learn but don't understand. You might forget what you learned in 9th grade when you're in 10th or 11th because you didn't really get the idea. But if you learn and understand something well, you'll remember it always, or you can recall it easily and use it in your life. Lastly, I want to say that people who just memorize facts without understanding them often have less chance of success because they don't really get important things. But people who understand what they learn can solve problems faster or think more creatively."}

If a person has to fix problems by himself and can't work with others, knowing a lot about different things will help him. But, if a group works well together and each person is good at a different topic, they can do things much better and be very strong in competition. When I think about this as it relates to me, I remember 'geniuses' who did great things in one area but didn't know much about other things, like how to get along with people. This can make them unhappy and avoid situations because they can't handle them. A genius makes something great that people will always value, but he might be unhappy because of it. I sometimes wish I were a genius at something. But I also like how I was taught, so I agree with the idea."}
{"file_id": "1143274.txt", "output_essay": "\"Mom, I don't want to study these theories over and over,\" my little child said. I wondered about many things. What should a student really know? Should they just know the facts in their books, or should they understand the ideas clearly? This topic about how we learn is debated a lot. When it comes to learning, I want to see changes in how it's done. I really think that people should learn about ideas and concepts first. This helps shape who they are. Look at young kids, for example. By the time they are ten, their personalities are mostly formed. They have learned so much, know what they like and don't like, and have many ideas. A soldier is another example. He learned to love his country when he was young, right? If I could change how we teach our kids, I would create a whole city just for learning. It would offer special courses. It would focus on loyalty, love, working together, and using individual talents. There would be no regular tests. Instead, kids would learn that tests are not always the best way to learn. They would also have weekly talks about big ideas like excitement, morals, beauty, and racism. This would help them get ready for the real world. In the end, learning about ideas is the best way for someone to help their family, community, and country. It's all about smart ideas that work well together. I think if everyone wanted to understand and respect each other's ideas, there would be no wars or violence."}

Even with a good education, they can't find jobs. Big companies have cut many jobs. The economy is not growing fast. Globalization has made companies move jobs to cheaper places.\n\nOld people are losing their jobs too. Countries in Europe are making people retire later. They need to do this to keep their social programs going.\n\nBoth old and young people get upset by this. Old people see young ones hanging out and think they are just having fun. They might think young people enjoy life more than they did. This might be true. When old people were young, in the 1940s and 1950s, Europe wasn't a fun place. There was a terrible war and a lot of hard work to rebuild.\n\nYoung people now live in a safer, often richer place. They can do things old people couldn't. They can travel, talk to people all over the world, and learn about the world in new ways. They have time for sports and fun. They might enjoy life more, or just differently, than older people.\n\nYoung people might do things like travel and extreme sports to deal with their fears about the future.

They might never get the same benefits.\n\nI think young people should enjoy life while they can. It will get hard later. Old people should not complain. They should try to understand what young people are going through. They should even tell their grandkids, 'It's okay, have fun in your life. Go and have some fun!'"}

Ads often make things look better than they really are. This happens a lot with ads for food, cars, and clothes. But it's not just the product that looks better. It's also what's around it. To sell a sausage or a T-shirt, you usually see a cute girl, a good-looking guy, or a big, bright house. It's these things, not the product, that seem better than they are. Still, sometimes the product isn't made to look better. This is true for ads for services, not goods. Like ads about road safety or bank loans or insurance. These ads are more serious and less misleading. Overall, I think ads often exaggerate, but it's not surprising. Most people know this. The point is to make people want things and to sell more. In short, ads try to make products look much better than they are. This is more common with goods than with services."}

I am twenty years old, so I am young, and I am part of the youth. I see two things about this. First, I want to say that young people do help; they want to help. They want to be asked to help. They want to know they are doing something useful and that they are needed. Communities need every young person to make a better society and to feel important. Young people want to be asked to help! This is my point; today, people think young people are lazy, that they just want to have fun and hang out with friends. They think young people won't do anything good. But many young people go to poor countries to volunteer. They can also volunteer in their own countries; they can look after people nearby; they can work on charity projects at home... But what happens? Most of the time, their own communities don't ask for their help; they don't know they can help at home and make a better society. In the end, I can say that society doesn't push young people to help, and that's why young people act in two ways: They do nothing because they think society doesn't expect anything from them; or they go to poor countries where they think their help is really needed. I think, besides what I've said, there are people who care about their communities and want to help as much as they can. They see what their community needs and they want to meet those needs."}

Now, I want to talk about their time and why I think they are short on time.\n\nI've seen lots of students struggle to keep up with their schoolwork and busy schedules. I think students should have time to help their communities. This is because helping out can teach them about life. These lessons are often more important than what they learn in school. Life lessons can give us insights that are very important. Being part of a community is also important. When young people talk with others, they learn a lot. For example, studying with others can give us a lot of useful information. It's better than studying alone. Life is changing fast, and it's hard to find time for ourselves. Young people are very busy, and students are too.\n\nI believe that if we can talk to people and rest, even when we're busy, it will be good for us. It will lead to better work and results.

But I think it's better to know about many different subjects for a few reasons. First, someone who knows about many things is likely open-minded and curious. Take Leonardo da Vinci, for example. He knew about a lot of different things. Also, knowing about many areas can help you in your job. And knowing a lot doesn't mean you can't be really good at one thing. Having an open mind and knowing about many things is useful in our world that changes quickly. We need to be ready to handle new things. If we only know about one small area, we might not see the big picture. We could be less flexible and struggle with changes. It's okay to be really good at one subject we like. But knowing only about one small area can be a problem. If someone is only good at one thing, they might do their job well but not handle new situations well. For example, sometimes doctors make big mistakes because they don't see the whole picture. They might know a lot about one part of the body but forget they are treating a person. So, I believe knowing about many subjects and always being curious and eager to learn is better than just focusing on one area."}

In school, I studied many things like science, math, acting, music, history, taking pictures, and what's right and wrong. These things gave me basic knowledge for everyday life. After school, I chose to learn about marketing and got a degree in Business with a focus on marketing. I also had to study money management and bookkeeping. I didn't enjoy these as much as marketing, but I think it's good to know a bit about them. They helped support what I learned in marketing. I don't think I need to learn a little about medicine, building design, and government in college just to know a lot about different things.

Cars will become more appealing, making people want them even more. They will want the latest and prettiest models. Since cars were made, the number of cars people have has grown a lot. In the past, only rich people had cars. But now, cars are less expensive. There are many used cars for sale that are cheap. As time goes on, rich people will keep buying new cars and selling their old ones. Poor people will buy these old cars for less money. This way, more people will have cars instead of fewer. Why do rich people keep buying cars? It's mostly because car technology keeps getting better. They want fast cars with special looks. Many think rich people buy cars just for their style. Car companies know this and make more cars with cool designs. It's unlikely that rich people will stop buying cars. And there will always be poor people who want to buy these cheaper used cars. Most people want a car. I think this is because of envy. When someone sees another person with a car, they want one too. If a rich person sees a friend with a cool car, they will want a special car too. More young people are growing up. With envy and falling car prices, it will be easier for them to get cars. In the end, I believe that in twenty years, or even fifty, we will use more cars, not fewer.

But you can't argue that without getting it, no one can use what they know with confidence. Also, facts are often very simple.

So, what it means to be an expert has changed. It used to be about knowing a lot of facts; now, it's about getting the big picture. Next, when it comes to thinking straight, getting the big picture is more important. I took a history class in my first year of college. I learned a lot of important facts and did well in the class. But I forgot most of them right after the final test. On the other hand, when I took a physics class, it was hard for me to get the big picture. But by trying, I learned how to think straight.

{"file_id": "1129532.txt", "output_essay": "Most people believe that fun comes from doing things, but I think we have more fun the first time we do something. There's a saying that something is exciting until you have it. This means when you want something but can't get it right away, you want it more. Once you have it, you're not as interested anymore. This is how people are. So, this means that young people have more fun in life than older people because they are doing things for the first time. I also think that young people have more fun than older people. To back up my view, I want to talk about how young people act. They are very curious about new things and want to try everything, even if it might be dangerous. For example, when I was little, I was very interested in parachutes. One day, I jumped off my roof with an umbrella. I wasn't scared at all. You wouldn't expect an older person to do something so silly. Even if an old person doesn't know something is dangerous, they probably wouldn't take the risk. Also, young people don't worry about right and wrong as much as old people. Old people have learned what is right and try to always do it. But teenagers might not care about doing the right thing. Another point is that you can have more fun if no one tells you what to do. Old people have to think about their family and what society expects. But young people can do what they want. For example, I like to dance in public whenever I can. But some older people won't dance because they worry about what others will think or how it will affect kids. Finally, young people are more open to new ideas and ways of living, while older people often stick to what they know. Young people can easily get used to a new way of life to learn about it. But older people want to keep their own way of life the same. In the end, even though older people have fun based on what they've done in their lives, I really believe that young people have more fun. They want to try new things, they don't have as many rules to follow, they don't care as much about right and wrong, and they have more energy to enjoy life."}

They need to know this so they can use it in different places. It helps them grow their knowledge and skills too. I study nursing. When I worked, I learned facts. By 'facts,' I mean everyday tasks like cleaning wounds or testing blood. But now, machines do most of that work, so I don't use those skills much. Still, we use our understanding to look at the data. Big ideas stick around. If I grasp a big idea, I can use it in many cases. For example, if I get that culture shapes how people act, I can better care for patients from other countries. If students know the basics well, they can handle new problems. Also, knowing the basics helps students go further in school. If someone wants to go for an advanced degree, they need a strong foundation. If I only knew the tasks in one hospital area and didn't learn the big ideas, I couldn't go for a master's degree. So, I believe students should focus more on the big ideas than on facts. These ideas are the foundation that lasts, works in many places, and helps students reach higher levels of education."}

I think that most ads make things look much better than they are for two reasons.\n\nThe first reason is that ads show products in a great way. They make you feel like you need them and can't live without them. But then you find out the product isn't worth it. For example, I saw a TV ad for a hair straightener that said it would make hair straight and healthy. I bought it, and it was terrible. It ruined and burned my hair. Another time, my boyfriend saw posters for a rain party. The posters made it seem like everything was included in the ticket. But when he got there, it was all lies.\n\nThe second reason is that there's no control over ads, especially online. This lets companies do what they want and trick people. I had a friend who was very upset. She had ordered a dress online and paid for it. But when she went to pick it up, they asked for more money because she didn't come on the day she was supposed to.\n\nIn summary, we should be careful with these ads and know who we are buying from. I believe the government should control ads in the media. Remember to be careful and think carefully when you see these ads."}

This helps people notice and like the products. There are many kinds of ads. Some are on TV, others use famous people to promote products, and more. When we see an ad a lot, we start to remember the product. Take the iPod I bought. I saw lots of ads and my favorite star with an iPod. The iPod is famous. Many movie stars have one. Lots of people buy it. We see iPod ads all over. They are in movies and TV shows too. This is not just direct ads but also when stars use them. A friend has an iPod. She said she got it because it looked good in ads. She liked it more because movie stars had it. I got an iPod too. I saw its ads a lot and saw Jung Il-woo, an actor I like, with it. I think I picked it because I saw its ads more than others that do the same thing. To end, ads are needed to make things look and seem better than they are. They make things more appealing."}

To get people to notice their products, companies often make ads that are better than the products themselves. I agree with this because we see it all the time. Just go to a grocery store and look around. You'll find many similar items. The ads are what make them different from each other. On TV, too, there are lots of ads that just want to grab our attention. Some ads talk about the company's history or look fancy, while others show off new things. I believe ads should be honest about what a product can do. They shouldn't make things up. This way, they avoid people complaining and the product getting a bad name. If a product fails, the maker shouldn't lie in ads to sell it. They should make the product better. Since we're always on the go, we see more ads everywhere. When we're stuck in traffic, big ads with jokes or shocking words try to get our attention. But the product isn't always as good as the ad says. In the end, I think the people who make ads should really know what they're selling and what the product can actually do."}
{"file_id": "1147239.txt", "output_essay": "I strongly believe that whether or not to use a tour guide when traveling is a topic that many people have different opinions on. It also depends on the situation of the travel. On one hand, having a tour guide is not a bad idea. Let's think about why someone would want a tour guide. We all want to feel safe and well-informed when we travel. This is because travel involves people. For example, let's consider safety. Even in this modern age, with all our technology, people still want to feel safe. This includes political leaders and countries. They all have protection. This shows that everyone wants to feel safe to the fullest. So, I think traveling with a tour guide can be a good way to travel for these reasons. But I also think that it's not always the best way for everyone. As I mentioned before, it depends on what each person thinks is best. Some people travel without a tour guide and still think their trip is great. So, this shows that the idea of the 'best way to travel' doesn't always mean having a tour guide."}
{"file_id": "1134094.txt", "output_essay": "We should talk about how successful people are based on the risks they take in two parts. First, there are people who try new things and take risks to reach their goals. Then, there are people who stick to what they know well. Both ways of dealing with risk can lead to success. People have different views on how much risk they can handle. I think about this when I consider two friends. One friend is about 35 years old. He did very well in school and finished university in less than 4 years with great marks. He started working at a big company at 26, answering legal questions about contracts. He didn't like taking risks, maybe because it was his first job in business. He stayed in the same job for almost 9 years, not trying anything risky except leaving work 10 minutes early. My other friend is 28 years old. He got average grades in school. After school, he started his own IT business for small and medium companies. When the market was new, many companies needed his services. He had many regular customers. He decided to take his business to other countries, starting with Austria in 1999. Banks gave him a lot of money to do this. After two years, he had four offices in other countries but owed the bank 4,500,000 Euros. His business failed when the market crashed. He lost everything in two months and won't be able to pay back the bank in his lifetime. From these two stories, we can't say that school grades or university degrees show how much risk someone will take. People who take risks might succeed faster and keep their success if they check on themselves often. They have a bigger chance of failing because of mistakes than people who avoid risks. But everyone must choose their own goals and how quickly they want to achieve them. These choices will show how willing they are to take risks and how successful they might be."}
{"file_id": "1147316.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with the statement. I believe people should know a lot about many school subjects. Here's why I agree. I know someone who got very rich. He is my grandfather, who passed away peacefully. As a young man, he did well in school. He wasn't focused on earning money. He enjoyed learning about all sorts of things. His teacher saw he was great at math and never made mistakes on tests. The teacher suggested he study more math, but he didn't want to. He wanted to learn about many topics, not just one. He kept learning, but couldn't go to college because he had no money. After finishing high school, he looked for work. But many businesses wouldn't hire him since he didn't have a college degree. They were looking for people with better education back then. So, he took whatever work he could find. He wasn't a regular employee, but he worked hard. He kept learning while working. Eight years later, he saved some money. He decided to start his own business and opened a small store. He knew how to do it because he never stopped studying. He used what he learned to grow his store. It became more and more successful. He married a beautiful woman and opened another store. He started four stores before he died.\n\nIn conclusion, I think knowing a lot about many school subjects is better than just focusing on one area."}
{"file_id": "1154048.txt", "output_essay": "I don't really agree with the idea that ads make products look a lot better than they are. Usually, it's the opposite; products aren't as good as they appear. Here's the difference: ads will show the good things about a product and how it works. But they won't show the bad parts. They ignore those. Ads might make things look great, and they get us to buy them. But only later do we learn how the product really works, and it's often not as good. Sometimes, though, products do look better than they are. But this is rare. Let me tell you about something that happened to me. I bought a video-CD player because the ad said it was great. It was supposed to be better than others. I thought it was a good choice. But I was wrong. It broke a lot and didn't work well. I made a mistake by trusting the ad. My friend had a similar problem. She bought a skin cream that was supposed to make her skin glow. The ad convinced her. But it just made her skin itch and gave her an allergy. So, I really think products aren't as good as they look in ads. I still disagree with the statement."}
{"file_id": "1152681.txt", "output_essay": "I fully agree that curious people who want to learn and try new things are the ones who succeed. People who don't change or improve their skills, and can't adapt to new situations, will not become significant. For example, those who think they can live in today's world without changing will probably get left behind.\n\nSuccessful people are always coming up with new ideas, taking chances, and looking for the next thing to learn.\n\nGood business leaders in industry see research and making new products as top priorities. These are key to a company's success. Let's look at a well-known Italian, Silvio Berlusconi, who was very successful. He began by building and selling houses. When this worked well, he used his money to buy a small TV channel. Over the years, this channel grew, and he bought more channels in Italy and abroad. But he didn't stop there. He then bought a football team, AC Milan, which was not famous at the time. As president, he made it one of the world's most famous teams in 15 years. He still wanted more, so he got into politics and became the Italian Prime Minister in 1994.\n\nThis story shows how being curious, skilled, and willing to try new things can lead to great success."}

Actually, it's the older people who have more fun in life. Being young has its good points. Young people are seen as having more fun because they are full of energy, excitement, and have more time. But what is often missed is the pressure from society. Over time, society has changed; it asks for more, pays attention to details, and focuses on the young. Even with more energy and excitement, young people don't have the TIME to enjoy. 'I wish the week had eight days' - young people all over the world say this. They work hard to be responsible and successful. They want to do a lot in a short time. They face pressure from friends, school, exams, jobs, and personal issues. They also have to deal with family, friends, and other social duties. There's so much to do and not enough time. So, the things that should help them enjoy life actually make them work harder. There's never enough time. In all this busyness, when can they even take a moment to relax? On the other hand, older people have been through many changes in their minds, communities, beliefs, and bodies. Thanks to government and community support, they don't have to worry about money in their old age. So, they can really enjoy life as it is. They may not have the energy or excitement of young people, but they have the wisdom, patience, and drive to really enjoy life. People often say, 'Life begins at sixty.' This is because at that age, you're free from all duties and can enjoy life at your own speed. You can only truly have fun when you have TIME to savor every small moment."}
{"file_id": "1138108.txt", "output_essay": "Advertising was made to get people to buy things. Today, there is a big fight between brands. Each brand works hard to get people to buy what they sell. Marketing teams are in charge of this. I think that ads often make things look much better than they are. Because of globalization, we can buy almost anything in any country, especially in rich countries. This means there is a tough fight because there are so many choices for customers. How do we choose what to buy if we don't know the products? So, brands make a lot of ads. They try their best to make the best ad. They use special ways to make their products look as good as possible. They want their product to get the most attention. When we see an ad for a new food on a billboard or TV, it looks so good that we really want to try it. But we are often let down. For example, a new McDonald's burger looks great in the picture. But when I try it, the bread is too dry, and the cheese doesn't look the same. Things are almost never like they are in the ads. Ad agencies have a lot of money to spend. They use great tricks to make the product look better. Not only do things not look the same, but they also don't do what they say they will. Some products promise to do something, but they don't work as expected when you try them. In the end, I want to say that this happens not just with products but with famous people too. Stars look amazing in magazines, but they don't look the same in real life. You might be very surprised. This is all because marketing makes everything and everyone look perfect."}

There's a big argument about whether it's better to travel with a group and a tour guide. Some say it's the best way because the guide plans everything and picks where to go. This might work if you like the places the guide chooses. But I don't think it's the best way. I like to travel alone better. When you travel alone, you can do what you want. You can look up places you're interested in online, learn about them, and figure out how to get there. Then, you just pick a time, pack your bag, grab some food, and head to the place you chose. You don't have to go to places you don't like or have seen before. Also, when you travel alone, you can go whenever you want. If you really like a place, you can stay longer and see more. You don't have to worry about what other people think. Finally, we shouldn't forget that some tour guides take people to places they don't want to go, like expensive markets with bad quality stuff. In conclusion, I don't agree that traveling with a group and a guide is the best. Traveling alone is much more enjoyable."}
{"file_id": "1146557.txt", "output_essay": "In a world that is always changing, it is clear that people who do not understand ideas and concepts will likely not do well. Some people think that learning facts is best. However, I believe that learning only facts is not realistic because it stops them from growing their knowledge and finding better facts. \n\nFirst, just learning facts does not make their knowledge bigger. This is because if people only learn facts, they get tired of them. This makes it hard to grow their creative knowledge. For example, a study shows that students who only learn facts are 30 percent less creative than those who understand ideas and concepts. This is because students get bored with just facts; it makes them uninterested. So, learning facts stops students from growing their knowledge. \n\nSecond, getting the meaning of ideas and concepts helps students find better facts. This is because they can learn better facts from what they experience and understand. For example, my son went from learning facts to getting the meaning of ideas. I was sad when he did not get the main point of something. But after he started learning by understanding ideas, he found better facts. If he had kept learning just facts, he would not have found these better facts. \n\nIn short, it is not practical for students to learn only facts because it leads to less knowledge. Also, learning from experiences and understanding ideas and concepts helps them find good facts. Even though learning facts is easy, it stops them from advancing in their work life."}

If we travel to some countries in America, we might have trouble understanding their language or their way of speaking English. For example, if you go to France, people speak French there. If you don't understand French, you will need a guide.\n\nAnother reason is that if you visit a historical place without a guide, you might just look at old rocks and not learn anything. Every historical place has a story, and we visit to learn that story. Since we don't know the place or its story, a guide can tell us about it. For instance, if you visit Mahabalipuram in India, you'll see many rock temples and carvings. A guide can tell you what these rock carvings mean.\n\nFinally, we travel to get something out of the money we spend. Imagine you're on a tour of Europe.

For instance, I bought clothes online last week. They looked like a nice pink color I enjoy. I was very excited. But when they arrived, I was upset. The pink was not nice at all. I did not like it. This shows that the way ads show things can be misleading. Also, TV shopping hosts sell products by making them look good. My aunt saw kimchi on TV. The host and guests ate it and said it was tasty. They made it look good. But when my aunt tried it, she thought it was awful. Moreover, companies often brag about their products winning awards in ads. This makes us trust and buy the products. But these claims might not be true. In conclusion, I believe ads often make things look much better than they are."}
{"file_id": "1140280.txt", "output_essay": "Students come across a lot of information in their classes or talks. This can be too much information for students. The talks often have ideas, concepts, and facts that students need to learn and use. I believe that students should try to grasp ideas and concepts more than facts in their classes to do well. Grasping ideas and concepts instead of facts gives knowledge that lasts longer and helps students understand topics fully and deeply. \n\nFirst, a student has two options when studying: remembering the facts of the subject or grasping the main concepts and ideas. If he or she chooses remembering over understanding, the knowledge will fade in a few days. That's why focusing on ideas and concepts is better and more useful than just learning facts. \n\nAnother big plus of understanding ideas and concepts is the full and deep grasp of the subject. Ideas and concepts mean more than facts. They are worth more in terms of meaning. Facts, however, may be just one event or a certain case. They are limited and usually only mean something by themselves. It looks like students should care more about ideas and concepts than facts. \n\nIn the end, it's the students' choice to focus on ideas and concepts or not. The other option is to remember facts. Understanding ideas and concepts lasts longer and gives students a full and deep understanding.

I want to share an example from a trip I took with my friends to explain this better. I study history. In my last year of college, I needed to write a big paper on the Taj Mahal. Four of us went to New Delhi, India, to see it. New Delhi is an old city with a lot of history and it's also the capital. We found a tour guide who was said to be the best. As we looked at the Taj Mahal and heard about it from the guide, we were amazed by its history, beauty, and how hard it was to build. We learned about parts of the Taj Mahal that we had never heard of before. These details were not in any books but were important for our paper. Our group asked the guide many questions. I think I only asked a few of them. This made me see how good it is to travel with others. If I had been alone, I would have learned much less for my paper, and my grades could have been lower. When we got back, we saw that we each spent only 40% of what it would cost to travel alone. From this trip, I am sure that traveling with others and a guide gives you more information and saves money. It also makes your friendship stronger. You will always remember the fun times and things that happened on the trip."}

It looked really good and healthy on TV, but it didn't taste good, and it made me sick. I couldn't sleep all night. I believe it would be better if food or clothing companies used their money to make their products better or to lower their prices instead of spending it on ads. The issue is that what's good for business isn't always what's good for people. But we need to do something.

Many young people are very busy and can't find the time to help out. Some just don't want to help. They think it's a waste of time, even when they have free time. Young people often look for fun and don't want to help when asked. They don't understand how good it can make them feel. It's not just about studying; being helpful is important too. However, there are groups for young people that focus on helping others. For example, there are blood banks where young people sign up to donate blood. They give blood to hospitals for free. They hold events and give awards to blood donors to encourage more young people to donate. There are also groups that collect money for people hit by natural disasters. After the tsunami left many without homes, these groups raised a lot of money and gave it to the victims. So, young people do help. They just need to know why it's important. Young people have a lot of energy and are good at what they do. We just need to encourage them and explain why helping matters. Older people should teach the young to help and to spend time doing so.

But I believe it is good to know a lot about many subjects because we can use this knowledge in our daily lives.\n\nFirst, some people say knowing a lot is not needed because they feel it takes too much time and is not useful. Also, learning different subjects is very hard. For example, in Korea, middle schools make students study about 12 subjects. This has become a big issue because the schools do not think about what students can do or what they like. A study showed that over half of Korean middle school students are unhappy with their school work and think it is a waste of time. Every day, about 30 students choose to study in other countries.\n\nHowever, I think the knowledge we learn is very useful because we might need it one day. For instance, I learned Home Economics and Technology at school. At first, I did not see why I had to learn things I was not interested in. But once, I had to make food alone because my parents were away. I did not know what to cook. Then, I remembered how to make a Korean dish called 'Bulgogi' from class. That's when I saw the value of knowing a lot.\n\nIn the end, I think it is good to study different subjects and learn a lot. This can help us in life, even if it is not about something we like.

Adults say they don't help, but I don't believe that's true. Hundreds of young people work for their communities. Why do adults think they don't? Maybe they haven't seen it. How can young people show adults their work for the community? They don't need to show off their work. Young people today help in their own ways. Take a club DJ, for example.

Not every young person ignores helping their community, but I think most young people today don't spend enough time on community service. I agree with this idea for a few reasons, which I will explain below. The main reason I feel this way is because young people today are too focused on themselves. They care about their own success because the world is very competitive. To keep up, each young person is busy getting ready for the race. They forget about the community because they are too busy with their own goals and wins. They all want to be the best and don't want to spend time on others. Another reason I agree is because of all the bad things happening, like corruption, violence, theft, and murder. If young people spent more time on the community's health, wouldn't things be better? Many of these bad people are young, right? Instead of helping, they are causing pain and trouble for the community. Also, I think young people don't help the community because they are losing their moral values and discipline. They want to be free and don't want to learn about helping others. What they get from the growing tech world is how to update themselves and stay in the race. They don't care about the community. For example, many young people are online for a lot of their time. When they use the internet, are they helping others or just chatting, surfing, looking for jobs, or schools? They are more likely using it for themselves. All these reasons make me think that young people today are not very interested in helping the community.

But you can't just come up with new ideas out of nowhere. You have to study them. You need evidence and a good reason for your idea. Sometimes, you also need advice from people who have tried it before. For example, look at the president of the clothing store UNIQLO. It's a very popular store in Japan now. He started many new projects and really tried them out. But he also failed a lot. He showed us how to mass-produce clothes. They began by making simple clothes and selling them cheap. Before UNIQLO, people thought selling lots of cheap, simple clothes was a bad idea. They believed customers wanted unique, high-quality items. But UNIQLO did well selling clothes like this. They also had big failures, like when they tried to sell vegetables and fruit in the store. It was a shock to us. Who would think a clothing store would sell vegetables? But it didn't work. They stopped after a few months and lost money. Still, the president of UNIQLO keeps coming up with new ideas and projects. That's why the company is still growing and making money. I've realized that even if others think your idea will fail and try to stop you, they can be wrong. You might fail a lot before you finally succeed. But that's how you get to success, so you shouldn't be scared. You need to take risks and try."}

I read a lot of car magazines filled with ads. There were so many cars in the magazine, it was hard to pick just a few. When I finally went to see a car at the dealer, it didn't look as nice as in the magazine. Second, I helped make uniforms for my company's baseball team. We looked at a catalogue and liked the designs. But when we got the uniforms, they weren't as nice as the pictures. Also, I helped make a website to hire college students. It was like an ad for our company. We used the best pictures of our company to make it look great. We didn't lie, but we chose pictures carefully. So, our website showed our company in the best way. In the end, I believe ads make things look better than they are. But I also need to remember that things aren't as good as they seem in ads when I shop."}

Group trips are fun in many ways. \n\nWhen you go on a group trip, you meet new people. You learn about their language and their home countries. \n\nGroup trips let you see lots of places.

You can make friends from different places. This way, you have friends all over the world. \n\nGroup travel is very nice. It's even better because you learn about different places. You see many things with others. Group trips help you make friends from around the world. I believe traveling with a group and a guide is the best way to go."}

In ads, especially on TV, the products are shown as amazing things that can meet all our needs! Many people work in these big companies to sell as many items as they can. Of course, I think that the companies can't sell something very different from what we see on TV or in newspapers. If they did, people wouldn't buy a bad product a second time. I think that advertisers want to show a product in the best way. They try to focus on the good parts and hide any bad parts of a product. They usually show happy customers who are glad to be in the ad."}
{"file_id": "1162480.txt", "output_essay": "These days, ads are very important. We see that ads have changed a lot because of fast changes in technology. When I watch TV, I see many different and fun ads. If someone wants to do well, they need to make a good ad. But, they also have to spend a lot of money. So, we need to make ads to sell a good product.\n\nThe first reason is that people are curious. Most people watch TV every night. Ads show us many things about products. They can change the look, color, or size on TV. For example, when I see an ad, I want to try the product because it looks good on TV.\n\nThe second reason is that ads often show famous people. I think this is important because many people enjoy seeing celebrities. This kind of ad costs a lot, but I think it's worth it. In the end, it can make a lot of money. For instance, my sister wanted to buy Coca-Cola last week because she saw celebrities in the ad. So, understanding feelings is important in ads. Ad makers should try different kinds of ads when they plan.\n\nIn conclusion, there are many reasons to make a good ad. From the examples given, we can tell that ads are very important for selling a product. If we focus a lot on ads, I think the product will get popular."}
{"file_id": "1158507.txt", "output_essay": "For many years, there have been lots of new things made that have really changed how we live. One of these is the car, which we use almost every day. Some people think that fewer people will use cars over time, and I think they are right. Nowadays, a lot of us, including me, worry that there might be fewer people in the future. This could mean that not as many people will need cars. Also, because technology is getting better, buses and trains are much easier to use. This might be why people could choose them over cars later on.\n\nRight now, we're worried that there might not be as many people in the future. Studies show that more old people make up the population. This is partly because doctors and medicine are better now. Also, as more women work, they often decide not to have kids so they can keep their jobs. This could mean there will be fewer people later on, which might make car use go down.\n\nAs things in technology get better, buses and trains have become much easier to use than before. In Korea, there used to be no help like elevators for people who can't walk well, not like in Japan. But when I went there this year, I saw a lot of elevators for these people. There are still many cars on the roads, but people might start to use buses and trains more because they don't cost much and are easy to use.\n\nLike I said, in the future, not as many people will use cars. Sure, a lot of people still drive their own cars because it's easy for them. But if there are fewer people, less of them will need cars, and more will probably take buses and trains because they have gotten easier to use."}
{"file_id": "1136669.txt", "output_essay": "Yes, I agree that many ads make products look better than they actually are. Ads today don't just show what the product does or how it looks. They often make the product seem amazing with the false promise that it will make customers very happy. Sometimes, this promise is true, but it really depends on the company and the actual product.\n\nAds are often just meant to win over people's hearts! I say this because products that compete with each other are usually similar in quality and amount. It's up to the company's marketing team to make their product look 'much better than it really is.' If they succeed in winning the customers' hearts, the product will sell and the company will make money.\n\nIn a competitive world, makers have to show their product as the best. Studies show that products that are advertised well are often wanted more by customers. If you make your product shine or seem bigger, better, or more appealing on TV, in magazines, or through other media, you might attract customers. Even if they only buy after looking at the product carefully and asking friends, they are at least drawn to go see what it's really like. How much a product sells depends on how much it's like the ad and what other options there are.\n\nIn my view, ads are a key part of selling things today. They should be as honest as possible. But I think it's okay to highlight the product and its features a bit."}
{"file_id": "1156452.txt", "output_essay": "It is hard to understand many things if they are not explained with ideas, examples, and simple terms. I believe they are connected because without the things that happen, there are no ideas. Take war, for instance. Why doesn't war stop? Wars have been around for a long time, and we all know the terrible things they cause: hunger, poverty, people having to leave their homes, fear, mental health issues, children losing their parents, and families losing their homes. But I think that if students really get the ideas and lessons from all the wars in history, we could avoid repeating the same mistakes. Let's look at another example that's more familiar. When a teacher talks about mental health issues in class, he might say, 'People still have mental health issues,' and students will ask why. If he explains that some people who feel emotionally empty (maybe because their mom didn't show much love) and weren't taught right from wrong, might steal not because they need to, but to feel better. In a business class, when the teacher says, 'The customer is always right,' and then explains it, we get it: a business needs customers to survive. It doesn't matter what the business thinks, but what the customers who buy the product think does. For example, if you treat a customer well, they can bring in more customers (like friends and family). But if they're not happy, they'll tell others, and the business will get a bad name. I think this is true everywhere, not just in school but also at home with our kids and family. It's hard to learn things if we don't have ideas and simple explanations to help us understand."}

They also live in a time with many more things to distract them than in the past. I believe our world has become very competitive. Since more people can get a good education, schools and businesses want an even higher level of learning. This is why I think some people work harder now. Also, computers, video games, and other gadgets keep today's youth very busy. This is why I mostly agree that young people now don't have time to help their communities. I don't think it's their fault; it's because of the way society is now. From my own life, I can say I don't spend much time helping my community. One reason is that no one pushes me to do it. People around me care less about community problems and are more focused on themselves. But it's not true that all young people don't help enough. I believe this is more of a problem in rich countries. In poorer countries, people know more about being poor, so they are not as caught up in new technology."}
{"file_id": "1152202.txt", "output_essay": "Ads often show off the newest and coolest products or services to attract buyers. To stand out in a busy market, it's important to grab the buyer's attention. Ads need to be short and powerful. Because they are so short, they can't always show the product in a true and fair way. People who buy things that are said to be reliable or easy to use might end up unhappy with what they get. But who is at fault? Companies will always show their products in the best light; I would do the same. But we, the customers, also don't want to sit through long ads that explain everything. The problem of misleading ads isn't new. I think people should be smart enough to realize that companies will say anything to make a sale. For instance, when a phone is advertised, the ad might claim: 'The best phone ever made.' No one can really prove this. So, we get an overstatement or maybe even a lie. Take food and drinks as another example. How can an ad claim: 'The tastiest burger ever'? If someone buys it and doesn't like it, it shows that ads can't decide what we like or always be right about a product. I've talked about the bad side of the ad industry. But there are also honest companies that don't exaggerate or lie. When ads compare products, you can usually trust them. In the end, it's the buyer's choice to believe an ad or not."}
{"file_id": "1162627.txt", "output_essay": "I believe that it is better for students to grasp ideas and concepts than to just memorize facts. Nowadays, in schools, students only memorize facts. They often don't get what the teacher is saying. This isn't good for young learners. If teachers only read from the book, all students will think the same way. This could also stop kids from using their imagination. Low student scores are a big issue worldwide. In Japan, for example, I heard on TV that many students rarely read books. They don't enjoy learning and don't see why it's important. I feel that teachers should help kids become interested in new ideas, not just facts. Kids should come up with their own thoughts. This will make them smarter and more curious people. Another issue is that many Japanese people can't speak English well. I saw a chart on the news showing Japan at the bottom. In high school, students learn English from non-native speakers. They focus on grammar and speaking. I don't think this helps much. They should practice listening, writing, and have chances to speak with English speakers. This would help them follow along and like their classes more. I don't think learning facts is all bad. But if that's all students learn, they might lose their own ideas and creativity. That's why grasping ideas and concepts is more important than just knowing facts."}

I'm not against knowing a lot, but focusing on one thing is how you make a mark in history. Going deep into one subject is better than knowing a little about many subjects. So, I don't agree with the idea that it makes you just an 'average person.' History and my own life show that being an expert in one thing can make you stand out and lead to success later on. For example, a well-known English scientist who studied plants is famous in biology. What makes him different from other biologists? He looked at pea plants for over 20 years and won a Nobel Prize for his work. He will be remembered, and his work on genes helps many people. Also, a French poet named 'Silvia Plath' is famous for her sad poems. Her poems make you feel sad. She's like other poets, but her special use of metaphor and clear descriptions make her work feel dark. Her style is still loved, and many poets try to copy it. Not just in academics, but in sports too, like 'Michael Jordan,' famous for basketball. His college coach said, 'Basketball and Michael have a strong bond; he only knows how to play well.' He became very rich and famous by playing basketball well. In the end, these examples show that focusing on one thing can make you famous and put your name in history books. This is why I don't agree with the earlier statement."}

Some people think it's better to help students understand ideas than to just know facts. First, if students come up with their own ideas about a topic, they will likely remember it better. For example, if a history student thinks about how Germans felt after World War II, and figures out they were desperate and hopeless, the student learns by doing. Also, when students understand ideas, they can use them in new situations or other subjects. For instance, a student who understands social behavior can notice it in their own life and see how it's different in other places. Knowing facts is not always useful, like in tests when you have to remember dates. In history, it's important to know dates so you don't confuse the order of events and to understand time periods. In the end, it's more useful for students to be able to apply what they've learned in many areas than to remember facts that they might forget after a test."}

The tour guide told me many things about Australia. Before the trip, I didn't know much about it. But I learned a lot from the guide, like the history of Australia and about the native people there. When I was in middle school, I read a book set in Australia. In the book, a man climbs a big rock called Uluru. I wanted to climb it too. But the tour guide said Uluru is important to the native people and they don't want us to climb it. I didn't know that before.

Young people today have more fun than old people did before. This is because young people are healthy and can easily adapt to new places. They can play, dance, and drink, which old people can't do as easily. Young people like to hang out with friends, talk, walk around, and go on holiday to other countries for parties. But old people can't travel much because their health might not allow it, or they might not handle new places well. They can't have as much fun now as they did before. Young people can fit in anywhere and do anything as long as they are able. They have more fun than old people because things have changed a lot nowadays. Looking at today, we can say young people have many ways to have fun. They go to parties, come home late, take long drives, go on picnics with friends, and enjoy weekend parties. They like to try new things and go everywhere to learn about different places. If they find a new place, they will go there and have fun while they learn about it.

This decides if focusing on one subject in school is good or not. I will talk about this idea by looking at the area of business studies. In Switzerland, a student getting a master's degree can pick if he wants to focus on just one thing like finance, or learn about many things like marketing, human resources, finance, management, risk, and leading people. To show what I mean, let's look at two different jobs in a company. A general manager and his team don't need to know just one thing well. They have to deal with many areas like leading, marketing, and money matters. For a manager, being able to make quick decisions on many topics is key. So, learning about many things is better. On the other hand, someone working in finance, like at a bank, doesn't need to know about everything. It's more important for them to know a lot about their own area. Their job is more narrow. They should know a lot about one main thing, like finance, which is still a pretty big topic. But, it's clear that knowing more is always good. Still, a person must choose their path first.

Everyone is now thinking about what we can use instead of gas. There are some ideas, but they cost a lot. But when we find a good fuel that doesn't pollute, it will change car technology a lot. Right now, cars put too much carbon into the air, and it's very bad for Earth. We can't keep making the air dirty like it doesn't matter. People will understand that their cars are harming the air, and they will want to use bikes or clean cars instead. We can make these clean cars, but car makers aren't doing it yet. This is because governments and people don't understand how quickly carbon is hurting our planet. But if we keep making the air dirty with our cars, in about 10 years, the problems will get worse and happen more often. Then, everyone will want to stop making the air dirty before it's too late. In many places, cars are not allowed anymore. For example, in Paris, the mayor made some streets only for buses. This is to make people use buses and not drive their cars. In Mexico City, it's even stricter because you can only drive your car once a week. The government did this to make the air cleaner, as Mexico City has some of the dirtiest air in the world. Cars make the air too dirty, and soon it will cost even more to fill them with gas. So, I think in the next few years, you will see new car technologies."}

On one side, a car is our best way to travel because it's simple and we don't have to wait in line to buy tickets. But we have to ask: Is the car really the best choice for getting around in cities? Or could it turn into a big problem for us soon? I think that in a few years, the car will be the worst way to travel. This is because there will be too many cars on the road and, even more important, because of air pollution! I believe that soon we will use fewer cars. This will happen as our lives get better. I also think that experts agree with me. They are trying out new ways to move around in cities. They are also looking at using cleaner fuels.

Some people who like the idea of knowing about many topics say it makes a person's view of the world wider. Others believe that being an expert in one area is key to success in today's world. I think a mix of both is best. I will talk about the good and bad points of each side and explain why I think a mix is the way to go. In our fast-changing world, knowing about many different subjects is important. It helps someone see the big picture and make smart choices. For example, think about a person in charge of marketing at a company that sells products quickly. If they know about money matters, they can make better plans for advertising. Without this knowledge, they might suggest a plan that costs too much and the company can't afford it. Knowing about money, planning, and how people act can lead to better choices. This shows why it's good to know about many topics. But we can't ignore that the world is very competitive. The most successful people are often experts in their areas. Take doctors, for example. They focus on specific areas like teeth or diseases and get more degrees in those areas. Most people would rather see a doctor who is an expert in their problem. I like the idea of being both broad and deep in knowledge. This makes a person well-rounded, able to make good choices, and an expert in their field. If the marketing person knows a lot about different subjects, they might struggle to create a good marketing plan. This needs deep knowledge of marketing. But if they only know about marketing, they might miss important facts from other areas and make a bad plan. If they know a lot about their field and also about other topics, they will make better choices and be more successful."}

For example, getting around is harder because of traffic, and talking to people takes more time and work. Young people are too busy with their own lives to help others. Also, traveling costs more now, so they can't afford to go to different places to help. Second, there are more fun things for young people to do now. They can watch many movies and hang out with friends. When they have free time, they'd rather go out to eat or see a movie than help in the community like their parents did. Third, schools are partly to blame. They don't teach kids how important it is to help others and be part of the community. So when they finish school, they don't help because they never learned how. In conclusion, we are all to blame for young people not helping out. Parents at home didn't show them how to care for their community. Schools and the media are also responsible.

Sometimes, when you start something new without knowing how to do it, you think a lot before you start. This is normal. But you need to decide when to try new things or stick with what you know. It's hard to choose, and it depends on the situation. If trying something new is safe for my health and not dangerous, why not? It could help me learn new things and think of the best way to do something. A big point is, if everyone does the same old things, how can we find new ways to work or live? So, successful people take risks to find or improve their lives. Life is like school; you learn from it. You learn by doing things yourself. Remember, there is no end to learning, and you learn by making mistakes. When you make a mistake or try something new, you should learn from it.

However, some of their products were not worth the high price. The first iPod is an example. When it first came out, it sold very well and still does. But the first iPods had many problems. The batteries inside the iPod stopped working after two weeks and only lasted for an hour when fully charged. Since the iPod was very popular, this battery issue happened to many people soon after they bought it. Also, the headphones that came with the iPod stopped working if you listened to music at the loudest volume. This was a problem because it meant the headphones were not made well.\n\nEven though people knew about these problems, the iPod still sold well. It was a popular item to have. Steve Jobs, the boss of Apple, and his team made the iPod look so good that everyone wanted one. The iPod cost three to four hundred dollars. Other MP3 players were cheaper and just as good, so the iPod was not worth the extra money.\n\nThe way products are advertised makes us think they are better than they really are.

Then, companies will make their services better, and they will be ready for this change in twenty years. Next, we should put more money into finding new ways to travel and to make travel cheaper, like for planes, trains, and boats.

This new way let them serve food quicker. Thanks to what they did, McDonald's grew to be the biggest burger company in the world. \n\nTrying new things can be risky. It's great when new ideas work out. But if they fail, it can be really bad. I think trying new things is like playing the lottery. We can't tell if it will work out or not. \n\nAnother example is the person who made the iPod. This device is one of Apple's biggest hits. Apple used to make only computers. The iPod was new because it was light and could hold a lot of music. Apple was the first to make something like the iPod. This way of trying new things has made Apple very successful. \n\nFor these reasons, I believe that successful people try new things and take chances instead of just sticking to what they know."}
{"file_id": "1127832.txt", "output_essay": "While the main goal of ads is to show off a product or service, I believe that most ads make products look way better than they really are. Ads are meant to make people want to buy a product by showing that it's good and the best choice. But, many ads go too far. They show a product that is very different from what it is like when you use it. The way ads overstate things to get buyers interested can sometimes be silly. Ads for everyday items often show the products in a false way. They make them look much better than they are. For example, there's a TV ad for a shampoo that says it can grow hair on bald people. It also says it can make them as good as top race car drivers. Ads in other areas also trick people. They make them think the product has features it doesn't have. Some ads use humor to sell a product. But they can make the product seem too perfect. Ads for workout gear in catalogs are another example of this problem. The real items are not like what the ads show. Today, many people believe TV more than printed words. They use TV ads to choose what to buy. This is not a big deal for small items. But for costly things, ads can lead to bad choices. For instance, ads for houses, money-saving plans, or job sites can make false promises. This can cause people to decide wrongly. In the end, I think ads should give people the right information to choose well. A little humor is okay. But ads should not turn the real use of the product into a dream. This happens a lot with ads today. So, I strongly agree that most ads make products look much better than they are."}
{"file_id": "1148468.txt", "output_essay": "I don't agree with this statement. First, we can't just say yes to this idea because we often hear about people who did well after they tried something new. For example, the people who started using assembly lines in car factories took big risks. They didn't know if enough people would want to buy so many cars, but they went ahead anyway, and it worked out for them. So, the statement we're looking at isn't completely wrong, but I don't think it's right either. I believe that trying new things and taking risks are important to do well, but they're not the only things that make people do well. Running a business well also means finding good chances. Sometimes, you get a great chance and you go for it, and that's what makes you do well. Also, many people who do well had a great idea once, but then they don't try or risk anything new for years. Take Bill Gates, for example. He's done very well, but he doesn't keep taking risks or trying new things. He made the most well-known company in computer engineering, but he didn't try to do different things. Furthermore, many people who do well focus on one special area. They work to be the best at what they do, and they don't want to try new things that could change how people see them. So, they don't try new things or take risks, but they still do well because they are very good at what they do. This is the complete opposite of the statement we're talking about. And I don't think that's wrong. To end, I think there's not just one way to be when you're doing well, and that's why it's really hard to run a business that does well. Every business leader is different and makes different choices than another leader in the same spot."}

They have time for everything else, but they avoid helping their community. These same people will live in this community later. They should remember something important: if they don't help their community now, there might come a time when they need help and no one will be there for them. If we don't help ourselves, no one else will help us either.\n\nWe need to help each other when we live together. This way, we can live without problems. If we act as one, there won't be any problems in the world one day. We could be like one big family. We should all try to help each other. I see this happening. For example, through globalization, countries are coming together. Rich countries are helping poorer ones. This shows that some people do want to help.\n\nWe can't say that young people never help their community. Some young people are teaching others how important it is to help. They are starting groups to help those who need it.\n\nThis means that some young people do want to help others and their communities. But there are not many of them. We need to make this habit grow. We should make sure that everyone starts doing this."}

Sure, taking risks can lead to failure. If the risk is big, you might lose a lot. This choice is even tougher if you have a family. I remember my dad once wanted to make his small drugstore bigger. It was a big opportunity, but he chose not to risk it because he wanted to protect our family. Also, trying new things means a lot of hard work. Some might ask why bother when you can just keep doing what you're good at?\n\nI believe you should try new things because they can reward you. I enjoy trying new things. They make life fun and interesting. They give you a chance to learn and grow. If you don't try, you'll never know if there's something out there you might like more. For example, I used all my money to start a small copy shop while I was in college. That small shop didn't just give me money for school. It also gave me the chance to use what I learned in college in a real business. This helped me a lot to do well later on.\n\nTo sum it up, it's easier to stick to what you know. But taking a risk can make us better and lead to new ideas. These new ideas are important because they help our economy grow."}

It made me sad because they forced me to follow a set path. We had to go to certain places at specific times. I couldn't spend extra time at any place because of the tight schedule and the group. Second, it looks cheap at first, but they make you pay more bit by bit. If I traveled by myself, I might save money and make friends in the city. Third, it's hard to make local friends when you're in a group. Traveling alone, I could get to know the local ways better. So, I don't like traveling with a tour guide."}

They grab our attention. Many people want to be like movie stars, singers, and TV stars. A product shown by a famous person might seem more appealing. Second, a survey by Chosun Daily, a top paper in Korea, found that three out of four people think products in ads are better. A poll by the same group found that people believe these products are safer. Third, in high school, my friend bought a tape player that wasn't in ads. It broke the next day. He tried to get it fixed for free but couldn't. He had to buy a new one. He chose a SONY player because it was well-known and had good service. Lastly, as a kid, I had two toys. I liked them the same until I saw an ad for a Superman toy. Even though it was cheaper, I always played with the Superman toy because it made me feel good. In the end, for many reasons, I think ads make products look much better than they are. Ads draw us to the products."}

They leave out anything that doesn't fit this message. Most of the time, the makers don't care about telling the truth. Take cigarettes, for example. If makers want to sell cigarettes, they won't talk about the bad effects. They will only talk about the good points. They hide important facts, even if it could harm the buyer. The buyer sees only the good things in the ad and thinks buying cigarettes is a good idea. This trick is also common in food ads. Many companies want their food to look healthy because people want to be thin. The ad makers create ads that make the food look good for health and fitness. They often make too much of small parts of the food. For instance, some ads say chocolate bars have 'lots of milk' when there's really very little milk in them. Ads also try to connect with how people see themselves. Beer ads often show beer as manly. Men may think drinking this beer will make them look tough and more appealing to women, even though the beer is not different from other beers. Companies use these tricks to make more money, no matter what it does to the buyers."}
{"file_id": "1164626.txt", "output_essay": "I believe there is no one answer to whether trying new things and taking risks brings more success than staying with what you know. It really depends on the person. Some people do very well by doing what they have always done. They know a lot about their work. They use their knowledge to make good choices. These choices could lead to big success. But, people who take risks and learn new things are often more open to new ideas. They must adjust to new situations and be flexible. They need to watch for changes and change with them. People who look for new challenges are often more driven. They don't get bored by doing the same thing every day. New challenges can open doors to success. I also think knowing about many areas, not just one, gives you more chances to succeed. Being able to talk about different topics might make others respect you. It's easier to have a strong opinion if you know about many areas. I find knowing a little about a lot more impressive than knowing a lot about one thing. Employers might prefer someone with common sense and many interests over someone who only knows one area well. Even though knowing a job well can lead to success, I would rather learn new things and take risks. Beyond success, I think life is better when you can try new things and face new challenges."}
{"file_id": "1146060.txt", "output_essay": "I really agree that it's more important for students to get the meaning of ideas and concepts than to just learn facts. I have three reasons to back up this view. First, I do think it's important for students to know some facts. Knowing things is key, but it shouldn't be the main goal. From what I've seen, you remember ideas and concepts taught by a book or teacher, not just hard facts you memorized. To remember well, you need to link facts together into bigger ideas. Second, knowing things is not enough; you need to understand them. Just remembering lots of facts doesn't mean you get them. You might not see how they connect to other things. You might miss the big picture. Third, when you use what you've learned, you need ideas more than just facts. Take a doctor, for example. It's not enough to know where the knee is. You must also know about other body parts that could affect the knee. Knee pain might not come from the knee itself. It could come from a different body part. In conclusion, students should learn facts and also understand ideas. This helps them really get the meaning of what they've learned. In the end, being able to use what you know matters most. And that only happens when you deeply understand the facts."}

A community is a group of people who live in the same area, share ways of life, and support each other when needed.\n\nEven if you are busy with work or school, you should still help your community grow. But many young people aren't doing this. Instead, they waste time in internet cafes, watch movies, or just hang out in the city. They could be volunteering to make their community better.\n\nYoung people often get sidetracked by things that aren't important, like spending hours online or talking about silly things. They think going to bars and spending their evenings there or on the streets is fun. But they could use that time to join in on community projects.\n\nThey also don't listen to their parents who tell them to get involved in making their community better.\n\nIn the end, I believe one important thing: young people should help out in their community.

{"file_id": "1147734.txt", "output_essay": "I agree that ads often make things look better than they are. Here's why. First, ads usually go too far in showing how good a product is. For example, some beauty products say in ads that they can make your skin lighter in two weeks or improve your face. When you see the ad, you like the catchy phrases or the promise of quick results, and you buy it. There's no real proof or studies to show the product works that well, but the ads use pretty models and big promises to get you to buy it.\n\nSecond, ads are made with a lot of care and detail. They use lights and computers to make the product look perfect. Look at shampoo ads. The model's hair looks very shiny and smooth after using the shampoo. But this is not real. No one's hair is that perfect. The shampoo company spends a lot of money on the ad to make you think their shampoo is the best.\n\nLastly, ads often sell a dream way of living, not just the product. You're drawn to the perfect life shown in the ad, not the product itself. The product might not be good, but if you want the life the ad shows, you'll buy it. For example, ads for houses might show that a single woman can be happy living alone. The house isn't the main thing. It's the idea of being a happy, independent person that makes you want the house.\n\nIn conclusion, ads are made to push a dream and often make the product look much better than it is. This is why products seem better in ads than they really are."}

We must make changes and new technologies are key. A step in the right direction is the new hybrid car technology. Hybrid cars have two engines. One is a regular gas engine, and the other is electric. These cars save a lot of fuel. They use oil to run normally and at the same time, they charge their electric batteries. After driving a short distance, especially if you drive fast (which creates more energy), you can switch to the electric engine. We should back up research to make technologies like this better. In the future, spending money on research will be even more important. Another reason for my view is that some countries are just starting to use cars. Take China as an example. Owning a car there was rare, but with its fast growth, they will soon have millions of cars."}

It also lets me meet many new people and make friends from different backgrounds, which makes the trip more fun. It helps me manage my money because I can plan my spending on shopping and other things. It also keeps me from being tricked in a new country. With a guide, I can see all the key spots in the cities and learn more about them. Traveling with others lets me talk to many people and learn more about society. It also gives me a chance to understand different ways of thinking. The guide can even show us fun places in the cities that are not on the plan. Following the guide's schedule helps with managing time. Also, being in a group keeps me safe from any bad behavior by locals. To sum up, I would definitely choose to travel with a group and a guide. I won't have to worry about booking my travel, places to stay, or my safety."}

People need to know about these products, their features, and how good they are. This is why ads are so important. They tell us, the buyers, about what we can buy. But ads must show a good product, or they might make us think it's better than it is. Ads often show only the seller's view of the product. First, they make you feel like you need it. Then, they try to convince you it's the best. They always try to make you see it in the best light. You might believe the product is great without even trying it. Also, you might not really need a product. But if you see it on TV, you might want to buy it. You might even make up a reason to buy it. Often, this product ends up forgotten in the garage or somewhere in your house. Ads always say good things about the product. They want to grab your attention and compete in the market. When something new comes out, it has to look good enough to beat other similar products and get customers. So, many products look good in ads but aren't as great in real life.

This happens almost everywhere, and I think it's okay to accept it. The first reason is that ads are made to show the good things about products to make people want to buy them. That's the goal of ads. The people who make ads look at the product closely and try to make it seem very useful and important. They often make things that are not that great seem great. For example, they might say a simple piece of paper can make you healthier than other paper. This might sound silly, but ads often make big claims like this. Second, the company that pays for the ad wants to make money. They do these things because they want to sell more and make more money. A company cares about what it spends and what it gets back. So, the bosses want the product to look really good to buyers, and the ad will try very hard to convince people, even if it's not all true. In China, there are many ads that are not legal and trick people, which is bad for everyone. The last reason is that sometimes people enjoy seeing incredible things in ads, even if they don't believe them. For example, a woman who wants to be thinner might like to see ads for weight loss pills. She might hope to look like the person in the ad. She doesn't really want the product, just the dream.

I don't believe that planes, ships, or any other forms of transport can take the place of cars so quickly. Right now, cars use petrol for fuel. This is a big issue because there's only so much petrol on Earth. Many experts warn that if we don't find new fuels for cars, we might not be able to use them in a few decades. But companies like Toyota, Ford, and Hyundai are working on cars that run on hydrogen and electricity instead of petrol. These cars won't need petrol, so we won't have to replace cars in twenty years. The world has changed a lot in the last hundred years. Cities have gotten bigger, and more people live in them. This has made it important to have a way to travel that is fast and doesn't cost too much. In big cities, a car can take you somewhere in 30 minutes, but walking there could take hours. Cars are now a must-have in our lives. The world is still changing. Cities are getting even bigger, and countries like India and China are seeing their populations rise. In twenty years, we'll need cars even more. Also, cars will get cheaper as time goes on. This happened in the past, and it means more people will be able to buy cars. Cars will become even more important. Our cities have grown in a way that makes cars the best choice for getting around. We've built roads, tunnels, bridges, parking spaces, and many things for cars. This setup is deeply rooted in our cities. Unless we completely change our cities in the next twenty years, cars will remain the best way to travel, and people will keep using them. Cars have been with us for fifty years. They've made getting around easier and quicker. They're also getting less expensive, which means more people can buy them.

Imagine a student who has finished school and wants a job. If this student says they have a college degree in business, a finance diploma, and have led some school clubs, they usually get a job faster than someone with just a high finance degree. This is because the person with the high degree might want more money and power, but can only help in the finance area. The other student, who knows about business and finance, can help in two areas, which makes them more helpful to the company. Also, a student who knows about many subjects can find a better job and earn more money. Knowing about different things helps you make friends, especially if you share interests.

I will talk about the good and bad points of each choice and share my thoughts.\n\nLearning about many subjects seems good at first. You don't have to pick your favorite topics, and learning one subject can help you understand another. For example, studying living things in biology can help in ecology. Changing subjects can also keep you from getting bored. But, you don't get much time for each subject. This can be upsetting when you can't learn a lot about the subject you like most.\n\nThe other option is to focus on one subject. The best part is that you learn a lot about a subject you enjoy and become more sure of yourself in it. You also make fewer mistakes. The big problem is when you need to know about other subjects. If you don't know them, you might not have time to learn and have to ask others for help. This can waste a lot of time. Another bad point about focusing is that you might not notice your own mistakes because you are too focused on your subject.\n\nIn the end, I like to focus on one subject more than knowing a little about many.

Young people can do more things because they have this energy. But this is only good if they use their energy for good things. Young people are always learning. They often find new places and things. They like learning about them because it's all new to them. Take driving, for example. Young people might like it more than older people. This is because it's new for them. Older people might not like driving as much because of traffic and other problems. If you ask kids in school during tests, they might not say they're having fun. But if you ask them during a holiday, they might say they are having fun. This shows that young people don't always understand life's duties as well as older people.

Second, you won't have to pay for car repairs. Also, public transport will save time because there will be less traffic on the roads. This is especially true for trains that run underground. As public transport gets better with new technology, fewer people will want to have their own car. \n\nAnother reason for fewer cars is that people are more worried about the environment. People who want to protect nature have been using TV and the internet to share their message. They have told everyone how serious global warming is. They have also taught people how to stop a big disaster from happening. These people have made many believe that saving nature is very important. They have also said that the world will run out of gas soon. So, more people who believe this will use cars less. \n\nIn the end, because public transport works well and people want to protect nature, less and less people will want to own cars.

Some people agree with this because it's important to know a little about many things. You should know simple facts about different subjects. This is what schools do. In school, kids are expected to do well in all subjects like math, languages, science, and sports. Kids have to work on all subjects to do well after school. But some people might ask: 'If a kid is good and likes math a lot, why should they also be good and like sports?' This is another way to think. Some parents believe it's okay if kids are only good at some subjects. This is because after school, they go to college and focus only on the subject they want to study. I believe the best way is to combine both ideas. I think everyone, especially kids, should learn a little about all subjects. It's not right to send a kid to a special school, like one for science or sports, too early. Kids should learn simple things about politics, geography, and other key subjects. It's good to send kids to a regular school first. After they finish, they can choose where to go and what college fits their interests. This way, kids will have the basic knowledge they need in life. Then, they can focus on one special subject later."}

Knowing ideas and concepts can teach us about the world and people around us. But learning facts lets us feel and experience possible events in our lives. For students, it is better to learn facts than to just understand ideas and concepts of a subject.\n\nFirst, learning facts is more exact and can be trusted in many jobs. Look at crime scene work. We don't know why someone died until we look inside the body closely. A tiny thing in a blood vessel can be very important, but we can't learn this from books. This is true for teaching students in school too, like in biology. They can only really get the ideas by doing experiments.\n\nSecond, students remember facts better. Seeing how body parts work together can make a big impact. It's easier to remember than boring book concepts. I'm in high school, and my friends and I like lab classes more than regular ones. They are fun and leave a strong memory.\n\nThird, for our feelings, learning facts makes life more interesting. We think about how things connect and what happens because of them. We learn by facts and doing things when we are young. This knowledge is simple and real. The more we experience, the better we can stay calm and think clearly in tough times.\n\nIn the end, even though we can take a shortcut by learning proven ideas given to us, we should still try to find answers on our own."}

This idea also fits the situation we're talking about. At first, being an expert in one area seems great. Most companies and university scientists show this. To do well in your job, you need to know a lot about it. Knowing more can take your focus away. Now, everyone focuses on a small area and knows a lot about it. This is needed to some degree. For example, only someone who has studied nano-composites for years can really understand them. But when you need to see the big picture, these experts often struggle. If they only know about nano-composites, how can they learn about new ideas in medicine that could help their work? So, not knowing about other fields can be a problem. Also, if you only know about one area, you might not care about other things and miss out on a lot. On the other hand, some people know a little about many things but not enough about one thing to be useful. These people have broad skills but don't have the deep knowledge needed to really help. Academia doesn't need these people because you need to understand specific issues. I think the best way is to mix both types. But I know we can't know everything about every subject. That's just not possible. I like the idea of focusing on one or two areas but also keeping an interest in other things. If you're a mechanical engineer, for example, don't stop being interested in the theatre."}

The first reason is that most ads add a 'bubble.' This 'bubble' makes ads look better and more important. For example, they use fun to make their look seem great to people. This makes people think the ads are really good and support them. They also use shows in ads. Many people watch these shows on TV. Ads use these shows and fun to make products look much better than they really are.\n\nSecondly, they help each other to earn more money by sharing information or helping in other ways. They entertain and teach people who don't know much about these ads. This way, they get more people interested, make more money, and make more products than they should.\n\nMany ads make products seem better than they really are.

Some people believe that ads often make products look better than they really are. I think this is true. Ads were made to boost sales. They have to make people think they need what's being sold. To do this, ads show products as the best ever, even if that's not true. Ads aim to get customers to buy what's being offered. For example, TV ads sometimes say that many customers loved the product after trying it. But there's no proof that this is true. Ads need to make the product look good to the buyer. So, they use a lot of tech to make the product look better in pictures. They fix photos and remove parts of them. TV ads, which are very common, try to show the product in the best light with bright colors and a good shape. Take food ads, for instance. If a cake is advertised, its bright color and nice shape can make people want to buy it. But when they do, they might be let down. The cake in real life can't look as perfect as it does in the ad because of the computer tricks used for the photos. In the end, ads often use false info. It's hard to tell the difference between honest ads and misleading ones."}

Take my classmate, Anna Bron, for example. She does well in our Advanced Placement Art 12 class because she tries new things. Anna is known as a great painter at our school. She told me she likes painting the most and enjoys trying difficult things. She has done well by pushing herself. But what really made her stand out was when she pushed herself by doing something that seemed easy. In our AP Art 12 class, we all have to do a project called 'Concentration.' Anna decided to use teabags to represent memories. She thought that each used teabag could remind someone of a specific time, place, or reason they drank that tea. Her first plan was to create a canvas from the teabags and paint on it, since painting is what she's most comfortable with. Her idea was unique, but my art teacher didn't like the painting part. The teacher told her to try something else with the teabags to make them stand out. Anna worried that this would be too simple and the result wouldn't be good. She was used to drawing and painting, so this was a new challenge for her. But she listened to the teacher's advice. Anna kept it simple and focused on the teabags. She once said that doing something simple is actually very hard for her. But she found a way to make the teabags look interesting. She arranged them into a mobile, sewed them into a quilt with different teabags, and tried other experiments. Now, Anna is making a dress from teabags she got from people. She's reaching new heights as an artist. She's not just getting good grades in AP Art 12, but also getting the chance to try new things. Anna is doing well because she's willing to experiment."}

This means that medicine now saves thousands of lives all over the world. Fewer people are dying as time goes on. Today, we can fight almost all diseases, except for HIV. But even HIV is becoming less common. People are taking better care of their health. Governments are helping smokers to stop. The USA gives food to other countries. All of this is making the world's population grow. \n\nFreedom is another reason. Today, we don't have slavery or other bad things that cause death, except for wars. The USA and other places give food and medicine to hungry kids in Africa. They also teach them things we already know, like how to use condoms to avoid HIV. \n\nRich countries are sharing their skills with poorer countries. This helps those countries improve their economies. So, people live longer. \n\nBecause of these reasons, I think more people will drive cars in the future. Cars will be cheaper because making them will be easier with new technology. So, people will buy more cars, and some might even own more than one. \n\nIn summary, as the number of people grows, we will have more cars in twenty years. Driving a car is convenient for getting around. I believe this will stay the same in the next twenty years."}

He talks to a lot of people and has fun activities and hobbies. Second, you can make friends more easily. There are many people around you, all with different likes. If you only know a little, and it's not what others are talking about, you might both find the talk dull. Lastly, if you only focus on one subject, you'll know it well.

I believe that successful people often try new things and take risks instead of just doing what they are already good at.\n\nFirst, a main reason for my belief is that successful people's work takes a lot of time and learning to improve. For example, Edison, who is very famous for inventing things, made the light bulb a long time ago. But he did not work on making it better. Later, other people made the light bulb better by changing its color and making it last longer. This shows that it is good for successful people to try new things and take risks. Also, when someone creates something new, it can lead to more new things being made. The light bulb is a good example. It was made soon after electricity was discovered. They are connected. So, when successful people make one new thing, they often make more new things after that. This proves that successful people should keep moving forward and not stop.\n\nStill, I don't want to say that my view is perfect. It has some downsides. For one, making new things can take a very long time. In conclusion, even though there are some downsides, I find the idea that successful people should try new things and take risks very convincing."}
{"file_id": "1149147.txt", "output_essay": "I agree that to be successful, you sometimes need to take risks. It does depend on the person's situation though. Take a creative director at an ad agency. If they've always won with one way of making ads, it's smart to keep using it. But as times and people's likes change, the director should think about trying a new way. If not, they might lose their customers. That's when it's key to risk doing something new with your ad. From my own life, I've found that taking risks has often led to success. I love art, so I've taken many art classes. Once, a teacher gave me a low mark because I always drew the same way. I never tried anything new. So, I used pastel paints instead of my usual charcoal. My teacher liked the colors, which were different from my black and white drawings. I got a higher mark. It wasn't just because the painting was better, but because I tried something new. Trying new things lets you see different ways of doing stuff. It makes you more open to change. If you only do the same thing, you're not showing you can adapt. It also means you might only do well in one area. But if you try and learn new things, you can show you're good in many areas. If you don't risk trying new stuff, you'll never know if you could do even better."}

Albert Einstein once said, \"Try to be a person of value, not just a person of success.\" Success comes to those who have new ideas and share them openly. Albert Einstein did not plan to create the 'Theory of Relativity.' His wish to look into and question every part of daily life led him to become famous as the creator of the 'Theory of Relativity.'\n\nPeople always change. Those who make this change clear are the ones who think differently. Long ago, everything was written on paper, like stories, money records, medicine, and religion. Now, we write everything on computers and save it using electronics. This is thanks to people who always wanted to make changes. We moved from pens to typewriters, then to computers, and now to supercomputers. All the new things made in every area of life happened because someone was thinking beyond what they already knew. They wanted to improve and add value to what we do today, and this led to new inventions.\n\nLook at Bill Gates. He is successful because he started Microsoft, a computer system that is in almost every home today. His wish to make something new brought him fame. His ongoing effort to change the world keeps his success going.\n\nIn conclusion, we see it everywhere: people who risk doing something new are the ones who get success and fame."}

I don't agree with the idea that 'in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.' Long ago, people walked to move around. The wheel's creation was a big change. After that, people made many kinds of transport. They first used carts pulled by animals. Then they made bicycles, which were good for moving around. Next came motorcycles, which were faster and easier to use. People wanted a fancier way to travel, so they made vehicles that used fuel. Some were for carrying goods and some for people, like trucks and buses. Then came cars. Cars used to be just for luxury, but now they are needed. Because of global changes and needs, cars became common. At first, cars were rare and interesting. But now, in rich countries, many people have more than one car. The big issue with cars is that they cause traffic jams and pollution. So, governments are making it costly to have a car by raising taxes and parking fees. But people still pay these because they really like their cars. Some think there will be fewer cars in 20 years, but I don't think so. Car owners won't just throw them away. New technologies will come that cut down on pollution. Some cars now even run on solar power. Also, there are more and more people every day.

The older people ask the young for help to clean it. But the young ones living there don't listen to the older people.\n\nSecond, young people also don't help their parents with chores or problems at home. For example, the TV is broken. On that day, the mom and dad might be very busy with other issues. They ask their son to take the TV to the repair shop. But the son doesn't listen to them.

These two kinds of people look at different things in their lives that help them find the best way to do well.\n\nPeople who take chances do it because their life makes them or pushes them to. They might live in poverty, have a hard life, or lack many things. This makes them look for new and creative ways to meet their needs. These ways are often risky because no one has tried them before. For example, inventors take the chance of using new or unknown methods to make something new and useful. This can make their lives successful. Another example is a business owner who decides to take a big chance to deal with bad or unexpected changes in the market.\n\nPeople who like to follow their plans usually have a stable life. They do things like everyone else but work harder and plan better to reach their goals. Most of these people don't like to take chances without looking closely at all possible results. So, they stick to their plans. For example, some people don't want to change their jobs or they do the same job as their parents, like being a doctor or a college teacher.\n\nIn my view, I like to follow my plans without taking chances. It is safer for my job and my place in society. I am not very good at finding other ways if taking a chance doesn't work out.

There are many cases of people getting sick. For example, diet products often don't work, but with nice words and untrue claims, they make people use them. The same is true for tech products. They use design and bright colors to take your focus off important things like the processors, hardware, RAM, etc. People get drawn to the colors and nice words. It depends on people's ability and focus to know what is true and good, which can help them. For money, people might lie or do wrong things. Another reason is that success is often tied to money.

Knowing a lot about many topics might seem good, but it's not really useful when you think about it more. There are experts in every field who focus on their own research.

You can do deep research that is more useful than knowing just a little about many topics. If researchers share their work, talk to each other, and work together when needed, it's okay if they don't know about many topics.

For example, a well-known scientist from Korea, Ho Jin Moon, said that his teachers only gave him facts when he was young.

They tend to think positively and keep going.\n\nIn conclusion, I strongly believe that successful people try new things and take risks instead of just doing what they know well."}

Many older people believe that young people are free and can do anything they like. But this isn't true for young people because they have a lot to do before they grow up. As a young person, I feel my life is very limited. Teens go to school every day. They must do their homework and projects. They also have to get ready for college. Getting ready for college is very stressful for young people. Most students want to get into good colleges. To do this, they have to study hard and join extra activities. Even if they want to do something else, they often don't have the time or they are not allowed to. Also, to reach their future goals, it seems they must go to college and study what they are interested in. Without college, it's tough to get a good job or make a lot of money. Teens also have to listen to their parents because they are not yet adults. If parents don't like what you want to do, you have to stop or change your plan. Teens don't really have freedom at school or home. Older people can do more of what they want because they are free and usually don't have money problems since most of them work. They can buy what they want without asking their parents. They can also do what they want without their parents telling them what to do. We can't say exactly when a young person becomes an older person. But we do know that when someone gets old enough, they can enjoy life more and have more freedom than young people."}
{"file_id": "1142749.txt", "output_essay": "These days, students are not interested in where ideas and concepts come from. As time passes, fewer students want to know things like 'How did Newton come up with his law, and what math is behind it?' or 'How was steel made from what's found in nature?' They don't want to know how things were discovered because they think these things are old news and don't need to be looked at again. They prefer to just learn about the discoveries made long ago, which have been checked many times over the years. To make this clearer, let's look at the two examples from the start of this essay: Newton's law. In Newton's time, it was key to show his second law of motion was true by timing how long something took to fall from a certain height. Today, students don't want to test this themselves. They would rather learn Newton's formula and use it to solve a physics problem to get a good grade. Now, let's look at making steel. This is a big area of study, and people are still looking into it. Many groups were part of the early days of working with iron, and they did many tests to see how iron and air made steel; they looked at many ways to make steel using high-heat ovens. Students today only want to know how steel is made in a chemical reaction to get a good grade. They don't want to prove to themselves that steel can be made these ways. The reason students think like this is because they are told to focus on getting a degree, and they are not encouraged to think about what they really like. It would be better if students could study what they really like. Then, a student who loves chemistry and physics would want to learn about these discoveries, while a student who wants to be an artist wouldn't have to worry about things they don't care about."}

Every day, you can see in the news that gas prices are going up. Gas is now more expensive than ever, and it might not get cheaper in the next few years. Also, we are running out of oil fast, so it will be hard to keep driving cars. Maybe people will start to use buses or trains more. This would help the environment by cutting down on pollution and noise. We can see that public transport is getting better, like with the fast trains. But, we also see that car companies keep making new cars. Most adults have driven a car at some point. Sadly, many people think of cars as a sign of their success and way of life. They use cars to show their place in society. Some don't want to stop driving because it's an easy and fast way to get around. For many people, especially men, cars are more than just a way to travel. They are toys that they like to show off and compare with others. In the end, I believe there will be fewer cars in twenty years. This is because driving will get too costly for some people if insurance and gas prices keep rising."}

Successful people always try to make things simpler and come up with new ideas. For example, people used to travel by carts in the past. But now, we can go across the sea using cars, airplanes, and helicopters. If people had not tried new things or thought of new ideas, they would not have been able to make new and faster ways to travel.\n\nTaking risks and trying new things is also important for success. In my family, my mother is a housewife, and so was my grandmother. But I want to be a scientist, so I am breaking our family's usual ways. I am doing things no one in our family has done, like planning to study abroad for a PhD because my country is still growing. So, I really believe in what was said before.\n\nWe should always try to come up with new ideas and add to the world. Making new technology by taking risks is how to succeed. For example, if no one had tried to go to the moon, we would not know what it looks like or what it is made of.\n\nBut trying new things can sometimes be risky.

This is because they can find better jobs and earn respect in society. First, a key reason to try new things and take risks is to get better jobs. It's clear that a successful person works hard to make more money. They look for new chances and are ready for new situations. For example, imagine a man who is a police officer and is okay with his job. But if he wants to be a chef and works hard for it, he is trying to be successful. Besides getting a better job, another important reason to try new things and take risks is to have a good place in society.

{"file_id": "1167264.txt", "output_essay": "I don't agree with the idea that getting the meaning of ideas and concepts is more important for a student than learning facts. Ideas help a student know what to do and how to do it. Concepts come from old books and are about what has already been done. They are the basic thoughts behind any subject. Without a concept, things don't get done right. For example, when picking a major, a student will struggle if they don't understand the basic ideas of the course. Facts are exciting to hear about. A fact tells us what is really true. Facts are important in every job we do. I believe that knowing facts puts us where we need to be. Facts are like behavior, personal experience, or something we've done. Take a test that is new to a student. He needs to take many practice tests to get ready for the real one. If he only studies the ideas and concepts, he won't do as well as he would with practice. Let's also think about starting a business. A person who wants to start a business needs to learn about marketing ideas and concepts, and also get experience. He should watch how other business people handle their daily work. Just knowing the idea and basics of the business won't make it successful in the market. There will be less profit without learning facts. So, I think that knowing only a little can be risky. That's why I don't agree that understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning facts for students."}

If they didn't, no one would buy these things. People want to be sure they are getting the best thing when they shop. So, ads show them what they want to see, even if it's not true. Take, for example, products that say they can help you lose weight in two weeks. Many women know this isn't true, but they still want to try because the ad promises good results. In the end, women find out the product doesn't work. Kids also see toys on TV that they dream about. Ads make them think that with these toys, they will be the strongest or the best. Kids don't know how buying and selling works, so they believe the ads and want the toys. But when they get the toy, they realize it doesn't do what the ad said. So, I think ads do make things look much better than they are. This is a big part of how our world works. Things must always look better than they are so people will buy them. Ads have to lie. If they don't, another ad will, and then the honest ad won't work. It looks like people today would rather be lied to and feel good than know the truth.

I think they often make products look much better than they really are. For example, we might buy something because we've heard so much about how amazing it is. But when we use it, we find out we were tricked.\n\nThe real quality of the product doesn't match the ad, and we've probably paid more for it than for a similar product that wasn't advertised.\n\nI think ads have a bigger effect on kids. They often want their parents to buy a toy or shoes they saw on TV. They like how the product looks in the ad and think it will do what the ad shows.\n\nIn the end, I think we should be a bit skeptical when we see ads. When we buy something, we need to be careful. Sometimes, a product we've never seen before can be just as good as the one in the ad. And we might save money."}

I think we will see even more cars in the future. They are very important for getting around. First, many people see cars as a sign of wealth. They buy them to show off, not always because they need them. People from all income levels are influenced by cars. So, cars will not go away. Second, cars are seen as more comfortable. People like cars because they can get to places without waiting for buses or trains. Cars are less stressful and help people relax more than other ways of travel. You can use a car anytime and it helps you do things without hurry. Also, car prices have gone down for many reasons. Now, even people with an average income can buy them. This means more people will have cars. Owning a car lets you make quick plans, like going on a picnic. A car is useful for work and personal things. Cars don't pollute as much as some people think. They are not the biggest cause of pollution. Besides personal use, cars are also used by everyone as taxis. Cars help us get to places and enjoy life's comforts.

Sometimes you might want the first, other times the second. I don't agree with the idea that 'The best way to travel is in a group with a tour guide.' It depends on how you feel and where you're going, which could be to another country or somewhere in your own country. I like to travel by myself for many reasons.\n\nFirst, when you travel with a group and a tour guide, you have to follow them all the time. I don't like this. It feels too limiting and dull. You might research a place before you go and think of what it will be like; you might even make plans. If you're with a group, and the tour guide wants to go somewhere else, it's a problem. Also, you might get tired of a place, but you have to stay because of the group. This isn't good.\n\nSecond, tour guides usually take you to old places. This can be nice, but if you don't care about history or art, it's not good.\n\nIn the end, there are lots of reasons to travel by yourself. A group tour might not be as nice as you hoped. The hotel might be dirty or uncomfortable. Even though there are some good things about traveling with a group and a tour guide, the bad things might be more important for some people."}
{"file_id": "1165743.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with the statement.\n\nI believe that evidence shows that most people who have done well have tried new things and taken more risks than those who have not done well. For instance, many large computer companies are run by people who took a lot of chances in the 1970s and 1980s by putting money into new computer products. These people took a lot of risks and were successful.\n\nThis fact matches the business idea that 'taking more risks can lead to more rewards.' So, it is likely that someone who takes risks will earn more than someone who only sticks to what they know best. This assumes that the risk-taker is smart and not just someone who gambles without thinking.\n\nAlso, if a person only does what they are already good at, they won't learn more or get the knowledge they need to do well. For example, if someone only does what they are good at, they will probably never fail. This might look like a good thing, but it's not. Failing is key to learning from our mistakes. That's why people who have done well have often failed many times. For example, many rich people today have gone broke several times.\n\nLastly, trying something new usually leads to a new product. Once it is protected by trademark laws, the person has the sole right to sell it. For example, many successful drug companies got there by creating new medicines. They could only do this because they took a lot of risks and did things differently. It's also worth saying that this is true not just for professionals but for artists too. Many artists have done well because they did their art in a new way, taking a lot of risks."}

Have you ever seen an ad that made you want something? I bet almost everyone has bought something because they saw it in an ad. Ads are tempting. They play with our feelings. They are made to catch our eyes and make us want what they show. Ads usually show a perfect-looking woman with not much clothing and a big smile. These ads make women want to look like her and men want to be with her. The product doesn't seem as important as the feelings the ad creates. For example, a cigarette ad might show a tan, pretty woman smoking. It's on a big sign for everyone to see. Do people want to smoke, or do they want to look like the woman? This shows that the ad makes the product look better than it is. Even if we don't want ads to affect us, they still do. When we leave our homes, we see ads everywhere. On big signs, on trucks, in schools, and in magazines. We remember these ads without thinking. Later, at the store, we might buy what we saw in the ads. Then we realize it's not as good as we thought. We're surprised that the ad made us buy it and made it look better. In the end, we live in a world full of ads and people selling things. It's hard to tell if something is worth buying or just trying to get our attention. It's important to know that not everything in ads will work the same for everyone. But I had to learn this myself.

First, it will cost more to own and drive a car. This is because oil prices will go up. We've seen prices shoot up in the past few years. Also, car taxes will increase since the government wants to protect the environment and needs money. So, not everyone will be able to afford a car. Another reason for fewer cars is that we will have more ways to get around. For instance, a new fast train called the Transrapid will be built in Munich soon. If people can take the Transrapid, they might not drive cars. Plus, researchers are looking for new ways to move people that don't hurt the environment as much as cars do. A third point is that more people are moving to big cities for work. These cities will get more crowded. In big cities, you usually don't need a car. I say this because cars can be slower than other options, like bikes or the subway, because of traffic jams. For example, my friend in Munich takes an hour to drive to university. But by bike or subway, it only takes him thirty minutes. So, I think more people will ride bikes or take the subway.

So, I started to solve problems on my own. My dad went through something similar. His business failed at first, but he didn't stop trying. He kept going and eventually, his business did well. What I'm saying is, don't stop, and work hard all the time. \n\nI have another story. Everyone knows Thomas Edison. As a kid, people called him 'stupid' and 'foolish'. His own parents were worried. One time, he brought home some eggs. He told his mom, 'I can make chickens, mom, babies will come out.' He always wondered about things and tried to make them happen. In the end, he did well in his work. We all know about the light bulb. He made it himself. Everyone should try things and not be afraid of the new. \n\nTo sum up, I think people do well for a clear reason. They are brave with new things and they take chances.

Kids think they are healthy now, but health gets worse with age. I think it's better for young people to have fun than older people for a few reasons. First, being responsible makes a person focus on making their life safe. They don't think about having fun until they've done everything they need to do. For instance, in a family, the dad works to make money for his kids, and the mom takes care of the kids and helps the dad with money. But the kids just want to play and enjoy every day without worries. This shows how young and old people are different. Second, older people start to look after their health more because it gets worse as they age. Young people don't worry about responsibilities or health problems, so they should enjoy life now before things change. For example, a 60-year-old who has stopped working might have health issues that stop him from having fun. But a 20-year-old who just finished school can play sports and hang out with friends without health worries, unless they have a disability. In the end, I agree that young people should enjoy life before they get older and have more to deal with. No one knows what their health will be like later.

Because of this, people often think they don't help the community or do kind things for others. In fact, people usually think they do the opposite. This idea isn't completely made up. There are many kids who are ready to spend their time to support the community. You can see this happening in many places, especially in schools. A lot of schools have different activities for students that help their communities, and students join in to help without being asked to.\n\nOne of the most liked activities by students is visiting orphanages or homes for older people. Students choose to use their time after school to go to an orphanage or a home for the elderly that's close by. When they visit, students play with the kids, talk with the older people, and clean up litter in the area. They bring joy and kindness to the community. These kind actions definitely make the community better.\n\nAnother activity is with Amnesty International, which helps communities all over the world. Students work in groups and learn about unfairness in society and politics in different places. With this knowledge, they spread the word about these issues and get more students involved by writing letters to governments. As the next leaders, they not only tell governments about these problems for the community, but they also get other people to pay attention to the world around them.\n\nIt's true that sometimes young people can be lazy and not help out. They might prefer to have fun watching TV or playing games. Sometimes, they just need to relax and have fun as kids. Being a kid should mostly be about having a good time. Also, there are always other kids who are more responsible and do helpful things for the community to make up for the ones who are lazy.\n\nBeing kind and giving up things for others show that a person is growing up. Many young people already volunteer to help the community, as we can see from the successful activities in schools. But young people are still learning and changing. If they're not helping yet, we shouldn't stop them from enjoying their childhood."}
{"file_id": "1172794.txt", "output_essay": "The way students are taught is a hot topic. Some focus on facts, while others focus on ideas. I believe it's better for students to grasp ideas than to memorize facts. This is for three reasons: understanding ideas helps with facts, facts are easier to learn on their own, and ideas help students think for themselves. First, if a student gets the idea, they'll get the facts too. Learning just facts is not that useful. For example, there are too many historical facts to remember. But if you get the main idea of a historical event, you can remember the facts about it better. Second, it's simpler to learn facts one by one than to get a whole idea. Teachers can give tips to help understand ideas. But facts are easy and you don't always need a teacher. Teachers can use their own stories to make facts more fun, but they can't change the facts. Third, knowing ideas helps students think and judge things on their own. When they understand an idea, they can come up with their own thoughts and ways of thinking. Like, a student who really understands a philosophy can make their own theory about it. In the end, I think understanding ideas is the key part of learning for students. Learning facts is also good, but it shouldn't be the main thing."}

While we may never fully agree on this, I am sure of one thing: I don't think ads always make things look better than they are. Not every ad draws in customers, and there are a few reasons for this. First, some ads actually make people not want to buy what's being sold. For example, in many places, tobacco ads must show warnings. When I was in Australia, I saw ads with pictures of lung cancer on them. These ads are meant to warn us about the risks of using tobacco. Clearly, they don't make tobacco look good. Also, some ads use a special way to get attention. A Japanese food company called Yukiguni Maitake has an ad that tells people not to buy its products. This odd approach gets people curious and they end up buying anyway. So, some ads don't just talk about how good the products are. Still, some people think ads should always make products appealing.

We will use electricity instead. This means the air will be cleaner, and there will be less global warming. Because of this, groups that care about the environment will be okay with people driving. Second, I don't agree because driving a car makes you feel relaxed, safe, and warm. You can go anywhere with your family. You have your own space, which you can't get on a bus or train. You also don't have to deal with other people when you're going somewhere. This is very important for people with families or kids. Third, I don't agree because cars can show off your success. For example, if you drive a fancy car to the store, people will think you have a lot of money. Also, when you see old friends, you can show them you've changed.

In science, students must always think hard and learn to think in a smart way. Take a lawyer, for example. It is better for them to learn how to think clearly than to just know the laws. Laws can change quickly, and a lawyer who only knows the old laws won't be helpful anymore. They would have to go back to school to learn the new laws. Luckily, law schools teach students to think clearly. This way, even if laws change, a lawyer can still do their job. But to do well in any job, you need to keep up with new technology and research. For a historian, learning facts is a must. But this is not the same for a doctor. We need to keep making things better to grow with society. That's why universities have research departments. Without research, many areas would not get better. Students do research to understand new ideas and concepts. If they only knew facts, they couldn't come up with new ideas. Look at how much better phones and the internet are now. This is because students understood the ideas behind them and made them better and cheaper to use.

I will talk about teenagers first and then adults before I make a final point. Teenagers love their lives because they are full of energy. They can party and have fun a lot. They enjoy life more than older people because they don't have as many things to worry about. Their parents help them with money and advice, so they don't need to work or deal with big problems. They also like life more because they can try new things and go to new places. Trying something for the first time is usually exciting, so they have an edge there. Adults have their own reasons to enjoy life a lot. If you have been friendly and fun, you might have more friends than younger people because you've known more people. As an adult, you have more freedom than young people. You can do things they can't, like go on trips without asking anyone or make big life choices. I think the statement is true because, even though young people can't do everything, what they can do is more fun and thrilling.

But cars are not the only business he's in.\n\nTata has started other businesses too, like tea, salt, computers, and phone services. He's everywhere and doing well in all these areas. Now, he wants to buy the well-known brand 'Jaguar.' Tata took big risks when he entered each new market. But you have to take big risks to get big rewards. A person with a clear goal can take these risks and do well. These are signs of a successful person.\n\nIf Tata had only cared about making trucks, he wouldn't have made such a big mark in other areas of business. He tried new things, and it worked out for him. His success is because of how he took on new chances in business.\n\nSo, we can say that a person who only does what they already know will probably not do as well as someone who tries different things and takes smart risks for the chance of bigger success."}
{"file_id": "1159224.txt", "output_essay": "In today's tough business world, ads are key in helping sell more of a product. There are many different products out there. Lots of companies make similar things. So, people have many options to choose from. Often, the differences between these similar items are small. Ads make these small differences seem bigger. Look at cars, for example. One car company might say their car is as roomy as a living room. Another might say their car looks like a spaceship because of its design. Both companies use these points to sell their cars. But sometimes, what you see isn't what you get. Many times, ads trick people into buying things that look great but aren't. People write about these tricks in newspapers a lot. Let's talk about buying a home. A friend of mine wanted a new place to live. He looked at many ads and unfinished buildings. He chose based on the ads. The ad for the home he picked talked about big rooms and extras like a gym and a playground. But when he moved in, he found big rooms with bad plumbing, no gym, and a sauna that didn't work. The ad made it seem perfect, but it wasn't. This happens with many products. Ad people are paid to make things look great, even if they're not. For example, an ad showed famous athletes using a razor. But one buyer got skin problems from it, a newspaper said. Still, the ad helped the company sell the razor and make money. There are many stories like this. Ads often make things look way better than they really are, and I think this is true."}
{"file_id": "1172884.txt", "output_essay": "This essay talks about products and ads. Do ads often make products look better than they are in reality? First, let's think about ads and what they aim to do. Today, ads are everywhere to help sell products. You see them on TV and in newspapers. Ads are a key part of marketing. They let people know about new products. The main goal is to get new people to buy the product. The buyer should feel good about the product and want to buy it. As I said earlier, the buyer should get a good feeling from the product. To do this, the ad will only show the good things about the product. But, some ads might not be honest about what's good or bad about a product. I believe these are just a few bad examples. Another point is that ad creators can't lie about the product. If they did, people would find out after they bought it. Then, they wouldn't buy anything from that company again. Companies want to make buyers happy. They wouldn't do this with ads that lie. As I said before, I think ads focus on the best parts of a product and leave out the bad parts. But, I don't think ads generally make products look better than they really are."}

If we follow a guide's plan, it feels like work. Traveling alone or with friends lets us choose where to go and what to eat. We can laugh and have fun without worrying about being too loud. Also, we can stay as long as we want at places we like. If we're tired, we can rest or grab a drink at a cafe. No one tells us what to do. Some say a guide can teach you a lot. But I don't need to learn everything from a guide. It's better to learn by doing things ourselves. We find out more when we try things on our own. Traveling on your own or with friends is better. It makes the trip memorable and strengthens friendships. I'm not saying group tours are bad. I just prefer my way. Group travel can be exhausting. So, I don't think it's the best way to travel. Have fun on your trips."}

We usually think about our own goals, while people in the past thought about the community. There are many reasons for this change, but I believe the main one is our new lifestyle. Our lifestyle makes us focus on our own things instead of what's happening in the world. We worry about how we look, what we get, and what we can do. We have to. But we should try to change. We need to see what's going on around us and help out. Still, I don't think young people are selfish on purpose. They just don't know what's happening. \n\nFirst, our lifestyle has changed. We live in comfort. Our parents give us what we need. It looks like our community is rich and everyone can do well if they work hard. So, we focus on ourselves, not the community. We complain and want things we don't need. We try to be perfect, not just good. We worry about these things to fit into this 'perfect' community. \n\nBecause we're so focused on ourselves, we don't see our community's problems. We don't know about them. \n\nEven if we don't know about these problems, we can't just ignore them. We need to see what's really happening. We should do more for our community.

It might be true that going on a group tour is an easy way to see places because a tour guide knows a lot and you don't waste time with a good plan. But, I believe that traveling on your own is more fun than being in a group, and I have three reasons for this thought. First, when you travel alone, you can go anywhere at any time. For instance, if you visit a popular spot with a group and like it, you must hurry and can't really enjoy it because there's not enough time. Next, you can meet people who live there. On a group tour, these people don't pay much attention to you because you have friends with you, and they don't think you're special. But if you're alone, they might notice you and talk to you or be kind. They also know the best places to visit, better than guides or books. Plus, you can learn about the local ways and things that books don't tell you. Finally, you can be on your own. Traveling by yourself isn't always just fun. There are dangers. But, you can learn how to keep yourself safe. What you learn from these risky times can help you later in life."}

Still, I must say that the quote in the left side of this window needs to be checked. We can't make broad statements because we only speak from what we know. With this key idea, I can say that I don't fully agree with the quote. Some young people spend a lot of time helping their community. Others don't want to get involved. I believe that the value of a 'job' (not just one that makes money, but any task done for some reason) changes based on where it's done and the society around it. Young people have different goals, but they might still help their community without knowing it. No one can be sure if one person helps the community more than another. We must look at each case on its own. From what I've seen in my family, the old reasons for helping others, like caring for the sick or elderly, are less common now. In the past, people thought about helping others first. We call this 'altruism'. But today, people often act out of self-interest. I'm not saying this is always bad. Self-interest can be a problem because it makes us do things only for a return, not because it's the right thing. This happens everywhere: at work, in school, and in sports (I'm from Italy). To end, I'll say this: no matter your job or where you work, no matter what others say or think about you, keep doing what you've always done. This way, you'll help your community as much as possible."}
{"file_id": "1175488.txt", "output_essay": "I think that people who take chances do better and are smarter. This is because life is about taking chances. This is very true now when everyone is trying to win. Let's say a college admissions officer looks at an application. If the student has only done the basic requirements, the officer will not be happy. But if the student has done something new, the officer will be impressed and might give them a chance. If you know how to do an experiment, you should try to change it. Take a chance and do something very different. Also, imagine you want to open a restaurant. You want it to be the most popular. You might think about using the name of a famous chain. But you could also pick a new name. If your restaurant does well, you will be happy with your new idea. If it doesn't do well, you will still be happy because you tried your own idea. This is what makes you stand out. Being original and willing to take chances leads to success. Knowing how to do something is the first step. The next step is to make it your own and be happy with the outcome, whether it's good or bad. I survived brain cancer and learned that taking chances is the best way to live. I took chances in the hospital, and now I am doing well."}

Growing up is always hard. Teenagers are busy figuring out their own lives. They might be the only group we shouldn't criticize for thinking about themselves. Even when people get into their twenties, many don't care about others. This is true for all ages. It's easy to point fingers at the young, but older people often ignore problems too. Still, this doesn't mean young people don't care. If all ages don't help enough, young people are part of that. But I believe they are usually the ones who want to help the most, especially after their teen years. Young people are often more open to new ideas than older people. Now, let's talk about 'nowadays.' In the past, families might have been closer and helped each other more. But community isn't just family. It's also about helping people who are different from us. Helping strangers in the street was rarer in the past than it is today. And while many charity groups have older volunteers, this doesn't mean young people don't want to help. They often lead the way in wanting to make changes. I agree that not enough people help their communities. But we can't blame just the young people today. It's a problem that has always been there."}
{"file_id": "1167441.txt", "output_essay": "The clear phrase, \"On the move,\" was likely chosen after careful thought. Studies show that from early times, humans have always traveled. We see this in how nomads live and how some farmers move to find new land to farm. But, I'm not here to talk about history. I want to start a discussion on whether we will see fewer cars in the next twenty years. I think we will have more cars, not fewer. Here are my reasons for this belief.\n\nSince the invention of the wheel, the number of cars has grown a lot. It's hard to think this growth will stop. First, reports say that people will live better in the future, which means they will have more free time. With more free time, people will want to travel with their families and go on trips. Cars make it easy to travel to places that are far away.\n\nEven if we only think about wealthy people, there's another reason to expect more cars. Science and technology are always working to make things better, including cars. A lot of money is being spent to create cars that run on solar power and use less fuel. This money is not being spent for nothing. It shows that people plan to have more cars later on.\n\nFinally, as people earn more, they tend to buy more personal things instead of using shared services. Let's take the middle-income group as an example. When these people earn more, they often prefer to buy their own things. If someone has the money, they will likely want to buy their own car. With economic growth around the world, more people will want to have their own cars instead of using buses or trains.\n\nSo, I think we will definitely have more cars in the future."}
{"file_id": "1170027.txt", "output_essay": "I believe that success comes in many forms, not just from taking risks. In the next few paragraphs, I will talk about different ideas to show why I think this way.\n\nFirst, success means different things to different people. For some, it means having a lot of money and a private jet. For others, it means running a small business that supports their family and gives them a good life. Not everyone wants the same things. Some people are happy with a simple, quiet life. Taking a risk can help, but it's not always the answer.\n\nAlso, success is hard to get. It needs many skills. You need to work hard, be dedicated, be ready, and be smart. People usually don't find success by chance. It can take many years, and even then, it might not be enough. Having all these skills doesn't mean you will definitely be rich. Many people work hard their whole lives and still don't get to where they want to be.\n\nAnother point is that success can come from doing what you know best. Working hard in your area and making wise decisions can lead to success. For example, someone who studied economics and works at the NYSE can make a lot of money. They can use what they learned in school to make good choices in the stock market. But they can also lose everything. It's not just about taking risks, but about making good decisions.\n\nIn conclusion, I want to say that although some people have succeeded by taking risks, many have not. Success is not guaranteed, and it might not last. When you reach the top, the only other direction is down. It's hard to get to the top and even harder to stay there. So, I don't agree with the original statement. The only sure things in life are death and taxes."}

I believe you can know a fact without understanding the ideas and concepts about it.

Also, people have their own views on various topics. So, you can't explain or describe something in just one way; everyone has their own thoughts.\n\nSometimes, people can twist ideas to make their own seem better. But a fact can't be twisted; it is the same for everyone. Proof shows that a fact can't be changed.\n\nA fact can be fun, scary, or interesting. It can make you feel something, which makes it easier to remember than an idea. When students learn facts, they can link them to ideas and concepts they already know. For example, I think learning facts is key when studying history. When kids learn about Nazism and the Holocaust, they won't get what these terms mean if they don't know what happened. They need to know the facts first!\n\nThis is true for other subjects like biology too. Ideas and concepts only come after a fact is seen! You must know the facts before you can understand the concepts. Ideas need facts to stand on. The best and most effective way to learn is to start with facts."}

Even if you like your job or where you live, you can get better and happier by trying new things.\n\nGoing to a new country, studying in a different place, or learning a new language expands your view. It lets you see new things and chances you wouldn't have otherwise. Living in another country doesn't just teach you new things; it also teaches you about your own country or background.

Often, people think the other age group has more fun than their own. So, everyone's thoughts, whether they are young or old, might not be fair. I'm trying to avoid being influenced by what most people think. I believe that most people in our society are happy with their lives, but maybe older people are happier. Some might say that young people are lazy and just want to have fun. But I think this is because they are younger and have more energy. I am sure that the little time young people spend having fun is not the same as the long hours older people spend watching TV, playing cards, or chatting in clubs. Sure, some older people use their time well by working, taking care of their yards, or joining sports clubs. And some are sick and can't do what they want. But overall, I'm talking about the average older person. Young people do a lot more, both in having fun and working, than older people. I don't know any young person who thinks life is just about having fun. They all work hard and study in schools, colleges, or learn a trade. They want to find good jobs and make money to support a family. With so many people out of work today, young people have to do even better to not be without a job. This is different from the past when it was easier to find jobs and factories needed workers. Now, workers need to be well-trained and skilled. Older people are now enjoying their later years with enough money. When today's young people get old, things will probably be harder for them."}

Like this, many items look better in ads than they do for real. So, I think that most ads make items look better than they are. This is not good. The items are not as nice as the ads show, and this can lead to wasting money.\n\nFirst, the item you saw on TV or online and bought because it looked really good isn't that great. For example, a friend of mine bought an MP3 player that was on TV. In the ad, the MP3 player looked cool and the sound seemed very good. But when he got it, it wasn't as cool as on TV, and the sound wasn't good at all. He wished he hadn't bought it.\n\nSecond, when you buy items that looked good on TV without checking more about them, you waste money. Often, when you watch TV, you see many movie ads. They make the movie seem great. So, when you go watch that movie, you might not like it. One time, I saw 'National Treasure' on TV, and it seemed exciting. I went to watch it with friends. It was really dull, and I even fell asleep for a bit. The ad was full of action, but the real movie had few action parts, and I didn't like the story.\n\nI don't think all ads make items look better than they are, but most do.

{"file_id": "1147775.txt", "output_essay": "Imagine a world with not as many cars! It may sound silly now, but I believe this will happen in twenty years. I think this for several reasons. These are more people living on Earth, not enough fuel, and people caring more about the environment. \n\nEvery day, more people are born. You might think this means more cars on the streets. But we forget that we don't have more land for these people. Soon, we won't have space for all the cars. So, we will need to use things like trains and buses more. This is already happening in Delhi, the capital of India. They built a big train system called the Delhi Metro Rail to help with too many cars. Now, fewer cars are on the streets because it's easier and cheaper to take the train to work than to have a car. \n\nAnother reason for fewer cars could be not having enough fuel. We are really running out of oil. It's getting hard to meet the world's need for energy. Oil prices will go up a lot soon. We can see this starting to happen. Driving a car could get very expensive. We're still figuring out how to use other types of fuel, like from plants or the sun. So, it will be hard for regular people to afford gas for their cars. In India, gas prices keep going up. My family only uses the car when we really need to or if all four of us go somewhere together. Otherwise, we ride bikes or take the bus or train. \n\nThe last reason I think cars will become less common is that people don't like pollution. Cars make the air dirty. So, some places, like countries in the Nordic region, tell people to ride bikes. Bikes don't pollute and they help you stay healthy. More and more people like this idea. This makes me think it will get very popular. If that happens, not many people will want cars. \n\nIn summary, I believe cars will be less common in the future for a few reasons. We will run out of land and oil because there are more and more people. Cars won't work well then. Also, when people want to protect the environment, they will choose other ways to travel. This means cars won't be as important."}
{"file_id": "1176184.txt", "output_essay": "Taking risks and trying new things both make us feel scared. They are not as easy as doing the same things over and over. But I believe they are needed to do well in life. Taking a risk can be scary, that's true. But if you don't take risks, you will miss chances to make your life better. Every choice in life comes with some risk. If you can't take risks, you can't make tough choices. This will lead to expected outcomes. Also, in some cases, taking a risk can be the difference between someone who is okay with what they have and someone who is truly happy. For example, think about a student who just finished school and gets a great job offer in another country. Should he stay or should he go? I think he should go. If he doesn't, he might regret it forever. In some areas, like research, trying new things is very important. Researchers need to question what we know and try different things to find new answers. Without new discoveries, the world wouldn't move forward. I can't think of a researcher who doesn't want to try new things. So, I believe that people who do well are the ones who are not scared to take risks. People who only do what they are good at will miss out on chances. That's because change is really a chance."}
{"file_id": "1159884.txt", "output_essay": "The topic of whether young people today spend enough time helping their communities is one that people have argued about a lot in recent years. I don't think the claim is true because I believe young people do help their communities. This topic keeps coming up because people judge young people's actions without really knowing what they go through and how their lives have changed over time. First, I've seen that it takes many good actions to get praise and just one bad action to get blamed. Often, the behavior of one person is seen as the behavior of all young people, even when we don't know what the others are like. A few bad cases have made people think that young people today don't care. Second, young people's lives have changed a lot. The world is much more competitive now than it was ten years ago. School and work ask for a lot more from them. Time is precious, and young people are busier every day. I don't think everyone fully understands this. Still, young people do what they can to help their communities. For example, when someone dies, everyone helps the grieving family. If you look closely, it's often the young people who are busy helping. Also, many young people spend most of their time working for their communities. Many are part of or lead groups that work on big issues like education or making sure people have enough food and a place to live. They give all their time and effort to improve their communities. In conclusion, people may never fully agree on this topic, but I strongly believe that young people are doing their share. I think we just need to pay attention and look at the whole situation. I believe that, like me, you might find that the facts don't support the claim either."}

Today, we make cars very fast, and the government is trying hard to give us good public transport. Soon, there won't be enough room for all the cars. More people mean more drivers, which leads to full roads, even if they are very tall. Countries don't have endless space, so they must cut down on cars to avoid traffic jams and pollution. In Malaysia, where I live, the government wants fewer cars on the roads. They put high taxes on cars to make people use other ways to travel. But this didn't work well. So, they are trying to have fewer new drivers by making them wait until they are older before they can drive. Another smart step is to make public transport better. This is the best way to stop too many cars in the future. Trains are a great example. They are easy to get to, cheap, and can carry many people. This is what many countries want to do. Japan's bullet train is a great example of this. I saw in Australia that they don't have many cars on the roads. This made me think that Malaysia should be like that.

My own trips have shown me that going alone lets us learn more about the place, spend more time in new spots, and talk more with local people. For example, I went to Cambodia with a group last winter. I didn't study much before because I thought the guide would tell me everything. And the guide did give a lot of details at the ancient sites, so I didn't learn anything extra. But when I went to Europe alone this winter, I had to learn about the places myself since there was no guide. This made me more responsible for my own learning. This isn't just about me. With a tour group, we must stick to the company's plan. We can't just explore on our own. But alone, we can go wherever we want, like local markets or just walking on the streets. This way, we see how local people live and their culture. Also, with a guide, we're too busy to really talk to local people. We just see famous places and take photos. Alone, we can make friends with locals. Even if we don't speak the same language, we can still learn about their way of life. Sure, group travel has some good points. We don't have to make all the plans, and the guide can teach us things. But the trips I remember most are the ones I took alone.

Some think we will use more cars because they see cars as very important and without bad effects. But I believe we will use cars less for a few reasons. First, we are running out of oil and gas because we didn't plan well when taking them from the earth. This means we might have many cars but no fuel to drive them. So, we have to look for other ways to get around or find different things to use instead of oil. I think it's better to look for new ways to move than to just find more oil. Second, cars pollute the air. They make CO2 and NOx, which make the Earth warmer. This causes the sea to rise. Our land could end up underwater. If we can't grow food or have a place to live, that's a big problem. That's why many people are trying to find new ways to travel that don't dirty the air. Third, cars are not always easy to use. They often break down and can't go across oceans. We live in a world where countries are connected. To make a country stronger, we need to be able to trade easily with others. This means using ships and planes that can go over oceans. Because of these points, I'm sure we will see fewer cars in the future. They pollute the air and we are slowly running out of oil."}

Some might think this is true because you're not alone on a group tour, and a guide shows you the best places to visit. But I think traveling alone is the best way to go. It's much more comfortable. Plus, I can do what I want without following rules.\n\nFirst, traveling by myself makes me feel very comfortable. Group tours can be loud and confusing. Traveling alone is quiet, peaceful, and relaxing. For example, when I went to Japan with a group, there were 15 of us. Every time we went somewhere new, I had to wait for everyone to be ready. This waiting made me upset. I think if I had gone to Japan by myself, I would have enjoyed it more.\n\nAlso, going places alone is a good chance to become more independent and strong. When you travel alone, there are no rules, so you can do what you like. You have to make your own plans and choose what to eat and where to stay. Making these choices teaches you things you can't learn from books. Like when I was older, I planned a 4-week trip to America. I booked flights, restaurants, and hotels. It was tough at the time.

After looking at the good and bad points, I believe it's better to go with a tour guide. I will talk about this and give some clear examples.\n\nFirst, a tour guide helps you save a lot of time. Imagine walking in a great city. You see beautiful sights, a lovely lake, and nice weather. You walk all day without stopping. At the end, you are too tired to walk. You only see the city's nature. The city is big, and you are just one person. You can't see every part of it. You don't know the famous spots, the shortcuts, or which bus to take. But with a tour guide, it's easy. They take you to interesting places, some well-known and some hidden spots you wouldn't find alone. They tell you how to get there and which bus to take. It's nice to just enjoy without worrying.\n\nSecond, it saves money. Tour guides often get discounts at hotels. They can book rooms cheaper. They also give you coupons when you shop.\n\nThird, it's more efficient. With a guide, you see more places. When you land at the airport, a bus is there for you. At a restaurant, your food is ready. When it's time to go, someone tells you.\n\nFinally, you can share stories with others in your group. It's easy to find someone to take your photo. In the end, traveling with a tour guide saves time and money. It also makes things run smoothly."}
{"file_id": "1174410.txt", "output_essay": "The word 'Successful' means reaching goals and dreams. But to reach a goal, you must take a risk and try new things. This is why people who succeed like to take risks. They grab chances and use them fully. This is how they get ahead. With risk comes a goal. So, when they see their goal, they only think about it. They don't look away. They focus on what they want. That's how they succeed. These days, people who succeed take risks and try new things. They grab chances. These chances make them try new things and learn. They don't just do what they are good at. They look for new skills they don't know they have. Look at Bill Gates. He took a risk one day. He grabbed a new chance and tried something new. Back then, when there was no Microsoft, people might have thought he was crazy. But that choice made him what he is today. Bill Gates is successful now because he took a chance no one else did. I think 'Successful people try new things and take risks instead of just doing what they know well' is true. We need to explore new things to see if we are good at them. Many people have succeeded by taking risks. This means we can too. We just need to decide to do it and then do it. We must keep our minds and eyes on the goal we want to reach."}
{"file_id": "1165367.txt", "output_essay": "I agree that ads often make things look better than they are. Now, getting money is easy because of new technology and money markets. This means many businesses are growing. There are lots of companies making the same things. They know it's hard to make new things all the time. But they've found a way to sell the same things in new ways: ads! They can't really make their products stand out. Let's look at a car ad for the Hyundai Santro. They use Shahrukh Khan, a famous actor, to promote it in India. The ad shows him driving with his famous girlfriend. But everyone knows he really uses a BMW for his kids and only drove the Santro for the ad. Still, people buy the car thinking it must be good if he uses it. I have one and it's good, but not because of the ad. The ad suggests that the car can help you get a pretty girlfriend, which isn't true. Now, let's talk about a Bournvita ad. It's a drink for kids. The ad says it helps kids grow faster and healthier. If that were true, the maker would be the richest person in the world. I believe what they say about what's in the drink, like calories and protein. But I don't believe it makes kids taller. Another example is a phone company ad. They say their service is great and easy for customers. I believed it and got their service. But when I had a problem, I had to wait a long time at their store. After arguing, I decided not to trust ads anymore. I think companies will always find new ways to sell things. Ads are one way. You shouldn't believe everything you see on TV. Things are never as simple as they look."}
{"file_id": "1175182.txt", "output_essay": "I don't agree that young people today don't spend enough time helping their communities. In many groups and charities, there are lots of young people working to help others. Many schools also make students help out in their community. Sometimes, helping out is a way for us to relax. We do want to be a part of our communities. \n\nMost schools in the United States make students do community service. They have to do a number of hours whether they want to or not. By helping out, students support their communities because they need to finish their service hours to pass their class. Some schools give awards to those who do more than they have to. We try harder and do more for the community to get these awards. Even if some students don't want to do the service, they still spend a lot of time helping because they must. \n\nMany young people help out in their communities to take a break and get away from schoolwork. Often, students like me are tired of studying and want to relax. I've found that helping others lets me take a break and forget about my studies. At the same time, I'm using my free time to support my community and those who need help. It's good for both my community and me. \n\nIn the end, young people today do help their communities enough in many ways. Whether we do it because our school says so or to take a break from studying, we are spending time and effort on our communities and getting involved."}
{"file_id": "1175383.txt", "output_essay": "People often argue about whether young people have more fun than older people. Some say that young people have more friends and are more active. But others believe that older people are happier because they have more family members to share good and bad times with. They also have many activities they can join. I believe that both young and old people enjoy life. Young people in school have lots of time. They can play, talk, and learn with friends. School is a great place for them to have fun. When young people face problems, many people are ready to help. Parents, teachers, and bosses can help them. With this help, young people can handle problems well. This makes their lives more enjoyable. Also, young people have the energy to do what they want. They can try new things like computers and video games. Older people have fun too. Thanks to better science and technology, they live longer and healthier lives. They can spend great times with their kids and grandkids. These family members often make life fun and interesting. Older people can also join many community activities. They can sing, dance, and do what they like. It's hard to say who enjoys life more. In short, I think both young and old people are finding more ways to enjoy life."}
{"file_id": "1165229.txt", "output_essay": "I believe the best way to travel is by yourself, not with a group and a tour guide. In my country, many travel agencies offer trips to other countries. But you should travel alone. A guide often does not give you much time. Traveling alone lets you choose when and where to go. You can also find out about the places you visit on your own.\n\nFrom what I've seen, a tour guide does not let you spend enough time at a place. For example, I visited the Northeastern United States and went to New York. Broadway was incredible with its musical posters and shops. But the guide only gave me one hour. I wanted to shop and watch a musical, but I only had time for photos and to buy a souvenir. When you travel, you should have the freedom to stay longer and do what you like, like watching a show, drinking coffee, or shopping.\n\nIf you travel alone or with friends or family, you can do things on your own time and pick where to go. In Cuba, I planned to go to the beach, but it rained. So I stayed inside instead. That evening, I had dinner on the beach when it was cool. With a tour guide, you can't change plans. You might have to go to the beach in the rain or visit places you don't like and spend hours on a bus.\n\nPeople use tour guides because they don't know the place. But now, with the internet and many books, you can learn about places on your own. You can find maps, scenic spots, and good food. Then, you can decide where to go by yourself. My parents went to Italy with just a book and had a great time without any trouble.\n\nSo, it's fun and smart to travel alone or with your own group. Being able to do what you want, when you want, is very important when traveling."}
{"file_id": "1164235.txt", "output_essay": "Traveling is now a part of our daily lives, like eating, drinking, and working out. But why do so many people travel these days? One reason is to learn about different cultures and ways of life. They want to meet new people from various places or religions to share ideas and thoughts, or just to take a break, which we call a 'vacation'.\n\nWhen we decide to travel, we often need someone to show us around. If not, we might get lost or tricked. It can also be exhausting and pointless because everything is unfamiliar. We need time to get used to the new place. We can either use travel books and maps or hire a tour guide. Which is better?\n\nI think a tour guide is important. A guide can take us to the best or famous places easily. We don't have to rent a car or find taxis to go somewhere new. A guide knows his country well and can tell us extra things that books might not have. We can also ask a guide any questions we have. With a book, we might not be as happy with what we learn, and it doesn't give as much information as a guide does. Another point is that people like to travel in groups to have fun and make memories of their trip.\n\nFrom what I've seen, I would say the best way to travel is in groups with a tour guide."}
{"file_id": "1168591.txt", "output_essay": "I agree that successful people try new things and take risks instead of just doing what they know. When we look at successful people in business, entertainment, sports, or politics, they all share one thing: they take smart risks and always try to do better in what they know. People usually don't like change and prefer to stay in their 'comfort zone.' Most people keep doing what they are good at because change can be hard. Trying new things seems too risky and can upset a stable life and job. But, over time, it's important to change, adapt, and try new things. This is because there are always others ready to do the same thing better, faster, or cheaper. To stay successful and not become outdated, you must accept change, try new things, and take smart risks. For example, traditional phone companies and media businesses haven't changed much in the last hundred years. They thought they would last forever doing the same things. But new technology and the internet have changed everything. Fewer people are reading newspapers. Most new phone lines are now 'wireless.' If old companies don't update their ways and take some risks, they will fail. Change and new ideas are happening faster than ever. Even internet and wireless phone companies must keep inventing and trying new things to stay important. Trying new things and taking risks is also key for progress. Imagine if Bill Gates or Michael Dell had stopped working in their garages or given up on their dreams, we might still be using the abacus. All successful businesses and ideas start with 'new ideas' and 'new concepts.' It takes brave and passionate people to take these risks and push what we know further. The rewards for taking risks are big, but you can't see them until you take the risk. In the end, being willing to risk and try new things are what make people successful."}
{"file_id": "1162960.txt", "output_essay": "I agree that successful people try new things and take risks instead of just doing what they know well. There is risk in many things people do. But this doesn't stop successful people. A smart person takes smart risks, and this can lead to success. Think about what would have happened if Bill Gates had not left school to follow his dream. We wouldn't have the Windows operating system! He took a big risk that could have destroyed his life, but he trusted his dream. Space missions are very risky. They can cost a lot of money and even lives. But some brave people have risked their lives for their dreams and to help us learn about space. Because of astronauts who went to space, even though they might not have come back, we know a lot about planets and space. If they hadn't done this, we would know nothing about the universe. Business is another area where there is a lot of risk. Nothing is sure in business. A business can lose a lot of money. But people still take risks to do well. The stock market is the same. The road to success in business has many dangers, and you have to avoid them to succeed. This is what many successful people do. In any area, many successful people have taken smart risks to get to where they are. The skilled cricket player Kevin Pietersen moved from South Africa to England to keep playing the sport he loves. He did this because of unfair treatment and politics in sports. If Kevin Pietersen had not taken the risk to leave South Africa, even though people told him he couldn't play for his country again, we would have missed a great player. The British government also gave him an honor. He is now called Kevin Pietersen MBE. The famous climber Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay climbed Mount Everest. This was very dangerous. They worked very hard and risked their lives to climb the highest mountain. Now they are famous in history. What they found out is very important for science. These examples show that success has a cost, and you need to take risks carefully."}
{"file_id": "1138106.txt", "output_essay": "Some people might think it's better to be really good at one thing than to be okay at many things. But I believe it's better to know a lot about many school subjects than to only know about one. Life is full of different things and topics. It's important for everyone to know at least a little about most, if not all, topics. Life has many different parts. I think it's important to know about many areas of life to keep up with our changing world. The world can change any time. It's hard to guess what will happen in business. A business area can fail suddenly, and all the companies in that area might shut down. So it's good to know about other areas, at least a little, so you can think about starting a new business if one fails. Another reason is for fun. If you know how to do different things besides your usual job, it can be a nice change. You can enjoy it and have a good time. When you talk to more people, it helps you make friends. We should try to keep everything in life balanced. For example, right now, computers and technology are popular. Many people only study computer science and forget about other things like nature, society, and money. But who will take care of nature and our country if no one knows even the basics about the environment? Everyone should know what's happening where they live, in their community, and in their country. You need to know about different things to do well in life. Every big business person in this country knows about different areas. Take the owner of McDonald's. He's not just in the restaurant business but also in property. He used his knowledge of selling and property to open lots of McDonald's in busy places all over the world. So, I think to be independent and do well in life, you need to know about many school subjects. I really agree with this idea."}
{"file_id": "1168162.txt", "output_essay": "America is seen as a great country because it gives regular people the chance to improve their lives by trying something new. This could be starting a business or bringing a big idea to life. This shows how important it is in our culture to try new things and take the risks that come with them.\n\nIf we were meant to live the same life, work the same job, and have the same experiences as those before us, we might still be living in caves. Human progress is closely tied to the new things some people found when they chose different paths. Take Christopher Columbus as an example; if he hadn't sailed across the ocean, risking his life, the Americas might not have been found.\n\nOf course, with trying new things comes risk. It's unusual to try something new without some kind of cost. This could be losing respect or the high standing one has had up to that point. For example, many people died in the past trying to make planes. But because they kept trying, we can now fly across the world in just hours. Those who made it are remembered as the first and builders of our modern world.\n\nFor me, the main point is to always weigh the benefits of new things or discoveries against the risks. Truly successful people always think about this balance. If not, the outcome could be very bad, maybe not right away but later on. Quick success without careful thought should be avoided just as much as being too scared to follow your dreams or new ideas."}
{"file_id": "1163243.txt", "output_essay": "Does success come to you, or do you go after it? Is it enough to just do what you're used to? Success often needs you to take a chance. When you look at successful people, you see a common thing: they are ready to try new ideas, go down new paths, and keep learning. They are not afraid to take chances, which helps things get better. If someone only does what they've always done, they won't see as much, and they won't be very successful. Many people get ahead not by doing the same thing over and over, but by changing how they work. This change can be risky. You could lose your job if you fail. You could lose a lot of money if you invest it. If you work with dangerous stuff, you could hurt yourself or even die. But we wouldn't have better planes, cars, or machines if people hadn't risked their lives to improve them. If no one had given Larry Page and Sergey Brin two million dollars in 1998, Google wouldn't have changed the internet. Now, that choice has paid off many times over. We need to take risks and be ready for new ideas to make them better, to test them, and to see if they're worth it. This helps us beat our competition. Nothing is sure, and we won't get anywhere if we just stick to what we know. Success and growth rarely come to us. We usually have to work hard for it, not sure if it will be worth it. Take stockbrokers, for example. Does the best broker always play it safe? Usually, the most money is made by taking chances on riskier stocks. And only those ready to take that chance will do well in the long run. Being ready for new things and willing to take chances will get you further than just doing the same old thing every day."}
{"file_id": "1172599.txt", "output_essay": "In this essay, I talk about if people who try new things and take more risks are more successful than those who stick to what is already known.\n\nFirst, I explain what success means, because people see success differently. Next, I talk about different views on this topic before sharing my own thoughts at the end.\n\nSuccess is usually a goal that society agrees on. Each group of people has their own idea of what goals are important. In Western countries, success might mean making a lot of money, having a family, or just being happy. I focus on the idea of making a lot of money as success.\n\nWhen looking at success in money, I compare new products to old ones. New products often come with more risks but can be more original than old products. Take franchising as an example. It's easy to buy the rights to a big company like Burger King and sell their products. But this doesn't let you create something new. Starting your own business costs a lot and it's not sure if people will like your product. But it lets you be creative and unique. Also, you can sell new, original products for more money.\n\nStill, you can make money with both new and old ways. Maybe this isn't just about success, but about how you make it.\n\nIn my final thoughts, I talk about the hope of success that makes people try new and creative things despite the risks. This hope might be just a dream, but it pushes scientists to discover new things and helps the world move forward. This is important for the world, but maybe not for making money quickly. With old ways, you can be successful too. And if you have a new product, a well-known name helps sell it better.\n\nSo, success comes from a mix of taking risks and trying new things, as well as using proven methods. This is true for people, businesses, and the whole world."}
{"file_id": "1149926.txt", "output_essay": "I think that people today don't spend enough time helping their communities. Communities can only grow when everyone works together to improve them. This might happen for many reasons.\n\nOne reason is that people are so busy these days that they barely have time for their communities. They are too caught up in other things to care about what's happening around them. They find it hard to make time for the community, much less help it.\n\nBecause their lives are so full, people would rather do fun things than go and help in the community. Helping is important, but no one should be forced to do it. People who don't volunteer don't understand what it's like; they think it's dull.\n\nAnother reason people don't help is that they are too busy. They work all week and want to rest on weekends. They see volunteering as another job and wonder if they should join in or just rest for the coming week.\n\nPeople also don't understand what 'helping their community' means. This lack of knowledge keeps them from getting involved. We should teach them how good it is for everyone when they help out. People care more about themselves and don't pay much attention to what's happening around them. For instance, some people don't even know what's happening in their own neighborhood because no one told them.\n\nIn conclusion, people are ignoring their duties to the community, which is like a big family. Helping out can make someone feel good because they've done something for others. So, people should try to find time to help in the community. This can make the community a better place to live."}
{"file_id": "1166282.txt", "output_essay": "Everyone wants to live well. We all want a big house, a nice car, and enough money for life. But getting this good life is hard. It needs success. Success comes from being open to new ideas, taking chances, and trying new things.\n\nThere are two types of people: those who succeed and those who don't. Successful people are open to new ideas. They are always ready to try new things and improve a plan, a project, or a topic. They also take chances to succeed. But some people avoid risks and new projects. They are scared of trying new things and stick to their own rules.\n\nLet's look at teachers and researchers in schools and institutes. You can see their success in how they act, talk, and smile. They are not scared of making mistakes. They think mistakes can help them succeed. But if people are scared of mistakes, risks, and only follow their rules, they won't succeed. For instance, if we look at a student who doesn't do well, we might see they study at random times they chose themselves.\n\nIn the end, successful people are not scared of mistakes. They are also ready to take risks. They are always looking to discover and improve things. But just doing what you want doesn't lead to success or the good life we dream of. If life is like stairs with beauty, comfort, and money at the top, successful people will climb easily. Others will not."}

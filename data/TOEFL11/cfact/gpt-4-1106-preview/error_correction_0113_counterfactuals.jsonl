Many products are usually advertised by famous people with a good image. If these products are shown to people repetitively, nobody would doubt the quality of them.\n\nSecond, almost all companies do not mention the side effects of their products.

The medical knowledge we have reached today is enormous. A medic cannot be experienced in all subjects of medicine. As such, their knowledge will be superficial and will have less benefit for their patients. That's why medics try to specialize in pediatrics, oncology, or cardiovascular surgery. As you further specialize in any subgroup, you should understand that subject more deeply.\n\nBut as stated in the first passage, a person can only do one job well; his habits also have supporting effects on his job. As a result, a person also needs habits that will support his job. Therefore, for this century, specialization is highly required for benefit."}

Lack of time is the first and most popular answer. Nowadays, youngsters are very busy: if the school doesn't give them enough homework, parents will find some extracurricular activities.

In every family with four people, there are at least two cars. This is a big problem for pollution and the environment. Cars are everywhere; we don't move without them, and we don't use public transports like buses or trains very much. Generally, people work in cities where there are lots of public transports, but they prefer to park near the office or the factory. It should be an idea to start going by buses or by trains, but there are other problems. If they want more people to catch trains, the trains must always be on time and cleaner. \n\nOn the other hand, I don't think that people will leave their car at home. A car is a status symbol. With a big car, you can show others that you have a lot of money and a good job. In addition, technology evolves, and this will permit the elimination of petrol and the use of other materials. So, pollution will be eliminated. \n\nIn conclusion, I hope that in twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today because I'd prefer to go by bicycle or by public transport, but I don't think that this will be possible, and maybe car use will be more than nowadays."}

Many professional soccer players, especially from Brazil, played soccer without reading textbooks in their childhood. They just played soccer for fun. Many of them didn't study the physics around the ball.\n\nThe other example is when you drive a car. In my case, I studied car engineering for one month and I thought I had enough knowledge of cars. However, when I drove a car for the first time, I couldn't drive it well.

As a young person, however, I strongly disagree with the statement on the left screen, and there are too many instances to support my view.\n\nFirstly, as we know, our society is becoming aged, and our welfare is becoming lighter. This gives rise to a new situation where many elders spend their leisure hours traveling. This is why the travel agency is one of the most lucrative industries in this era. For example, my parents usually spend 4 months in different cities.\n\nIn addition, many older people have less pressure from jobs than young people. Most of them have a fixed pension. They don't worry about their financial problems. This gives them a chance to enjoy life.\n\nMy uncle gets an incredible pension, and he doesn't save it. He usually spends so much on food and entertainment. Furthermore, our society needs youth to make progress. This can continue a great cycle. If we enjoy life, that means we don't want a comfortable life when we become old. Any developed country should have many ambitious youths to maintain its prosperity.

Consequently, companies use and benefit from this situation.\n\nYou can see many different actors, actresses, and singers as part of advertisements. I believe that if one loves Michael Jackson and saw him in Pepsi's advertisements, after this instance, Pepsi would strongly take its place in his or her mind.\n\nSecondly, advertisements introduce products without presenting their negative aspects. For instance, if you buy a microwave oven, you should not use it near babies or radiation-sensitive individuals. However, it is impossible to see any warning regarding microwave radiation in the advertisements.\n\nIn summary, advertisements are very powerful tools for affecting people's thoughts about a specific product.

In contrast, if students learn facts, they can acquire these qualities more easily.\n\nBesides, if students are going to be successful in today's society, merely understanding the ideas and concepts is not enough. Learning facts leads them to become successful individuals. For example, it is rare to find stimulating employment that does not require at least a basic knowledge of computers.

I think such a trip is far from enjoyment and relaxation. We need to think well about the true purpose of a trip. Traveling definitely is not about getting stressed.

Sometimes I think it is better to listen to our heart and to believe in ourselves, in our capacities, in our imagination, and ability to create because we can be able to succeed even if there are risks to take. Who knows? We may be able to do so many extraordinary things if only we were more brave! On the other hand, I think that a person who is always doing the same things at work all his life is not happy; it is such a boring routine to repeat the same tasks over and over. Why can't we just blow all these annoying jobs away and realize our dreams? We must not forget that we have just one life on this earth, so we must take the example of Bill Gates, who is very famous. Bill Gates, at the beginning of his career, took the risk to introduce a new concept of how to use computers to the PC market—a totally new project.

{"file_id": "105390.txt", "output_essay": "To try to give an answer to this important question, I would say that I don't really agree. In my mind, we have to keep facts in mind to improve and to understand concepts. For instance, when we make some mistakes, we always could and should learn from them. That's why I think that some facts are really important. Concerning Nazism, we can't ignore that it has existed, and this is because people made some great mistakes. They chose to put confidence in a leader who was a dictator, and it ended in a war that we could have avoided.\n\nNow that we know what that kind of ideology can lead to, we are aware that we better have to choose more wisely. But learning about some other facts is not always as important as it is in this case. Some facts are useless if we consider courses like philosophy. Some acts influence our lives and our behaviors, but some others are not interesting to develop conscience and awareness. But when we study this other point, it raises another issue which is directly linked to my first opinion: we have to learn facts to learn in general. How? Because everything that seems to mean nothing to you means more than you believe. Nevertheless, we can understand lots of things without having learned everything about the subject. We can know about World War II without being born and having lived during this war. You learn that there were millions of people who died for your freedom, but even if you didn't feel what it was to be afraid of bombs, you can understand what it is like.\n\nSo to conclude, I would like to underline that it doesn't matter how we improve things. The most important thing is to be interesting when you try to teach something to someone and to be curious when it is you who is learning. We learn from everything, but not only from facts."}

From my point of view, I disagree. I support traveling in a small group, alone, or just accompanied by my girlfriend.\n\nThere are several reasons to confirm my opinion. First, you are not dependent on a timetable the guide offers. I'd like to plan my traveling on my own. If you stay at a beautiful place, you can continue staying and not have to move forward with the group. Within a group, there are always different points of view; some would move faster, and some like to stay. You are not flexible. Furthermore, a guided tour is always more expensive than an independently organized tour. And anyway, with the new internet era and the research possibilities, you can find all relevant information on the internet or guidebooks like Lonely Planet, which also provides all necessary information about sights, cities, and historical background.\n\nBased on my own experiences, you meet a lot of different people from all over the world during the journey. This experience is sometimes more important than the sight itself. You can also get lots of information from other travelers.\n\nGuides usually visit the most famous places, and these places are most likely very crowded.\n\nIn a nutshell, I'd like to be more flexible and save money. You never know whether you will like a particular place or not, and to spend money to stay at a place I don't like, only because of a group's decision, this does not really sound like a holiday.\n\nPlanning the journey is also a very beautiful experience."}
{"file_id": "100336.txt", "output_essay": "Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. There are several reasons why this statement holds true. First of all, people who take risks are usually more adaptable to new situations and feel more secure out of their comfort zone. For example, when a student from another country decides to move to a new city with a completely different culture, he is allowing himself to experience new things, such as the music, the food, the architecture of that city. These factors not only enrich his life but also broaden his horizons and allow him to think outside of the box.\n\nAdditionally, when a person tries new things, they put themselves in a more vulnerable state, thus learning from their mistakes and helping them build a stronger, more resilient personality. For example, when a person knows that their options are limitless, and that even if they fail the first time, they are strong enough to try again, their chances for success increase.\n\nSuccess can be described in many different ways. Many people associate success with monetary compensation, others with personal satisfaction. Regardless of how success is considered, I believe that taking risks will directly improve your chances of being a successful person."}
{"file_id": "11566.txt", "output_essay": "The issue at hand is whether it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one subject. This is important because it makes us know what students are actually interested in. I prefer it is better to specialize in one subject rather than having broad knowledge of many academics.\n\nThe first reason to support my statement is that when we concentrate on many academic subjects, we cannot concentrate well on all of them. And we cannot do well in all the subjects. When you take one specific subject and specialize in it, you can concentrate well on the subject and can do justice to it. For this reason, I think my choice is superior.\n\nSecondly, specializing in a specific subject allows you to learn many new things without any difficulty, and you can focus more on a single point in a better way. By researching the subject, you can discover many new things in that field. For example, many great people, such as Einstein, devoted his entire life to a specific subject in which he was interested, and made many discoveries in that field, such as the mass-energy equivalence theorem, etc. Therefore, for this reason, I support that my choice is best.\n\nFinally, not all people would be interested or capable of learning all the academic subjects. For example, if someone is forced to learn a subject in which they do not have an interest, they cannot learn it properly. So, it is better to specialize in one subject in which one has an interest instead of learning all the subjects.\n\nSo, according to the above reasons mentioned, it is better for a student to specialize in one subject in which he is interested rather than learning all academic subjects."}

I believe that human civilization has reached the zenith of technology not because of learning the facts, but by understanding the ideas and concepts.\n\nThere have been advancements in many areas. If humans spent all their time on facts, our lives could have ended in understanding the history of our earlier generation. And we could not have seen the progress. There would have been no progress in science. So, applying the concepts to the facts will move the world to the next levels.\n\nI have always liked science, which made me a scientist, not because I know the facts, but because of the way I understand ideas and concepts. I am taking a mathematics class where I will use the concepts and ideas to generate a solution to the problem. If we use facts, there will be times when they will not help us find the solution.\n\nIn our daily life, we live with ideas and concepts. A very basic example: If my parents want me to go buy vegetables from the vegetable market, I will decide which way will be the easier road. I will analyze by asking myself using my concepts and not just go with the facts.\n\nOur human mind can take only so many facts, and then we have to use the concepts to work towards success. There are many facts in this world, and it is not within our human abilities to know all the facts. So, it is more important to know how to apply the concepts and ideas to deal with problems.\n\nOn the whole, I think that facts can only help to a certain level, but most importantly, it is the ideas and concepts that will help us in dealing with daily life, in our careers, and also at work."}

In this context, I can mention my own experience during my school time. I realized and understood math just because I really learned the different ways in which I could choose to come to a solution. It was sometimes definitely hard to understand. However, it led to a deeper understanding in this area. Another argument I can mention in this context is the history class I attended. History contains so many facts of the past which are not essential to become an educated student.\n\nWhile there are positive aspects to becoming aware of a good understanding of ideas, I feel that in some subjects it is not necessary to understand the whole background of the subject. Sport, for instance, is a very practical lesson and the history is not important.\n\nConsequently, my argument makes clear that it depends on the topic whether a teacher really should confront their students with all the information that is available or if they should better focus just on the important and significant ones."}

There are many influences on all people, including the young, that differ from the past.

Therefore, there was more social cohesion, and young people did their part for the community. Nowadays, the range of people one knows is spread over a much larger area, so that there is no longer the close relationship to people in your nearby community.\n\nThere are other factors that encourage young people to focus more on themselves than on others. In the whole society, there is the pressure of being successful in everything one does. Because these people need time to be successful, there is little or no time left to spend it on the community. Also, interest has shifted from caring about the community to caring about oneself. Mainly, people follow just their own business and do not care about others, whether they belong to the same community or not.\n\nAnother reason may be that life is more anonymous than it was in the past. People do not know each other, even if they live in the same building, they might not have met. If people do not know their community, why and how should they care about them?\n\nFinally, I would like to consider the point of responsibility for relatives and the financial aspect involved. In the past, families lived together much closer than they do today. People have a different view of being responsible. Today, they do not care as much about their relatives themselves; they would rather spend money for someone else to take care of the family member.\n\nThere are many influences today that differ from the past, which have changed the willingness of young people to help their communities."}

However, when I used this product, I saw that I lost my money because this product had a lower quality than my usual oil.\n\nTherefore, I think that there are famous companies, but this is not a guarantee of a good product. For example, a currently famous toy company had problems with its toys because the toys contained a dangerous chemical. This toy industry is famous around the world, but this does not completely guarantee the quality of the products.\n\nI agree with this idea: 'Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are' because the market is a war for consumers. So, the quality of the products is determined by the people. I think that specialization in the production of products helps people know which product is better than another because if the company only makes a special product, the products will be more technical and with a lower price than before.\n\nThere are products that are better than others just in appearance, but people should decide which product is better when they obtain it because it is better for their options in the market and for the habitual consumer; they have a social function too."}

I agree with the quote that says, 'Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well,' for many different reasons. A person who tries new things in his life will gain experience and knowledge. Taking risks and learning new things will develop a person emotionally and physically. It is a good thing for a person to be adventurous and go through different kinds of situations because it helps him learn new things and lessons in life. By learning these new lessons and by being more experienced, a person will suddenly see himself as optimistic and happy. His reason for living will increase because he will love life more and would like to do new stuff that will entertain and teach him. I think that a risk-taker is a very confident person who knows what he wants in life, and he is lucky to have this characteristic. It is a positive action that each person must choose to succeed in life, unlike the people that only do what they know. These people who are not risk-takers will eventually find themselves not capable of doing anything in life. They will regret not being risky and not doing and trying everything new in life and will hope and wish for time to go back and do whatever they did not do. The difference between these two kinds of people is that one is ready and willing to learn new things and lessons in life, while the other is being self-reliant, scared, and lazy, and he will not succeed in life as much as the confident, risk-taker. In conclusion, taking risks will never affect a person in a negative way. It will help a person to have great self-esteem, will make his confidence grow, and will make him successful in any situation he is going to face in life."}

As a result, they prefer to concentrate that little time left on their hobbies or some other personal activities rather than helping their communities.\n\nWith the advent of television and other media, which have revolutionized our lives, we are so much more concerned with what is happening around the world that we actually forget the problems immediately surrounding us. One of my neighbors is addicted to this one sitcom, which is played every night, that he actually leaves all his pending work and religiously watches the show. Such is the impact of television on today's generation.\n\nAlso, there is a growing trend among youngsters, especially among college-goers, that such activities are uncool and out of vogue. So, some students deliberately avoid helping a community even if it is against their conscience, just to show that they are cool. To be frank, I myself have witnessed this during my junior college years.\n\nThis kind of thinking, which is actually much more prevalent among youngsters in urban areas, needs radical change. It is really a shame that youngsters today consider such noble acts as cheap and uncool.\n\nBut there are some people in each community who, after all these things, dedicate some time to such work."}
{"file_id": "102872.txt", "output_essay": "I agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. When advertising, companies tend to make their products sound like they are the best by providing false information and exaggerated results.\n\nAn ad on TV may tell you things that you usually want in a product. This information may mislead you to build an idea about the product that usually turns out to be wrong. For example, when you watch television, you see a commercial about a certain type of cleaner. In the commercial, they say that this cleaner can make old things look new. You immediately think that this cleaner will help you make your old dress, made by your mother, look like a new Valentino. But instead, it shrinks your dress.\n\nOther commercials show what happened when other people—actors—used the product. For example, a company that sells a drug for weight loss will show images of people who used to be overweight, but now they are in good shape. Later, it turns out that these images were either taken of different people or were manipulated with computers.\n\nWhen companies try to make their products seem much better than they really are, they fool people into buying their products. People will see later that the product is not like what they expected. This will eventually lead the company to lose its credibility and honesty, which will lead to a financial nosedive in the future."}
{"file_id": "111601.txt", "output_essay": "During the last years, we have seen a significant difference in the lifestyles of all people. Many events have occurred during the 19th century, such as the world wars, the development of capitalism, and religious conflicts, among others. All of these have modified our society in France and in other countries. I will take, for example, the situation in France. What happened in May '68 contributed to changing people's minds. Before this period, young people were more obedient and structured, in my opinion. Moreover, I think that they were generally less individualistic than today. Capitalism has developed that feeling, and the consequence of all this is the fact that young people are obsessed with their individual success because times are increasingly difficult, and people know that it will certainly be more difficult in the future. So, young people are pressured, and they are aware that they have to succeed. They work harder at school, or they have two jobs, as I can see around me, and they have less time to do anything. To summarize, I think there are two principal causes: one, because young people are nowadays more individualistic and don't think about helping other people; two, because they have less time due to the new social model. However, we can see in a few situations that young people are able to help everyone who is in a difficult situation. For example, during the Tsunami, we saw a lot of young people giving donations to La Croix Rouge or other associations. Many of them have expressed the desire to go there to help those who were affected. In fact, we can see that these young people can help their communities when there is an accident. So we can say that it's occasional, and they can give the best of themselves at certain moments. But I think too that this type of population doesn't make enough effort to help other people who need their help."}

However, others may hold a negative opinion about it. As far as I am concerned, I do not agree that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.\n\nFirst of all, people will not study very well if they learn many academic subjects because they need to spare their time on so many subjects. We all know that the more time you spend doing one thing, the better, rather than less. The result of spending one hour studying is different from the result of spending eight hours studying. If you spend more time on one subject, you will know more about it. But if you spend time on so many subjects, you cannot deeply learn about them.\n\nSecondly, if you have one special skill, it is easier for you to find a future job because you have specialized knowledge in one specific subject. Many companies need people who have a special skill. For instance, in Canada, there is a lack of people who know how to build cable. If a person has that skill, he can easily find a job and get higher pay.\n\nHowever, people who have broad knowledge of many academic subjects can easily find jobs, such as in foreign companies, where they require people to speak two or three languages. They may be able to speak two or three languages, but they may not know how to write them.\n\nIt is better to specialize in one specific subject than to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects. People can learn very well in one subject rather than in many subjects."}

I am going to give some reasons to support my opinion.\n\nFirst, in the modern world, society is busy, and there are many things going on. I think young people are much busier than in olden times. Study is getting harder, and young people may need to spend more time on that because they want to get a better job and a better life in the future, which may give us a happy feeling. However, I believe they will forget about important things as they focus only on study.\n\nFor instance, friendship, helping people, caring for parents, and brothers and sisters. Volunteering is one good idea. They help people and they learn something from it at the same time. Therefore, they should make time to help their communities.\n\nSecond, I personally think it is such an excuse. Because actually, young people have time... even if they are studying very hard at that stage, they will have it. If this kind of young people continue to increase, I would be concerned about the future. Because helping society is needed for our life. It is essential to be familiar with the people and community.\n\nWe could find important things from there, and it will be useful for our future.\n\nStill, some may say young people do not care about this; I think they believe because it is only a short time that young people are enjoying their life. Nevertheless, I believe helping something is essential for us to live in this world, whatever that is.\n\nThus, students should make time to help their communities.\n\nIn conclusion, I would argue that it is better to give enough time to young people more often. Therefore, parents should care about their children seriously and tell them to make time to help communities. I hope the young people will think about this statement more carefully and wish luck to the future world."}

She speaks about the relationship between the community she lived in and herself. According to her story, the community provided a lot of festivals for local children and elderly people. For example, there was a cherry blossom festival in spring, fireworks in summer. They held a moon festival in fall and on New Year's Day, the shrine in the community made rice cakes with the local people. In every case, during these community events, the young local people would help to prepare and clean up afterward. Those experiences helped the young people to know the local people and to build up good relationships with others. Consequently, many young people wanted to help with holding events again, and through this, the cycle of creating opportunities and good relationships within the community was maintained. This is a story from when my mother was young.\n\nThen, what about today? Thinking back to when I was a little kid, I did not have such opportunities to join local events very often. This is because the place I live is somewhat old and there are not so many young people to help with those events. Also, I do not have many familiar people in my community; the relationship within our community is not as good as it was many years ago.\n\nAdditionally, when I was a junior high school student, I joined many kinds of volunteer works, but I did not have many opportunities to help my own community. As far as I remember, every time I did volunteer work, I went to another community which needed help. This means that nowadays, there are fewer opportunities for young people to serve their community. Another reason I think recent young people do not help the community is that there is no good relationship among the community members."}
{"file_id": "110394.txt", "output_essay": "Young people and older people are both vague terms which can be hard to discuss. Young people could vary by the perspective you have of them. Therefore, to make the argument clear, I will assume that young people are those in their teens, and older people are those fifty years old and above.\n\nIn order to establish the argument of whether young people enjoy life more than older people, first of all, I would like to compare the advantages and disadvantages of both the young and the old. One advantage of a young person is the lifetime they have left, which gives them more options for the future. On the other hand, older people have death approaching faster than those who are young, therefore having limited choices they can make. There is the difference of potential between the young and the old. Although it is arguable that the old have the same potential as the young, there is more time for the young to develop their potential.\n\nAnother advantage for young people is their physical ability. Although there are exceptions, young people tend to be more physically fit than those who are older. Also, young people have the physical potential which they can build up, whereas it is harder for older people to develop physical strength.\n\nOlder people definitely do hold an advantage which younger ones don't. From the experience and knowledge they have accumulated over the years, they are able to understand and take appropriate actions, whereas young ones are inexperienced, which may cause difficulties in life.\n\nA point where younger people experience great disadvantage is the restrictions set by law on certain activities for those underage. Examples include alcohol, driving, and other forms of entertainment that youth are prohibited from. Older people have the right to access all that is possible, whereas youth do not.\n\nWhether old people or young people enjoy life is completely up to the individuals. Both have advantages and disadvantages. If I were to express an opinion, it would be that young people enjoy life more, because I only have the view or taste of what it is to be young. Also, people have always been chasing ways to stay alive and young for a longer period of time. This idea supports my belief that young people enjoy life more."}

In this short essay, I will discuss with reasons and examples why traveling is best done within a group.\n\nFirst of all, we can make a lot of friends during the trip. When we are on an airplane, a train, a boat, or a bus, we can all communicate with each other and have fun. One of my best friends, whose name is Kim, I met for the first time on a bus during a group trip to Hangzhou. He just sat next to me, and we started to talk to each other; after all, we became the best of friends. So, traveling in a group can help you make friends.\n\nSecondly, it is well organized when traveling with a tour guide. He/She could lead you to the most popular and interesting places that tourists always like to visit. For example, if I go to a place by myself that I have never been to before, I will totally get lost and not know where to stay, where to go, or where to eat, and so on. But if I go there with a group and with a tour guide, things will totally change.\n\nLast but not least, we can have more fun by traveling in a group. For instance, if I go to a place individually, I will get bored on the airplane or train. On the other hand, it will be more interesting and fun by traveling in a group because sometimes we can talk about some funny stories or interesting personal experiences on the trip, so we would not get bored.\n\nIn conclusion, I have discussed the reasons and examples of why traveling is the best way in a group and by a tour guide. In my opinion, I would like to travel in a group because I can make new friends during the trip."}
{"file_id": "107269.txt", "output_essay": "It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. I agree with the statement for the following reasons: the importance of the capability to think logically, solve problems, and to create future visions. The stated reasons are described in more detail in the following paragraphs.\n\nFirst, a student needs to learn how to think logically in order to understand a problem that needs to be solved. Especially for study assignments as well as work assignments, it is important to determine what the unknown factor is that needs to be found. If the student is not able to do that, the result might not be the factor that was initially asked for.\n\nSecond, if a student just learns facts instead of strategies to solve a problem, the student will not be able to apply the already learned knowledge to a similar problem. For instance, the student knows how to calculate the revenue based on price per product times units sold, but as soon as the units sold are unknown and the given numbers are the price for each product and the total revenue, the student will not be able to solve for the units sold. In order to solve the outlined problem, it is important that the student learns the strategy to solve an equation for different unknowns.\n\nThird, only if a student understands the concept and idea of, for instance, a certain product like a car, will the student be able to create further developments of the already existing features. If the student only focuses on learning facts, the student will always limit his knowledge and learning to already existing ideas. Thus, the student will not be able to come up with future visions which are vital in someone's academic and professional career.\n\nIn conclusion, the ability of a student to think logically, solve problems, and to create future visions or developments of existing knowledge or facts is more important to me than learning the facts. It will enable the student to be successful in his or her study as well as professional career."}
{"file_id": "11644.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with this statement. Travel should be enjoyable and fun, allowing many people to interact during a tour group, not just with local civilians. On a group tour, there is a greater chance to talk to people than when traveling alone. First, a traveler will befriend the tour guide, which is the first opportunity. There are many advantages to traveling in a group led by a tour guide. First of all, travelers simply follow the tour guide. It is not necessary to make any tour plans or sightseeing schedules. Just listen and see what the tour guide explains at the sightseeing spot. Travelers can concentrate on whatever they want to see or learn. Secondly, traveling with a group led by a tour guide is safer. The tour guide has a responsibility to keep travelers safe, which means travelers do not go to any unsafe places. Even if travelers don't know whether a sightseeing place is safe or not, it is definitely safe during the tour. In case of traveling alone or without a local friend, nobody knows if travelers are in an unsafe place or not. It is dangerous. Thirdly, traveling with a group led by a tour guide is convenient. This means travelers don't waste time getting lost, nor do they waste money by being cheated. As I mentioned above, sightseeing places and time schedules are arranged by the tour guide. So travelers stick to the schedule, which means there is no way to waste time, and they can see anything they want, and go to safe places for shopping or meals, like in a shopping mall. There is no way for anyone to cheat them. These reasons apply not only to domestic travel but also to international travel. I recommend traveling with a group led by a tour guide, especially for international travel. Without a doubt, people in a foreign country speak a different language than travelers, and not every place is peaceful. These are the reasons why I agree with the statement."}

However, I have little belief in what the advertisements have told me. I think most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are!\n\nThe goal of advertisements determines their poor credibility. All the advertisements aim to attract as many customers as they can. And how can they achieve this? They provide misleading and incredible information about their products. For example, some health food will claim its body-building function in the advertisement. But few give any convincing statistical data or trustworthy surveys on how it affects people who have used it. We may see a set of comparisons between a fat girl and a thin girl. But how can we believe it's just the effect of the food? Since advertisements are used for commercial purposes, most of them will not provide scientific proof.\n\nAnother interesting phenomenon is that famous actresses and actors often appear on the screen to advertise a product. Of course, the actresses and actors are attractive and beautiful. With these kinds of advertisements, we associate the products with these beautiful images. But the truth is, how many celebrities really use the products they recommend? They are just invited to say a sentence, strike a pose, and so on. It misguides the consumer to some extent. Consumers will connect the products with the good images in their minds. Actually, the products are not as perfect as the advertisements say or the customers think.\n\nThe reason why there exists such a huge gap between the products in the advertisements and the facts is that there isn't an effective norm to regulate advertisements. No specific policy has been given to restrict the advertisements. In fact, exaggeration becomes one of the keywords in advertisements. I have already been disappointed to find a real product in any advertisement. Only when our government and media realize the importance of supplying the audience with unbiased and true facts instead of the beautiful lies in advertisements, can we choose products without doubt following the instruction of advertisements.\n\nSo, when you choose something to buy, do not trust what the advertisements tell you. Turn off the television when you see an unbelievable product in an advertisement again. A clever customer should try to evaluate and judge a product by themselves."}
{"file_id": "102535.txt", "output_essay": "In my opinion, specializing in one specific subject is better than having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects because of the nature of knowledge, such as its plentitude and complexity.\n\nSince the 17th century, many inventions have been made. The information used to create these inventions and the information provided by them is accumulating to such an extent that no one alone can know all of this information. For example, in a typical university, there are principal departments such as the natural science faculty, literature faculty, social science faculty, etc. All of these departments have subdepartments. In my university, for instance, business administration, economics, and international trade are subdepartments of the social sciences faculty. A person can only attend one of these subdepartments, making it impossible to complete all of these departments at the same time. Therefore, having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is not that feasible.\n\nAnother reason is the complexity of knowledge in any specific subject. When you want to cure an illness, for example, to cure AIDS, you should specialize in viruses, which are the cause of AIDS. Knowing many academic subjects such as optics, psychology, literature will not be of any use in curing AIDS. Since you can only learn by doing it, specializing is better.\n\nConsequently, specializing is better than having broad knowledge."}

To support my stance, there are three valid points. Firstly, with advancing technologies, newer and faster modes of transportation are emerging, such as metros, bullet trains, and intercity expresses, which make it very convenient for people to travel from one place to another and actually consume less amount of time compared to cars, which generally take more time because of traffic jams and the like. People would rather commute to far-off places in metros and trains and have already started using their cars as a mode of transportation to the nearest station if they have such an option.\n\nSecondly, with the advent of the internet and video telecommunication, most offices find it convenient for their staff to work from home, e.g., software firms, business offices, and corporations related to the trading of shares, etc. With this trend ongoing, it will take very few years for most people to be working from their homes. This will automatically reduce the usage of cars, as most people use their cars to go to their respective offices.\n\nFinally, the most important factor that will determine the reduction in the usage of cars is the scarcity of fuel. In today's world, the consumption of fuel is growing exponentially, and it seems there are no means to replenish it, even though various efforts are being made worldwide. With a limited amount of fuel supply, the world won't be able to sustain the demands of the market, and finally, to come up with a solution to reduce fuel consumption, people will be motivated not to use cars and other such vehicles. This will automatically lead to less usage of cars in the future years.\n\nIt might be hard to digest, but the way things are turning out, it seems we will soon reduce the usage of one of the most important inventions in human history. And it can be very well assumed that this time duration will be no more than twenty years."}

On the other hand, people with a passion will tend to specialize in a field that makes them happier and happier.\n\nA general education has many positive aspects, such as greater flexibility in changing preferences and visions for the future. This kind of preparation gives students with no clear ideas about the future the opportunity to postpone this important decision and take time to identify their main desire. Furthermore, a general education provides much more flexibility in adapting to different job conditions.\n\nA specific education focused only on one subject gives the student the advantage of being an expert in a field. This is a great advantage in the job market. At the same time, these students are usually much more rigid, unable to change and to cope with changes. These characteristics are not always required by employers.\n\nPersonally, I think that the best choice for a person would be a solution that takes into account both their own personality and inner desires; for this reason, I do not think there is only one best education.

There are several reasons for supporting this position.\n\nThe first reason is that young people have more ability than older people. They can do anything they want to do. Their power is stronger than that of older people. They hardly get tired. If they don't do the things they want to do while they are young, they can do nothing after getting old. This is especially true for sports like surfing, running, soccer, scuba diving, and so on. My hobby is traveling abroad. Taking planes is so tiring that I can't endure it for a long time. Last winter, I went to Orlando, Florida alone. I had to change planes twice. In total, it took thirty hours to get there!

But once older people make a mistake, even a small one, they can't start over. They don't have another chance. For example, if young people make a mistake and they quit their job, they are able to be hired by another company soon because they are young. But older people can't do so. Maybe they are not able to be hired by a company because of their age. 'Too much older!'\n\nFor these reasons, I agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do."}
{"file_id": "10535.txt", "output_essay": "In modern society, students always face the dilemma of which is more important between understanding ideas and learning facts. This problem is much debated as it affects everyone in their daily lives. Some people prefer the former to the latter, and others have no opinions about it. Before rendering my opinion, I think it is necessary to take a glance at the arguments from both sides.\n\nIt is quite easy for average people to choose learning facts because of several obvious reasons: learning facts is more interesting, easier, and so on. Although learning facts has some advantages, it also has many drawbacks, such as not understanding it deeply. Therefore, we have no complete evidence to suggest that learning facts is always better than understanding ideas. What is more, the innate quality of understanding ideas, unfortunately, is often underestimated; in other words, if you notice the invisible benefits of understanding ideas, you can understand them more deeply. Here, I want to explain a few of the most important reasons.\n\nThe ability to think is the first aspect of understanding ideas that people view profoundly. To illustrate this, there is an appropriate example that is very persuasive. My parents are professors, so they usually taught me systematically to understand ideas and put this at the forefront since I was a kid. As time went on, I gradually became a person with the ability to think. And this is very useful to me because this ability makes me more creative.\n\nBesides, the further reason why I advocate this is that it is widely acknowledged that interest is an indispensable part of the students' studying, and this issue is becoming a certain concern to many experts. To me, I think understanding ideas is more interesting than learning facts. They are more attractive and fascinating.\n\nFinally, I think understanding ideas is easier for students to grasp. Because facts could differ in many conditions and they might be influenced or changed due to other factors. In contrast, understanding ideas is more straightforward and is better for students who do not have good intelligence to learn.\n\nTaking all these factors into account, we may safely arrive at the conclusion that understanding ideas is more important for students, and it is more desirable for us to endeavor, and we also could derive a special fulfillment and pleasure."}

Today, we are in the space era thanks to those risky ideas and doings. When we think about human beings' first space travel, the possibility of returning alive was not much. Yet, the full risk gave its result so that new space stations could be established. There cannot be any scientists who could make his invention without trying risky experiments.

No one can predict whether or not his firm will make money. But there are many examples of businessmen who began the enterprise with bank credits or loans with higher interest rates, which means that they must earn at a higher rate. This is also risk-taking.

{"file_id": "112005.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with the statement that understanding ideas and concepts is more important for students than learning facts. If students learn only facts, they lack the conceptual knowledge or understanding of where and how to apply them in practice. For example, if a math teacher teaches one problem and solves it without explaining the concept, such as the formula, method, or steps needed to solve the problem, students will struggle. This becomes evident when the problem is modified or a different problem appears in the textbook or on an examination. They cannot solve the problem because they do not understand the underlying concept. Therefore, a math teacher should initially teach the concept of a particular problem. Based on that concept, the teacher should solve a problem, helping students remember the concept so they can easily tackle any problems that are based on it.\n\nFor every problem, there is a concept behind the solution. Take, for example, a physics book, which contains numerous concepts for each chapter. One such chapter is titled 'GRAVITATION.' The idea here is about Earth's gravitational force. Due to gravity, anything thrown into the air from Earth's surface will fall back to Earth because of the gravitational pull. If we simply tell students that objects thrown into the air will fall back to Earth, they are only learning a fact. They do not understand the reason behind it. This type of learning prevents students from becoming proficient engineers or professionals in other fields due to a lack of conceptual and practical knowledge.\n\nConsider a civil engineering student who does not know how to construct a building or where to build it; the building will undoubtedly collapse.\n\nThat is why it is crucial for students to learn and understand concepts and ideas rather than just facts."}

I do not like to study history but enjoy reading about it. I was excited; it must be written like novels, but the book was like a textbook I used in class.

In my opinion, unlike having a broad knowledge of many subjects, being the best in one specific subject is much more valuable.\n\nI think that specialization in one specific area can give a person many more advantages when compared to broad knowledge. For example, if you have only broad knowledge about many subjects, this tells people that you are not a qualified person. It only makes you more intellectual, but specialization is required in order to have a good job opportunity. Today, being intellectual is not enough to live well. Unless you have any specialization, you cannot earn a good amount of money.\n\nMoreover, being specialized can be seen as the reflection of success. You can be the most successful person in your specialized area by researching and working more and more. For instance, you can be a well-known scientist or professor in your field. This is impossible for the person who has broad knowledge in many areas because life is short, and you do not have lots of time to learn everything about every subject. Instead, you should use your time in one area which can make you the best.\n\nIn summary, as I mentioned in my essay, I disagree with the idea that it is better to have broad knowledge of many subjects. According to me, being the best in one area is much better than having broad knowledge. Specialization is not only the chance for a good position but also the reflection of success."}
{"file_id": "109364.txt", "output_essay": "When I read about successful people's writing about their lives, their success is always based on their very special new methods or inventions. Moreover, nowadays the new challenge is to develop brand new ideas. Every human being always seeks new ideas and new products to make them successful. The present world has already been developed too much for regular ideas or inventions. Moreover, people who succeeded always had hard times with them. In my opinion, because they faced their problems and overcame them, they can be called successful people.\n\nFirst of all, the common stereotype of successful people is not being satisfied with the present situation and always challenging the new one. Walt Disney was not satisfied with his current society's broadcast. He invented various Disney characters such as 'Mickey Mouse' or 'Minnie Mouse'. These new characters contributed to obtaining children's attention, and it became the fuel for Walt Disney's success. In addition, he never stopped creating new characters; his unstoppable trying also made his success more shining.\n\nSecond of all, the people who reach their success took a lot more risks than ordinary people. It is not true that a person can make their fortune in one try, except with the lottery. Successful people always took higher risks to obtain more new and valuable results from their tries. When Bill Gates was a young man, he attended Harvard University and was respected by others just for attending Harvard. However, when he tried to make the Microsoft programs, there are some episodes about him failing his classes at the university. Bill Gates gave up his reputation at Harvard. Normal people usually do not do this.\n\nThird of all, successful people did not stop developing themselves. They always try new things with risk but never give up on it. They try and try until they get satisfactory data or results about it. Then they start a new try based on their collected information. Picasso is the famous artist of the modern ages, and his one painting is valued at more than a million dollars. His work at that time was not that noticeable because his painting was too creative. However, he did not give up drawing. He just kept drawing in his way. After he died, until now, we thought his painting is very creative and we gave him credit for it.\n\nIn short, successful people try new things although they could take serious risks, and they never give up until they reach their goal. Therefore, I strongly agree with the statement that is given."}

I am a person of the latter type and I disagree with that statement. I don't like to travel in a group led by a tour guide because traveling in such a group deprives the trip of flexibility.\n\nIt is true that relying on a tour guide is comfortable. Some might think that even planning where to visit is bothersome. A group trip led by a tour guide is suitable for such a person. Tour guides are professionals at planning and ensuring safe travel. The trip led by a guide should be easy and safe. However, traveling in a group led by a tour guide lacks flexibility in the plan.\n\nIn some cities, there are too many famous places, and travelers are forced to choose only some of them. In London or New York, for instance, one would have to spend three or four days in a museum if they tried to see everything exhibited there. In such cases, travelers must follow the plans of the tour if they participate in a tour led by a tour guide. People who are especially interested in the arts and want to stay longer at a museum should prefer traveling freely.\n\nSometimes I change my plan during a trip. When I visited Germany as an undergraduate student, I planned to visit five cities during the one-week trip. At the first place I visited, however, I was so impressed by the beautiful scenery of a river and castle that I changed my plan and stayed there for one week. Consequently, I visited only one city during the trip.\n\nWhen we travel, we often encounter impressive scenery or events at the places we visit. Traveling in a group led by a tour guide does not allow us to change the plan to stay there for a longer time than we planned before."}

There are several reasons: to advance our world, to contribute to a better future, and to satisfy our curiosity. Many people think that human beings have greatly improved their lives and that they are the rulers of the planet Earth; I disagree. For example, a century ago, we did not even have electricity. What scholars did was develop theories and care about science. For instance, if we did not have Einstein, Edison, or other scholars, there would not have been electricity or new discoveries. We might have continued our lives with primitive machines and in dark houses. Moreover, we have tremendous problems in our world. Even though we have computers, rockets, and flying cars, the end of the world may be too close. For example, global warming poses a significant threat, and we need to save our world. How can we solve this problem? Most likely, by thinking more about science (theories), we probably will solve the problem. In fact, we need more scientists to pay attention to this area, and we need to encourage new generations to take science courses and think more about theories. We do not have plenty of food and resources, and we need to improve them. Without spending energy on the theories behind genetically modified foods, it would be impossible to grow healthier and more abundant food. For example, I used to pay two dollars for a pound of apples containing a lot of diseases; now, I pay less for better apples. In summary, without spending more time on theories, we could not improve our living standards, and I appreciate all the scientists who devoted their time to them."}
{"file_id": "10392.txt", "output_essay": "I am not quite sure about my opinion on that topic. There are several advantages and disadvantages on both sides.\n\nFirst, being a specialist is like a goal you can achieve, fulfilling the dream of being 'the best' that everyone has. It is like a motor for working harder. And of course, it needs experts for innovation. You have to have the time and power to think about new ways and to be able to make experiments. Specialization has always played a very important role in evolution in general and moreover in human evolution. People became experts and shared the work. So they got faster and had the knowledge, understanding, and skills others weren't able to have. In fact, specialization is the key to our culture; without it, there would be no kind of art.\n\nOn the other hand, one might say that experts are very good in one single topic but quite naive in everyday life. They are dependent on others - so there could never be a world full of experts; it always needs people who work together with them, who have to share their skills. Another important point is 'having an overview'. If you have knowledge in various areas, you can see the connections, how one thing influences another. And you can draw your conclusions.\n\nYou then have the possibility to find surprising answers for problems because you don't think in the 'ordinary' way. Lastly, not everyone is interested in all the different academic subjects and/or the skills and therefore isn't motivated.\n\nIn the context of education - as I understand this question - I would say the best way is a combination of both. You first have to know some basic information and gain skills that are fundamental in every field of academic subjects. But when you find out that one topic arouses your special interest and you have the gift to work in this field and be good, then you should have the possibility to specialize.\n\nIn my opinion, you should never stop learning. And in these times, you always have the chance to ask someone if you don't understand or don't know something. It is very important to be a 'good' expert - concentrate on what you can do best but don't forget to look around from time to time."}

I prefer to travel in a group that is led by a tour guide because I might find things easier and more comfortable.\n\nWhile traveling to another country, the main thing that our family thinks about is how we will get to our apartment and who will take us to visit the places in the country. The tour guide is the one who will take us to our apartment or hotel, and he will explain things about the city or the country because he is a son of his country.\n\nGoing with a tour guide made us learn many things; for example, when we visited England, we found many statues, parks, trees, trains, and rivers. Each one of these was explained clearly and accurately about its time and place and when it was found and how long it will exist; all that was known by the tour guide. We learned many things and gained more experience about this country.\n\nWithout going with a tour guide, we may get lost. A tour guide is like a North Star that guides lost people. A few years ago, when we went to visit Australia, we thought that we might not need to use a tour guide and because of that, we had a lot of problems and troubles. We were trying to find a park from evening until night and when we reached there, everyone was lost.\n\nIn conclusion, a tour guide is better to use because he guides lost people."}

A youngster should always help his community because they are the ones who will help him if he has any problems. They safeguard the youngsters.\n\nFrom my point of view, young people are not devoting sufficient time to the community. Instead, they prefer to party with their friends. Some utilize their time in studying and tuitions. Others find playing games more interesting than providing support to their community. They nowadays have no feeling in their hearts, which people in the past used to have for serving their community. They are unaware of the fact that the community is the one who is going to help them when in need. He should, therefore, work for it to take his community to great heights and create a level for it, i.e., a separate entity.\n\nFor example, Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi was not called the Father of India for nothing. He suffered a lot in freeing his country from the British, who had been ruling it for many years. He did not do this all alone. Slowly and steadily, he gathered Indians to support him and carried out several movements to oust them. At last, his country gained freedom on 15th August 1947, after struggling for a few decades. The young ones should, therefore, wake up from their sleep and help in strengthening freedom. They should not leave it at stake.\n\nThus, the youngsters' view should always be on helping their community, as Guru Nanak did for the Sikhs.\n\nTherefore, the primary function of every person belonging to a particular community is to have the potential to do whatever his community requires of him. He should serve his community as best as he can."}
{"file_id": "104726.txt", "output_essay": "The answer to this question depends on the situation that a particular person is in at a time. In the case that the person does not know the city or place that is being visited, I would recommend contracting a tour guide and doing it in a group because he is going to take you to the most important places quickly, safely, and with all the explanations needed to understand the place that you are visiting. Additionally, you can enjoy the company of other people, giving you the opportunity to meet and share experiences.\nOne of the most important things when you are traveling is to see the culture of the place, for example, the food, dances, festivals, etc., and I think that a tour guide can help you to accomplish this goal. Also, the tour guide can provide you with historical information about the place, which is very important when trying to understand the behavior of the residents of the region visited.\n\nOn the other hand, I think that if you have been to the region before, and especially if you have been there a couple of times, hiring a tour guide is a waste of money and time because these kinds of services are usually expensive, and you can use that money on something more productive in your trip. Also, the tour guide is going to take you to places where you have already been. Instead, you can use that time to visit new places in the region, doing something different than your last visit.\n\nSo the conclusion is that it depends on your previous experience visiting the region. I would absolutely recommend it in the case that it is your first time, but if you have been before, I do not see any reason to take a tour."}
{"file_id": "109346.txt", "output_essay": "I partially agree with this statement if we talk about the young people living in developed countries, such as Taiwan. As I see it, young people in today's society prefer technology over people. Thus, they may not pay enough attention to their own communities. But on the other hand, young people nowadays have more opportunities to help others because we lead a richer and more knowledgeable life than before.\n\nWe can say that young people born after 1985 are the generation of information technology. They've become familiar with using computers since they were very little, even at the age of 3 or 4. Growing up in this kind of environment, they seem to pay more attention to 'machines' such as personal computers, MP3 players, and game consoles than to people. In other words, they may spend much more time engaging with these high-tech devices instead of interacting with other people, including those in their communities.\n\nYet, young people who have grown up under such conditions have more opportunities to assist their communities. Why? By using their outstanding computer skills, they can help their communities do a variety of things. For example, they can teach older people how to use computers and surf the Internet. Tasks like these are very simple for young people yet quite meaningful for older individuals who cannot use such technological devices. By connecting with the world through computers, these older people's lives will change significantly. In my neighborhood, there is a young person who enjoys teaching older people in my community. He said, 'Doing so makes his life more meaningful, and he is very happy to use his computer skills to help people. It's easier for him to do so.'"}
{"file_id": "105219.txt", "output_essay": "\"Jack of all trades, master of none.\" This is a saying many of us grew up listening to. The question is whether you want to be a Jack of all trades or the \"King\" of one.\n\nPersonally, I believe that it is better to specialize in one specific subject rather than to have broad, abstract knowledge about many. When you specialize in one subject, you gain a lot of knowledge and authority on that subject. This can lead to a lot of advantages.\n\nFirstly, mastery in one subject can help you with your career. If you have complete command over your subject, you can effectively utilize it to further your career goals. For example, in a competitive industry like the Information Technology industry, if you have a good grip on your domain, it will benefit you much more than having incomplete knowledge about a lot of other domains. If you are knowledgeable about a subject, not only can you do your own work better, but you can also help your colleagues or peers with problems they may be facing.\n\nSpecialization in a subject makes you an authority on it. This can lead to other people looking to you for direction or help if they are stuck. So not only do you become more popular, but you also gain a lot of respect by helping others out.\n\nLastly, I would say that if everyone just wanted to have broad knowledge on a variety of different subjects, then no scientific or other development would ever have been possible. Take Leonardo da Vinci for example. Had he not developed his skill in painting to such a high degree, we would not today be able to exclaim at the beauty of the Mona Lisa. Or Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, who with his skill in music, gave us so many beautiful compositions. Or Albert Einstein, whose immense study of scientific phenomena led to so many inventions.\n\nIn conclusion, I firmly believe that it is much better to specialize in a subject you feel passionately about than to have a lot of unimportant data on subjects you might be just mildly interested in."}
{"file_id": "101001.txt", "output_essay": "For some reasons, we might think that young people enjoy life more than older people do. At first sight, we can state this because it is clear that being young, in good health with future perspectives, is easier than being old, suffering, and counting the years before dying. Besides, parents often tell children that they are lucky. I can't deny that being old is not a very fun thing overall for the body, for the health, but on the other side, it implies that you have lived a lot of various things, you have found your way, you have children, and maybe grandchildren. In a few words, at this age, people have done the more difficult tasks, and they can use their time for pleasure, for resting, for what they want.\n\nOn the other hand, being young is not such an easy thing, and it is often a difficult part of life, overall the teenage period. Indeed, the teenage years are the time of self-construction, the time to discover love, problems, to take the first decisions... And that is not an easy thing because teenagers don't have a lot of experience yet, nor self-confidence. In addition, youth is a tricky period concerning relationships: young people are not always nice to each other, and a lot of them suffer a lot during this time. Youth, and more particularly the teenage years, are times of transition and change, and for that, they're not always cool and easy. You lose some beautiful things like innocence, purity, unconsciousness, and so on; you enter the real world, and the deception can be high.\n\nTo the contrary, older people have already made their lives; they have more experience about life, and thanks to that, they encounter fewer difficulties in resolving problems.\n\nAll in all, of course, I can't say that I prefer to be young or old; that is not the question, but I think that every age has its advantages and its setbacks. But I do believe that the most difficult is to be young because it implies a lot of problems and questions for which we are not always ready."}

Technological advancements leading to a more rapid pace of life have indeed brought about a revolutionary change in young people nowadays. This has led to the fact that they do not give enough time to helping their communities.\n\nOne of the most important reasons is the lack of time available to young people for such activities. They are more involved in their careers, family, social, and sports activities. Hence, they seldom find it possible to take time out of their busy schedules.\n\nSecondly, people are much more competitive nowadays. There is competition in each and every field today. It is the time where only the fittest of people survive. Everyone wants to build a good career so that they can provide for their family as well as ensure a bright and prosperous future. In this rat race, they are left with no time to think about those outside their family. Hence, they choose to turn a blind eye to their responsibilities towards their communities.\n\nLastly, they are not aware of their responsibilities and duties as individuals towards others. It is sad that a few of them choose to remain so still. There is a need for awakening the youth so they become more aware.\n\nThere are a few young people who have still managed to contribute largely to their community. There are many examples of television actors and other famous personalities who have made their mark by carrying out their responsibilities to the fullest. Such people are considered as role models by the common public and they inspire the youth of today to continue with their good work.\n\nThus, it is true that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.

{"file_id": "111649.txt", "output_essay": "In the fast-growing world, job opportunities are increasing. All subjects have sub-subjects to work on or new working areas. Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well because of earning money and reputation, people's attention, and being imaginative.\n\nFirst, earning money and reputation is the base of all kinds of work and success. People always want money and reputation, at least one of them. Trying something new will always bring you money or reputation. For example, if we think about a good car mechanic, known by his own neighborhood, starts working on luxury boats' engines. A while later, his customers will start to want his help in boat-related subjects or something else about mechanics because they will think that he is gifted with mechanical things. So, trying new things brings you both money and reputation, and these two encourage you to try more new things again.\n\nSecondly, people's attention makes you happy because everybody asks you something about the thing you have done or invented, wants something about it, or comes near to you and says 'congratulations.' The point is that you are the center of the world at that moment; you think that everything happening is about you, everyone loves you, everyone needs you. This is the food of the human soul and the key to success, so people's attention is one of the most important points of trying or doing new things.\n\nLastly, only imaginative people may try new things because they are the ones who try the not-tried things before. Their brains are successful from their birth; maybe they are really gifted or the 'one.' They can assemble a world only for themselves and live in it. When they imagine something, they can also imagine the result. What does that change? If they do not see success at the end, they do not venture into new things; their brain works in a different way; they are smart.\n\nIn conclusion, trying new things and the success related to it is about money, attention, and being imaginative. People trying new things can be successful, but sometimes only successful people can try new things because they already have enough courage and brain for that. This is a two-directional road; someone on this road will always be successful or always try new things. And it will end with the other one."}
{"file_id": "109910.txt", "output_essay": "In this era of immense competition, modern youngsters spend less and less time towards 'giving back to society'. There is a downward trend in the number of hours spent doing community service these days. The sense of belonging has decreased over the years, and we tend to take most things for granted. Community service is considered to be 'someone else's job'.\n\nFirstly, students are faced with more workload from schools and colleges, so they have less leisure time. They feel so exhausted after classes that there is little or no motivation to take up some community work. Also, there is high competition, so the students tend to spend after-school hours doing extra research or preparing for tests. Say a student is not doing as well as she expects. In such a case, she will obviously concentrate on making an extra effort and studying harder. Thus, community service takes a backseat.\n\nSecondly, when a student does have some time to spare, he or she may have an option to take up a paid job. For example, when one has an option to make money by working in the local cafeteria and earn a good chunk of money, the community service option does not seem lucrative. This is due to the tendency of seeking personal benefits before caring for others. In other cases, the leisure time is spent 'hanging out' with friends, watching movies, going to concerts, chatting on the internet, etc. For instance, after a full day at college, two friends prefer to meet up at the mall rather than tire themselves out doing more work.\n\nUsually, the motivation to do community service arises from a desire to present a more 'attractive' resume or for college admissions. However, it would be incorrect to generalize this statement because there are a few individuals who genuinely like to do community service out of personal satisfaction. Some people enjoy interacting with elders at old age homes and get happiness when the old express their excitement over having someone to talk to! Sadly, such youngsters are fewer in number.\n\nHence, community service is declining these days."}

Some people might agree with this opinion because society is becoming more and more individualistic. However, I disagree with the idea that the young do not spend much time on community activities because of what schools and society require of them.\n\nTo begin with, schools encourage students to participate more actively in community service. Many schools now offer volunteering programs for additional credit or as elective courses. To support this point, studies done by the Ministry of Education of Korea have shown that the number of official community services provided by educational organizations such as high schools and universities has increased by 67% compared to that of 10 years ago. Also, student participation in these programs has increased by 87%. It seems clear that schools have a positive influence on young people's involvement in their communities.\n\nMoreover, society places more emphasis on helping communities. Communities display many advertisements to solicit help from young people, and their participation is highly praised by society. Young people considered virtuous are rewarded by the government with their names published in local periodicals. For example, I saw a poster for the rebuilding of my community damaged by a hurricane earlier. I immediately decided to be part of it as the team leader and was awarded by the representative of my village. This volunteer experience, written on my resume, greatly affected the employers at my current job. They said the virtue of helping others is the very criterion they esteem.\n\nIn short, I disagree with the opinion that young people do not spend enough time on community activities to make them better. This is because of the encouragement from schools and society."}

When I was a university student, I visited Guam Island with five friends as a graduation memorial trip. After I reached a hotel on Guam Island, I wanted to swim as soon as possible.

I was not free.\n\nSecond, I cannot encounter some troubles if others or a tour guide are around me. I believe that some troubles that happen on a trip, such as losing one's way, are interesting. Three years ago, I traveled to New York in the United States of America. I wanted to go to Central Park after I arrived there. I tried to go there using the subway. However, I lost my way near Times Square. Although I could not speak English well, I challenged myself to ask someone where Central Park was. A kind man told me the way, and I finally reached there. I encountered trouble and tried to find a solution during my trip. This is my interesting experience. If other people or a tour guide had been with me, I would not have lost my way. And I would not have talked to a foreigner. For instance, I would not have had that accident.\n\nTo sum up, taking these matters into account, I absolutely disagree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.

In fact, a lot has already been done to reduce pollution, and I am sure there is still much that can be done. For example, Italian cities and other European cities are encouraging Europeans to buy Euro4 and Euro5 cars, which pollute far less than standard cars. This reduction has been possible thanks to improvements in car technology.\n\nEvery month around the world, there are showrooms that present new kinds of cars, less and less polluting, more and more sophisticated in shapes, motors, and accessories. Some of these new kinds of cars are very expensive, depending also on the brand, while some are more affordable. Industries are doing a lot to encourage people to buy these cars, from the wealthy to the less fortunate.\n\nNot only are industries and the most famous brand companies acting in favor of less pollution. In fact, governments are doing a lot as well. For instance, they organize many information campaigns; they define calendars of days during which people must not use cars in cities where pollution is over the maximum level permitted, and they finance electric public transportation.\n\nI think these are good reasons to believe that cars will not decrease in number over the next twenty years; on the contrary, it is common to expect them to be numerous but less polluting than they are today."}

What good is being loaded with material things if you don't have time to supervise your children's school progress?

Some people think that singing, dancing, or other forms of entertainment constitute enjoyment, while others believe that reading books, helping others, and watching nature are their kinds of enjoyment. So, if we consider age groups, mostly younger people want to enjoy life more than older people. Whatever may be the type of enjoyment, younger people want to do it completely, without hesitations or restrictions.\n\nYoung age is the only stage in life where everyone is full of colors and ambition. People's feelings are just like beautiful butterflies. Even though nowadays the younger generation has become so competitive and career-oriented, they just don't want to suppress their joys. They are sharing their happiness and sadness. They are going to discos, concerts, and cinemas. Here, exactly, the older generation is opposing the younger ones.\n\nOld people are usually more mature and behave like a stoic to situations. They take whatever comes in their life in the same way because their experiences have taught them a lot in life.\n\nOne important reason for this variation in enjoyment is differences in hormonal levels. As a person becomes older, his hormonal influences become less evident. Their enjoyment levels and expressions directly correspond with this.\n\nEven though some exceptions to this are there, on the whole, younger people's enjoyment is higher than that of older people. In my house, I also want to celebrate all the festivals in a grand way, but my parents are always restricting me from doing that. Though at that moment I feel bad, later in my life, who knows, I might do the same thing!\n\nSo, in my opinion, in general, youngsters enjoy more than the older age groups. The reasons might be hormonal influences, attitude towards life, their experiences, or their better understanding of the value of the moment."}

If a person has a lot of experience in doing one job, he can usually make the best decision when a problem arises. Compared to a person who makes a decision when he does a new job, he is inexperienced and has no idea which way has more benefits for him. So he can easily make a wrong or worse decision. Successful people would do what they already know how to do well because they have experience.\n\nSecondly, we need enough time to make our jobs successful. Working a job to be successful is a long process. A person who does a job which he already knows how to do well saves a lot of time on understanding the basic knowledge of the job. Then he can spend more time making the job perfect and making himself successful.\n\nFinally, a person does a job which he already knows how to do well, he has a higher possibility of success than those who try new things and take risks. As we know, if we try a new job, we have no experience with that and have to spend plenty of time to understand the job. It is risky to do that because we might find out we are not able to make it successful after spending a long period of time. On the contrary, if we already know a job well, of course, we know what to do to make it successful directly and efficiently.\n\nI disagree that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well, because they don't have experience, enough time, and a higher possibility of success in doing the new job."}
{"file_id": "112269.txt", "output_essay": "According to my opinion, the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know is one open for debate. Curiosity has become a driving force that led to new inventions and discoveries from century to century. Man has evolved from the time when he hunted for food to today, when all the latest technologies are available. In this essay, I will first analyze the ideology of a successful person and whether optimism and audacity are the only criteria for becoming successful, and base my suggestion in favor of being optimistic.\n\nIf we turn the pages of history, one thing we find common in all the greatest leaders is the quality of being optimistic. They do not hesitate to take any audacious decisions and explore new things. Take, for example, George Washington, America's first president; he always showed enthusiasm in trying out new things. Another example is Abraham Lincoln, a person who reached great heights in his career by taking risks and experimenting with new things.\n\nI also support the point that if we do those things we already know, we can perform those tasks more accurately and with less effort. However, this does not increase our efficiency. Think of the primitive world, where our ancestors were very good at hunting, and if they had never tried to break the old rituals of hunting and started living like civilized people, we could not have reached the apex at which we are today.\n\nObstacles are the milestones that show us the path to success. While overcoming obstacles and taking new kinds of risks, people become stronger and discover new limits of success.\n\nI would like to conclude by stating that if you want to reach the apex of success, then make yourself accustomed to different kinds of risk and obstacles, and in all conscience, you will become successful."}

{"file_id": "102061.txt", "output_essay": "In my view, it is always helpful to have a lot of interest in acquiring as much information as possible in every field or subject, rather than concentrating merely on one subject. As far as I am concerned, an individual will shine if he continues to gain knowledge throughout his entire life, more so in different fields, as the world is changing faster.\n\nAs a child, I was doing a lot better in most of the subjects during my secondary school. But I never was dominating in any one subject. This continued when I was in intermediate, which used to worry me a bit, as after higher education there was an entrance exam for which I had to score very well in academic subjects. But my maternal uncle, who was close to me, suggested making a slight alteration to my study pattern and concentrating on subjects that would be tested for the exam. He said to remember one important thing: that being a jack of all trades is better than being a master of none.\n\nWhile I was studying in the 10th standard, I had a friend who was good at natural science. But he never used to concentrate on other subjects, as he found them uninteresting and worthless. Because of his attitude, he got much lower marks in the final and could not qualify for the state government higher education college. He had to settle with a private college.\n\nThe main important reason for his downfall is that by gaining lots of knowledge in one particular field, he might have thought that he had nothing to learn further and stopped learning all of a sudden, which is a dangerous pattern for any individual. Also, he might have become bored and stopped concentrating on other topics as a whole.\n\nThe above examples in my life convinced me that by gaining knowledge of many issues and topics, you will help yourself interact more expressively with your colleagues and make you more socially interactive.\n\nAlso, with the world changing all the time, every second, keeping this attitude in mind will help you adapt quickly and smoothly."}
{"file_id": "112184.txt", "output_essay": "It is often thought that young people enjoy life more than older people do, but is it really true? A young person and an old person differ completely in terms of social status, experiences, physical abilities, and other factors which can explain that statement. Let's analyze them.\n\nFirst of all, old people can sometimes be limited physically because of their age, and it can prevent them from doing all they would like to do. Simple things in life can be difficult, such as going shopping, driving, or maybe going out with friends. All these difficulties added together can make their life more difficult to enjoy.\n\nMoreover, older people often have more responsibilities in terms of family or professional goals. This can create a lot of stress and psychological tensions, which prevent people from enjoying life to its maximum. However, I have to say that having a family (children...) is not only a source of stress... and can therefore be a great cause of happiness!\n\nOn the contrary, young people are often more 'free' psychologically as they are less conscious than older people and want to experience life in a fun way and to enjoy it. They often do not have the preoccupations linked to a family or a professional situation. Consequently, they can be more selfish and have fun in life.\n\nWe also have to notice that young people often do not have the same problem with money that they get when they are older. Most of the time, parents supply their children with money and all their material requirements. It is thus an important worry that disappears and allows, in one sense, young people to enjoy life.\n\nFinally, we arrive at the conclusion that young people enjoy life more than older people do because, in a way, they are sometimes unconscious of some worries or problems that can exist in an older person's life. However, some people prefer to make sacrifices during their youth and then enjoy life when they are older, whereas other people do the opposite... But which is the best solution to enjoy life as much as you can?"}
{"file_id": "109415.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with the statement that says young people enjoy life more than older people do. It is because young people tend to be optimistic towards life, whereas older people tend to be realistic. I am 21 years old now, and I consider myself young, and I think I can do anything I want in my life. It sounds more enjoyable and exciting when people think that they can do everything. However, the older you become, the tougher life becomes, so older people tend to forget how to dream and enjoy life itself. It is probably because of these things: money, family, and health.\n\nFirst, when you get older, you think about money a lot. Money that comes from a job can't easily break your savings. To be an adult is to be independent somehow, so you should make a living by yourself. But when you are young, you can live with your parents and still have a part-time job and spend it on your own. I was the richest when I was in high school, living in a house and doing whatever. When you have money, you can enjoy your life more because you can do a lot of things, especially the money you can spend on your own.\n\nThe next thing I want to point out is the family. Like I said in the second paragraph, when you are young and don't have your kids yet, you can almost do anything. However, things will be different if you have kids. Your free time will be limited, and you always have to think about your family and also the BILLS!! Jobs may not be the preferable ones, but you still have to work for your family. Occupation is the number one factor for an adult to be stressed, and stress can make people enjoy their life less. It will be just a pain in the neck.\n\nLast but not least, as you get older, your body will not listen to you as it used to. I don't have any disabilities or bad guts or anything right now, but if I look at my mother, she is always complaining about her health. She says she has bad legs and waist, and she doesn't like to go out often. Just sitting at home won't be the best thing to do, but what if there is no choice? So I think I do what I can do when I'm still young and take advantage of being young.\n\nIn the meantime, there will be a time that I can enjoy my life as older people, however, being young is just one factor of life that older people cannot beat."}
{"file_id": "114679.txt", "output_essay": "In my opinion, I disagree with the topic that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. In this new global world and era, companies try to reach many people around the world by using technology. However, this can sometimes be harmful to consumers who do not pay attention.\n\nFirst of all, there are many ways to attract consumers to a product. We can use the internet, TV, radios, by giving advertisements. All of them are effective. By using a famous footballer or model, you can increase the popularity of the product. On the other hand, companies use camera and lighting illusions to make the product appear more attractive. This method can also be used to show the big one as little and the slow one as fast. In addition to these mechanisms, the advertisements given on TVs or the internet are repeated many times in order to persuade and convince consumers. This puts pressure on consumers to try the product. The last factor for me to attract consumers to a product is its price. As we know, if a product is cheap, we always think that it is the most suitable one for us. This is quite a wrong statement, in fact. Thus, companies know this situation and use it as their most well-known weapon.\n\nIn spite of the facts stated below, there are also some advertisements that reflect the obvious and fair appearance and usage of a product. In such situations, we can try to trust the companies' mark on it. For example, brands like BMW, General Electric, and LC Waikiki are well-known producers, so we can trust their products and advertisements.\n\nConsequently, in our global and technological world, all companies try to take a role in world trade and make much more money. Furthermore, we can say that world management is related to some big companies. So the smaller ones try to be part of this huge budget. And they can do everything to achieve this, even if it means forcing countries to begin a war. Attractive products to convince people are an easy piece of cake for them."}

People used to live without cars, but since their creation, there have been more and more cars all around the world. Yet, I truly believe that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years.\n\nFirst of all, considering all the new technology and the constant evolution of the world, I'm convinced that the car will finally disappear. People change their minds very quickly nowadays, and they will soon be bored with cars; they'll need something new. For instance, I hope we'll soon be able to move just by thinking about the place we want to go; it will be easier and will save energy and time. Besides, even if teleportation isn't created, it's obvious that the car will disappear as quickly as it came. Thus, a new means of transport will be created, more powerful and more useful.\n\nFurthermore, all countries are getting engaged in the reduction of toxic gases on Earth, and the Kyoto Agreement is the perfect example of the world we all want to fight for. Even if some countries don't really apply the rules at the moment, I'm sure they will finally realize the emergency and won't have any other choice than to make efforts. Moreover, people are becoming more aware that we are acting for the future and for the next generations. Therefore, if we want future humans to be able to live on Earth, we have to stop using cars and thus stop polluting.\n\nIn a nutshell, even if I'm not sure that there will be more pedestrians, I'm truly convinced that cars don't belong to the future but to the past, and that we'll find solutions to be able to move as we wish without polluting too much."}
{"file_id": "110509.txt", "output_essay": "In a way, I disagree with the statement that young people nowadays do not devote enough time to helping their community. I believe that in current times, communities themselves do not require as much help or as much time devoted to help.\n\nIn the past, people of a small town or village identified themselves as a community and worked towards mutual and communal benefits. There were weekly meetings, and the problems of the community were discussed. Young people, who form the most energetic part of the group, volunteered in solving the problems and in arranging festivals and local gatherings.\n\nPeople were more physically involved in the community. They worked as a team, and one's problem was everybody's problem. It was natural for young people to be the most active component of the community.\n\nIn many modernized parts of the world, the situation is in stark contrast to what it was in the past. The revolutions in communication technology and the advent of the internet have largely deviated people from each other to the computer.\n\nSystems and services have become more efficient and computerized. There is much less need for people, not only young, to be involved in any help, mainly because there is not much help required. People can discuss problems in e-communities and via email and chat.\n\nThe town administration has its public website, and any problem can be posted on it. Responsible people can then take necessary action. So today, there is not much help required, but there is a big need for ideas, and in this case, young people still form the most active group.\n\nSo in view of the current times, I disagree."}
{"file_id": "105218.txt", "output_essay": "I believe that a strong conclusion stating that having a broad knowledge of academic subjects is better than specializing in one specific subject would be faulty. There are both advantages and disadvantages to the two.\n\nFirst, being an expert in a specialized field is unquestionably necessary. The development of science is based on using the knowledge gained by our ancestors. So, in order to make use of previously conducted research on specific topics and to take them to further points, we need specialists. A person having broad knowledge in many fields would not be effective in this kind of situation.\n\nSecond, in our daily life, we can clearly observe the necessity for specialists. For example, think of a situation where you are sick and go to the doctor. The first doctor you visit would probably be a generalist with broader knowledge of the human body. You would expect that doctor to direct you to a specialist for the specific health problem you have. Then you would need a doctor specialized in your problem. This situation also illustrates the necessity for both.\n\nFinally, people who are specialized in a topic may sometimes become blinded by the long periods of the same kind of work they are dealing with. In such cases, a person with broader knowledge could see the big picture and would be more beneficial in solving the problems. To illustrate, industrial engineering, which is my major field, requires seeing the big picture in a company as we try to solve its problems. When we deal with problems stated by a department in the company, we observe that the department does not consider the possible causes of the problem, which can actually be caused by any other department. So, this experience of mine from a summer internship indicates the possible disadvantages of working on the same topic all the time.\n\nIn conclusion, we need both specialists and people with broad knowledge since they are both needed for solving the problems of human beings in real life. Therefore, a clear conclusion that one of the positions is better than the other would be very misleading."}
{"file_id": "105202.txt", "output_essay": "I mainly agree with that statement. However, it is important to consider the context in which this statement is seen. For example, I think it is correct when related to languages. It is obviously better to speak a little bit of English, French, German, and Italian than to speak only one of them perfectly. Concerning the profession, I have to disagree with the statement. In today's economic situation, it is better to be specialized. Unemployment is so high that it is possible to be well-educated but still unemployed if you are not specialized enough. On the other hand, a broad knowledge of many academic subjects can be better if you have to manage your own firm and cannot rely on other specialists.\n\nIt is important to note that a broad knowledge is the base for further knowledge in these areas. So, if you do not have a variety of knowledge, it is much harder to gain experience in those unrevealed areas. Especially in the current situation, it is important to be flexible and to be willing to keep on learning throughout your lifetime. If you were a specialist in one certain subject, you probably would not be willing to listen to more current information because of your status as a specialist.\n\nIt clearly depends on one's character, but my opinion is that specialization is minor in contrast to a broad knowledge of many subjects. As I stated above, the base is the most important thing. Afterwards, there is still time to specialize in certain subjects in which you are interested. If you do not know all the possibilities, you cannot be sure of having chosen the right path.\n\nI would prefer a broad knowledge because then I still have all possibilities. If I specialized and chose wrongly, I would be disappointed. You do not know how the future will be; that is why specialization is such a dangerous thing. It is better to be eventually less qualified in a lot of subjects than to be specialized in one which no one needs.\n\nSo, in general, I would agree with the statement. Specialization comes after the broad base of many academic subjects."}
{"file_id": "10769.txt", "output_essay": "I find it productive and rewarding to specialize in one subject because one is likely to progress better by staying focused on one area of thought. Mathematicians like Andrew Wiles spent a huge amount of time to prove a single theorem, but he managed to solve one of the greatest enigmas of mathematics. So, devoting oneself completely to solving a problem or structuring a method may result in an effective, all-inclusive, and creative solution or understanding.\n\nHowever, specialization could also lead to boredom or a waste of time. Staying up all night pursuing the same goal repeatedly may cause someone to live an empty life, even to lose sight of what they were seeking in the first place, thereby rendering many years' work obsolete. Many great thinkers became stuck in their own minds, believing there was only one important thing in the world, like religion or esoteric metaphysical entities, shutting themselves off from the rest of the world and, more importantly, from the opportunities for growth and understanding they had as human beings. The mind has to flow and explore, take new chances; it is not contained in a box. After all, there are many ideas and projects out there, endless possibilities for how to make a better world. A wide range of abilities and knowledge of various subjects enriches people's lives and opens their minds. The only problem is that it is difficult to coordinate oneself to grow in each discipline; one can get easily distracted, and it is hard to determine what requires one's attention at what time.\n\nStill, the statement could be wrongly put forward. Going back to Wiles's experience, he could not have proved the theorem without having a wider mathematical understanding. If he hadn't looked in archives others (more specialized mathematicians) would have considered useless or irrelevant, if he hadn't dared to try new methods whenever it was needed. Nowadays, it is hard to imagine what it would be like to focus on only one discipline or science, since they are all interconnected with each other, and with technology, in significant ways."}
{"file_id": "106772.txt", "output_essay": "I certainly disagree with the statement that \"young people enjoy life more than older people do\". I will explain my point of view along with some examples.\n\nFirst of all, this statement cannot be generalized. There might be some young people who do enjoy their life more than some older individuals. However, I do not think this is connected with their age but more with a general attitude towards life. For example, an older person could be more pessimistic than a younger person. But this person might have been more pessimistic throughout his whole life, even when he or she was still young.\n\nI do believe that there are different ways of enjoyment and different areas from which old and young people derive enjoyment. In my opinion, this is connected to the different life stages people are in at different ages. Each life stage, like the toddler's, the teenager's, or the adult's, brings along different tasks. Let's say a teenager lives more on the riskier side of life and takes drugs from time to time or has more liberal sexual habits than an adult would practice; this might be due to his wish to experience independence or to define his own personality by testing his own and society's limits. That is normal behavior for his age and role in our Western society. In today's society, a more liberal way of life and expression is often taken as a symbol for a happier life. This does not necessarily hold true. Some of these teens, when asked about their amount of joy in life, might not be happy with what they have at all. On the other hand, an older adult, living more quietly with his family and having a satisfying job, might not look as happy at first, but if asked might show a quite high level of life satisfaction. This so-called joy in life could maybe better be described by the words happiness or life satisfaction.\n\nAlso, another point is that there is confusion between seeing older people's lifestyles, which indeed might look a little boring and less enjoyable to a younger person, as connected to their age. Even when the really old people of today were young, their values were different from ours. They just continued living them until today. This is not boring for them, but to us, it looks boring."}
{"file_id": "109326.txt", "output_essay": "I think that it's much better for a person to have specialized knowledge of a specific subject than to have broad knowledge of many academic areas. Because being specialized in one subject allows you to know more about it and to be able to discuss it easily and thoroughly without any problems, unlike having broad knowledge of many academics. Having broad knowledge leaves you on the surface of everything, not being able to dive deeply into any subject.\nFor example, if you were in a conversation or a debate about something, having broad knowledge would let you talk for a little bit with everybody, using the thin layer of knowledge you have to discuss things with people. But if you are specialized in one subject, you may be able to engage in a deep, interesting conversation.\n\nAlso, being specialized in one subject gives you better working opportunities than those given to broadly knowledgeable people. These days, institutions want specialized individuals who can handle complicated issues in business and life, people who can be put in difficult situations which they can manage easily without panic and solve problems. And talking about money, these institutions pay a lot more for those specialized individuals.\n\nAnother thing is that when we talk about the career issue, specialized people are always remembered and respected wherever they go, and their names will never be forgotten. Broadly knowledgeable people are not as well-known, or at least the majority of them aren't. For example, when we try to say who is the best in chemistry of all time, we have a name; or when we try to remember who is the best in math, we have names.\n\nThat does not mean that people who have broad knowledge are bad or have less experience, but I think that specialized people leave their memories in the minds of others, or they leave their fingerprint on the book of history."}

For example, suppose you planned to go to France; the language the people speak there is French, which you may not understand, and in that case, you would need a guide.\n\nThe second reason is, if you planned to tour a historic place without a guide, you would finally end up just looking at the rocky structures there. As each historic place has a history behind it, and the main purpose of a visit is to know its history, a guide is the right person to explain it to you. For example, when you go on a tour to the Egyptian pyramids, you may not know who built them or how they were built, but if you have a guide with you, he can help explain all these details. After all, you derive a lot of thrill and, in turn, great happiness by knowing all these details.\n\nOn the contrary, when you tour alone or with your kith and kin who don't know anything about the place or its history, you cannot enjoy the place simply because you don't know the details, and there will be every possibility of getting detoured. When you encounter mysterious inscriptions scribbled on stone, you alone cannot decode them in order to enjoy the trip to the fullest extent.\n\nHaving considered all the reasons given above, I would say that I strongly agree with the given statement."}

Car companies are producing a new car every year. When I analyze the traffic, each car has only one person being transported. Every family has a minimum of two cars. This is because car prices are also decreasing, and people are earning much more than before. The government must solve this problem, but nobody does anything. The government should investigate underground and bus systems.\n\nFor example, Istanbul is a huge city. There are 15 million people living in Istanbul. Also, there are 5 million cars in our city. But Istanbul does not have an underground metro network. The buses are very old for transportation. Taxis are not cheaper either. Because of all these points, people choose to buy a car and use it for their daily work. I think this is a general problem all over the world.\n\nAnother point is the old cars in traffic. There are lots of old cars in traffic that are more than 20 years old. These cars are trying to work successfully and transport people. In this case, it is necessary to establish new traffic laws in the countries. For using a car, it must be prohibited to use cars that are more than 20 years old, I think.\n\nScientists are researching ways to power cars with electric energy or water.

Most people in the United States of America possess their first own car by the age of sixteen.\n\nAnother problem that, in my opinion, is directly linked to the number of cars and that we are facing today is the problem of obesity in society. In most developed countries, people are getting bigger and bigger, become more and more lazy, and therefore more likely to drive a car. Simply because it is more convenient.\n\nThen again, people are also starting to be aware of the direct link between cars and the effect they have on environmental changes. Some strongly object to the idea of having a car because they simply cannot live with the thought of destroying the planet for selfish purposes.\n\nIn a television transmission that I happened to watch a few days ago, I also heard a discussion about the earth running out of natural resources such as oil. If there is no more oil, we will have a huge problem supplying our cars. Although that is not expected to happen anytime soon, scientists are trying to find alternatives by developing more natural and environmentally friendly ways to make an engine work.\n\nBut I believe that this will take a huge amount of time and will not be presented to the public in the next few years. So, no, I do not believe that there will be fewer cars in 20 years."}
{"file_id": "112069.txt", "output_essay": "I disagree with having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects rather than specializing in one specific subject.\n\nI feel that we should narrow down our choice of subject instead of increasing our knowledge across all subjects widely.\n\nWe all study for a better career, and when we graduate from university, employers ask for specific skills, and we should be the best in our skills to get the job. If we start having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects instead of concentrating on what our career exactly needs, we will lose the race in the job hunt.\n\nWe all know the famous quote 'Jack of all trades, master of none.' That's what would happen if we start gaining knowledge on many subjects rather than one. We would no doubt increase our knowledge, but unless we specialize in all of them, it's of no use.\n\nI would cite an example of myself; I always wanted to be a software engineer, and there is heavy competition out in the market for software jobs. If I had not taken up software as my major at university, I would not have secured a job. No software industry wants a person who knows 10 subjects but is not specialized in software.\n\nBut at the same time, I insist we should know a bit about other subjects too, for the sake of our general knowledge and to live in this world. In our school, we read about everything like maths, science, geography, history, etc., and that's enough for us to know about many academic subjects. Once we come out of school and join a university, we should start focusing on one particular area of interest which would ultimately give us satisfaction and better career prospects.\n\nI would like to conclude by saying that specializing in one subject is always more fruitful than learning about a lot of subjects."}
{"file_id": "115179.txt", "output_essay": "I do agree that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are, and with good purpose. The main focus of advertisements is to make it seem that the product is the best thing in the world, that it is completely necessary, and most importantly, to sell the product to make profits, which equals money. A good example of these reasons are diet pill campaigns and ads on television. They make ordinarily difficult goals to obtain, obtainable, making it seem easy, fast, and without breaking a sweat. First of all, they target the one thing humans are concerned about: their physical beauty, specifically losing, gaining weight, or being healthy. Today's men and women understand the importance of having a healthy body and being in shape for different reasons, these being health-related issues such as heart disease, diabetes, morbid obesity, etc., and other more physical reasons are the stereotypes of being pretty and skinny in a judgmental society that thrives on superficial beauty. Healthy bodies and weight loss come from healthy eating habits, exercise, and well-organized planning. Diet pill advertisements make it seem as if you could skip all of these steps and still achieve your goal of a healthy shape and body, which, ironically, is not healthy or recommended by doctors because the risks are endless. Still, people buy these products because they want to be the lovely young lady with the tight body, or men want to be that guy with the washboard abs to feel good physically and mentally. To understand how this operates, we must look for the obvious reasons of why the product would seem much better. First of all, the image of expressing the easily unobtainable as obtainable is key in selling the product and therefore making more money, and secondly, when watching a television ad, look for the little black paragraphs in which the truth about the product is stated, and they don't want you to know quickly. This isn't a new practice; every product will seem the best to make a profit out of it, but it is up to us to be educated and be informed about the product we hear or read about to make a wise decision when purchasing it."}
{"file_id": "101568.txt", "output_essay": "It is age that shapes our lives, and that is why it is so important to enjoy life. However, it is not as easy as it sounds because there are different stages in our lives that come with different challenges we have to face. And that's why I think that young people enjoy life more than older people do.\n\nWhen people are young, there are three main aspects that make them enjoy life more than when they are old. The first one is the responsibilities they have in their lives. When life is just beginning, people don't really have to worry about many things; they normally have their parents or someone else to take care of important aspects of life. And if they have responsibilities, they have the energy to handle them. For example, paying the bills, being responsible for the house, and many other things that require responsibility and can cause stress. Another very important aspect that shows that young people enjoy life more is health. Young people normally have no significant problems with their health and body in general; they can move by themselves and are able to do things without any physical help. This is very important for us as human beings. The last point is mentality, or also mental health. This psychological aspect also makes young people enjoy life more because they normally think positively, have dreams, and have goals to accomplish in their future. And that is also something important; young people have expectations, and so they can do things to get what they want out of their lives, or at least try.\n\nFor older people, things are not just that easy. They have already been young and done many things. They have had a lot of responsibilities, and now they are tired and need to rest, and this aspect makes them have a negative attitude towards life, so they cannot see other things to enjoy. At this stage of their lives, they do not really have much more energy to continue with all these responsibilities. The second aspect, and more important, is physical health. Normally, when people reach the old stage of life, they have some kind of limitation that does not permit them to enjoy life as they did when they were young. Things take more time to be done, and maybe they cannot even do them. Finally, mental health; as said before, a positive mentality is very difficult to find. Things have changed, and being old is not easy. That is why I say that young people enjoy life more than old people because everything is easier and, physically, mentally, and in terms of responsibilities, it is better being young; you have more things to enjoy in life. Energy ends, and attitude is also a matter."}
{"file_id": "112333.txt", "output_essay": "It is difficult for me to answer this question because we must define some concepts to answer it. First of all, what is really meant by using the word 'nowadays'? Comparing young people from now to those who lived fifty years ago is not the same as comparing them to those who lived a century ago. Let me suppose we are comparing today's young people to those who were young just at the end of the Second World War. For that example, it is difficult to answer again for a particular reason: society was not the same at that time. The cities were not so crowded, except for a few of them, and many people used to live in small cities. In that kind of town, people are more likely to know each other than in the big city centers. When you live in a small town, you can, for example, help your neighbor with his garden when he is not at home, and you are more likely to do that kind of thing just because you know him very well. In the cities, almost nobody knows his neighbor.\n\nA second thing that has to be clarified is the meaning of 'helping their communities.' Must there be a benefit for everybody or just for a single person? Actions that benefit the entire community are not so easy to do for young people simply because they do not care about that at their age.\n\nTo finish, I would like to give a part of my opinion on this subject. I would say that young people nowadays give less time than their parents used to in the past, but in my opinion, this is not due to their selfishness but to today's society's selfishness."}

I agreed and added that it's best to have a group with a comprehensive plan for the trip and a tour guide, since I consider this the best way to travel, especially to a place I don't know.\n\nTraveling has many benefits, the most important of which is knowledge. By traveling to a country or island that I don't know anything about, I must come back with much information about it; otherwise, my trip is useless. The best way to get information about the area I want to travel to is to go in a group led by a tour guide, who will explain everything about the place: history, value, landmarks, and all the important details. I found the tour guide very useful last summer when we (my wife and I) went to the Greek island of Rhodes, which was like a museum where we studied Greek history. The amount of information we gained about that area of the world is so tremendous, and all that was because of that distinguished guide.\n\nIn addition to the assistance in obtaining important information from the guide, he is a great help in every other aspect of traveling, like dealing with the people in the 'strange' place, directing us to the greatest places that we must visit, and all the other daily life matters that without him could form a big issue or problem.\n\nFinally, I consider the guide an essential element for a successful trip, and he is indispensable for all the services that he can provide before, during, and even after the trip."}
{"file_id": "107514.txt", "output_essay": "After World War II, one of the bloodiest battles in history, more pacifist communities appeared with the important and helpful assistance of international organizations. Since then, societies have naturally wanted to live in peace without any conflicts therein. Moreover, this perception was supported by economics, and particularly the 1980s were a significant turning point for young people who were educated by their parents, who closely lived through the damages of wars around the world. Hence, young people started to feel themselves isolated from society, and their major purpose was occupation and making as much money as they could. Nowadays, young people do not give enough time to helping their communities. I completely agree with this statement for several reasons. Young people want to enjoy their time before computer screens and video games, and they wish to realize their career goals without paying attention to society. No matter what the percentage is, it is obvious that young people love video games. An increasing number of video games are being experienced, and young people avoid spending time with their family members, friends, and even the members of the community. Yet, the community faces various problems that need to be resolved without delay. For instance, unemployment is a major issue for today's societies. Young people prefer playing video games instead of searching for solutions to unemployment. Since young people are more energetic and active, they could be involved in projects looking for solutions to unemployment. Besides, young people are much more focused on making money instead of addressing fundamental social problems of the community. It is undeniable that career goals are important for young people, but major community problems will eventually affect large numbers of individuals soon. In the last decade of the 20th century, foundations played a great role in society because of their supportive function and well-organized structure as well. Be that as it may, it should be noted that the widespread participation of young people led to this success at that time. In a nutshell, I strongly believe that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. This probably originates from the misleading of youngsters both in school and in the family, but whatever the reason, governments should definitely bring a detailed insight into this situation and produce solutions; otherwise, the whole of society will encounter different problems. This is because younger people are those upon whom society is being built."}

People are widely influenced by watching these advertisements. Many products are marketed through this process.\n\nMost of the products are not as worthwhile as they are portrayed in the advertisements. Marketing personnel do not actually show the reality but try to convince the public that their product is of good quality and quantity; however, they are not.\n\nFor instance, the advertisement of a beauty cream or a face pack is marketed with an attractive presentation, but that product actually does not have much effect on anyone, and the side effects are not mentioned in the advertisement. Similarly, food and snack products do not contribute to health as claimed but are shown in such a way that they can produce lots of energy and strength in a person. Of course, one can't find clothes shining so brightly forever with a detergent or washing powder as shown in the advertisements. It's all about attracting people in a false manner towards their product. It would be fair enough if the real quality of the products were shown in the advertisements. Only a few products have an effect on people in the way they are displayed.\n\nIn conclusion, I do agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are."}
{"file_id": "1000168.txt", "output_essay": "Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. Is this statement correct or not? I think it is quite difficult to answer this question. If I think of my grandmother, was she really more involved in her community? It is possible that at the time, when my grandmother was young, kids and teenagers may have done more for their community. For example, people in those days organized events for the whole community; they were together in a social community and helped each other wherever they could. But this statement can be made for all people of my grandmother's village, not only for young people. On the other hand, my grandmother and also the other children of her age had to work a lot at home and in the fields. So they did not have a lot of time to spend together or to do things for their community. \n\nFurthermore, I think nowadays young people are also socially active. It depends more on where they are living. In rural societies, in a small village for example, the connection between the inhabitants is much closer than in urban areas. In a big city, like Zurich for example, people do not spend a lot of time helping others. The bigger a city is, the more individual and isolated people are. They do not have enough time and also not enough connection with others. And the consequence of this individualism and this isolation is that people, especially young people, are not integrated into the whole society; they have only their peers, but they are not much connected with, or related to, people from different ages or different social and educational backgrounds. These people do not even think about helping their communities. But that is not their problem; that is the problem of the whole society and the difference between urban and rural life."}

There are many alternatives to using a car; there will not be enough space on the routes for all those cars. In addition, I am sure that there will be certain laws in the future to keep the number of cars at a certain level.\n\nToday, one can use the train, a ship, a plane, or even the public transport system to reach different places. These alternatives will become more attractive because of technological progress, which will eventually make their use cheaper. Many people in Germany, for example, prefer to take the train because it is more convenient and is sure to arrive on time.\n\nFurthermore, the oil price has increased over the last few years, and a change cannot be seen. The industry reacted to this problem by building engines that need less petrol, but because of the electronic equipment, the sum of needed petrol could not be reduced.\n\nAnother argument is that cities will become more overcrowded, and there will not be enough space for new cars. For example, in Japan, there is not enough space for new buildings, and the streets have reached a critical size which cannot be enlarged. One solution is that people could share cars to go to work.\n\nAnd finally, there will be certain laws to keep the number of cars at a certain level. The world has many problems with pollution, and governments have just started, for example, to introduce special laws in the faster-growing economies. By doing this, the states want industry and common people to pay more attention to their use of energy. If this group changes its behavior, one consequence could be that fewer new cars will be bought.\n\nIn conclusion, these are my three main arguments why there will be fewer cars in 20 years."}

Wherever people cast their eyes, whether on TV or in the streets, advertising campaigns overwhelm our landscape, filling it with expectations for the products they admire on the screen or in the newspaper. But, unfortunately, most advertisements promise more than they can really deliver to the final customers. The strength of the marketing systems of multinational company brands leads people to dream too much, and the final customers are not very aware of the image techniques companies use to make their products appear more attractive.\n\nThe message an advertisement wants to convey to the final consumer is delicately composed by the marketing systems of the multinational brands. Marketing allows companies to sell dreams through their product campaigns. For example, the consumer does not feel guilty about buying and drinking too much Diet Coke because it is said to be produced with less sugar than the original one. Similarly, those who buy electronic machines to exercise at home in order to get slimmer dream of being fit by using the machine promoted by the ad.\n\nMoreover, people neglect the capacity of image computerization too much. This occurs especially in the cosmetics industry, where brands showcase the merits of their products.

But as long as selling cars provides remuneration to the car industry, one can presume that the number of cars in circulation in the future will mostly depend on whether it will be interesting to buy a car in, let's say, twenty years.\n\nQuite a number of statements are in favor of a reduction of the world's car population in the next years. First, the fact that a good part of the estimations we have tells us that the Earth's oil supplies won't last forever. In fact, with the technologies we are currently using, we can allege that fuel won't be at our disposal anymore by the year 2050. It will, anyway, have become pretty expensive.\n\nSecondly, global warming, being an issue that has to be faced, will require the world's population to decrease its use of fuel, and thus of cars. Stricter laws will imply less pollution in the future.\n\nEventually, the evolution of customs worldwide may occur with the decrease of the number of cars in the next years. Since people are gathering in bigger and bigger cities, the use of subways and buses will grow.\n\nBut the major point is: if the fact that there will be fewer cars in twenty years is not even certain, what is for sure is that cars will be different.\n\nWhy could the world's population demand for cars grow? The first answer is simple: the human population will grow over twenty years for sure. The car demand being correlated to the world's population, the global demand could be more important in the future. Cars can also use less fuel for the same distance, and new petroleum fields can be discovered.\n\nBut since it will soon be more economical, new sources of power will be used in the car industry. For example, oil derived from vegetables can be used with success like in Brazil, not to mention hydrogen energy.\n\nEventually, the question of the global evolution of the car population worldwide is open. I personally allege that there will be more cars in the future, but that they will be more respectful of the environment."}

For example, if students try to remember facts, they might spend more time than if they were understanding the ideas and concepts.

{"file_id": "108264.txt", "output_essay": "In our era, the value of everything is evaluated by the image it creates in the minds of humankind. The most popular technique for creating the desired image is using marketing methodologies. One of the most valid and prevailing marketing tactics is advertising. Some factions believe that advertisements have the power to make products seem better than they really are, while others assert that it is impossible to make a product seem better by deceiving customers, thanks to numerous legal legislations and institutional controls. However, to me, both sides can be correct under different conditions.\n\nFirst, not all countries have laws and legislations for broadcasting fair advertisements that accurately reflect the product as it is. In such cases, producers can make their products appear more qualified in advertisements. For example, consider the cream used for decoration on top of cakes. In advertisements, the manufacturer might use shaving cream instead of cake cream to benefit from shaving cream's durability and viscosity, if there are no regulations about the ethics that should be upheld in advertisements. Because they are the same color, nobody can distinguish the shaving cream displayed in the advertisement from normal cake cream, and all advertisement viewers would probably think that it is a marvelous brand to buy compared to others, as no normal cake cream can appear in such good shape and durability. As a result, if there is no legal incentive for truthful advertising, with the help of spurious substitutes, the product may be presented as more qualified.\n\nHowever, if there is sufficient legislation governing advertising procedures in a country, it is impossible to deceive customers by providing false information about a product or using a counterfeit product, as the manufacturer is aware that he will be punished by the laws if he even attempts to do so. For instance, in the USA, if a producer wants an actor to give a testimony for his product, it is mandatory that the actor should have used the product for six months before the advertisement.\n\nIn summary, in advertisements, it is quite possible to make a product seem more qualified than it is if there are no laws governing such practices. Therefore, more laws should be enacted on this issue."}

There are three main reasons why I hold this opinion.\n\nFirstly, I support the idea that understanding ideas and concepts in a field (for instance, economics) provides an overall comprehension of that field and the processes that can occur within it. Thus, it allows graduate students entering the labor market to meet the requirements of numerous jobs, even if they did not study certain specifics of some tasks.\n\nSecondly, I believe that when a student has a good grasp of ideas and concepts in a field, they are then able not only to understand new events that can take place in this area but also to learn from these events themselves.\n\nFinally, from my perspective, facts are highly dependent on the time and the conditions in which they occur. Consequently, an event that took place in a certain situation or country, for example, a major workers' strike in France before a change in political majority, cannot be interpreted in the same way as one in Bangladesh during a very harsh time. Furthermore, facts may be linked to a fashion in the way of thinking or the way of producing goods. An illustration of this idea could be the fact that an American citizen sold a lot of French foie gras because he liked it at a certain period, but ceased to do so because of a change in both the relationship between the American and French governments, and the way the treatment of ducks is considered.\n\nHowever, I admit that learning facts may help to understand concepts that are either not concrete at all or a little difficult.

I have no doubts they would use as many resources as they have to undermine every idea or project that could result in a contraction of their market.\n\nAnother example is the fuel industry, better said, the business of Mobil, BP, Texaco, and a few more brands. They have been investing billions of dollars trying to avoid the development of alternative sources of energy for automobiles. Their biggest business is to produce car fuel, and they won't let it go so easily. If they are contrary to car transformations, logically they will fight fiercely against the diminishment of automobiles.\n\nAnother example of how economic issues won't let the number of cars go smaller is the fact that public investment in Western countries consists mainly of road building. About 50% of the public budgets all around Western countries are used to allow car circulation. If the number of such vehicles radically goes down, it will produce a huge administrative collapse since the traditional political economy would be threatened.\n\nIn conclusion, neither the tire industry, nor the fuel producers, nor the public planners and administrators of Western countries will allow the numbers of cars in use to decrease.

Cars are very convenient, but they come with many problems. I agree with the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today for three reasons.\n\nFirst, if the number of people who use cars frequently decreases, it will be easier to solve the environmental problems in the world. Cars consume a lot of fuel and emit bad gases. This is a very serious problem. Bad gases are harmful to people. If people are exposed to a lot of car emissions, they might become sick. Especially, little children are very vulnerable. If children are exposed to a lot of gas on the road, they might become very ill. Today, fuel prices are very expensive, and many people are worried about money. However, many people still use cars frequently. People must think about the environment. The Earth is ours.\n\nSecond, if people don't use cars as often, there will be no areas of heavy traffic jams. In the world, there are many cities where traffic jams occur, especially in developed countries. For example, in Japan, heavy traffic jams occur every morning in the capital city of Tokyo. This is a very serious problem. The Japanese government has built a lot of new highways and roads, but the number of cars has not decreased significantly. I think that the biggest reason for this is that the price of cars has decreased and many people can buy cars easily. The best way to decrease the number of cars, I think, is for the Japanese government to implement a tax on car usage. If the Japanese government does this, the number of cars will decrease.\n\nThird, if fewer people use cars, there will be less danger. Getting a driver's license is too easy. Of course, not all people have good driving skills, and sometimes, traffic accidents occur. If the test for a driver's license becomes more difficult, fewer people will be able to drive, and traffic accidents will decrease.\n\nIn conclusion, if fewer people drive cars, we can solve many problems. Therefore, I hope that more people will use trains or buses, and as a result, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today."}

{"file_id": "1005891.txt", "output_essay": "Cars are one of the major means of transportation. In fact, when the opportunities, such as comfort and rapid access to locations, are considered, it is the inevitable vehicle for people. Although some may argue that cars cause certain problems such as congestion or air pollution, I do not foresee any change in the number of cars in use in the coming twenty years.\n\nIt is debated that cities are so full of cars that in the near future, people will not be able to use cars due to the crowd. Besides, the traffic jams that cars create are proposed to be solved by decreasing the number of cars. However, one should also take into account the vital importance of cars to human life. Cars are integrated into the lifestyle of people. They are used ubiquitously in public life. People go to work, or urgent patients are delivered to hospitals by cars. In fact, a car is a symbol of civilization.\n\nA second point is that cars lead to the problem of air pollution. Exhaust gases are thought to cause air pollution, and the greenhouse effect is triggered. This is true, but it does not mean that the number of cars in use should decrease. This problem can be solved by changing the energy source that cars utilize. For example, solar or hydrogen energy can be considered as alternatives.\n\nIn conclusion, in my opinion, the number of cars in use is not expected to decrease. Instead, it becomes more widespread; however, the source of energy cars consume may change."}
{"file_id": "105179.txt", "output_essay": "I completely agree with the statement. Success is attained by pushing yourself to the limits, out of your comfort zone, and conquering the challenge, whatever it may be. Through preparation and acumen, and utilizing what you have learned from your past experiences, stepping out of the comfort zone and facing a challenge directly is the best way to increase stamina and tolerance that will help make you become stronger.\n\nFor example, being a martial arts student and observing the successful moves of my mentor and chief instructor, I can confidently state that he practices for success. I met my instructor when he was merely a senior student; once he became the chief instructor and owner of the school, he revolutionized the curriculum to do things that had not been done before—this is getting out of your comfort zone, knowing that you are doing well, but that you know you are capable of further success. The chief instructor decided to expand the curriculum and incorporate social activities that would benefit the people in the community. In order to do this, he was forced to expand his staff on contract—this means that he committed to employ this staff for at least a year—regardless of the outcome from the changes in the curriculum. To make the story short, the exposure to community activity increased the popularity of our school, and the respect, reputation, and profits that came along with it. It would have been financially challenging for the school to have staff that would not have been needed, had the social activities addition to the curriculum not succeeded—he would have thought of something, though. The chief instructor was looking to be more successful through innovation and thinking out of the box, and in my opinion, he attained his goal.\n\nAnother example, and a more common one, is the introduction of Microsoft Windows as an operating system in the 1990s. Before Windows came about, most operating systems were based on prompt and response, and people were used to it. Systems like DOS and Linux that were monotonous, but worked well. Mr. Gates took a tremendous risk in creating a whole new interface to use on the computer, an interface that was more expensive and complex, but turned out to be more effective and entertaining for most users. Nowadays, Windows is the most popular operating system. Taking risks means thinking out of the box; moreover, it takes courage and confidence to materialize the idea. Mr. Gates thought Windows would work, took steps to attain his goal, and succeeded.\n\nIn conclusion, trying new things, while risky, can improve the individual and the outcome through challenging our endurance and tolerance. No one says it will be easy, but if you are persistent enough, you will eventually succeed."}

Both opinions are good ideas, but I agree that it's better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects because that's helpful to meet a variety of people in my life, and every major is related to each other.\n\nFirst of all, broad knowledge is helpful in society. I've been in New York City for 3 years now, and I've met a lot of different people during my life in New York. I've met people from other countries, I could try different foods, I saw different customs, and I saw a lot of different religions. In the very first English class I had in New York, there were 10 classmates in my classroom. Everybody was from a different country, and they introduced themselves on the first day of class. I thought I had enough knowledge about other countries, but for some of my classmates, I had never heard of where their country is. That was a very big shame for me, and I felt sorry for them. Our country is also very small, so some of our classmates didn't know where Korea is. Also, some people still ask me which part of Korea I am from. When they asked me, I was shocked because North Koreans can't move to other countries. Koreans who live in other countries are all South Koreans. For me, that's very basic knowledge, but other people don't know. That time, I realized I should learn about other cultures because I felt bad when they don't know about my country.\n\nAlso, every major is related to each other. My major is interior design. Before I started to study interior design, I thought I would learn only drawing and measuring. But when I started to study, I had to learn mathematics, history, and art—everything. I wondered why I had to take all these classes. But after I started studying, I realized why I had to study. I had to learn history to understand how interior design evolved, who started to design rooms, and why. After learning history, I could understand easily and faster. Also, I took mathematics classes that helped me to calculate all my measurements when I draw.\n\nIn conclusion, I agree that it's better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects because that's helpful to meet people in my life, and every major is related to each other."}
{"file_id": "1001604.txt", "output_essay": "It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. I agree with this because it is crucial for every student to comprehend something rather than just memorize it. By understanding, the student can continue on the path of knowledge and can acquire more information to confirm that they have grasped the concept before learning the facts.\n\nA student, being a human being, cannot skip the main ideas of understanding and the concepts of the study. Without understanding, the student would struggle and not be able to learn the facts clearly. Understanding the study in steps is beneficial because it avoids all the mistakes that a student can make.\n\nUnderstanding ideas and concepts is a must for all students, but it has to be done in steps before learning it directly. After understanding, the student can learn the facts more easily. Schools are established to provide students with a brief explanation of how it's done and how to understand the ideas before analyzing them and learning the facts.\n\nColleges, with their different administrations and majors, give students the opportunity to understand the ideas of the study they are pursuing. Schools are there to facilitate this understanding. Afterward, when a student graduates from school and goes to college, they would be ready to learn the facts because they would have already grasped the ideas and concepts. However, it is not as important for the student to learn the facts as it is to understand the ideas and concepts.\n\nThe main idea of this essay is that any student, anywhere in the world, should understand the ideas and concepts before thinking about learning the facts. Understanding the ideas and concepts gives the student a chance to truly know the subject."}

As such, they tend to project their product as an essential purchase for one's happiness and well-being. I personally feel that they make their products appear much better and more useful than they actually are.\n\nSome advertisements slightly inflate the usefulness of their product, while others make them appear to create outstanding results or even miracles in one's life. For example, take any aerated drink advertisement. They use prominent sportsmen like David Beckham or Michael Jordan to endorse their products, showing the audience how their drink would enhance one's performance to become like their idols. Everyone knows that having a drink won't make them a star or play like one, but just seeing their idols in the advertisement may persuade them to purchase it. This may work for any purchase not costing much, and people may make the small purchase either way without the advertisement; it's just a matter of which brand to go for.\n\nAnother way they make their products look much better is by persuading people to purchase the product because it will make them look attractive and will influence their personal lives as well. Take the case of all the beauty products which promise to make you look better and more attractive by spending a small amount on them. These advertisements may actually get the audience's attention because everyone wants to look better by spending the minimal amount of money. These advertisements may particularly catch the attention of teenagers who are always ready to spend on any product that makes them look better in front of their peers.\n\nWhile some products may rope in big stars to get their point across, some may cash in on the small desires of the audience and ultimately market their product in the best possible way. By and large, in most advertisements, overexaggeration of the product is what we witness. The competing products are shown in a light where we feel incomplete without using them."}

It reminds me of a French proverb that says, 'we are not twenty years old every day.'\n\nFirst of all, it is a fact that children and teenagers are more carefree than adults and elderly people. They do not worry about the problems adults often face. Their only priority is to go to school, which leaves plenty of time to enjoy life.\n\nBy the way, young people have a lot of things to discover, especially children who do not have any experience of life. Going to the cinema, to the zoo, to the circus, enables children to apprehend the world they are living in.

The phenomenon appears in a lot of different categories, but one of the most important ones is business. Success is often associated with money, which means that a well-known company would take more risks than a small family business. That is not completely true since one has to remember that the opportunities of a big company are much higher because they have the financial resources. But if one compares a successful company with an unsuccessful company, one will see that the company with a high profit is risking more than the other one.\n\nFor example, Coca-Cola is nowadays one of the most successful companies in the world. But it did not start from the beginning as a big company. It started with only one product called Cola. When Coca-Cola was established on the world market, the Coca-Cola company increased its profit each year. After that, the Coca-Cola company took a huge leap of faith and invested in new products called Fanta and Sprite. That was very risky because people might not like the new drinks and would not buy them, so that the Coca-Cola company would not get back their production costs. But even if they would have lost all the money they invested into the new product, the Coca-Cola company would have remained as a successful company.\n\nIn general, successful businesses take risks more often to gain even more profit rather than unsuccessful businesses because it does not matter to them if they lose."}

First, specializing in one specific subject is very useful for getting a job. For example, when you want to be a carpenter, if you learn about carpentry specifically, you can become a carpenter more easily than if you learn broad knowledge, because you learn deeply about carpentry, and a carpenter does not need too much broad knowledge.\n\nSecond, having broad knowledge lets you take more time to learn than specializing in one specific subject. This is a very serious problem for people because their graduation will be delayed, and the time to get a job becomes later.\n\nThird, specializing in one specific subject saves costs to learn. For example, if you have broad knowledge, you have to spend a lot of money on many textbooks to learn all of them. In contrast, if you want to specialize in one subject, you can get a few textbooks about just that subject. So, you do not have to spend much money to get materials for learning.\n\nIn conclusion, it is good to specialize in one specific subject because of the advantages in getting jobs and saving time and cost. These are very important reasons."}

However, a guide could still provide lots of information that I had never heard of. Therefore, I can say that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.\n\nFirst, tour guides can provide a wealth of information. When we travel alone or in groups without guides, we have to depend on guidebooks to gather information about what we are looking at. This gives us a limited amount of information. However, guides have studied for a long time. For example, to obtain a tour guide license in Japan, a guide needs to major in Japanese culture. So they know many things that we cannot learn from books. For instance, at the Guell Park constructed by Antoni Gaudi, there is a famous bench which is really comfortable because the design considered the human biological structure. Our group thought that this bench shows another genius aspect of Gaudi. However, our guide told us that this bench was not made by Gaudi, but by another architect who worked with him. No book included that fact.\n\nSecond, guides know a lot about the region, so we can experience special things. Guides know where to have great meals, where to buy the best gifts, and they understand local culture. For instance, my guide suggested a restaurant and we had a meal together. My guide told me that if I show the chef that I am enjoying the meal by making a certain gesture, then they will feel appreciated. I did it, and I got extra chicken soup for free.\n\nTour guides are experts. They can offer information that is not mentioned in books. Since they know a lot about the area, we can experience many things that other tourists cannot. The best way to travel is by following the lead of a wise and smart tour guide."}
{"file_id": "1009747.txt", "output_essay": "Whether most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are is a good question. The advertisement is made to increase the sales of the product. So, the more the qualities of the product that people know, the greater the sales. Then it can be that some advertisements make products seem much better.\n\nAn example is the depiction of food products; in the image on the box, they seem very beautiful and also very good to eat. But when you open the box and see the product inside, you understand that the product on the box is very different.\n\nWhen I was a child and I saw the advertisement for a toy, I wanted that toy because in the advertisement it moved a lot, spoke a lot, and it had beautiful colors. But when I got the toy, it was static, spoke only four or five words, and it had dull colors.\n\nIn this case, advertising is used to increase sales using the little child that, when they see something that looks beautiful, they want that. There are also some rules that say that the advertisements must respect the quality of the product, but these rules are not always followed. To tell the truth, there are also some advertisements that represent the products as they really are. But these are not many because if you show in an advertisement a product that is not beautiful, people prefer to buy another product that seems more beautiful in the advertisement, maybe even if it costs more."}

Since technology has interfered in their lives, people have started to perform these activities at home. This has led people to become a bit more isolated. Some may define this as good, but I personally define it as 'bad'.\n\nOn the other hand, what I can define as 'good' is that helping people has become easier now. For example, if you want to make a donation, you do not need to go to the charity or the bank; you just open the internet, type the address, and provide your credit card number. It is so easy.\n\nFinally, because of these reasons, I strongly believe that young people are devoting enough time to helping the community."}

As an example, I would like to talk about my grandfather: until the age of almost eighty years, he enjoyed his life. During his lifetime, he had a lot of terrible experiences; in fact, he went to the Second World War and he lost his first son. All those experiences gave him additional strength.\n\nI also think that being an adolescent can be very hard because, in this sort of twilight, you still don't know what to do when an important choice has to be made. On the other hand, elderly people have gained the necessary experience to make considered and rational choices. Another factor that makes me state that you can still enjoy life even if you are old is that, in modern days, there have been many improvements in the medical field that, as a consequence, have led to an average better condition of elderly people. All these factors, such as a broader vision of things given by experience, a deep knowledge of oneself, and the recent improvements in the health conditions of the elderly, make me see my future years in an optimistic way and make me look at the future with no fear."}

Having more knowledge could broaden one's horizon, serve as a path to discover one's true passion, help with talking to other people, and be capable of understanding the world around us.\n\nFirstly, having more knowledge of many academic subject areas could broaden our horizons because we know different subjects in different fields. Each specific subject has its own uniqueness; therefore, it would be better to know a bit about each area.\n\nSecondly, understanding more knowledge could serve as a path for people to discover their 'real' passion. Sometimes, if we are always 'inside the box,' it would be hard for us to find other hobbies and have the opportunity to think whether it was truly their passion or not. When I was in Grade 11, I studied courses in different areas, such as Chemistry, Accounting, Physical Education, Business, History, etc. I wasn't sure of what I wanted to study at university, and I didn't want to limit my area of study; therefore, I decided to broaden my knowledge by taking many academic subjects. However, my friend, who desperately wanted to become a doctor, took all science courses because she had discovered her passion. As a result, I think it would be better to have broad knowledge of many subjects before specializing in one, unless you have found something that you really love doing.\n\nMoreover, by understanding more subjects, it would be easier for people to engage in conversations with new people. Everyone has different backgrounds; therefore, if you have knowledge from different areas, it could be easier to socialize with people who have different fields than you do. One way of knowing more subjects is to read every section of the newspaper, such as Business, World, Entertainment, etc. This could help one to gain more knowledge and therefore be more talkative when meeting new people.\n\nSince the world changes every day, something new will happen every day. If we don't have the basic background in a certain subject, we will not be able to understand it. Moreover, a lot of subjects are interrelated; therefore, you will need knowledge from other areas in order to fully understand the material. For example, business ties with politics; political changes could affect the business environment, therefore it is essential for us to have a simple background in politics in order to understand business changes around the world.\n\nIn conclusion, with all the reasons stated above, I believe that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject."}

Even a simple biological experiment requires the effort of people from different fields such as chemists and physicists. Had there been no chemist to provide chemicals and reagents for purifying DNA, and had there not been any physicist to develop machinery for us, we would not have sequenced the genetic material in us, and the use of these requires knowledge of these areas. The various exams, such as the one I am giving, also make us realize that it is better to have broader knowledge of many academic subjects.\n\nAlso, I feel that having broader knowledge increases the learning and application power. We can think bigger and put our vast knowledge to do great innovation. We should have general studies about culture and history even if we study science. In various interviews and examinations, the questionnaires are not from what we have learned specifically but about our knowledge, and I feel it's good too because this can only tell how much we know about things happening around us.\n\nBroader knowledge not only helps us lead a successful life but also makes us an improved human being.

However, this can cause some misunderstandings for consumers since most advertisements present products in a better light than they actually are. This essay will discuss the deceptive nature of advertising and try to find a solution to counteract it.\n\nIt is evident that many people have faced problems with products they purchased because advertisements only highlight the positive aspects of the product. None of the advertisements mention the negative features of the products they are trying to market. Moreover, due to competition, producers may choose not to disclose all instructions of the product through advertisements since a well-informed consumer might change their mind and choose another product. In addition, with advancements in computer technology, consumers are being lured by visual effects in the industry, leading them to assume that the product is suitable for them or as good as it appears in the advertisement.\n\nIn conclusion, most advertisements take an unfair stance in favor of the product. Although the advertising sector should be improved, this does not mean it has the right to infringe upon the rights of consumers and other producers competing in the market. Because of this situation, the competition and consumer boards of the countries have to monitor advertisements, and consumers must be informed about their legal rights against the producers."}

For instance, traffic jams are becoming more and more common not only in big cities, such as New York or London, but also in smaller ones, such as Lyon or Bilbao. It is known that the car is the most used mode of transport, and all of us use it to go everywhere, although gas prices are getting higher and despite the pollution that it creates. That's the reason why I believe that the number of cars in twenty years won't decrease and, actually, I think it will increase for several reasons.\n\nFirstly, the number of people who belong to the labor force is increasing, and unemployment, in contrast, is going down. So, more people working means an increase in funds for those people and more people who need to go to work. Maybe not all of them will buy a new car, but many of them definitely will.\n\nSecondly, living standards are becoming higher as time goes by in developed countries. Then, although some years ago there was just one car per family, nowadays there are usually at least two. And as living standards go up, the number of cars will too, as parents will start buying cars for each of their sons and daughters.\n\nLast but not least, we are witnessing the economic explosion of some developing countries, such as China, for instance. The economic growth in China is huge, and the increase in car sales is huge too. All the international companies are going to China for both selling and producing cars, as their past production is not enough to cover the current demand. According to the opinion of the most famous economists, they expect this economic period to last many more years. Moreover, this phenomenon does not only affect China but also other developing countries such as those in South America and so on.\n\nIn conclusion, I sincerely believe that all of these factors explain clearly that the number of cars is going to increase, and it will be bigger in twenty years than it is now."}

Even though organized tours are usually cheaper and more convenient, I think traveling on your own is a richer experience for several reasons.\n\nThe first reason for my belief is that organized tours bring you to the most touristic sites. These places are overcrowded by other tourists, and as a matter of fact, attract also many local merchants that sell small commodities at expensive prices all along your way. For example, during my trip to China, the tour guide showed us a part of the Great Wall called 'Badaling.' The place was full of people; I could hardly walk up the wall, it was very unpleasant! On a second trip, I went by myself to another point of the Great Wall, which was further from the city than Badaling, but there were far fewer people. Also, the scenery was much more spectacular.\n\nThe second reason why I dislike organized trips is that you don't have the choice of the timetable. Every visit is precisely scheduled and we should not stay overtime; otherwise, the bus or tour guide would leave you at the point it dropped you. A visit to the Louvre museum in Paris is not worthwhile if you can only appreciate the 'Mona Lisa' painting and not contemplate the other, less famous, paintings.\n\nLast but not least, I strongly believe that the most interesting part of traveling is when you make contact with the local people. In my trips to foreign countries, I learned a lot through the visit of the country, but I also learned many things about the culture through conversations with locals. It may be disgusting to see Chinese people spitting in the street. But once you understand that they do that to reject bad elements (such as those coming from pollution) instead of keeping them in their body, you may find it smart or at least understandable. Communicating with people, that is how you begin to respect their culture.\n\nTo conclude, as per my experience, I always recommend people to make a trip on their own and not with a guide. This is the best way to discover, understand, and respect a culture."}
{"file_id": "1006416.txt", "output_essay": "Travel is an activity that could be traced as far back as the beginnings of humanity. Thanks to travel, remote lands were populated, empires were built, and civilizations were conquered. Over the centuries, travel has had a social connotation: an activity that is usually done in a group. However, that does not mean that it is uniquely a social activity. Many individuals often travel by themselves and enjoy individual travel.\n\nTravel is either a leisure or a business activity. For the purpose of this essay, and due to the nature of the question, leisure travel will be addressed. Tourism is a multibillion-dollar business that responds to a wide range of market demands. Over the years, it has become more and more refined. A person, or a family, can find everything from vacation packages to the Caribbean to tours into space.\n\nTravel in groups led by a tour guide are often well-organized trips: the number of people is set, the destinations are well assessed, the timing for each activity is carefully structured, and the tour guide is usually a tourism professional. People bond together when traveling in a group. In addition, because of economies of scale, another potential benefit of group travel is the lower and more affordable costs for the tourist. Group travel is often cheaper than individual travel.\n\nHowever, group travels led by a tour guide may also have disadvantages. People in tour groups are tied to the destinations, schedules, and timing of the tour. If someone wants to visit a different place or stay longer at a stop, it is likely that such options are not available. Also, they are often tied to the meals and hotels offered by the tour. So, if a person does not like any of these, it would be very hard—or more costly—to change them. In summary, people who travel in groups led by a tour guide are more restricted than when traveling by themselves.\n\nThere is no right or wrong answer for advocating or rejecting group travel led by a tour guide. It depends on the individual or family's preferences, as well as on the available budget, and ultimately the degree of privacy and restrictions that a person is comfortable with when traveling."}
{"file_id": "1006883.txt", "output_essay": "I do agree with the fact that successful people have challenging careers that lead them to hold risky positions.\n\nA successful person may be qualified as such because he or she has been distinguished from others who have not achieved the same level of success. And someone has, of course, many more opportunities to be distinguished in a challenging and difficult environment than in a simple one. In the latter kind of environment, many people may fulfill their duties in a competent way, and we generally expect them to do so; consequently, it is a normal situation that does not lead to any particular kind of success. On the contrary, by having a challenging career, someone may face many quandaries and diverse kinds of problems. The exposure is greater.\n\nBy being in risky positions, people are not expected to succeed every time; they may fail, but when they manage to solve a problem or develop a difficult or new business, then they are distinguished and become successful.\n\nAnother important point is that being in a challenging environment and taking risks allows people to break the everyday life routine. Indeed, by facing new and difficult situations, people do not have time to get bored. Their motivation can be very high, considering the stakes. Following that idea, we can assume that people may fulfill their duties with more enthusiasm than in less risky positions. Indeed, we can easily become bored by doing something we know well, so we could give less importance to our job and replace it with other things, which is not at all to be underestimated. People may have different priorities or qualities in life that are not suited to a complex environment.\n\nFor these reasons, I do agree with the statement, and my opinion can be easily verified with successful people such as politicians or businessmen who have faced difficult positions."}
{"file_id": "114907.txt", "output_essay": "I agree that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. If they already know how to do something well, they don't take any risks.\n\nTo be successful doesn't mean you will succeed at everything you try, but it does mean you can try everything and still succeed. Someone successful will want to try anything to see if they can still be successful. If that person tries only some things they know how to do well, they are not really a successful person.\n\nFor example, I am good at playing piano, so that was pretty successful at first. But now, I've never played guitar, and when I try, I'm not really good at the beginning. However, I take some lessons and, really fast, I get really good at playing guitar. That means I am a successful person.\nNow, I am a good dancer; I know how to dance, but I do not try anything else except dance. So, I am a good dancer, but I am not a successful person because the only thing where I succeed is the thing I already know.\n\nSomeone successful is someone who tries new things without knowing if they will be good or bad, and finally, because they are successful, they are going to be good at those new things.\n\nTo be really successful, you of course have to try lots of things so you can know how successful you are. Being successful at only a couple of things does not mean you are really successful.\n\nFor example, after trying to play guitar, I can now try another instrument, and another one... If I still succeed at every one, I am a really successful person.\n\nSo, if you really want to be a successful person, you need to try new things and take risks. If you do not, you are just someone who looks like they are successful but, in reality, you are not successful."}

The fact, in some measure, is how the situation has been developed. The facts help students to understand more efficiently and quickly because the facts can explain the details about the situation, and they can obtain a better idea about what they are studying.\n\nThere are many ideas and concepts about topics depending on the way the person understands the facts. To explain this opinion, I'm going to give you an example: The fact that children have to study is a general idea, but there are many concepts around this fact. However, the fact always has to be known; as a result, many ideas and concepts begin to be developed. For example, some people can say that they don't agree with this fact, but many persons agree with the fact that it is important for children to study and they should do it. Only in this fact, we have two different ideas, and if we continue analyzing the fact, we are going to obtain many reasons to agree or disagree with it, but the fact doesn't change; it is like the root of the situation or topic.\n\nIn conclusion, I think that it is more important for students to understand the facts, and then they can understand the ideas of other people and form their own ideas about the situation and prove them."}
{"file_id": "1009929.txt", "output_essay": "First of all, I would like to make it clear that the objectives of marketing and publicity are to highlight the positive aspects of the products they are presenting. Therefore, it is most natural to find that advertisements often make products seem much better than they really are. However, this is related to consumer impressions, not to an issue with the advertisement creators.\n\nIt could be a problem if the advertisement tells lies during its presentations or presents inaccurate information that could lead consumers to an invalid choice. For example, if a detergent advertisement presents a cleaning proof, comparing two types of detergents, it must present the true results because there are laws that protect consumers against abuse and misinformation.\n\nBecause of these laws, the advertising world has to be very careful in the presentation of facts and images. Over the years, they have developed many tactics for saying the maximum great things about their products without telling a lie, but making consumers think that their products are the best, when sometimes that is not the case.\n\nFor example, when talking about beauty products on TV, every day we can see supermodels using creams and beauty products that they claim put the skin or hair in excellent condition. However, we are fooling ourselves if we think that using these products will make us as beautiful as those supermodels. That is not the fault of the advertisement creators because it is their job to try to make their products the most desirable for us.\n\nFinally, consumers need to be realistic and critical of the current advertising world, weighing all the concepts and knowledge they have to determine if a product is as good as it is presented."}
{"file_id": "116669.txt", "output_essay": "I think that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts rather than to merely learn facts, henceforth agreeing with the statement. One of the best examples to support this statement goes back in time before the Renaissance period in Europe. The Roman Catholic Church at that time was the ruling authority. They proposed false facts that the Earth was the center of the solar system and that all the other planets revolved around it. This was taught to the masses, and at that time, preference was given to the facts, even if they were untrue, regardless of the underlying concepts of how a solar system worked. So even if the fact didn't have any underlying idea or concept, it was given importance, thus resulting in people living under a lie.\n\nNow, if the idea that understanding and conceptualizing was more important than just learning mere facts had been presented at that time, there would have been a great advancement in the knowledge of the universe even before the Renaissance period.\n\nThe statement also supports one of the idioms that 'necessity is the mother of invention.' If students are exposed to only facts, which are a kind of invention by others who understood ideas before, there would not be any room for free thinking, and the result, which in this case is the future (students are the future), would be stagnated!\n\nAlso, I believe that some facts can be altered and/or proved wrong by understanding ideas and concepts. Again, the example stated above serves for this statement. During the Renaissance period, the false facts were proved wrong by free thinkers like Galileo with the help of their ability to understand ideas and concepts. Great discoveries and inventions were made at that period, and many new facts were established.\n\nThus, all in all, we can consider that one needs to develop ideas and concepts in order to make facts in the first place, and that facts are just a resultant part of it."}

In this game, people with a broad knowledge of many academic subjects and a knack for conversation will have the upper hand. However, once the dinner has ended, such proficiency in so many areas might prove to be little more than an annoying character flaw.\n\nKnowledge is a vital tool for understanding ourselves and the world we live in. So, what is wrong with trying to know as much as possible about as many academic subjects as possible? One answer to that question could be that the pursuit is self-defeating; indeed, the more we learn, the more we realize how little we know. Given this state of affairs, pursuing knowledge for its own sake might seem absurd. The acquisition of knowledge should be motivated by something other than intellectual pleasure.\n\nEach person has his or her own personal interests, career objectives, ambitions, dreams, or big unresolved questions. These could drive people to want to know more. Moreover, these forces will often lead someone to look deeper into one specific subject rather than into others.\n\nOn the other hand, valuing knowledge for its own sake can lead people to waste their efforts in an incoherent way in a vain attempt to know more. Finally, a motivated approach to one or a few subjects might lead someone to understand things better, to find answers, or even to achieve something.\n\nTo conclude, it might be better to specialize in one specific subject than to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects. Above all, it is important that this pursuit of knowledge should be motivated by something other than the arrogant goal of just wanting to know more."}

A guide is a person who is specially appointed by the government for the benefit of visitors. He is capable of providing explicit information about tourist places. So why not take advantage of the service provided when one is in a group?\n\nSuppose you are traveling in India with a group of friends. Here, the inscriptions giving technical details about tourist places are very limited. So a guide will thoroughly delight one with the dates, history, and all its related matters. Moreover, if a guide is not hired, it might happen that some of your friends may go in other directions as per their interest, lose the fun of being together, and acknowledge less information.\n\nIt's always greater fun to be together while visiting places. Else, one may get bored. So if a group has hired a guide, it will be rather involuntary that the group will stay bonded. So there's no risk of losing someone behind on the trip.\n\nThe process of seeing new things will be extremely sequential and meaningful because the guide will proceed step by step, giving out intriguing information. The group members might have some doubts regarding the monuments. So it might happen that one might be able to understand the history better based on others' doubts. They could even discuss more things if they have come on a school assignment trip for the history class. Also, the guide will not dare to skip things in order to save time and get more money as he fears the number of people. It usually happens in India, though. But the more people there are, the greater the interest, and this directly affects the enthusiasm of the guide.\n\nA group could even share the tour guide's expense, so they could hire a better guide than an individual. It's a more harmless option, giving all the group members equal benefits with all the fun combined with traveling."}

As the title suggests, young and old, we can say that the young will have more capability and ability than the old to enjoy life. There are many factors for that, like improvement in technology, considering the age factor, stress factor, etc.\n\nAs there is improvement in technology day by day, there are new things for enjoyment, like going for drives, spending their leisure time with friends in pubs and restaurants, many amusement parks which give recreation from their daily workload, etc. Normally, older people cannot make their way to the above-mentioned places because it may be because of their age, health, and some may not know also who stay in remote areas about these kinds of places and what mostly older people want is to spend their life peacefully—free from all the tensions—and most of them will spend at their home itself with their grandchildren and by some other means.\n\nMost young people will enjoy more compared to older people because of stress also. It is also one of the factors because they have to work all the time from morning to evening with full stress and to overcome that stress, there should be some means of enjoyment which were not available at the time of their elders. Moreover, as they were young, they are energetic and they have the ability to roam around the places with complete enthusiasm.\n\nConsider an example of a 20-year-old boy and his grandfather. The boy has many ways and opportunities to enjoy his life as he is energetic firstly, and there are many ways for his enjoyment as there is improvement in technology, whereas his grandfather cannot enjoy as the boy does because he is older and his age may not be cooperative with that. It may also be that he may not be familiar with new kinds of enjoyments which were brought by technology.\n\nAs there is more improvement in technology, there are many ways to enjoy as mentioned in the above paragraphs, and surely our next generations will enjoy more than what we are enjoying now as there will be improvements in technology in the coming years, and they will have better opportunities more than what we have.\n\nOf course, there are some ways for older people also to enjoy, but their health conditions may not support that. So, I strongly support the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do by considering certain factors and examples which were mentioned in the above paragraphs."}

When you really think about it, if we specialize in one specific subject, we would have more time to dedicate to it, and also we would become more expert in it.\n\nWhen we focus on one thing, we can spend more time on it than when we are interrupted by other things. It's like that. People do not have two separate spirits. Once we are interrupted, we might lose the important parts that we had been focused on. It would be too hard for normal people.\n\nSecondly, when we specialize in a specific subject, we pay more attention to it. We wouldn't be confused by two things. That way, we remember more information from the things we studied.\n\nLastly, there is always something that we're good at and not good at.

So, I bought the bag with a credit card. When I received the bag, I was disappointed because it was not as big as the photo. Then I swore not to buy any bags through the internet anymore.

{"file_id": "1000528.txt", "output_essay": "I disagree with the statement about how advertisements are. There are several reasons.\n\nFirstly, excessive advertisement confuses the consumer. Usually, consumers buy goods based on the information that the company advertises. When the goods are not what they thought they would be, they must be confused. For me, I wanted to lose weight, so I bought an exercise machine. The advertisement claimed I could lose weight without suffering, and that was very attractive to me. I immediately decided to buy the machine. Upon using it, I found that it is very difficult to use and demanding. I gave up using the machine.\n\nSecondly, I think that companies which prevail through excessive advertising lose their reputation. As I suffered from the problem mentioned above, I do not have any confidence in the company. The company still sells the same machine and promotes the method of losing weight; I have serious doubts about the advertisement and whether it is actually good for me.\n\nThirdly, this is not good for my country's society. Although excessive advertisement is needed for gaining more money, it is not permitted by the nation. It is tantamount to lying to the customer. Once such advertisements are permitted, they could spread all over my country. This situation is not good for my country's society. For example, food is to be sold with a consumption deadline because it is safe to eat until that date. But recently, the consumption deadline dates are intentionally changed by companies. This is very discouraging for my country's citizens.\n\nFor these reasons, I disagree with the statement."}

It is true that environmental problems related to oil are rising nowadays, and many car companies, such as Toyota Motors in Japan, are hastening the development of new transportation systems that could replace car-based transportation. Some people, especially those who live in metropolitan areas, may use such modes of transportation. As a result, the number of cars may decrease in those areas.\n\nHowever, there is a condition for an area to transition to such systems. These areas should be well-developed in terms of infrastructure and economics. In other words, areas that are currently developing cannot afford to buy or develop such systems. On the other hand, the demand for cars is thought to be increasing as the economy grows. Additionally, cars are available for a smaller amount of money than what it costs to adopt a new transportation system.\n\nGlobally speaking, the population in developing countries is higher than that in developed countries. If so, the speed at which the number of cars is increasing in developing countries may exceed the rate of decrease in developed countries.

{"file_id": "115952.txt", "output_essay": "I do agree with the statement that advertisements make products seem better than they are. This should come as no surprise, as an advertisement, by definition, responds to an aim. The aim is not to provide information to the consumer (for which there is the press), but rather, to make the particular product more appealing. An advertisement is supposed to increase the sales of a particular product, which is sold for a profit, of course. So, the manipulation of the human individual is the purpose of the advertisement.\n\nAdvertisements are sponsored and financed by the producer, who essentially dictates what they should say. This fact is known to everybody, so it is even fair to do some overstating within limits. Of course, there are consumer protection laws in all Western countries. These laws discourage an advertiser from making outright false claims. So, realistically, outright lies are probably uncommon in advertisements.\n\nHowever, within this limitation, it is rather easy to make non-verifiable statements or suggestions, which are neither true nor lies. Anti-aging cosmetic products are typical examples. Of course, nobody suggests that you can stop aging. But most advertisements for such products do implicitly suggest it as an underlying, implicit message, without explicitly saying it, by the layout and setting of the advertisement, etc. Cosmetic products' advertisements always show fresh, young characters who have no issue with aging...\n\nAlso, advertisers usually try to convey a dream, a feeling, and not a rationally verifiable message. For instance, advertisements for expensive cars, watches, and generally luxury goods always advertise the quality and substance of the product, which is greatly overstated, but in the end, the customer buys it for intangible reasons, such as prestige and exclusivity associated with owning a luxury product. It is unrealistic to think that an expensive Swiss manual watch is more reliable or precise than a cheap Chinese copy... But that is not the point."}

The same things can be done also by older persons if their health is good.\n\nMaybe, in my opinion, young people can enjoy life with more sports than older persons. Young people have a young body with many energies to spend. They have resistance and a young heart full of energy.\n\nBut older people have, however, many other valid ways to enjoy life.

Firstly, trying new things and taking risks can expand one's vision. The journey from good to great of the world-famous company Wells Fargo is one of the best examples to support this idea. Wells Fargo was indeed an American company, for the reason that it paid only 1 percent of the entire company's attention to its international department. One day, the top leader of Wells Fargo took a big risk: he placed the company's chief CEO, who had been in charge of over 60 percent of the entire business of the company, in the international department. Everyone was confused with the leader's decision to try new things. However, Wells Fargo succeeded. After several years of the replacement of their chief CEO, Wells Fargo became not only a big American company but a huge international business as well. The expansion of vision enabled Wells Fargo to reach out and become a great company, and made its leader a successful manager as well.\n\nSecondly, trying new things and taking risks can help one catch new opportunities. Living in a fast-paced world like this, we face new challenges every single day. If we only stick to the daily routine without getting to know this world better by trying new things and taking risks, we will surely be left behind by those who are more adventurous. With closed eyes, we may never reach the destined opportunities even when they are just knocking on our doors.\n\nReady and willing to try new things and take risks, one will finally become successful from mediocrity.

If they only do what they already know, they learn nothing. For successful people, trying new things and taking risks is essential. Take, for example, an animal professor who discovers medicine for humans. If they only produce known medicines, there is no discovery, and their role becomes redundant. They must seek out new medicines, which involves risk because it requires animal testing. Consider successful students as another example. Their success stems from trying new things, such as reading various books and engaging with teachers. The risk for them is taking extra, non-mandatory exams. Without reading extensively and self-evaluation, how can they become successful? They would remain stagnant, not learning anything new. They cannot limit themselves to familiar subjects; otherwise, they cannot be open-minded. Personally, I have a story related to this topic. I am embracing new experiences and taking risks by studying in America. I am learning about new cultures and languages. I haven't achieved success yet, but I am striving for it. This is also a risk for me because my parents cannot easily afford my university education in America due to the high tuition. They have to support both me and my brother.

It is better to stick with one subject than to be confused by many subjects, which you will forget in the future.\n\nSecondly, it is quite challenging when you specialize in one subject.

{"file_id": "1010108.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with the comment that younger people nowadays do not dedicate enough time to helping their communities. This could be due to many reasons. Helping the community is part of every person's duty. By improving their community, they would tend to enhance their surroundings and their quality of life.\n\nFor example, if there is a need for good social workers in their communities, they might not show much interest in such aspects because they are preoccupied with work-related stress. They would rather spend their time enjoying activities in a playground or a movie theater than engaging in social work for their community. The younger generation nowadays prefers to stay out of helping their communities develop because they are interested in other pursuits. They are less focused on aiding their community due to ego, which their fellow colleagues might not share. They are so busy with their academic careers that they do not have much time left for community service.\n\nIt should not be the fault of educational institutions for having such a rigorous academic schedule. Rather, it is the lack of interest among young people in community involvement. It is their personal interest to help the community. Likewise, there are very few young people who show interest in aiding the community. It is usually the older individuals who are more inclined to help, as they face fewer work-related stresses. It would be more accurate to say they have much less work-related stress than younger people. Therefore, they have some advantage over the younger generation in terms of community service.\n\nIn conclusion, I would like to say that younger people have significantly less time for community service compared to older individuals. The community would benefit and grow faster if younger people showed more interest, as they are much more energetic and enthusiastic than their older counterparts."}

My point is, fun could mean a lot of things to a lot of different people.\nFor older people, fun could mean just watching television or going for a long walk. For example, my grandfather, who is about 75 years old, has a lot of fun eating food he enjoys.\nYes, it is true that when a person reaches a particular age, he starts pleasing himself or having fun with simple things like these. This does not mean that he isn't enjoying his life. He has his own ways to enjoy it.\n\nYounger people might enjoy life as they are presently, but this does not mean older people have not done what the younger people have. Moreover, older people have done everything that younger people have. What this means is, enjoying life and fun go hand in hand and also change as the needs of people change when they grow older.\nIt all depends upon what the individual finds pleasurable, to have fun at that particular age, like in my grandfather's case it was the kind of food he liked to eat.\nIn my case, it's enjoying life sitting on my rooftop with a guitar.\n\nHence, commenting on the statement, I would like to assert that fun could mean different things for different people. Therefore, older people have as much fun as younger people do; the only difference is the means of having fun or satisfying themselves."}
{"file_id": "108367.txt", "output_essay": "Depending on personal experience, personality type, and emotional concerns, different people have different ideas about which age group enjoys life the most. Some people think that young people enjoy life more than older people do, while others do not agree. In my opinion, I think young people do enjoy life more than older people. Yes, older people may have more money and more experiences, but they cannot turn back time. For the young, everything in the world is new and fresh, so they can have plenty of time to experience and enjoy life more than older people.\n\nFirst of all, young people have plenty of time and passion to study new knowledge and everything that is happening in the world. In this way, they can stay in fashion and enjoy life more. According to a survey made by China Daily, few people older than 50 use computers to work and communicate with others, which is a more money-saving and interesting way to do things. So we must say that it is the young who can enjoy life more. Secondly, I think young people have more time and energy to have fun. They are young and strong, and they can participate in many great activities that older people cannot. In this way, we can see that young people can have more entertainment. I am a young girl now, and I think I can do anything I like. I am planning to travel around the world someday in the future. See, I think few older people can have such a dream, and in this way, I would like to say, young people do enjoy life more than older people.\n\nAdditionally, young people are usually healthier than older people. There is a famous old saying in China, 'Health is the basis of everything you want to do.' And because young people have strong bodies, they can enjoy life more than older people.\n\nFrom the statements above, you can obviously see that young people have more chances, more time, more energy, and more passion to lead a better life. In summary, I strongly agree with the opinion that young people enjoy life more than older people."}

When you travel in a group, you have more fun, and you end up doing a lot of activities that you would not do if you were travelling alone.\n\nMan is a social animal, and we always like it if we have someone to talk to and someone with whom we can share our emotions. When travelling in a group, you have this chance. For instance, if you go to an old church and you are in awe at its beauty and architectural design, having someone there with whom you can share these feelings always feels nice.\n\nSecondly, having a tour guide is a major advantage when it comes to travelling around in a new city, as the guide is familiar with the city and the tourist spots in that city. He is the right person who can show you around the city and take you to the right places. If you were to do it alone, it would take you hours just to figure out how to go from one place to the other.\n\nThirdly, travelling in a group is a lot of fun, as you are never alone and are always with someone, playing, chatting, or doing something fun. Also, travelling with people makes you try new things which you would never do on your own. For example, if someone in your group likes adventure sports, seeing them, the other people in the group would also get motivated to try their hand at it. You might never know; someone might actually turn out to be very good at it.\n\nThus, we see that traveling in a group led by a tour guide is much more fun and adventurous. Even though the tour guide might charge you some extra money, he makes up for it with the fact that he saves a lot of your time and helps you relax on your holiday, as he is taking care of everything. Travelling in a group helps you have a holiday in the true sense of the word and lets you enjoy it to the fullest."}
{"file_id": "1000434.txt", "output_essay": "It is not arguable that if one wants to be successful, one must seek new things so that one can differ from the usual and common people. When one opens a business, it can be hardly successful if one only tries to use a system that already exists in the world. It might be safe to operate a business with common systems and to produce famous products for profits and money; however, that business will not grow beyond any other companies or businesses. To be successful, it is important to try new stuff even though it seems risky. This contention is lucidly manifested in the history of McDonald's and the book 'Le Papillon'.\n\nThe owner of McDonald's, Mr. Kroc, once started a business with just a restaurant as usual as any other common restaurants. However, the owner thought that it did not bring him lots of profits. He wanted to use a new system of selling his food to people. McDonald's came up with the idea of fast food. It began to produce hamburgers rapidly to follow the trend of the time period of his days. As people started to open new businesses, they did not have much time to spend in the restaurant eating. McDonald's made food faster so that busy business people could pick up their ordered food, pay, and leave to their places. It was once very successful. Kroc still was not satisfied with this policy. As the usage of cars increased, he once more thought of a faster way to pick up and move, 'Drive-Thru.' People liked it and nowadays, McDonald's is one of the famous restaurants that is worldly known. It was a pretty risky policy to develop during that time. Other members of the company rejected this idea because people might not come to his restaurant with great pleasure. However, Kroc had the insight to see further into the future and to try new things. He was one of the successful people who tried new things with risks.\n\nIn the book 'Le Papillon', written by Bernard Werber, it eloquently clarifies that trying new things gets you a new world. The protagonists of this book are sick of their world because of the corrupted media and selfishness of people. There are several protagonists, but one of them, a scientist, first comes up with the idea of an escaping earth project. Not many people in the world would fund his project, which illustrates that people did not like risks. However, another protagonist, a rich businessman, steps up and gives the funds for the project. Any other businessman or scientists think that the plan is too risky and impossible to become real. The project's required budget is so high that it is very risky for the businessman to fund all the money for the project. However, the project is very successfully done as a result. When the protagonists get to leave the earth with the spaceship, those who opposed his idea and risks do not get to leave the earth. It is a great success for those who try new things and take risks for their future.\n\nThe game that I currently play even shows that it is good to have risky quests for greater rewards. The important fact is that trying the risky way for more experience and greater success is better than just keeping things that we already know how to do well, just as clearly appealed in the history of McDonald's and in the book 'Le Papillon.'"}
{"file_id": "104080.txt", "output_essay": "In today's world, cars are the main form of transportation used on land. As cities grow and distances become longer, people increasingly need ways of transportation in everyday life. Therefore, nowadays almost every person who can afford it, is over 18, and has a license, owns a car. If you consider the number of people living on this planet, that would make quite a number. However, on the other hand, public transportation methods are developing, which reduces the necessity for cars. So what will happen in twenty years?\n\nFirst of all, there is the fact that to get from one place to another, you need to have a way of transportation. For most people in the large cities they live in today, it is impossible to get to work, go shopping, or travel anywhere within walking distance. So, they need to have a car or a way of public transportation. Most people prefer having their own cars, and it's easy to see why: methods of public transportation are slow and unreliable. You never know when the bus is going to come, and it's almost certain that you will be late to wherever you're going. Also, buses go slow and stop many times for passengers to get on and off. Metros are usually very crowded, and it is very uncomfortable to travel squeezed against people you don't even know. Taxis are usually very expensive. Plus, if you go grocery shopping, there is no way you can carry all your bags unless you have a trunk to put them into. Picture yourself in a crowded bus or metro with ten bags full of heavy fruits and vegetables, gallons of milk and juice, meat that is about to spoil, and ice cream that is melting all over the floor. Not very convenient, nor is it going to work. This is an example of why at least one car is needed for every family.\n\nHowever, there is the growing problem of pollution and traffic. There are so many cars that it takes you an hour to get home during rush hour when it usually takes fifteen minutes. Plus, when you get to work, or the mall, there is always the problem of parking. Wouldn't it just be great to go and catch a movie or get a bite to eat in the time you spend looking for parking spaces? That is why shopping malls and workplaces have started to schedule service buses which will take you directly from home to work or wherever you are going. Also, there is the problem of oil resources running out, and aside from that, cars heavily pollute the air. So, instead of twenty people going to a place in separate cars, imagine how much it would reduce pollution and traffic if all twenty people used a bus to go there.\n\nMy opinion is that the number of cars will reduce in the next twenty years. Governments that are aware of the pollution and traffic problems are developing public transportation methods to encourage their citizens to use those instead of cars. For example, in the United States, carpool lanes have been arranged in big cities like Los Angeles, which you can use only if you have more than one passenger in your car. So, in my opinion, the rising public awareness of pollution, the increase in the cost of fuel for cars, and the development in public transportation will reduce the number of cars in the future."}
{"file_id": "1011805.txt", "output_essay": "I definitely agree with the idea that it is more important for students to learn facts than to understand ideas and concepts. There are three reasons to support my idea. \n\nFor most human beings, the ability to learn facts is much stronger than that of understanding ideas and concepts. Facts equal specification, and concept stands for abstraction. For example, we may distinguish a high-value picture from a low-value one mainly by whether it looks like the real stuff or not. On the contrary, experts define the value of a painting by their colors or some painting skills. We may not understand the essential things in Van Gogh's paintings because we don't even know what he drew on the paper. \n\nFor another thing, it is easier for students to learn things from a teacher than to learn by oneself. That is the reason a teacher can use specific examples and facts to describe a new concept, which makes it easier for students to understand. \n\nWhen it comes to learning facts, we cannot disregard the part-time job. Why are there so many students who like to take it while they are in school? Because it provides them with some interpersonal abilities, which are not learned from books or classes. Additionally, they learn things with the joy of earning money. \n\nIn spite of this, understanding ideas and concepts is basic for students. Subjects such as math, calculation, science, history, and social science are essential for students to learn something new. Suppose a man cannot read, write, or perform simple calculations; he will learn nothing even if he knows quite a few facts. \n\nLastly, in my opinion, I think understanding ideas and concepts is as important as learning facts. We may build up both abilities at the same time."}

So many car owners won't be able to afford the higher cost for gas, because their income will stay the same.\n\nFor the car industries and the jobs that are connected to it, it's a dramatic thing, because many people will lose their workplaces.\n\nWhen I think about all this, it would be best to make plans now for what we should do with the problem. First, we could build new possibilities for transporting people and find new ways of exploring other resources we have on Earth, instead of oil.\n\nMaybe in twenty years, it could be a possibility for us to drive cars powered by water or sunlight.

For example, in developing countries, many students are provided reservations because they belong to a certain downtrodden community. The students, after achieving success, are not indebted to the community and don't try to help it.\n\nBut there are some instances where this is not always true. Consider the case of an Indian student going to the United States to pursue higher education. He checks out the members of the Indian community in that college and contacts them beforehand. The members of the community then arrange for his transport from the airport to the university campus and take care of him for two to three days. Since the basic idea of this community is to help other students, in this aspect, young people are succeeding.\n\nThere are also several youths who try to help their communities. When a person leaves his country and achieves success, they do not forget their motherland; they try to help their native community. Take the case of many Non-Resident Indians.

{"file_id": "117434.txt", "output_essay": "At first glance, we may think that specializing in one subject is good for us as we can concentrate all our time and energy on just one subject. However, having this kind of strategy might prevent us from completing our necessary improvement.\n\nFirstly, all kinds of sciences have complex structures that no specific subject can be thought to be completely independent from other academic subjects. Having no knowledge about other academic subjects is something that will always limit us during our studies. For instance, a computer scientist like me may never need information about sciences like physics or chemistry during university studies. But if one day, I need to create software for a company that produces chemical products, I will need assistance from other people for everything that is related to chemistry. From the projects I have made for the industry, I realized that having some knowledge about every topic really helps. In fact, a computer engineer cannot be seen as a real engineer if he does not even have basic concepts of general engineering principles. He will always be incomplete and in need of help from other people.\n\nIn addition, as far as I have learned from the software industry, having broad knowledge of many subjects is something that separates you from other people in the same area and makes you chosen instead of others. If we really want to be good at our jobs, this cannot be achieved by just concentrating on one subject.\n\nAnother fact is that there are so many interesting academic subjects in science. We may be happy if we can spend some time on some other subject and improve ourselves. It is not a good thing to limit ourselves to just one subject all the time as there might be lots of topics that could be interesting for us.\n\nIn conclusion, I agree with the statement that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects. As we have time and resources to gain knowledge about many academic subjects during our university studies, we should try to get familiar with the highest number of academic subjects and we should not limit ourselves to just one topic."}
{"file_id": "1008450.txt", "output_essay": "Personally, I don't agree with the given statement, and I think that if you do what you know and do it well, you can be as successful as a risky person.\n\nToday's people are most likely more risky and like to be challenged, but this is why they can easily fail. For instance, I had a friend who had a very good job as a banker. He had a good position and earned enough money, but he wanted to make more out of his life.\n\nHe started studying again in another field and had to give up all the little luxuries he was used to, like his car, old apartment, etc. Unfortunately, that was five years ago, and his 'risk' didn't work out that well. The normal study time would have been four years, but during that time, he figured out that this field does not seem to be the right thing. He developed bad grades and has to retake classes, plus when he finally finishes his studies, it might be very hard for him to get a good job because the demand in his field has drastically decreased.\n\nIf he had stayed in his old job, he could have been the director by now. Another reason for disagreeing with this statement is that I think you should treat all people equally and not judge their success based on how they got to a certain point.\n\nFor example, if it comes to a job offer and there are two people who applied for it, I think that the person who has worked for years at the same place and has a lot of experience in that specific area might be more successful than any other person. But I find it very surprising that people overlook those individuals and are more interested in hiring somebody who has a way more interesting past and took some risks to get there.\n\nOn the other hand, taking a risk might open new doors that you couldn't have imagined before.\n\nGiven those reasons and the choice between trying new things and taking risks or sticking to familiar behavior, I personally think that you can be very successful either way."}

All of them are part of students' society services.\n\nUsually, those servicing clubs are very popular among students at my university. Their common main concern is to help the whole society become better, but because they focus on different groups of people, they divide into various kinds of clubs. These clubs will recruit new members at the beginning of the semester and then arrange all the members into different groups to design helping projects. Sometimes, it takes a whole semester to prepare for a big project which may include several universities and is carried out together during summer or winter vacation.\n\nThese students really do some miracles for the communities, even the society, by donating their ideas and efforts to engage in activities such as picking up every piece of paper in a specific community, giving a bath to the elderly who live alone, or offering free after-school tutoring for children in remote regions. How could one say that there are no young people willing to spend time participating in this work simply because there are many students who spend their time in front of the computer or in KTV?\n\nHowever, there is still a shortage of human resources when it comes to helping the communities or society.

From a wealthy businessman taking his wife on vacation to a kid with a backpack eager to explore the planet, travel is diverse. Obviously, a trip to an unknown location needs to be prepared, and a tour guide is always ready to take the group to visit the local wonders. But is it the best way to travel?\n\nPersonally, I disagree with this statement. I think it deprives us of the spontaneous and adventurous aspect of a trip.\n\nWhen I travel, usually to unknown countries with my friends and family, it is, of course, to have a good time and see unusual sights that I may not have the chance to see again. But mostly, I like the feeling of freedom that I get: I can go anywhere, anytime. However, being led by a travel guide kind of takes that aspect away: following an exact map and program of the visit. And many times, the guide isn't a personal guide, so you have to follow others to see things that you didn't even want to see in the first place.\n\nA personal experience: during a guided tour of Paris a few years back, I was stuck (so to speak) in an art exhibition that I did not plan to attend. But since I had no car and no money for a cab, I was obligated to stay with the group, being bored out of my mind.\n\nMore than that, of course, staying in a nice hotel with a minibar full of drinks is nice, but I also love backpacking: going from place to place without a perfectly planned trip, staying at hostels, without the feeling that I have to follow the map exactly as planned. In that case, being led by a tour guide would be denying the whole definition of adventurous, exciting backpacking.\n\nTo conclude, I would like to say that following a group led by a tour guide is a great way to explore a city; you get to see all the important sights.

There are several reasons why I think so: lack of time and busy life, and unfamiliarity with the community.\n\nFirst of all, I am also one of the young people who do not engage in helping their communities. In my opinion, the big reason is that they are just too busy just going to school. In my case, even though I want to give my time to help my communities, I do not have enough time to spend on it because of school. Recently, many students attend private schools far from their homes, not public schools located close by. I also go to a private school. The school is so far that it takes me one and a half hours to get there. Therefore, it is difficult to find and spare the time to contribute to my community because of the lack of time.\n\nSecond, most students, even elementary school students, go to juku (cram school) after school because many parents and students are not satisfied with the education at their schools, or they think they need additional support with their studies. Therefore, they do not have time even to have family time or to hang out with friends. Students of the age that are the time to take entrance examinations to the next school, such as high school or university, go to juku almost the whole week. Consequently, they would rather have time to spend with family or friends if they could find the time.\n\nThird, they and I feel the community is not familiar to us. I am sure all people knew the faces of all their neighbors and they communicated with each other a lot a long time ago. To my disappointment, it does not happen now. I just moved to a new city, so I do not know about my community and my neighbors. As a result, even when there is a festival, I always do not participate in it because there are no people whom I know. I guess this occurs to people nowadays a lot.\n\nIn conclusion, I am in agreement that most young people do not spare enough time to support their communities.

Down the lane, about 20 years from now, the number of cars being used will have decreased considerably owing to many factors.\n\nA car can effectively work for a maximum of fifteen years; after fifteen years, most of the parts in the car would be worn out, and the efficiency of the car decreases. Even if the car is used beyond fifteen years, it may release hydrocarbons which may increase pollution. Most importantly, our native government is taking measures to implement the idea of using a car for only fifteen years. After fifteen years, the car has to be sent back to the showroom, or it has to be thoroughly checked before it can be used again, so that the car used will not increase pollution.\n\nThe demand for petroleum products has increased significantly. To run any vehicle, we require petrol. Unfortunately, we are running short of petroleum products. Due to the scarcity of petrol, the number of cars will be reduced as middle-class people may not be able to afford such high prices for petrol and maintain a car.\n\nNowadays, the roads which we use are congested because of the traffic present. The number of vehicles is increasing daily, adding to the traffic problems. The traffic nowadays is so congested that we can reach our destination more quickly on foot rather than using a car. To have a smooth ride in our car, we wish to have spacious room to drive, but unfortunately, there is little chance to expand these roads. So, people are finding different alternatives for their daily commute.\n\nOne of the most interesting aspects is the problem of obesity in many people.

The main important problem for the reduction in the number of cars is the availability of petroleum products and health problems. In order to overcome these problems, people may switch to various means of transportation, reducing the number of cars used."}

Similarly, there is another club that raises its voice against many social problems prevalent in my country, for example, dowry, female foeticide, etc. I myself am a member of this organization, and we organize various activities like trips to local neighborhoods, staging street plays to spread our message.\n\nAnother aspect that shows the commitment of young people to their communities is their increasing interest in political issues. In my country, right from college, students compete for different positions in university politics, and they have an important role in bringing important national issues to discussion forums where students can discuss possible solutions to them.\n\nYoung people also contribute towards the economic and technological development of their communities by implementing new ideas. For example, they can use their education to help create new types of jobs by being entrepreneurs. In this context, I would like to add that many alumni of my college who have now gained important positions in society contribute by giving donations to various social organizations.\n\nI do agree that there are some youngsters who forget their people in order to earn money, who leave their countries for a better life, but a large majority of them, including me, are determined to serve their communities from where we started our lives."}

However, the problem is that there are a lot of people who prefer to have a beautiful car rather than a sweet home. The famous phrase 'home sweet home' is in danger because it is no longer at the forefront of desires. A car was the symbol of a generation; our parents remember their first car as a realized dream. Today, young people want a car because their best friend has one, not because they understand the real significance it can have. I think that in twenty years, this object of desire will be more sought after, more coveted, and more dangerous... There are already many cars that drive too fast; in the twenties, it will certainly be worse. Today, young people die because they can drive cars that run very fast; tomorrow, they will be able to fly. I hope it will be different. In my grandfather's time, the car was a luxury good because he couldn't have one. A car costs a lot of money, and during the war, money was like ghosts. In the sixties, some people like Corradino d'Ascanio created a way to help these people discover the world: the Vespa. This became a real status symbol thanks to the significant meanings it held. 'With Vespa, you can fly,' and with this idea, motors became the most important thing for people. In the sixties, it was possible to fly away; will it be possible tomorrow too? It's important to be free; with a car, I can be free because I can go wherever I want. For this reason, there is a fever for cars. A fever that will never pass."}
{"file_id": "1013452.txt", "output_essay": "The demand for mobility and access is not likely to cease in modern life; however, the supply that will enable people to mobilize will certainly shift from conventional methods established today. With this fact, one can go further and argue that twenty years from now, there will be fewer cars than there are now. Such an argument can be coherent in itself if one is to observe changing trends in mobility regarding alternatives and environmental issues.\n\nWhen comparing cars with their alternatives such as planes, trains, and ferries, they all seem to be better than cars in certain aspects stated below. For instance, it is a known fact that the average use of cars is around 1.5 people per car worldwide, which proves how inefficient cars are compared to massive transportation methods such as trains, ships, and planes. In addition to this, cars also create a traffic problem which is incomparable to its alternatives. Despite cars seeming to provide more accessibility than their alternatives, since one can drive wherever he wants and whenever, this fact also seems like it is changing. It may be the case that, twenty years from now, planes and trains will develop to an extent that they will be cheaper to use and more frequent in destination. At this point, it should also be remembered that cars have considerable upkeep costs due to repairs and taxes, which will eventually become a luxury compared to their alternatives.\n\nApart from losing its edge among its alternatives, cars will most likely be forced to reduce in number due to their harmful effects on the environment. The fundamental need of a car to run is oil, and this fact is unlikely to change in the coming twenty years. Regarding increasing concerns about global warming, this need for cars will make it likely to be replaced. In addition to harmful gases released, cars also damage the environment by creating sound pollution and indirectly by drivers demanding more roads. The more cars there are, the more roads and sound pollution there will be as well. Subsequently, these will make people take a decision between altering their mobility styles or facing the consequences of environmental disorder.\n\nIn conclusion, it seems that because of the drivers mentioned here and many possible others that extend beyond the limit of this essay, cars are going to be replaced relatively by their alternatives. Maybe these drivers will lead car industries to develop new, cheap, and environmentally friendly solutions, but even this isn't likely to stop a change in choices. It is because maybe other industries will take advantage of their increasing usage and will develop further technologies which will make them incomparable to cars."}

It is true that such advertisements have significantly increased the popularity of certain commodities and, meanwhile, encouraged many more customers. However, we may also have heard some newspaper reports about complaints regarding these commodities from customers. Usually, the complaints are mainly about the products not actually having the effects advertised.\n\nTherefore, I agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.\n\nFirstly, some advertisements might be so exaggerated that they create effects which the products do not possess. I have just read in a newspaper that one woman bought a television but then she found that there were many functions missing compared to what was advertised. For example, the advertisement clearly stated that this kind of television could receive TV programs from overseas without any additional equipment. However, the woman discovered that her television did not have such a function at all.\n\nMoreover, some advertisements may go to the extent of changing the defects of the products into seemingly fascinating advantages. What is more incredible is that these fictitious advantages may become the compelling reasons that encourage customers to purchase the products.\n\nFinally, in order to persuade more customers to buy the products, advertisements may try to downplay or eliminate the defects of such products. That is to say, only the advantages of products will appear in the corresponding advertisements. As we know, there doesn't exist something that is perfect and without any disadvantages or defects. Although such advertisements tell the truth and the products really possess those advantages, they still convey misleading information to customers, making their first impressions of the products much better than they really are.\n\nTherefore, from the discussion above, we can come to the conclusion that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are."}

The problem with this approach is that it involves taking many risks, and in the end, these people could end up losing everything, while they could have stuck to what they already knew. This creates the problem of knowing if it is worth taking the risk to try new things or if instead, people should stay with what they already possess.\n\nIn my opinion, life is all about taking risks and discovering new things, so that our knowledge doesn't stay confined to what we are already good at, but instead, these limits extend and allow us to learn and to succeed at new things. For example, if there weren't people willing to try to understand the anatomy of the human body, the progress in medicine would not have been so advanced as it is today. This shows that even if there are risks involved with gaining knowledge and mastering an area, it is still something that has to be done in order to evolve.\n\nHowever, there are times when people who take risks end up regretting it, whether because they didn't succeed in the other things they tried to learn and lost what they already possessed, or because they didn't like what they learned while exploring new areas. If we take, for example, a man who owns a shoe company, and he decides to invest his money in a new perfume company, or in another random business that doesn't relate to his area of expertise, he may end up losing money if this business doesn't work well, or he may end up giving up because this business is not fit for him. Either way, this man would have lost money and this could even affect the business in which he succeeded. Therefore, taking these risks could definitely end up causing these people a lot of harm if they weren't prepared for it.\n\nIn the end, it is all about being lucky and hoping for the best because there is a lot of good things that can come out of discovering new things, but there are also bad things. But if I had to choose, I would probably decide to take the risks, because the world wouldn't be where it is today without our will to discover and to master."}

First of all, I like to enjoy the journey in my own way. I always relish the pleasure of freedom. Arranging the travel is hard work, but it is quite interesting. Being led by a tour guide means I have to obey the instructions they give. I have to follow the whole group to places I don't want to visit, eat the food chosen by the tour guide, and even go to the toilet at times fixed by the tour guide. So, do we hire a tour guide or a commander? Furthermore, the tour guide often repeats the same information found in travel books. I can read it in the hotel or through the Internet; why should I hire a tour guide for this? \n\nSecond, which is even worse, is that tour guides only have the most profitable routes, so there are many places where I can't find a tour guide. Especially for some very exciting undeveloped districts, it's very hard to get a tour guide. Last time, some friends and I wanted to go to a mountain in our province. After we explored all the websites of the tour companies, none of them offered this route. We had to go by ourselves. \n\nThird, some claim that traveling in a group led by a tour guide will save money. It makes sense sometimes. But business is business; you have to pay extra money for the guide, not just the journey itself. Moreover, some tour guides will bring tourists to shops and malls but not to the places we want to visit. This is because these shops and malls pay the tour guide for bringing in business. I even heard that some tour guides have cheated and blackmailed tourists over food, transportation, etc. It's quite difficult to find a good tour guide. \n\nTo sum up, I do not like to travel in a group led by a tour guide."}

It is true that learning facts is important, but not more important than ideas and concepts.\n\nIn my experience, most professors give tests based on the ideas and concepts of what we have learned. The purpose of testing is to gauge how much students grasp the ideas and concepts of the content and how to apply it. None of my professors wanted the students to pass the class without understanding the ideas and concepts.\n\nAccording to a Korean newspaper, the most successful students grasp the ideas and concepts of the subject, not just the facts. Researchers conducted an experiment in one high school. They had fifty students study only concepts and ideas, and fifty students study only facts. The result of the experiment was that forty out of the fifty students who were in the ideas and concepts group got A's, and ten out of the fifty students who were in the facts group got A's on the test.\n\nAfter reading this research paper, I focused on understanding the ideas and concepts of the content. As a result, my grades were higher than when studying facts alone. I think understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning facts.

However, many believe that it is better to stick to what they already know how to do well rather than taking risks and trying new things. I don't agree with this.\n\nFirst of all, according to Dr. Gong, who is a professor of future business in Korea, becoming a professional in one field only takes about two years if we try our best. So, if your job has a lot of competition, it will be hard to be successful in that field. You should change to a job where no one else has thought of your idea.\n\nSecondly, people who are successful in their business often have unusual ideas, such as inventing the light bulb or connecting the internet. I think that if what you know how to do well is something many people can do, then it's not unique. Let's say you are good at math; if you decide to make a career out of it, you are likely to become a teacher, as there seems to be no other choice.\n\nTherefore, if you think someone might like your idea, you should try new things and take the risk."}

This approach has many more benefits than trying to learn a multitude of subjects; in fact, it is impossible to have a deep understanding of various subjects.\n\nFirst of all, you can choose your aim easily, and it brings you to reach your destination in the shortest time possible. Also, expertise in one specific subject can be helpful in your business career. In the business world, employers look for more specialized individuals. For example, it is not enough to graduate from business administration to acquire a good position. One should also have specific knowledge of Finance or Marketing in order to command a good salary. For instance, I work in the forest industry and I graduated in forestry, so now I know a lot about timber, plants, solid wood, and the like.\n\nSecondly, in today's fast-growing world, if one wants to be employed in a high position within a company and earn a salary sufficient for high standards of living, he must concentrate on one specific subject and become an expert in that area.\n\nTaking everything into consideration, one should prefer specializing in one specific issue and utilize this knowledge to build a successful career throughout his life.

More and more new cars are getting added to city traffic every day. Improving economic conditions are encouraging people to purchase their own cars instead of using the public transport system. The city's infrastructure is not able to grow proportionately to the traffic, resulting in increased jamming of traffic and accidents. A recent health survey has shown that people who get stuck in traffic jams are more prone to stress, affecting both their personal and professional lives. Also, we must not forget the pollution of air and sound these vehicles cause every day.\n\nOne more important factor that would discourage car usage in the coming times is the constant rise in fuel charges and the lack of immediate and reliable alternatives. The fuel production is not keeping up with the alarming increase in fuel consumption.\n\nWith the advent of metro rail and other advanced public transport mechanisms, which carry a huge number of people in a short span of time to their destinations, people would be inclined to use them rather than risking getting stuck in a bad traffic jam. With aggressive promotion of the usage of public transport systems by the government, the number of cars could significantly decrease.\n\nAlso, with people experimenting with newer ideas of carpooling, where a car is shared by a group of people instead of each one driving their own, we may see a significant reduction in the number of vehicles on the road.\n\nOwing to all these factors, people in the coming years will be less inclined to use their cars."}
{"file_id": "1016671.txt", "output_essay": "Some people prefer individual travel, while others like to travel in a group led by a tour guide. In my opinion, I prefer to travel in a group led by a tour guide. I would like to present three points with rationales and examples.\n\nFirst of all, a group trip makes it easy to visit unfamiliar spots in famous sightseeing places. Since a tour guide has professional knowledge of the place, they can direct us to unknown but worthwhile spots. In my experience, when I went to China on a school trip, I discovered beautiful scenes of forests and rivers from lesser-known locations. If I had not traveled in a group, it would have been impossible since I was unfamiliar with China.\n\nAlso, a tour guide can help us communicate efficiently with foreigners during international travel. Generally, a tour guide, especially one who often travels to foreign countries, has a good command of the local languages. Therefore, we can communicate with local people with the help of their language skills. Without tour guides, especially in countries whose languages we have not learned, we cannot communicate directly with the locals. Since one of the major advantages of going abroad is to interact with native people and to learn about their life and culture, the absence of language support can lead to a less beneficial experience.\n\nLastly, another advantage of group travel is that it ensures communication with other people who are on the same tour. It is a good opportunity to meet new people, because, in my case, I do not often have the chance to meet unfamiliar Japanese. As a university student, I always encounter the same individuals, such as classmates or friends from the same club activities. If I could meet someone with similar tastes, I might be able to develop a lasting relationship with them.\n\nThus, due to three points: exploring unfamiliar spots, communicating with local people, and forming relationships with fellow travelers, I prefer to travel in a group led by a tour guide."}

Learning is a process that accompanies us until the day of our death. \n\nPersonally, having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better than specializing in one specific subject. \n\nDepending on the field, knowing about a variety of matters will give the person a broader overview of the topic in which he is trying to specialize.

I think we can discover new things more by traveling alone or with a few friends or family.\n\nFirstly, we can be flexible with our schedule when we travel by ourselves. This means we can pick places we want to go to and arrange the most effective route. When I went to Spain with my son last month, we chose where we wanted to go first and organized our route carefully. We moved around using the subway and visited historical sites and museums. Whenever we felt like changing our plan, we had a cup of coffee and made another plan. For example, after we saw Gaudi's famous Cathedral in Barcelona, my son wanted to visit other architectures of his, so we decided to see other buildings rather than go to the Picasso museum.\n\nSecondly, we can go where our interests lie. In Granada, we visited an old historical town called Albayzin. This town is located on a hill and it seemed to be very difficult for tour groups to go, as these roads are too narrow for large buses to drive and there are many paths to get out of the town. If I were a tour guide, I might lose my customers as these roads are like a huge maze. But when I think back on our trip, this town was the most exciting and attractive place for us. If we had gone to Spain on a group tour, we could not have visited this marvelous historical town.\n\nFor these reasons, I prefer traveling on my own or with a few people. We can go where we really want to go and enjoy what we really want to see. The Spain trip with my son became one of the most memorable trips for me."}

I would agree with the statement.\n\nThe main reason to support the statement is that trying new things and taking risks sometimes gives innovative ideas and better insights to solve a problem at hand. For example, Einstein, a famous scientist, continuously tried new things and figured out innovative methods to reach a conclusion. As a result, he has given the world new theories and explanations of which the world was unaware. Einstein is one of the world's greatest scientists ever known.\n\nSecondly, doing what we already know how to do well is just blindly ignoring the changing factors surrounding us. For example, my father knew how to make a spear very well. I learned the art of spear-making from my father. But with all the technological advancements and innovative methods around, I cannot say that the method known to me is the best method. Today, spears can be prepared with machines which are faster and more accurate. So, in order to do things well, we need to have a clear understanding of the changing environment conditions.\n\nThird, if people do not try new things and do not take more risks, then the world economy would not grow and would come to a halt. For example, Bill Gates, the founder of Microsoft, took a risk of venturing into the computer industry when critics predicted that he would fail miserably. He continued to work hard and was able to succeed in the end. Microsoft generated huge employment and created products which helped ease certain tasks significantly. Microsoft helped the world economy to grow at a faster pace by introducing technological advancements and generating employment. Bill Gates today is one of the richest persons in the world. Had he not taken the risk of starting a new company, he would not have been successful.\n\nIn conclusion, people who try new things and take calculated risks succeed. People who only do what they already know may become successful but not to the same extent achieved by people who take risks."}

For example, when we learn about Plato, we might only need to know what era he lived in or the titles of his books.

Firstly, the primary use of advertisement is to sell the product. The second reason is that, for example, when contracts are advertised, they mostly include small printed or on-screen paragraphs with the flaws of the contract. The last reason is that everything has not only merits but also flaws, which are typically not displayed.\n\nIn order to sell products, the producer has to display it in a good light, because otherwise, similar products from other companies will be bought. This situation makes a better exposure of a product than it actually is very likely. An example might be creams that are supposed to improve the look of human skin. Studies have proved that they show no effect, but on the contrary, even sometimes harm the skin. If this were told in an advertisement, nobody would buy the cream.\n\nA good example for the second reason are contracts from phone companies. They often announce some but not all of the costs a special contract may incur. Because of legal requirements, they have to include these flaws in the advertisement, but they do this in very small letters. So, if you don't look carefully, you might get the impression of a much cheaper product.\n\nIn advertisements, flaws of products are never mentioned, except when there are special rights, as with the phone contracts. But everything has aspects that are better or worse, especially when compared to other similar products. Advertisements do not speak about these things where other comparable products may prove better results. So, they always hide some aspects of the product. To reveal these hidden characteristics, almost every product is tested by independent magazines or similar entities.

I think that the problem behind such an issue lies with the production company. These companies strive to make their products as attractive as possible in order to attract the most consumers.\n\nHowever, these companies forget that once someone buys anything that performs much less than advertised, it will be returned to the retail selling agent, who will in turn return it to the company where many other items have been returned. The result of this is that the company's reputation in the market will not be much, and it will have no future for products under the same name. It could be that what they were after is temporary profits. If this is the case, they succeeded. So, exaggerating the product's description and the claims that a certain product performs certain functions, when in reality it does not, leads consumers to think about and try the product before they buy it."}

I have two more reasons for this.\n\nFirst, I think it is a nice way to study many academic subjects. I will write about my experience as an example.

When you don't have many people around, life cannot be enjoyable.\n\nEver wondered why all the players, workers, etc., retire after a certain age? It's because of their reducing ability and diminishing spirit. An old person has to give way to a younger one, no matter whether he likes it or not. Imagine life as a coach of a team, shouting orders at the team players and thinking of the days when he himself ruled the field. He is there not because he wasn't good, but because he cannot do it anymore.\n\nTo some extent, this can be explained biologically as well. At an older age, your senses begin to diminish, and these are the only source of communication with the outer world. In such a condition, how can you expect a person to enjoy more? With age, the body begins to wear down, and the healing process starts taking a longer time. Older people cannot enjoy anything to its limit.\n\nEveryone must have heard his or her parents or grandparents saying, \"Those were the best days of my life.\" A broad grin comes on their face when you talk to them about the days when they were young. You cannot expect a bigger proof than this when they are themselves admitting it.\n\nSo, it can be concluded without doubt that younger people enjoy life more than older people do."}
{"file_id": "1020837.txt", "output_essay": "Let me introduce myself first. I am from Japan and have grown up there. I totally agree that young people recently do not give enough time to helping their communities. Some reasons why young people do not are that in Japanese society, there are more interests, such as playing video games, and interruptions like being busy studying. Or the young people tend to not have any interest in others.\n\nMost elderly people said, 'A long time ago, young people had sufficient time for helping their communities.' However, time is always changing; therefore, youth do not want to help or do not like their communities at all. Even if their parents may not care about those communities, they might not push their sons or daughters to go to communities.\n\nOn the other hand, because Japanese students study so much harder than they play, and some youth have to focus on studying instead of helping the communities, they do not have time to go to communities. Not only do Japanese students study hard, but Asians also study very hard if we compare them with North America.\n\nAmericans may have enough time to help their communities because I saw young Americans with my own eyes. Also, I heard from my friends who are Americans that Japanese study harder than Americans. It means that Japanese do not have time to help their communities.\n\nIn Japan, there is one of the worst trends for young people. We call the trend the 'Hikikomori Phenomenon.' Young Japanese (including young adults) tend to stay in their houses, especially their rooms, and spend the whole day there. It means that they do not have any interest in the outside world. They never work, go to school, or go out.\n\nIn conclusion, the reasons why in recent years young people do not have time to spend are the changing period, being busy studying, and the bad phenomenon."}
{"file_id": "1011748.txt", "output_essay": "Before attempting to give a definitive answer to that question, I would like to discuss the pros and cons of the group led by a tour guide. I will then conclude by summarizing the different points made.\n\nFirst of all, let's ask ourselves why people use tour guides to travel. A possible answer to that question might be that people do not necessarily have a lot of time to visit a certain place and therefore intend to make the most out of their time. In that case, people are shown the most popular monuments and locations for sightseeing by their tour guides and visit as much as possible in a short amount of time. So I personally think that in the case of a short trip, it is a good solution in order to see the main things to see.\n\nHowever, the major drawback of this alternative appears to me to be that as you intend to make the most out of your limited time, every visit is carefully timed and scheduled. Therefore, in the event that you would like to learn more about a certain monument or place, it turns out to be quite difficult as the group might be already leaving for the next visit, or you just might not have enough time ahead of you to do so. Consequently, if a deep understanding of a certain place or monument is the major concern of the trip, tours appear to me not to be the best alternative, making such a wish difficult to come true.\n\nTo conclude, I believe that groups led by a tour guide can be both a good or less good alternative depending on the major aim of the journey. In my opinion, if the thorough understanding of a certain monument or place is the objective, then a different alternative should be taken. However, if the objective of a short journey is to go around the main sightseeing spots, then I believe it is the alternative to adopt."}
{"file_id": "1021767.txt", "output_essay": "I'm not so sure that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. I think that this statement is quite generic and incomplete. If it is referred to historical studies, it could be acceptable. For example, it is more important for a student to understand why the world wars occurred than the specific facts and dates linked to the wars' history. And this example could be extended to the general comprehension of the actual world's political situation. But without knowing facts, it's difficult to make a personal idea on an argument.\n\nIf we take, for example, scientific fields, we have to refuse this statement; it's impossible to discuss a scientific idea without knowing the specific facts (rules, laws, properties) connected to this idea.\n\nSo, my personal opinion is that there isn't a division between facts and concepts; they are strongly connected. (Here we could open a philosophical discussion about facts and judgments in Kant's theory.) I suggest to the other students to make sure to know very well a fact before giving an opinion, and to investigate a fact before accepting others' opinions. This problem involves the eternal problem of the historical sources: scholars have to believe in historical narrations without the real possibility to control themselves the truth of a fact. On the contrary, the figure of the critic should be an example of a person who can see and study a fact and then give his opinion about that fact.\n\nSo, in order to give a correct and credible opinion about something, it is very important to study the facts themselves."}
{"file_id": "1005231.txt", "output_essay": "I completely agree that students should place more emphasis on understanding ideas and concepts rather than superficially mugging up facts. A mugged-up fact, with no basic understanding of the idea behind it, may seem less time-consuming initially and may enable you to score quite well, but in the long run, it does no good to you.\nFor example, in a math test in primary school, if you merely cram all word problem solutions, then please be ready to cram another set of word problems in primary 6, 7, and so on. But if you have understood the concept, you just need to apply the same and score an A in all the classes. This is my personal experience. In primary 6, 7, 8, and 9, I only studied word problems in primary 6 and never thereafter.\nMerely cramming not only hinders your clear vision towards the matter but also blocks your mental ability to think deeper and, in a way, blocks your mental growth. If we don't ask ourselves questions about a subject and don't try to find out answers, we are blocking our own vision. For example, if Newton had not asked himself or made himself think about why the apple fell, he would not have gone on to find out answers and give his theory.\nDeeper understanding of a matter not only enables you to clearly understand but also, in other words, automatically generates your interest in a subject. And what is better than this if you are really enjoying what you are doing? Every art comes with practice, demands time, devotion, and, of course, interest. Learning, not only painting but in fact doing science, is an art as well.\nFor example, if in your secondary school you learn and understand what titration is conceptually, you will definitely enjoy the moments spent in the chemistry lab when you are performing it with your own hands and then seeing the pH become neutral.\nAnother interesting example is that of understanding cancer. If you really understand the cellular mechanism of cancer and what genes or proteins are increased or decreased during the process, it will be so fascinating to study the response or development of cancer merely by studying the levels of genes and then see the results and understand them as well and then make others look at what results you have got in your laboratory with appropriate explanations and relate them to cancer, rather than merely acting as a foolish worker in your own lab.\nLearning a technique makes you merely a worker, as good as a blue-collar guy; learning a subject makes you a scientist. So in-depth knowledge is not just important but mandatory. Mugging or learning facts makes you a worker, but to really enjoy and rule a subject, one should understand the concepts, which is something that is going to take one a long way."}
{"file_id": "115743.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with this statement. Successful people try new things because they want to achieve more. There are several reasons for this.\n\nAll people who have a lot of achievements are not satisfied with trying just one new thing. As their ambition drives them to new achievements, they want to learn new things, even if it is risky. They consider taking a risk on something different that they didn't know before because these kinds of people don't like a monotonous life. In my opinion, this life is better than the other. Trying new things adds numerous new concepts to our lives. For example, I like playing soccer. When I was in my country, I played soccer every weekend. After a while, I got bored with playing soccer. I wanted to change something in my lifestyle. Before I came to the US, I didn't know about American football. Now I am learning about it. I also like it; I learn several new rules about the sport, so it encourages me to play it. Another example is about taking risks. I had been pursuing a Ph.D. education for two years in my country. I wanted to change my place of education even though it had many risks. These included spending a lot of money, passing the TOEFL exam, and completing a new Ph.D. education in the US. They didn't know how much money I had spent before. I also didn't know whether or not I would pass the TOEFL and complete a new education. I take it.\n\nPeople who are successful develop themselves by trying new things. They create new methods to do something, which helps them to try new things. Now, let's assume that a student is preparing for the TOEFL. He develops new studying methods, so he finds better solutions for studying. Then, he can use these methods for other exams, such as the GRE.\n\nEvery person who has a lot of success tries new things because of their lifestyle. They don't like doing something they already know. They have a kind of sense that pushes them to learn new things."}
{"file_id": "1016100.txt", "output_essay": "I do agree with the statement. I think successful people are always seeking new things which normal people have never generally done. They are never afraid of failure. Taking big risks brings huge success. To be successful people, I think, two more things are required in addition to trying new things and taking risks.\n\nAmbition is vital for success. I would like to mention Ichiro Suzuki, the Japanese Major League Baseball player with the Seattle Mariners in the United States. He is one of the most successful Japanese. As everyone knows, he has incredible talent as a baseball player. However, he has had the ambition to be the best baseball player in the world since he was in primary school. He hoped to be a baseball player and trained very hard. Without ambition, Ichiro Suzuki might have been a good player only in Japan.\n\nEffort is crucial as well. Even though having a fantastic dream, people cannot achieve success without hard training. For instance, I have a dream. I have been thinking about studying abroad to expand my value and acquire the skill of language since I was a high school student. Not only the dream 'I want to study in the US' but also the effort deserved for it. I have to do what is needed. I have to study TOEFL very hard. TOEFL is not easy. The ambition is going to help my motivation for study. But finally, the effort brings a result of success.\n\nAs is clear from the above, I agree with the statement. But I think two more things are important to be successful. People only doing what they already know how to do well is not challenging. If you want to be successful, you try new things, take risks, have ambition, and effort."}
{"file_id": "1011110.txt", "output_essay": "In this society, most people will spend 6 to 12 years in different schools to study. The main purpose is to gain knowledge. While some students think understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning facts, they just learn to understand. I don't agree with that. I think the facts of knowledge are as important as the ideas and concepts. The two cannot be separated in the process of study.\n\nFirst of all, we should know the true purpose of study. Everyone knows that the purpose is to gain knowledge. But what will we do with the knowledge? We should use the knowledge to develop our skills and abilities, which could be used in work and real life. For example, if a student thinks understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning facts, he will easily ignore the significance of the facts. And then, he doesn't like to learn them. After the student graduates, they just master many different concepts, but it is difficult to find a good job because he cannot apply his knowledge at work. So learning facts is very important for the students' future.\n\nOn the other hand, learning facts is also a good way to help students understand ideas and concepts. As we all know, most ideas and concepts consist of words and formulas. They are very boring for students. However, when students learn the ideas and concepts, if the teacher tells them some facts about the concepts, the students will become more interested and understand the boring concepts more quickly. So the fact is good for students to learn.\n\nLast but not least, students can learn some experiences and lessons from the facts. The facts are events, things that happened in the past, or examples of failure. This is very important. If the students don't learn some experiences from the facts, they will have to learn in the future by themselves, maybe from failure.\n\nFrom all the above, I can draw the conclusion that learning facts is very important for students. Everyone cannot ignore them."}

But that is not true; a well-known case is the way one must make a decision in a game, remember John Nash's equilibrium.\n\nSecond, it is easier to memorize a fact than a concept. We all know that two plus two equals four. On the other hand, try to understand how physics explains the Earth's movement.\n\nFinally, there is a lot of research in each area that when we understand a concept, immediately a new theory arises explaining the same concept. For example, Pluto is not considered a planet anymore; when I was a child, everybody knew that Pluto was the contrary.\n\nFor all I wrote above, I can sincerely say that learning facts is more important for students."}

For example, we can play in many ways nowadays, such as playing on an Xbox in our houses or going to a movie theater. On the other hand, older people might not have had the chance to play or watch movies at the theater with their friends. Not only for playing to enjoy life, but we can also easily find new jobs and discover our hobbies through Internet Explorer.\n\nFirst of all, many young people nowadays play Xbox in their houses. Probably in the old days, they just played outdoor sports like basketball or soccer. However, nowadays, we can play soccer or basketball in our house using an Xbox. The new technology systems affect us in many ways. For example, they allow us to talk to someone anywhere and anytime we want. By calling or emailing each other, we can find an enjoyable life.\n\nIn addition, many young people nowadays also go to movie theaters to watch films. In the movie theater, we can choose the movie we want to watch, for instance, a scary movie or a sad movie. By watching them, we can have a fun time in our spare time. Also, while we watch the movie, we can eat any food we want. In the old days, they didn't have any movies, so probably they all watched the news all the time.\n\nFinally, we can easily find our hobbies and new jobs by searching on Internet Explorer. For example, if we are interested in skiing during the winter break, then we can search for the best place to go and even learn how to ski. By searching and finding information from Internet Explorer, we can discover what our hobby is. For instance, when I started to chat with my neighbor and I enjoyed it, then it could become my habit.\n\nIn conclusion, many technology systems contribute to a more enjoyable life than what older people experienced before. Therefore, in my opinion, I agree that young people enjoy life more than older people did in the past."}
{"file_id": "1017877.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. The reason I agree is that I believe successful people are dedicated to improving in any way they operate, and they always want a new target, much more difficult than the past, to achieve. For this reason, they try new things and sometimes take risks, but this gives them the sensation of the power and the potential they have.\n\nNormal people see them and consider that in the same situation or position, they wouldn't take risks quite like the successful people do. In fact, normal people often consider successful people too much out of this world for the reasons that I mentioned earlier.\n\nContrary to what normal people think, I find it ordinary that successful people go in a different direction from normal people because, if it were not so, they wouldn't be successful.\n\nThe success of a person is given first of all by nature because a successful person, before he had success, was born with particular abilities in speaking, playing in general, and in improving what he had to do, compared to other people. With the growth of the person, success comes to those who had these particular abilities since they were young, and for this reason, they become 'effective' successful people.\n\nSociety in general considers that taking risks is the better way to failure or death. I support a different position, and that is if a man doesn't take many risks in his life, he continues to be the little ordinary man that he is. But if a man takes many risks (not always, but sometimes), it is a sign that he could be a successful person.\n\nSuccessful people have luck on their side; in fact, sometimes they undertake an activity with much more success than a normal person could achieve.

However, in my opinion, I think what is significant is that you actually attempt to do something even if you fail. I even think that failing is more important than not attempting to try.\n\nOnly doing what they already know is not going to make one improve more. It would make one confident in only one thing. For instance, if a person is trying and trying to do something as much as he can but he is unsuccessful, he would be successful sooner because he would realize the reason why he failed at this task. In fact, if you attempt to do something and fail at it a few times, it's the leading road to success.\n\nFor the person who only does what he already knows, he will not improve at all but gain confidence. Even if this person really knows what he has to do and how to do a thing well, he won't be as good as the person who fails and has failed many times. The chance will only come to you if you start doing and try doing new things. The more doors you open, the more chances you have to encounter more opportunities. If you keep the door closed, nothing will come to you. Chance will come only if you open the door.\n\nPeople want to succeed and want to have more chances.

{"file_id": "1016245.txt", "output_essay": "In today's world, it is highly debated whether a person should have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects or specialize in one subject. That is, the concepts of 'specialization' and 'all in one' are argued to determine which is better. In this essay, I will try to explain my opinions about the issue I wrote above. Before writing details of my opinion, I would like to say that I believe in the power of specialization and disagree with the statement given in the question.\n\nThe needs and requirements of the academic environment are changing. And I think the trend is moving towards specialization. Specialization means knowing every side and aspect of a subject, covering all of the details. There is a saying in my country, Turkey, which underlines the importance of specialization: 'Instead of knowing a little about every subject, knowing everything about one subject is better.' As soon as I read the statement in the question, I remembered this sentence. And I believe in the message of this sentence.\n\nSpecialization in one subject brings a lot of advantages to the person who is related to it. I would like to explain one of the advantages by giving an example from university life. In Turkey's universities, there are Business Administration Faculties, and under these faculties, there is an 'International Trade Department,' which I would like to specialize in. When I took the University Entrance Exam, there were two choices in front of me. One is studying business administration; the second one is studying international trade. In Turkey, international traders are 100% graduated from business, and they are not international trade specialists. So, when I realized this situation, I decided to study international trade and try to specialize in it. And nowadays, I see the advantages of this; the majority of the Foreign Trade Departments of companies are looking for International Trade Specialists.\n\nAnother point that I consider an advantage of specialization is: if someone asks you what your job is or what your main interest is, you'll be able to give accurate responses. That is, people and yourself will easily be able to know what you are doing and what you are specialized in. For example, if doctors are not specialized in any type of specialization, they will not have any specialized topic, and again a Turkish saying goes, 'they will say I can do any job that you want me to do.'\n\nIn conclusion, specialization is the trend."}

However, I agree with the statement that young people do not give enough time to helping their community for the following reasons.\n\nFirst, young people cannot have enough time to help their communities because it is harder for young people to live on their own. For example, I started working at Goldman Sachs, which is one of the most famous investment banks, in the Tokyo branch in Japan from 1996. At that time, the Japanese economy was at its worst, so it was very difficult for young people to find and hold even a job in Japan. Fortunately, I found a good company to work for, and since then, I had worked long hours every day without much sleep and rest. Considering this situation, we, young people, cannot have enough time to support our communities.\n\nSecond, communities have been decaying themselves. For example, I live in Roppongi, Tokyo, Japan, which is one of the central districts of Japan. A lot of young people, who have to work long hours for themselves, live in this area. In this area, each person does not have any idea that a community exists. In this circumstance, young people do not think to help the community. So they do not give any time to helping their communities.\n\nConsidering the situations in rural areas, there might be an opposite opinion to the one mentioned above.

There are several reasons I think for this situation.\n\nFirst, most young people do not know their neighbors, because there is no opportunity to connect with them. In the past in Japan, people did everything with community members, because those who belonged to the same community were like families, so people decided important things, like rebuilding a house or changing jobs, with the community. People helped others in their communities. However, nowadays, people are not interested in others, and they do not want to have a relationship with their neighbors, because of the horrible incidents that have occurred recently.\n\nSecond, older families and younger families have a generation gap. If there is a chance to do something together in their communities, both families have different opinions. It is natural for people to avoid complex problems, so they do not give enough time to helping the communities and do not have a relationship.\n\nWhen I was a child, I had to clean up the park where I always played with my friends for the community's event. This was a task for the children. Many adults observed us, but on another day, many adults taught sports for the community club. I agree with the opinion that many young people do not give time to their communities, but we should change this custom to improve the relationship between the neighbors and me, because if accidents happen in daily life, those nearest to us help first.

By learning about various subjects and obtaining knowledge from different fields, a person can survive in any part of the world, particularly in any field.\n\nAfter gaining a very good knowledge in various fields, we can understand the importance of these fields in our daily lives, which can be useful at least once in our lifetime.\n\nWe should have knowledge about various academic subjects like literature, arts, science and technology, pharmacy, etc. I mentioned just a few important subjects that play a vital role in our human lives.

By learning about various subjects, we can later specialize in one subject that interests us and helps in developing our career in this busy life.\n\nNowadays, many engineering IT people are settling in the software field to have exposure to various fields."}

In Italy, the place where I live, there are a lot of advertisements that make products seem much better than they really are. I hope these advertisements will disappear because I think the way people spend money isn't a joke.\n\nI could write a lot of examples about this stuff. I have a friend, Kate, who bought a shower gel that promised to make her body skin as smooth as silk, but it isn't the truth! Another example could be the LCD televisions that clerks encourage you to buy with the promise of great viewing and a lot of light, but then you discover that you need to subscribe to a new pay-per-view frequency to see it.\n\nIn the past, I had a lot of arguments with people who sold this kind of stuff. I don't want to say that it is always the same; sometimes there are things that seem great through advertisements, and after you buy them, you discover they are really pretty good.\n\nIn my life, I don't like lies, and I don't like people who lie, and I really hate those who promise you something and then you discover it was just a bad lie. I think that these people deserve legal judgment and to go to jail, especially when they handle other people's money.\n\nI think that in the time we live, with a lot of diffusion, it's important for economies to be clear because having a clear economy is the first step for people to trust their own governments and make the world work in the right direction.\n\nIn my opinion, it's important to have laws that allow people to trust in advertising and make advertisements clear and reliable for people who buy something without bad surprises."}

However, I agree with the statement for the following reasons.\n\nFirst of all, a famous person who advertises products may make us misunderstand the products. For example, I bought a new car three years ago. Because a new car was very expensive for me, I searched a lot of cars by using the internet and talking with salespeople. This searching process continued for about five months. However, the most important factor in buying my car was the TV commercial in which Ichiro, who was the most famous baseball player in Japan, advertised the car. I admired him very much, and if I bought the car, I would feel close to him. However, this decision resulted in failure since this car had a lot of problems. If Ichiro had not advertised this car, I would not have bought it. This experience definitely demonstrates that a famous person who advertises products may make us misunderstand the products.\n\nAdditionally, advertisements often emphasize only the merits of products. For example, I bought a new computer last year. Because this computer was advertised as the cheapest and latest machine, I decided to buy it very quickly. However, I found that most of the software, such as 'word' and 'excel,' were not included in it. Generally speaking, familiar software is included with a computer in Japan. However, this advertisement did not mention this drawback. If I had had all of the information about the computer, I would not have bought it. This example clearly explains that advertisements often emphasize only the good points of products.\n\nIn conclusion, I definitely agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are."}
{"file_id": "1021923.txt", "output_essay": "The argument that successful people are characterized by being individuals who continuously take risks and enter new ventures, and avoid tasks that they are familiar with, is a controversial one. On the one hand, more risk means more return, and greater chances of reaching and building creative ideas and results. On the other hand, working on a task that you know well will promise sure success, as compared to risky avenues that have a tendency to result in huge failures as much as successes. Personally, I believe successful people are the ones that stick to the tasks they can master, and I support my argument with the following three reasons.\n\nFirst, entering risky avenues without the knowledge and experience in the chosen risky task is similar to a gamble; the chances of winning are equal to the chances of losing. It may also be that the chances of losing are higher, as any task requires the performer to learn and educate himself, and also familiarize himself with the task. Take snowboarding as an example; you can't successfully snowboard without practicing for long hours and taking lessons, or you will end up injured.\n\nSecond, working on things that you are familiar with is the beginning of any process of innovation. A number of human resource books state that any process of innovation within any field first requires that you have the knowledge and experience within this field.\n\nThird, a number of losses faced by risk-takers who enter fields they have no knowledge about lead to very severe losses that may very likely impair the person's ability to undertake other tasks in the future. As an example, the market crash in the late 1990s led to substantial losses for the naive investors who devoted their time and a significant amount of their savings to a venture that they had no knowledge about. Many really went bankrupt, lost their families, and their health.\n\nAll in all, I believe success can be reached if people undertake the tasks they are familiar with. The choice of the familiar task leads to a much more positive outcome, compared to an outcome of entering risky avenues that you have no knowledge about."}

{"file_id": "1017038.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with the statement that there will be fewer cars in the next twenty years. There are three points to support my idea. Then, I will list these three points as follows:\n\nFirst of all, the governments of today invest more to improve public transportation, and there will be less need to purchase a private car. Most people in our city buy cars because there are so few public buses and subways, and it always makes them late for work or school. So if the government allocates more of its budget to build the public transportation system, fewer citizens will buy cars. And since the Traffic Mass Action began progress in our city, the number of cars has already declined.\n\nAnother factor that will contribute to the reduction of the number of cars is the decreasing availability and the high expense of crude oil resources. Nowadays, fewer oil fields can extract enough crude oil for people to use. In order to explore new oil resources, we turn our eyes to the sea floor. You know, drilling an oil well on the sea floor requires much more expense and more modern techniques. In addition to the war in the Middle East, the expense of oil has risen far more rapidly than we could have expected. If we want to run a car, we should spend more money on fuel than ever before. And I think this situation will not change in the next twenty years. As a result, it will make us use cars less than we do today.\n\nLast but not least is people's desire to protect the environment and reduce pollution. Using cars causes many environmental problems such as air pollution and noise pollution. All these are harmful to human health. However, people are now more concerned about health problems than ever before. So they will reduce the use of cars to decrease the pollution they cause. For this reason, the number of cars will, of course, decline in the next 20 years.\n\nAll in all, government action, limited natural resources, and the mindset of people to reduce pollution all contribute to the reduced number of cars. And I also think fewer cars will make our lives better and will also benefit society as a whole."}
{"file_id": "1022384.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. From my point of view, it is very important to have people within a society who try to do new things. This is especially important when it comes to innovation. Up to now, there would not be any automobiles or planes if people had not tried to do new things, although these things were connected to high risks. On the one hand, society needs inventions, but on the other hand, you need to look at the risks as well. Regarding Albert Einstein and his inventions, everybody would agree that he created huge value for our society. On the other hand, the question must be raised: would nuclear weapons exist today if he had not been that innovative?\n\nAs most people are part of a community or a company, I would like to focus my answer on the strategic management of a company within a highly competitive market. From my point of view, the only possibility to be successful and to create sustainability is to be innovative and to have innovative employees. Of course, there are a few companies staying in the market by focusing on their core competencies and by 'doing what they already know how to do well,' but to become 'successful,' as mentioned in the question, you have to be innovative. Of course, one could say that a company focusing on only one well-known activity does not have any risk, but from my point of view, the risk is getting kicked out of the market by another very innovative company.\n\nThere is a famous statement referring to the strategic management of a company and its employees, which can be used for all other people as well: 'Often it is more important to do the right things than to do things right.' I draw the conclusion that people trying new things are successful, although they must be aware of the risks."}
{"file_id": "1006488.txt", "output_essay": "In order to compare the lives of young people and older ones, it seems necessary to start off with a brief description of the average young and the average older person.\n\nYoung people enjoy themselves in activities such as meeting friends, going out, doing sports, or listening to music. On one hand, these activities are fun and help a young person to relax after an exhausting day at school or work. But on the other hand, all these activities cannot be enjoyed without a certain amount of money. Because of that, young people can easily get into a rush of working really hard, maybe even having a job while studying at a high school or university, and spending the money in the evenings and on their weekends. They keep switching directly from the status of making money to spending it and forget to just settle down for a moment and simply sit down and read a book or something like that.\n\nSometimes young people even start working almost nonstop so that they can just stop most of their work and have fun later in life, which is the worst of all cases.\n\nOlder people are usually the opposite. Most retired people enjoy a slow day without getting in rushes or being stressed. They have no fear of sticking to everyday habits, which provides a basis for a settled and enjoyable life. They don't feel like they miss out on things when they go to bed early every once in a while, which is a problem a lot of young people share.\n\nIf people try to compare these two different types of enjoying life, a basic problem shows up immediately. If someone put an older person into a young person's position, he or she would think it's unbelievably stressful. On the other hand, the young person would probably call the older person's life entirely boring. The only difference is that most young people enjoy their lives at a way higher risk of becoming stressed and getting in a rush with things.\n\nSo after all, a young person doesn't enjoy life more than an older person does; both enjoy life just in totally different ways. Still, one should not forget the fact that we are discussing stereotypes here; there might still be a lot of people at all ages that don't enjoy their lives."}
{"file_id": "1021251.txt", "output_essay": "It is really important to have broad knowledge, but it's true that in this age we also need people who are specialized in one specific subject. This problem begins to appear when you finish high school and, I think, it never disappears.\n\nI said that it is important to have broad knowledge because only if you have tasted a lot of different things can you really choose one of these things. You have to decide and feel what is the subject that you prefer, that you like, and only when you have really understood it can you go on and specialize in it.\n\nTo specialize is the second step. This is really important because in this period the world moves quickly and we need people organizing themselves in sectors. We need people to do their work at the best level and, for this reason, people need to specialize themselves. For example, an economist must know math and economic history, etc., very well, so he has to study a lot in this specific subject.\n\nAt the same time, he also has to know other knowledge, not because our system wants it, but because I think that if we want to become a complete person we must have an open mind and having broad knowledge is a way to open our mind.\n\nIn my opinion, this is an instrument with which we can change the future."}
{"file_id": "1019727.txt", "output_essay": "One of the main problems of the scholastic system in Italy is the extensive curriculum we have for all the subjects we are required to learn. I can say from my own experience that most of the information given to us at school is forgotten immediately after we study it. I completely agree with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas. A famous Italian writer once said that what we call culture is not what we remember having studied at school, but the mix of all the experiences and all the ideas we have, and it doesn't matter if we don't remember some trivial details about something we studied years ago.\n\nIn my opinion, a good teacher should try to guide a student through history (for example), not by filling their head with dates or names of ancient emperors and facts, but by trying to engage that student, talking about the differences between our life and the life of that time, and trying to transport the student into a fantastic world with the wand of imagination. Of course, we can say the same for most subjects, but with some exceptions like mathematics or physics. Moreover, we can forget learned facts, especially because they may not align with our everyday life, so that we may never have the opportunity to recall that fact to mind. But we can be sure that if we have learned the idea of something, we'll never let it go.\n\nIt is more important for students to have a taste of things, which allows them to develop passions and interests. In conclusion, Italian schools (but I'm pretty convinced it is a problem felt in other countries) should impart values to their students, just the sense of how many things we don't know, and open the door to infinite worlds students should explore by themselves, depending on their interests."}
{"file_id": "1027947.txt", "output_essay": "I disagree with the following statement. In fact, I hope to become a person who will specialize in one specific subject. Currently, I am studying mechanical engineering at the university, and when I finish, I plan to work in an industrial factory. This is one reason why I do not agree with that opinion. In fact, I have to continuously acquire knowledge about mechanical problems because this is a condition that will allow me to easily enter the job market. Therefore, I still have to study more to reach that goal.\n\nDespite this consideration, having broad knowledge of many subjects can also yield important results for the future. Being knowledgeable in other areas such as economics, literature, or foreign languages presents another opportunity, and with this broader culture, you can achieve interesting results to enhance your career. However, I think that it is better to know only one sector of one's job.\n\nPerhaps an explanation can be given. Ever since I was a young boy, around ten years old, I had a clear idea of what I wanted to do when I became an adult. I always wanted to be an engineer. My father is an engineer, and my grandfather was also an engineer, and perhaps this has influenced my choice and my opinion about this statement.\n\nTherefore, I attended a Technical School and received a diploma as a mechanic.

{"file_id": "1021707.txt", "output_essay": "The school provides a good environment for students to be educated. Some people emphasize the great importance for students to understand ideas and concepts in their school settings, while others argue that the significance of learning facts should not be neglected. As far as I see it, it would be more reasonable for the school to teach their students more about how to understand ideas and concepts. Some of my reasons are given below.\n\nThe main reason for my propensity is that the school provides the best environment for students to understand ideas and concepts, while the facts can be learned by the students themselves through other ways, such as the internet and documentary films. In the classroom, students can be guided by the teacher, and they can discuss matters with their classmates, which are both of utmost importance for them to understand ideas and concepts. If the teachers just keep telling the students the facts, the advantageous aspect of the school would be wasted. Furthermore, other methods enable the students to learn facts that are far more valuable and more up-to-date. The internet contains much more information than the textbooks used in the classroom, and the information is likely to be the latest.\n\nBesides, understanding ideas and concepts helps students solve more complex problems. As we have noticed, exams nowadays are more flexible, which not only require students to list facts printed in the book but also require them to make use of their learned ideas and concepts to achieve a higher score. If a high school student can grasp the ideas and concepts in class, he or she will probably get a higher score in the College Entrance Examination, which can exercise an extremely important impact on this student's future career.\n\nAdditionally, were students eager to understand the ideas and concepts, they are more likely to discuss or share their opinions with their classmates and the teachers. That would undoubtedly help the students' interpersonal communication ability. Moreover, communication can result in friendship. When students are discussing with each other, they may find something in common between them, or even can become friends owing to it. As the time for them to discuss problems goes by, their friendship is likely to solidify.\n\nThough learning facts is also very important in education, judging from what has been mentioned above, I believe it is understanding ideas and concepts that far outweighs the opposite aspect."}
{"file_id": "1003689.txt", "output_essay": "I do not believe that in twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. Many factors contribute to my belief. These factors include the current state of driving, current drivers, and development in the area of driving. Through this investigation, it will be shown why I disagree with the statement.\n\nThe current state of driving today is one that has morphed several times to reach where it is. Before cars ever existed, people found other ways of transport such as boats and horses. The general aim was to be transported or to transport items from place to place. The first car that was produced revolutionized the transportation system. People became more time-efficient in reaching their destinations. Technological advances are made every day, so as cars started to become faster, people started to lose sight of the purpose of a car. Now faster cars constitute faster drivers. People now place more importance on the pleasure of speeding and performing stunts, rather than getting to where they need to be. This state of driving has an effect on the drivers.\n\nToday, we find that more adolescents are interested in cars than before. As young adults, they enjoy extremes and risks, and the young age at which they are granted a license does not help. Most accidents in my country of Bahrain are attributed to the speeding of young people, and the fact that the mortality rate increases each year seems to have no effect whatsoever. Now, for a driver seeking an adrenaline rush and a living-on-the-edge attitude, the right technology has to be developed.\n\nAs I mentioned before, cars today are faster and technologically better than before. We should acknowledge that advancements will not cease, and if we take other life factors into consideration, we see that cars are demanded and are needed even more. As job requirements relating to cars change, so do car expectations. New roads are always being built, and so faster, more reliable cars need to be engineered according to the newly built roads.\n\nNo matter what is done to reduce car usage, such as increasing the age requirement or investing in other modes of transportation, I believe that people cannot give up on cars due to the privacy and efficiency they provide. Logically speaking, if the world progresses, we go forward, not backward, and so in conclusion, forward to me means more cars and not fewer."}

It's a problem because reserves of petroleum are going to become smaller, and because of this, the price of petroleum is increasing. Nowadays, the environmental question is very popular in European countries, and cars are considered a very bad element for the environment's health. So, in my opinion, in twenty years, the number of cars in Europe, Japan, and the United States will be lower. But, in my opinion, cars will be fewer in twenty years than today in developing countries (in poorer countries) like African countries or South American countries because for them, cars are still a very important element for economic growth. People in those countries use their cars a lot to go to their jobs, whereas in countries that are already developed and rich, people are used to taking the subway, buses, and the tramway. However, because the poorer population represents a big part of the worldwide population, if all those people are going to have a car, the worldwide number of cars will dramatically grow. There is also the problem of lobbying. The car lobby is very important in the United States of America, so they will not allow the American government to make a law about the number of cars per family. So if some people would like to make the number of cars smaller, they will be in conflict with politicians and the lobby. In my opinion, in twenty years, there will be a terrible struggle between environmental protectors and car constructors (General Motors, Ford, VW, etc.). I'm very sure that Greenpeace will become a more and more important organization because who doesn't want to take care of our environment? In my opinion, the number of cars can also be smaller in twenty years because circulation problems are terrible in big cities such as Paris or NYC. That's why nowadays, cars are forbidden in the center of London. Because of this prohibition, I'm very sure that a big part of Londoners sold their cars and didn't buy a new one. Cars have become useless in London. I also heard that Paris would like to do the same. Isn't that evidence that the number of cars in Europe is going to decrease? As a conclusion, we can say that in some parts of the world, in twenty years, cars will be fewer, but in another part, their number is going to be less important."}

Although this statement may sound totally unaware of the fact that the number of car owners is quickly growing all over the world, I will now explain the reasons for my idea.\n\nCar prices have been decreasing slightly in the past few decades. Originally born as a super-luxury status symbol back at the end of the nineteenth century, we can therefore clearly state that today cars are a commodity affordable by almost anyone in any industrialized country.\nHowever, this apparently positive change in the situation has led to two extremely negative effects: the abrupt rise in oil prices and a tremendous impact on the planet's environment.\n\nFirst things first, since cars are produced and sold even in large, heavily populated countries like China and India (together comprising more than one-third of the world population altogether), markets where once they were unavailable to almost the entirety of people, their demanded quantity has risen to the sky, and so have fuel prices. Petroleum extracting sites are used in an increasingly savage way, but the lack of supply of this fundamental mineral has caused, according to a very well-known economic law, an increase in its price.\nAs of today, even extracting sites placed very far from any valuable market, or very expensive to use, have been approached by extracting companies (e.g., in Alaska, in the North Sea, through oceanic platforms, etc.) after the traditional sites' shortage.\n\nIt is my opinion that oil prices will, unfortunately, rise more and more, to the point where cars will once again be an item affordable only by very rich people, therefore significantly decreasing their number.\nThe only solution to this inevitable economic disaster would be to find some alternative energy source; however, research in that field has been progressing slowly in recent years, thus our energy future is not looking bright at all.\n\nBesides, how can we not mention the fact that since the use of cars spread around every continent (and it's going to get worse in the short term), pollution's effects on global environments have increased so much?\nCars are not what you might call an ecological mode of transportation: having more and more of them driving around all over the world might even lead to the worst outcome.\nSome scientists, in fact, have even come to think that if their number continues to increase over the years, world governments could even ban their use, so as to protect the environment, which, however, by that day will probably be seriously compromised.\n\nTo summarize, I think that the number of cars will grow in the short term until it will be too much to afford them (in economic and ecological terms): from that moment on, I believe there will be fewer and fewer of them, even less than today."}

However, one might really ask oneself whether there will be more or fewer automobiles in twenty years. Despite several reasons to believe there will be fewer cars, I personally think there will be more cars in use in twenty years than there are today. The main reasons for this theory are, first, that people have, do, and always will love cars. Second, an automobile is too useful to disappear from the surface of the planet. Third, the laws against pollution are not very effective.\n\nFirst of all, people have deeply loved cars since their inception, and there is no real reason why this would suddenly stop. Cars carry an image of wealth and happiness. They could also be part of certain dreams and fantasies since they are often used in movies, for example.\n\nMoreover, a car is fundamentally very helpful. It is a convenient mode of transportation, a very flexible one. In my opinion, there is not any other invention, to date, that allows people to decide to leave a spot for another one and go off immediately. I bet there will not be one either in the next few decades. Another example of the usefulness of automobiles is that you can put more personal stuff in them than when you travel by plane or by train, for instance.\n\nFinally, the political battles waged against car pollution have not permitted the number of cars to decrease. Thus, I think this ineffectiveness will continue in the future. For example, if it is true that people driving cars in Mexico have to pay more taxes, it is still the most polluted city in the world, because the number of cars in use in this city is still the same. I think this will also continue in twenty years.\n\nTo sum up, there will probably not be fewer cars in use in twenty years because of the three major reasons I expressed. But, of course, it is only a guess, since nobody can really predict the future."}

Therefore, I agree with the statement that it is more important to understand ideas and concepts than merely learning the facts.\n\nAs we see, students in their schools or colleges perform much better when they understand the concepts well and have a clear idea of the subject that is being taught. They never have to cram things when the basic concept is clear in their minds. Also, they never forget that thing for their entire life.

Like in today's world, one must have the idea and concept of a computer to perform well in an office or in his or her job.\n\nThirdly, it is very important for a player of any game to know the basic concept of the game rather than the facts. When I learned to play football, my coach told me the main concept behind the game, and hence I play the game well. Simply knowing the facts about football cannot make me a good player.\n\nThus, we saw that knowing the concepts and the basic ideas behind a subject is much better than simply knowing the facts."}

We have some living examples like some business legends who reached the peaks of their business and were preparing themselves for social service.\n\nNobody can walk without falling often, so nothing can be achieved without risk."}

The reasons for my thinking are as follows:\nFirstly, a guide is a professional person. His aim will be only one, and that is to make his customer go around each of the visiting points without giving them time to fully enjoy the place. If we all friends can make our own way by ourselves.\n\nSecondly, without a guide, you can travel at your own convenience. For example, last month I went on a tour to Bombay (Bollywood city), Lonavala, and Khandala (tourist places) with my college friends. These places are very beautiful and full of natural scenes. Over there, we had hired a guide to take us to different places. That guide rounded all the places within one and a half hours. There were many places which he showed us from a long distance. My friends and I requested him to spend a fraction of time at every place, but unfortunately, he did not allow it. Our bad luck.\n\nBut for another example, last year I went on a tour with my relatives without a guide. The place was definitely unknown to us. But by our own efforts, we reached it. So, I do not prefer to have a guide on a tour."}
{"file_id": "1024250.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with the statement given to me. Traveling with a group allows me to share more things with different people who are in the group. Traveling in a group with a guide will enable me to discover new places which I had never visited before. The guide will explain the entire information about the place. Traveling in a group has more advantages because if the information about a place is not known to the guide, I will try to learn the information with my colleagues in the group. A tour guide will probably have a clear idea of which place is more important than others. If we have limited time to explore new places in the country, it is suitable to take advice from the tour guide. Traveling in a group makes me more enthusiastic to learn new things. If I had visited the place earlier, I would try to explain the place I had visited. Traveling in a group will keep me away from laziness. I will try to understand the different cultures that exist in a country and the ideas of different people, whether they are thinking in a positive or negative manner. Traveling in a group makes me pay more attention and concentrate better than I had before. People within the group make the travel experience more enjoyable. It will release my tensions and problems. Traveling with the group makes it easy to travel because it does not let me feel the passage of time. I can travel longer distances with the group."}
{"file_id": "1025599.txt", "output_essay": "Have you ever tried to figure out the hard and complicated math questions? Some people suggest that it is important for students to learn the facts. On the other hand, I think that understanding the concepts is much more important than just learning the facts. I support my opinion with two reasons: people will remember longer when they understand the ideas, and they will also figure out all the questions, even though they are hard and complicated.\n\nFirst of all, people tend to remember longer when they understand the concepts or the ideas. However, when they just learn and memorize the facts, they will forget about it quickly. For instance, in biology, I learned about the 'Feedback system' in the human body, and I was able to understand how this system works because my mother knew about biology very well. However, my friend, who didn't get help from anyone, just memorized and learned the whole process of the 'Feedback system,' and a week ago, we had a pop quiz in biology class. I managed to figure out all the questions about the 'Feedback system,' but my friend couldn't solve any of the questions. In this case, I was able to answer all these questions because I understood how the 'Feedback system' worked, while my friend couldn't answer them because he forgot what he memorized and learned before.\n\nSecondly, students can figure out any hard questions if they fully understand the facts or the ideas. This happens a lot in math classes. Math teachers don't just ask students easy and simple questions; they make the questions complicated and hard for students to solve. Students who understand the ideas would be able to solve these questions. However, students who just memorized or learned the facts will be confused or hesitate to figure out the questions because they only have basic knowledge about the concepts and ideas.\n\nSince students don't forget or misuse the knowledge when they understand the concepts, and students who understand the ideas and the concepts will manage to figure out all the hard and high-level questions. Above all, I state that understanding the facts and the ideas is much more important than just learning the facts."}
{"file_id": "1025673.txt", "output_essay": "Recently, you may have realized that there are more and more advertisements, not just on TV programs, but also in some newspapers and magazines. This leads us to deeply consider whether advertisements make products seem better than they really are. In my opinion, I agree with that statement. To begin with, products of mediocre quality often spend much on advertisements. Most companies invest a lot of money in advertising their products, overshadowing the function and use. This is harmful and not responsible to the customers. Actually, many good quality products cannot afford expensive advertising, so they cannot attract many customers.\n\nWhat's more, most customers like to find their preferred products according to TV ads. As you know, most people spend about 1-2 hours in front of the TV. They think the advertisements are very trustworthy, especially those announced by a famous person. If they like the person, they will trust the function of the product. Consequently, they waste a lot of money on that. In fact, the product is not really what they think it is.\n\nFinally, many beautiful words and descriptions of the products really make them seem to be useful. Many people add some uses that don't really exist in the products and also overstate the function of it. Many words sound very reasonable and trustworthy; it's hard for you to analyze the false from the true. So, people will easily spend money on purchasing one to have a try. For instance, a medicine that cannot cure a headache might be advertised as being able to cure your headache and help you easily go to sleep.\n\nIn a word, most advertisements can make products seem better than they really are, in different ways. You must be careful in your choices."}

It has been important for almost the past century, but it seems like it's becoming even more important today. The reason for this development is that developing countries, or newly developed ones, are expanding their industries. And it's well known that one of the major sectors of the industry is the car industry.\n\nTherefore, more and more cars are being built every day in the world, and they will be in use on our streets sooner or later. For example, Asian countries are becoming very powerful in this area. We all know brands like Toyota, Honda, and others. And if we pay attention to the cars around us, we'll notice how common it becomes to see people with those cars.\n\nBesides, this development doesn't mean that the other developed countries have stopped making cars. They actually try to catch up with those countries and are making new cars too. For example, we have Volkswagen and BMW in Germany, Chevrolet, General Motors in the United States, and much more.\n\nThey are all trying to be more competitive, so they are all developing new cars and selling more cars too.\n\nThe car industry is an important economic area for every country today; that's why I personally think that a huge number of cars is coming, and in twenty years, it won't be solved at all.\n\nBut, today we can also see the development of environmental concerns. More and more organizations are opening in order to protect our planet: Greenpeace was the first one but definitely not the last one created.\n\nAnd in my opinion, it's also becoming a political strategy, so we may have a \"solution\" to this environmental damage: a new kind of car that won't pollute as much, for example, cars using electricity.\n\nTo conclude, I would say that economic strategies won't let the car industry disappear, but they might find new techniques in order to combine a strong economy with the protection of our environment."}
{"file_id": "1024522.txt", "output_essay": "Learning mechanisms work in different ways from person to person. Some people choose to memorize the facts, while others choose to learn how the facts can be produced. Learning concepts and ideas is important because you can remember the facts by brainstorming about the concepts and ideas, and you can become familiar with learning new facts about a different topic.\n\nFirst of all, it must be accepted that memorizing facts can be a fast way to learn. It can work in a small period of time. For instance, you can pass the next examination. On the other hand, when you forget a fact, it will be very hard to remember if you don't know the ideas and concepts behind them. If you learn the ideas and concepts, you can guess how the fact is derived. So, learning the ideas and concepts can work in keeping the data in mind for a long time.\n\nFurthermore, once you get used to learning how a fact can be derived from an idea, you can easily learn an unfamiliar topic. Every lecture has facts and ideas, and the relationship between facts and ideas is the same. Firstly, you will try to understand the ideas. According to the ideas in the concept, you can learn the facts as reliably as you derived these facts. You can use exactly the same method when learning new lectures.\n\nAs a result, learning the ideas is better than memorizing the facts, even though it requires more time to understand. The data will be more stable, easier to remember, and learning new topics will be easier than memorizing every fact of every lecture."}

Without the understanding of the required concepts and ideas, it will be difficult to grasp the core of the passage or the theory. Of course, the facts will be useless when the main idea is not conveyed to the students. All of us have heard about the 'funny stories.' These pieces of information we hear from other people are meaningless most of the time, but why do we laugh to tears and catch the meaning of the words instead of just understanding the fact, which means nothing to you? This is because the fact is like the lower-division course which just leads the listener or the student to understand the surface of the words, yet the more important information the 'funny story' wants to send to the listener is the idea and concept, that is the upper-division course, including what's beneath the surface of the story. I believe this is the key and most of us should be concerned about it.\n\nWhile facts sometimes really improve our repository of knowledge about news we are not familiar with, the fact is that its usefulness is such a small part of the main benefit we derive from the information. We should deduce sometimes, to grasp the underlying idea and concept to understand the fact much more clearly. Without understanding the core of the delivered information, we may misunderstand the meaning of the fact and never escape the darkness of misunderstanding.\n\nBewildering amounts of students just read about the Times News to catch up with the world and the happenings. They hardly have the enthusiasm to dig deeper to summarize the main idea of the situation they are facing. It is indeed the pollution of information surrounding them. As a result of this, with their simplistic understanding, they make comments to others, and they always indulge in these mistakes. This is just like a 'hoax' or deception. They think they will never plead ignorance to anything without realizing that they are making countless mistakes. And these mistakes will overtake and ruin them someday. Only because these students cannot see what is behind the fact, ideas, and concepts."}
{"file_id": "1018958.txt", "output_essay": "People always say that if you want to learn more about an unfamiliar city or place, just stop reading; making a trip there is a definite way to solve this problem. I do agree with this, but should we travel with a group led by a tour guide or just go there by ourselves? I believe that the attitudes people maintain toward this question will differ. I would rather say that I'd like to go to a new place on my own.\n\nFirst of all, it is hard to deny that the goal of our travel is to feel and enjoy different cultures, for the most part. I would say that I am a boy who likes adventure because that is more exciting than going with a group. Culture can be seen as a representation of a place and should also be respected. If I gain a great amount of knowledge about those cultures from the tour guide, that will make me feel disappointed, and the knowledge will become tedious and boring to me. The only way that I get to know a new culture is to experience it myself.\n\nIn addition, joining a group led by a tour guide seems restrictive because our journey is already planned by the guide, and the guide can even try to convince us to buy some expensive local crafts which can benefit the guide. That will make our trips unacceptable.\n\nFurthermore, it is impossible to say that traveling with a group is cheap. If I go somewhere on my own, I will make a precise plan to control my costs, and I can even stay at my friend's home that is beside the place I want to visit. This can not only save a considerable amount of money but also give my trip a more wonderful feeling and more significant meaning.\n\nAs I have mentioned above, I would rather say that I do like to travel to a place on my own."}

I think it was not a problem at all; we arrived in Japan well and went shopping, took pictures with native people, etc. During this trip, I got along well with my friends.\n\nSecond, we can become acquainted with the history of the places we travel to. Without a tour guide, we can study the history of our travel destinations. Nowadays, according to international social development, we can find a lot of information and history about Japan.

{"file_id": "1017400.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects rather than specializing in one specific subject.\n\nThere are several reasons why I think this way.\n\nFirst of all, it is crucial to choose someone's future once. It is too early to decide what to study. The more we experience, the more we can choose. We don't know what we really want to do yet because we couldn't have had enough time to think. Most university students are not sure about their future.\n\nIn my case, I chose French as my major and have worked with French. After two years, I was confused about whether my choice was right or not. I decided to take some English classes and talked to a professor about my situation. I could think about my problem sufficiently after that. Lastly, I decided to double major in English and French. If I hadn't taken English classes, I wouldn't know what I exactly wanted to study at the university because I wouldn't even know I liked studying English.\n\nSecondly, sometimes people don't have much knowledge outside of their major, and this can make a person boring. Nowadays, society wants people who have many interests and talents. We can learn this information from other activities, such as other academic subjects. From these studies, we can explore other majors.\n\nFor instance, there is a leisure sports department at my university. Many of my friends were interested in jazz dances and physical exercises like bodybuilding. Even though their major was not leisure sports, they took those classes and had a lot of fun.\n\nFrom these subjects, not only could they enjoy their campus lives, but they could also create great memories and experiences.\n\nUntil graduating from high school, we couldn't choose what we wanted to study, and we have the right to choose many subjects and to get interesting information from outside our major.\n\nThis can be very helpful in our campus lives."}
{"file_id": "1017282.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with the statement that products seem much better than they really are because of the advertisements used. The marketing department of every company tries to create successful advertisements to sell more products. Their aim is to influence consumers to buy their articles or products.\n\nBecause of this, they use different strategies for different products to attract potential users. For example, the marketing department might use kids and a happy family in an advertisement for a family car, hoping that the head of the household will think, 'That's the perfect car for our family. I will buy this one next week.'\n\nAdvertisements like this are everywhere: during breaks in movies or between TV shows, there are always spots aimed at getting viewers to buy the product.\n\nAnother example could be an advertisement for washing machines: 'It's the cheapest washing machine in the world; you will save a lot of money buying this one!' However, it may not be an economical product, meaning the consumer may have to pay a lot for water and electricity due to poor technology.\n\nManagers use this strategy to make the article appear as the best. They want to outsell other companies.\n\nThat's why consumers need to decide on their own which product is best for them. The best way to do this is not to listen to or watch too much advertising. In most cases, it is better to look beyond the advertisement, meaning you need to consider what you can really do with the product.\n\nConsumers need to compare products—determining which one has the best features or is the most economical, rather than which one looks the best in the advertisement."}
{"file_id": "1027345.txt", "output_essay": "I think we should improve our lives right now, so I agree with this statement. I have several reasons. First, I think successful people can improve the things that are not good, so they should take risks. For example, if they know how to make the computer well and they don't take risks to change the computer to be more convenient and more useful, we might not have notebooks in our lives. Therefore, I think we need to take risks to improve our lives. On the other hand, some people only make computers because they already do well; they can't make improvements in that computer. Their business might go down. In addition, this is a competitive world, so we need to improve. Second, we should make new things that successful people need to take risks for. For instance, many people have CD players; they have improved its lightness and usefulness, but other companies make MP3 players that are more useful and lighter. It means there are risks if people don't like MP3 players; their company might die out. It is a big risk. However, if it succeeds, the business can get richer than before and more famous. In conclusion, I think successful people should try new things, not only do what they already know how to do well because if they take risks, they can get richer and it's also good for people who live in this world. It means they can improve things and also make useful new things for people."}
{"file_id": "108871.txt", "output_essay": "\"Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.\" \n\nI agree with the above statement that successful people should try and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. A person must first secure his position both financially and mentally by doing what he is skilled at. Then, there is no point in doing the same thing over and over again and producing the same results. For a person to grow in life, he must try innovative means to do the same work or try new things and take risks.\n\nAs we know, doing the same work repeatedly will add nothing but boredom to one's life. To add spice to life, one must try something new. However, this should be done carefully and responsibly so that it does not affect one's existing reputation and profession. Let us consider one of the giants in the global economy, Mr. Dhirubhai Ambani, who was the founder and director of Reliance Industrial Group in India. He initially entered the market in the final quarter of the 20th century by starting a textile firm, which he struggled very hard to develop into a very big company. He was very successful and was financially very secure at that time. Yet, he was a true entrepreneur and tried out innovative things and took many risks by entering the petroleum industry. Now, Reliance Petroleum is a very big name in the Indian economy.\n\nIn addition to the above-mentioned industries, he also started Reliance Telecommunications, which is the first CDMA mobile service in India. He reaped huge profits through this. In fact, the Reliance group has entered the energy and retail sectors as well. Today, the Reliance Group stands among the top 50 companies globally. All this would not have been possible if he had not taken the risks and entered into these businesses instead of holding on to the textile business.\n\nSo, I think it is always better to secure your position first, both financially and mentally, and then try out innovative things and take risks to develop your business. A successful man doesn't rest at any point in time but strives hard to be more successful. Successful people try new things and take risks rather than doing what they already know how to do well."}
{"file_id": "1026161.txt", "output_essay": "It is interesting to travel and learn about the culture of other countries. When I travel, I usually do so with a tour guide. I become more pleased after traveling in a group than when traveling freely. I strongly believe that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide because I can gain knowledge and spend travel money more effectively.\n\nTo begin with, I can gain knowledge. One of the tour guides' tasks is to help people understand the culture of other countries. They also need to ensure that they present the culture and provide opportunities for travelers to experience it. To illustrate, I went to Hong Kong last week, and it was very nice. The tour guide showed us the culture of Hong Kong, and not only that, we could also eat Hong Kong's food and visit places where Hong Kong people usually go in their daily lives. He also talked about the history of Hong Kong, which helped us understand the culture easily, and I became interested. Therefore, with a tour guide, travelers can learn about the countries more deeply.\n\nMoreover, I can use the money spent on traveling more effectively. Some people travel to escape daily work and to relieve their stress. They think they need to relax during travel, but they also need money to travel, so I think it is not cost-effective. For instance, when I went to Cambodia, I didn't go with a tour guide, so I didn't know where to go. As a result, I just spent my time resting in my hotel room, which was a waste of time and money. Even though I could have rested at home, I chose to spend money and rest in another country, which was not a good choice. Thus, I can save money.\n\nTo wrap up, I think the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide. First of all, I can gain knowledge and learn deeply about other countries. Also, I can use the money that is spent more effectively."}

A person must choose a specific subject to learn about because it will take a very long time to become an expert in a specific subject. When a person achieves this, he or she will be qualified for many jobs related to that subject.\n\nIn developed countries, the teachers of young students observe their students and identify the areas in which the students are more effective, and then they assist their students in that direction. Those students take the courses to which their teachers have directed them. Later in their higher education, they can choose a specific subject and they will be effective in that subject because their skills are useful for that subject.\n\nOn the other hand, if a person does not choose a branch to specialize in, he or she will have knowledge of many academic subjects.

{"file_id": "1014908.txt", "output_essay": "I do agree with the statement that advertisements make you feel that the product advertised is better than what it actually is. The reason is that they use famous people, perfect results, incredible situations, and many more tactics to make their products look better than they really are.\n\nIn advertisements, they always make claims of excellent results. For example, in an ad for a fairness cream, it might claim that it will make you fair in six weeks, but when you actually try it out, the results are not as spectacular as the ad claims. Thus, the ad makes the product seem better than it actually is.\n\nAnother way by which advertisements make their product look better is that they use star power. That is, they hire either a big movie star or a sports celebrity to endorse their product. This attracts the public to the product without really paying all that much attention to the product itself. Thus, the product will seem better to you just because a particular star is using it. It will not matter to you if the product is not really all that good. What does matter is that your favorite star is using it. Thus, star power helps enhance the product and make it seem better than it actually is.\n\nAlso, in advertisements, many times, the model is able to do incredible things after using the product. For example, the ad might show that after drinking their product, the model is able to do incredible stunts. These stunts will make the product and the people who use it look cool, and it will very much appeal to the young male population. They would only want to use the product, as it is associated with cool people, and they would also want to become cool people. Thus, the product is made to look better than it actually is.\n\nLast but not least, the ads barely mention the disadvantages of using their product. For example, in an ad for mutual funds, the disadvantage is mentioned so quickly that the viewer barely pays attention to it, thus drawing attention only to its good points.\n\nThus, advertisements make their products look better by using star power, claiming exaggerated results, and employing many psychological tricks."}

Last year, I had really long black hair, but my hair condition was not good, so I decided to make my hair healthier. At that time, I ran into an advertisement featuring a very attractive woman whose hair looked like silk. What I felt at that time was, if I used that product, I would have fascinating hair like that woman's! I used it for a long time, but I couldn't achieve silky hair like hers. Initially, I was depressed, but then I began to think, that's what advertisers do. 'Over-advertise.'\n\nMoreover, in my opinion, there is a reasonable reason that companies have to 'over-advertise.' From my experience that I mentioned above, I wondered why they do it. Why can't they just be honest so that no one would expect what could never happen. Then, I got the idea. There are hundreds of different shampoos on the market. To capture people's attention, they have to be attractive to survive the competition with others.\n\nIn short."}

{"file_id": "1014998.txt", "output_essay": "Some people argue as if it were a general truth that understanding ideas and concepts is much more important than learning facts. But to be frank, I cannot agree with them. There are numerous reasons why I hold no confidence in them, and I would like to explore a few primary ones here.\n\nTo begin with, we can learn the ideas and concepts during the study of facts. Teachers will be able to teach the students the ideas and concepts by teaching a specific fact. Let's take a look at a physics class. At the very beginning, the teacher gives the class a specific problem and asks them to solve it. The students might not be able to solve it, so the teacher could offer some conceptual suggestions that could help to solve this problem and encourage them to think again. And this time, the students might know how to solve the actual problem and also learn the basic concept.\n\nFurthermore, why do we learn ideas and concepts? For practical work, of course. So, why don't we learn something that is more practical? Learning facts will lead us to work directly, and it would not waste a lot of time studying the boring theories or concepts, and this would save much more time.\n\nLast but not least, studying facts will sometimes be more useful than studying concepts. For example, imagine we are learning how to repair a bike. From the books, we may just know how to solve the general problems. But when we face a special problem, an integrating problem that causes noises from all over the bike, for example, what could we do? We might find it complicated to solve this kind of problem.\n\nTo sum up, learning facts can help us save a lot of time and because the purpose of learning is for work, studying facts might sometimes be more useful when we work than studying ideas and concepts. Taking into account all these factors, we may reach the conclusion that it is advisable to learn facts rather than to understand the ideas and concepts."}

The progress of medicine, which prolongs our lives, and the increasing population lead me to believe that there will be more humans in 2026 than in 2006. And due to this increase, the number of cars sold each year suggests that car development will follow the same trend as the population. Moreover, no government has yet taken a position to discover a new means of transport. They are developing composite fuels (with ethanol) or other kinds of fuel to reduce gas emissions in the atmosphere, but not to reduce the number of cars.\n\nBut on the other hand, many things lead me to think the contrary. Firstly, I have talked about the progress made by medicine in the first section, but it's also about all the progress made in science in general. Something makes me think that some utopists had the right idea. I am waiting to see cars replaced by planes. It's logical to me. And why couldn't teleportation be created in the near future? Teleportation could replace cars.\n\nSecondly, I am sure that the impending lack of petroleum, which must happen in the coming years, will be the catalyst for substitution. Even if we find solutions... but today, it is not going in that direction. We can also try to limit the number of cars by establishing mass means of transport, like buses or trains.\n\nFinally, the lack of petroleum is not the only reason for a potential decline in the number of cars. Even if we continue to discover new materials, added to the number of cars produced each year, we can anticipate a shortage in metals, plastics, as the consumption by all inhabitants of this Earth is so rapid.\n\nTo me, it is difficult to predict such a statement, even if I hope there will be fewer and fewer cars, and what I hope the most is that a genius will create teleportation, which will be very efficient for all people around the world.

{"file_id": "1028226.txt", "output_essay": "Yes, I do agree with the topic that young people enjoy life more than older people. This topic is a very interesting one because many people may not agree with my view. Life is not as it was some years ago; it has become very fast-paced. Due to this, even the stress levels have increased, making it difficult for the older ones to cope. Older people are not able to compete with their younger rivals. This means they are not able to enjoy their work or the success it brings. So, it would be fair to say the young are able to enjoy life more. Some time back, I read in a novel that Alexander could pursue his plans vigorously only due to his youth. From history, we do know that the great emperor Trajan lamented that he could do no more conquests due to his old age. So, this shows that in order to do most things in life, we need youth. To even enjoy life and its pleasures, we need youth. We have read in numerous stories that men have been searching for the elixir of youth to stay young forever. Even many of the modern-day research efforts are aimed at slowing the aging process and its effects, with billions of dollars being spent on it. To undertake many adventures in life, we also need youth. Youth is a divine gift which must not be wasted because you can't get it back. So, we must accomplish important things in life while we have youth; else, we are too late. This is my personal opinion. I am not saying that old age is a curse or anything; rather, that youth is a blessing, so we have to use it to the maximum, i.e., enjoy life when we have the youth so we won't regret it in our old age."}

However, the ways to conduct education through learning differ. For some authors, it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. For others, learning facts is more important. Here (in my opinion), the question is to show that learning facts is better. In other words, I will show why I disagree with the statement using two examples.\n\nFirst, this example is related to the field of Mathematics. It is obvious that students involved in memorizing theories, assumptions, propositions, and theorems related to Mathematics will have much difficulty remembering most of the theories. For that reason, software applications are, in some way, a method for students to remember easily what they have studied. This example can be applied in many other fields like economics, agriculture, etc. For students in agriculture to really have a deep understanding and clear knowledge of what they have learned, they need to be in the field or in a greenhouse in order to apply the basic theories on chemistry, agronomy, and so on.\n\nThe second example is related to the first steps of education. During my primary school, I visited some historical places in the framework of our class on History and Geography. A historical place like Goree (with its Slavery House) is still etched in my memory, and the explanation of the guide as well, as if I were in that place during the Slavery Trade. Compared to people who have never been to that place, I am more able and more likely to talk about History.\n\nTo conclude, it can be said that, as witnessed by the use of software in the Social Sciences and through my experience, I can"}
{"file_id": "1031347.txt", "output_essay": "In my opinion, for a student, it's far more important to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts. In the process of teaching, there are two components to establish: the fact of learning itself and the interpretation the student may give to it.\n\nAt first, a student has to learn the basics of a subject. The teacher's job is to provide as much information as he can. This information has to be general. A teacher is not an amateur (as he has already learned the subject before), so he has his own point of view. The teacher is just here to provide general information and in no case should he influence the students' minds. So, learning facts is too focused on theory and not on practice.\n\nThen, once the student knows the basics, the general facts, he has to go beyond the given information by himself, in order to understand all the specifics of the subject. I think that understanding ideas and concepts is something personal. It is something made by oneself. Nobody would ever have the same interpretation of ideas. It depends on the experiences of the student and his possible story or link to a subject.\n\nFor example, in a theoretical course of law, the teacher can teach students the evolution of something in particular, like the stance of society on homosexual marriages. But I think it is far more important for the students to understand how this stance has emerged and to learn all the discourse of both the people for or against it. Thus, the student can form his own opinion, even if it is not the same as the majority of the population."}

Nowadays, advertisements are also seen in cinemas. But I personally feel these advertisements often exaggerate. Advertisements usually don't mention hidden costs, don't mention the efficiency of the product, and hence deceive people.\n\nFirst, the advertisements projected nowadays do not mention the hidden details they have for a particular product. For example, in the MasterCard advertisement, the advertisement mainly portrays advantages like a lower interest rate, surprise gifts. But they do not provide detailed information about the product. My friend received a bill for $500 just because he crossed the due date, which was not mentioned to him when he bought the card. Moreover, for the gifts they give to customers, they actually demand money from the customers. Another example of such hidden costs is in the mobile phone industry; last month, I got a call from my service provider, and they launched a new offer which they mentioned was free of cost. But when I activated and started using this facility, my bill started to shoot up. The service provider did not mention the usage cost.\n\nSecond, the advertisements do not mention the efficiency of the product. For example, I started using a calculator from a local market. But the calculator did not work for more than two days. It did not respond to several buttons. The advertisement which I referred to did not mention the life of the calculator. Another example is when I bought a BlackBerry; the advertisement said, \"Free Bluetooth Headsets for every BlackBerry.\" But it failed to work after one month.\n\nFinally, advertisements primarily deceive people. They project the product in a bigger size on televisions, but actually, they seem to look so small. Moreover, they mention that the entire product is free, and once we go and buy, they would say that the scheme is under exchange. Several such ways are followed by companies to fool the public.\n\nFor the above-mentioned reasons, advertisements are depicting an entirely wrong picture of the products and tend to exaggerate the product. I personally believe that companies must project correct facts about products."}

I prefer to travel in a group led by a guide because it really has a number of benefits that we cannot deny.\n\nThe first reason for my inclination is that traveling in a group led by a tour guide can give me a more profound knowledge of my travels. No one could detail the history of a new spot only by your touring guidebook. No one could point out where a more valuable spot is located only by your telephone. No one could know more sceneries by only confining yourself to the maps. However, the tour guide can!\n\nThe second reason for my propensity is that traveling in a group led by a tour guide can connect you to different kinds of people. I just took part in a travel group led by a tour guide, and I made friends who were involved in it and what's more, until now I still keep in touch with one of them who is also a university student like me. And she is in the same major as me, so it is lucky for me to have this kind of tour and get such a good friend who has the same personal experience and emotional concern as me!\n\nLast but not least, traveling in a group led by a tour guide can make you safer and happier. If you visit by yourself, who will help you when you get hurt? If you visit by yourself, who will help you to continue your tour when you lose your way? If you visit by yourself, who will talk with you when you feel faint during your bus ride? Nobody. And this is quite different from traveling in a group where you can ask your tour guide and talk with other travelers.\n\nAll in all, traveling in a group led by a tour guide is an advisable choice with conspicuous benefits. I prefer it fully. Now, what I want to do is to make sure that everyone around me who likes traveling as much as me can reap all these benefits."}
{"file_id": "1029018.txt", "output_essay": "I completely agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. Our modern world is full of such examples where people took risks and created new things. To a large extent, our modern age is made by these people. I will classify these activities into mainly two categories.\n\nFirst, where people just change the way in which we do things. For example, take the music industry. A few years back, the music industry was dominated by Sony's Walkman. If you wanted to listen to music, then you needed to buy a Walkman and cassettes. Sony thought that this was the best way, but Steve Jobs from Apple had different ideas. He created the iPod, where you can download your music onto flash memory. This was more efficient, and one could download a large amount of music that was not possible with Walkmans. This made Steve Jobs famous, but Sony lost the market because Sony executives were just making more efficient Walkmans. They never tried to do a new thing.\n\nSecond, where people leapfrog the current way of doing things and create a totally different solution to the problem. For example, take the postal services. Earlier, if you wanted to send a letter to your loved ones, then you had to write it on paper and send it by mail. It used to take time and the process was inefficient. A few people thought about the electronic transmission of information, and the internet was born. Now, sending a letter to someone is a click away by email. Email is much more efficient and much faster.\n\nSome people will not agree with the statement, and they will say that trying new things is risky, so we should not try new things. I would like to tell them that if our ancestors had thought in the same way, then we would have been living in the Stone Age today. I agree that once you try new things, you might fail, but learning lessons from failures and trying again makes someone successful."}

It's not an illusion, and even today, there are the first cars that use other substances, such as propane or other gases, on the market.\n\nI think that when twenty years have passed, these technologies will be sufficiently developed to allow cars to operate without the need for petroleum. This doesn't mean that they won't harm our environment, which might be really harmed by then, but I don't really think anyone is going to change anything to prevent or solve the environmental problem, as long as no one has until today.\n\nPeople might stop using their own cars when the Earth becomes so overheated that living on it becomes impossible, or at least very uncomfortable, but I don't think that is going to happen within the next twenty years, and the car commerce is so powerful that nobody is going to take care of preventing the use of cars before the heat becomes unbearable.\n\nAs I think this won't happen, and cars have shown to be a very popular product to sell, I mean, cars are very well positioned and adapted to cities and citizens' lifestyles all over the world, it's very probable that car sales will continue as they have been until now. Therefore, the new cars should be added to the old to finally detect a significant increase in the total number of them.\n\nNot only this, but if we look at the rest of the world, and not only at developed countries, we will find that some large countries are developing nowadays, like China or India, and they are potential car consumers in the very near future, which, of course, includes the next twenty years."}

We have been using them for more than 50 years, but it's hard to tell what their approximate numbers will be in a twenty-year time period, as this subject requires extensive analysis. However, some predictions comparing their advantages and disadvantages can be made.\n\nThe number of cars in use can increase or stay nearly the same in twenty years. First of all, they are not new technologies, so they have become crucial elements of our lives. For instance, we have built large roads, bridges, and traffic rules to use them effectively, and even some of us regard our cars as friends. What is more, although they pollute the environment, it couldn't prevent people from using them. Secondly, they still provide easy access to everywhere compared to planes or trains. For instance, we will still be using our cars to go short distances. In addition, there could be new materials in twenty years' time, which will be alternatives to petrol and which will enhance car usage.\n\nOn the other hand, it's also possible to say that the number of cars in use will lessen in the following years. New transport opportunities can be mentioned to support this argument. For instance, more accessible and more efficient vehicles can be preferred in the future. Moreover, cars use petrol, which is a natural resource that will be depleted soon and for which people have been killed for years. So, it's logical to think that people are already fed up with the problems that petrol causes. Not only its political and social problems, but also the economic aspect, due to the fact that petrol prices have been increasing and have become very expensive.\n\nIn conclusion, it's possible for cars to remain popular in the following years as they are now. But in my opinion, the drawbacks of these little vehicles are so many that people will find new options in twenty years. Besides, none of us wants to face wars or high prices anymore."}

On the one hand, there are some people who spend most of their time thinking about how they can help their community. On the other hand, there are some who really don't care about helping their society. They just think about their own problems and don't have enough time for other people. However, in the final analysis, I agree with the statement that people do not give enough time to help their society.\n\nOne reason for my belief is that in the current business world, people don't have time to help their communities. The demands of the business world require a lot of time, and at the end of the day, people are very tired.\n\nFor example, five years ago, I worked for an advertising company. Advertising is very demanding work, and at that time in my life, I usually spent more than 12 hours in my office. When I returned home at 9 o'clock, I was really tired. It was impossible for me to help my community. The only thing I wanted to do was to go and rest. It was impossible for me to try to help society; I was always tired when I wasn't at work.\n\nAnother reason for my belief is that people have become more selfish. People just focus on what is important to them. They do not care about what happens to other people; they just think about their own problems. Recent research shows that less than 15% of the people from my hometown have helped the community in the last two years.\n\nFor the reasons stated above, I agree with the statement that nowadays people do not give enough time to helping their communities.

Although my family paid a great deal of money, we enjoyed the trip since it was convenient and helpful for increasing our knowledge. Like in my case, people should realize that the best way to travel is in groups led by a tour guide.\n\nFirst of all, since the tour guide provides enough knowledge and information to people, it is the best way to travel in a group led by a tour guide. There are two purposes of travel. One is to have a rest, and the other is to gain information about the countries or places that people visit. When people travel to acquire knowledge, they need a professional guide, as it is hard to get information about certain places on their own. In contrast, when people travel without a tour guide, they will sightsee without gaining information, which will not be beneficial for increasing their knowledge.\n\nThe safety provided by the tour guide also makes guided tours more attractive. Foreign countries or places that people have not visited can be dangerous because they are unaware of factors that can be harmful. Therefore, people who travel alone sometimes encounter troubles. For example, I heard news that a traveler who visited foreign countries alone was kidnapped. Thus, to decrease the risk of travel, people should travel in groups led by a tour guide who has been guiding people for a long time and has extensive knowledge about the dangerous factors, so the tour guide can ensure the travelers' safety.\n\nFinally, travelers do not need to worry about their travel plans if they travel in groups led by a tour guide. When people plan to travel alone, they have to consider various factors. They have to arrange hotels where they will stay and purchase airplane tickets. Also, they have to plan their schedule and choose where to visit. However, people who travel in a group with a tour guide do not need to worry about these factors because tour guide companies plan everything. What the travelers have to do is just pay money.\n\nTo sum up, the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide because people can gain knowledge effectively and travel safely.

I agree with this assertion and consider pollution the main cause. In our days, there is more pollution than in the past, which is caused by industrialization. For this reason, the ozone hole grows larger day by day, along with the harmful ultraviolet light that is detrimental to our health. To resolve this issue, we must reduce air pollution, and cars, along with other means of transport, such as trains, are the main contributors. If we want clean air, we must use alternative means of travel that respect the environment, such as bicycles. Another way to reduce pollution is to decrease the use of trains and especially cars, which can be used by fewer people than trains and for this reason are less efficient than other means and more numerous. For these reasons, I think that this great number of cars must be reduced if we want to solve the problem of pollution. In many cities, cars can only be used on a few days of the week; this is an important measure that leads me to believe that in the future, I will only be able to use trains or other means, such as trains, that can transport more than one person at a time. Only in this way will we be able to have clean air, a clean environment, a clean sea, and not only that, we will be healthier and especially less ill because many diseases are caused by pollution from cars, trains, and so on."}

Strength in this specific case is associated with youth. Indeed, when you are 80 years old, chances are you will not have the strength anymore to hold yourself up on a horse. I believe that the sheer capacity of doing something can make one happy, just as the incapacity of doing something can make one unhappy.

On the other hand, when I am older, I will be able to contemplate all the things I will have done physically and experienced over my lifetime. In my opinion, that is something only older people can do. Which, in my opinion, is a good thing, because it shows that nature is well made. Younger people have different ways to enjoy life, in what they are able to do, for example. And then there are other ways they are not able to enjoy their life, because they are young. The same goes for older people. They have their way of enjoying life, like for instance contemplating their experiences over a lifetime. Why?

A student who conducts and manages a software development team may have a deeper understanding of the area of software design and human resource management than one who only learns from books. For example, a designer may have a more detailed and deepened comprehension of the internal core thinking, which is the most valuable part of his job, after he finishes a design by researching and reviewing a lot of books and articles including concepts proposed before.\n\nIn addition, it makes more sense for a student to learn the facts brought by his or her own hands-on experiment. When I was a member of the web development team for our university website, I learned a lot from the practice of installing and configuring the web server and writing code for a web application, which is not fully stated in any book in the bookstore. This makes my way broader and easier to achieve expertise in the field of computer science.\n\nLastly, learning facts is a higher level than just understanding the original ideas and concepts. The students who know how to put the principles into daily work may show a stronger ability to master not only what to learn but also how to learn; that is to say, they are more likely to become quick learners, an ability which is called for by many international business companies such as Microsoft, Google, and IBM.\n\nFrom all the discussion I mentioned above, we could safely draw the conclusion that learning facts takes a more significant position than just understanding the ideas and concepts in the learning process."}

As an example of this, there are many young people who live in deep depression, sometimes clinical, sometimes not, that clearly do not enjoy life.\n\nIt is clear that the example given in the paragraph above can be reversed. But that brings me precisely to my second point. For me, it is not accurate nor completely correct to make generalizations about such a subjective thing as people enjoying life more than other people.\n\nHow do we compare the enjoyment of one group versus the enjoyment of another? And what is the meaning of 'enjoying life'? All of this makes me more suspicious about the given statement.\n\nNow, my third objection is foreshadowed in the last paragraph. What do we mean by the phrase 'enjoying life'? It is obvious that although there may be a certain consensus among some people about the meaning of that phrase, enjoying life does not mean the same for everyone. Less probable is that it will mean the same thing for older and younger people. So, it may be possible that older and younger people enjoy life the same but within their own definitions of what enjoying life is."}

I do not agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. In fact, I believe that young people nowadays spend more time helping their communities than young people did before.\n\nDoing volunteer work is one way for young people to help out their communities. Although young people before also did community service, now the urge and the need to do community service have increased. There are many factors that have caused young people to do volunteer work.\n\nFirst of all, nowadays, young people have more opportunities to do community services. In schools, teachers encourage students to sign up for community services such as Flag Day or teaching English at a local school.\n\nNowadays, it can probably be said that doing community service is not optional but is now becoming compulsory. Before, students were not required to do community service, but nowadays, it is compulsory for students to do volunteer work to participate in various activities. For example, HKAYP is a program where students work on their outdoor experience. In order for students to join the HKAYP program, they have to do a specific amount of service hours to enter different levels (bronze, silver, and gold) and receive certificates after they complete each level.\n\nAlso, the importance of community service is recognized. All students want to be accepted by good universities. It is now known to students that doing volunteer work can give universities a good impression of them, as the volunteer work they have done can be reflected on their university application. So, for example, now, young people in Hong Kong spend a lot of time doing volunteer work during their spare time (especially on holidays) since they receive a certificate provided by the government when they fill up a certain amount of service hours.\n\nOverall, I disapprove of the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to help out their community. I believe that young people nowadays, as a matter of fact, help out more due to the fact that they are more exposed to community services (schools encourage students by introducing community services), some activities require students to do volunteer work in order to join, and that students can include their services on their university application."}

The main reasons are as follows.\n\nOne reason that students should put a higher priority on ideas or concepts than on facts is that ideas and concepts can help people to explain things logically. To be more specific, students can classify, confirm, and assure things with fixed ideas. For example, my brother always tells me the reason why things go on as they do because he studied a lot of ideas and concepts at his university. However, I did not study ideas. So my knowledge is just from experience or facts. To be honest, it is quite difficult for me to explain something to other people because I do not understand the real ideas or concepts. Many people have told me that they do not understand my explanation at all. That is why I think learning ideas is the most important.\n\nThe other reason that students can benefit more from ideas than facts is that students have more time to study ideas than adults do. That is to say, even if adults want to study ideas, it takes a long time to learn the concepts of things. For example, as I mentioned above, my brother studied ideas and concepts at his university. I actually envy him because he can explain things better than I can. So I decided to learn concepts by myself. However, since I am working for a company six days a week, I did not have enough time to learn ideas thoroughly. Hence, I regret not studying ideas at my university.\n\nIn conclusion, I agree with the idea that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts, for the above reasons. When I have children, I will encourage them to learn ideas and concepts at their universities in order not to have trouble explaining things to people."}
{"file_id": "1024274.txt", "output_essay": "In my opinion, in order to have a better understanding of ideas, concepts must be supported by facts.\n\nFirst of all, it is impossible to understand an idea without a complete evaluation of the facts that are the base structure of the concept. If you understand an idea without knowing the facts behind it, then you are only learning a 'dogma'. An example of dogmatic understanding is the religious one that ignores facts, because it is not looking for a deep understanding of things but only for a solution that will bring its answer.\n\nThis is why in religious learning, facts are generally avoided: they do prefer interpretations.\n\nSecond of all, to understand something, you need to start by learning the facts in order to begin a critical analysis. The only way to start this process of understanding is by starting from the knowledge of facts.\n\nIn order to understand an idea, you must know what the historical situation was in which this idea was created. I'll make an example to make my opinion clearer: you can't understand the basic ideas of communism or Nazism without knowing the historical situation and dynamics that led to these different political, social, and economic totalitarisms.\n\nLastly, I would say that you don't really understand anything if you can't prove it and explain it with facts. It is with an empirical analysis of facts that you can prove what you have understood and why you believe so. Every scientist needs an experiment to clarify his point; otherwise, he will seem not credible, and his idea not effective.\n\nThese are the three reasons why I believe that there is a strong link and connection between understanding an idea and learning the facts related to the concept."}
{"file_id": "1032028.txt", "output_essay": "Humanity has never found out the answer to this question: 'Is it more important to see the ideas and concepts or to learn facts for new brains?' Both of these two poles have their proper advantages, but is one of them more essential than the other? For students, which one is more efficient?\n\nIdeas are always needed and, as a result, they are important because they are the starting points of all developments, of all achievements. Students have to understand these ideas and concepts because they have a great thirst for knowledge, which is led by these abstract forms. More precisely, a student must grasp the meaning of the ideas and concepts to move forward, to have new visions, to develop his creativity. Thus, understanding ideas and concepts is really important for students, who are the future of this world.\n\nOn the other hand, students cannot do without facts because these show the results of ideas; they clarify reality for us. Students cannot continue just by using ideas and concepts; without knowing facts, they won't be able to incorporate their abstract views. Moreover, facts are the light of the past, of the present, and with them, of the future because, as in history, we cannot go on without knowledge of the realities in this world, and for students' education, reality is conveyed by facts. Also, students will encounter facts to test their ideas and concepts; if not, they can't know if they are correct or not.\n\nIn conclusion, with these advantages shown, it's impossible to say whether learning facts or understanding ideas and concepts is more important for students. In my opinion, we don't have to compare these two sides because they always go together, complementing each other, and both are essential for students."}

{"file_id": "1013913.txt", "output_essay": "Nowadays, there are evolving discussions pertaining to whether young people give enough time to help their communities. In this connection, and based upon my experience as an undergraduate and graduate student at The American University in Cairo (AUC), I would state that it is my belief that young people are actually devoting enough time to develop and make life better in their small and large communities.\n\nFirst, I would like to provide express examples of how AUCians have invested efforts to support their small living community, that is, AUC. It is worth noting that prior to the start of the new academic year, AUCians usually gather in organized groups to orient the new freshmen. There are groups that cover a wide spectrum of services, including orientation to the AUC campus, encompassing classes, labs, library, and departments. Also, these groups introduce the new students to the university catalogue and related matters such as advising, course registration, and requirements for joining any specific major. Moreover, the same groups make the new students familiar with the various extracurricular activities available on campus. Another aspect of the devotion of young AUCians to their small community is that they join certain groups that target alumni and other sponsors in order to provide adequate funding for many of the activities arranged at AUC. In this way, it is evident how the young AUCians prove to be effective in serving their small community.\n\nOn the other hand, as far as AUCians' services for their larger community are concerned, it is essential to highlight the role of the different clubs at AUC. AUC hosts many clubs that are fully operated by young students and aim at making life better in Egypt. These clubs include, inter alia, the Help Club, Cancer Club, and Hand in Hand Club. The Help Club aims at providing poor people in Egypt with better living conditions. This is attained by gathering donations from AUC's young students and using them to buy food, clothes, homes, and shelter for the poor. Furthermore, the Cancer Club concentrates its efforts on collecting donations to support cancer patients in their tough struggle with this severe disease. Along the same line, the Hand in Hand Club aims at visiting elderly people who are hosted in various elder houses. During these visits, members of the Hand in Hand Club tend to provide the elders with their needs and try to draw a smile on their faces as a simple reciprocation for the sincere efforts in their youth. Accordingly, it goes beyond doubt that the young students at AUC play a vital role in serving their larger community.\n\nIn light of the above, and based on life examples of the young students at AUC, it can be concluded that young students feel their belonging to their societies. Thus, they have enthusiasm and dedication to help and serve their communities."}
{"file_id": "1033201.txt", "output_essay": "Haven't you ever wondered why the laundry we see on TV is always perfectly clean after washing, but we still find some stains when we wash at home? This essay will discuss the issue that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.\n\nFirstly, the product is always shown in a perfect light when we see it in an advertisement. Obviously, the producing firm does not want to show the product under worse circumstances. They want to sell the product in order to gain profits. Therefore, it seems reasonable to me to show it in a rather perfect light. For instance, if someone drives a car in an advertisement, he drives the car through a picturesque landscape. But we often face noisy traffic jams in dirty cities. Obviously, the actor in the ad seems to have more fun driving the car. Furthermore, the ads are often supported by music to stimulate the consumer's desire to obtain the product. The sound of beautiful music also suggests that the product looks better than it does in the noisy real life. Moreover, the actors in the advertisements are always happy, and they really know how to use the product. Sometimes we experience some difficulties using a product simply because we do not know how to use it properly. Imagine a new cellphone. There are so many functions; we simply do not know how to handle it with all its possible features.\n\nTo conclude, I agree that the products seem better than they really are because in our daily life we are not using them under the perfect circumstances. But as far as I am concerned, this is no problem as long as the basic statement of an advertisement is true and if we are aware of the fact that our daily life differs from the one we see on TV."}
{"file_id": "1035799.txt", "output_essay": "Some people say that students have to learn facts rather than understand ideas and concepts. They insist that learning facts can lead to more developed technology. However, I agree that it is important for students to understand concepts. First, understanding concepts can entail facts. Second, when students enter the university, they can apply their knowledge to other fields. I will explain in detail.\n\nMore than anything else, understanding ideas can provide a chance to obtain facts more effectively. Usually, many people think that the relationship between understanding concepts and learning facts is separate. However, coherent understanding of ideas can result in learning facts. Let me take a friend of mine as an example. When he was at university, he made an effort to study an exclusive idea. From this exclusive idea, he could derive conclusions such as mathematical formulas. He always told me that it was easy for people to memorize facts; however, the facts weren't memorable for a long time. If you understand concepts, you can remember them for a long time. It shows that boys and girls can understand concepts.\n\nIn addition, if they enter the university, they can apply their knowledge to other fields. When some students enter the university, they have trouble with their major. This is because they learned facts. As time goes by, students can't recall things that they were educated on in high school. However, other people get a chance to expand into other fields. Moreover, they can apply their knowledge to their major."}
{"file_id": "1030800.txt", "output_essay": "I believe that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. There are two reasons as follows. First of all, most people would agree that the products in the advertisement are presented under the best circumstances since the purpose of advertising is to sell the products. For example, clothing manufacturers and designers put their clothes on good-looking models, which makes the clothes more attractive. Another example can be food advertisements. Food is presented in the best dishes with picture-perfect lighting and everything. I remember that I had to return some of the products I bought because they were different from what I had seen in the ads.\n\nSecondly, advertising is one of the most powerful ways for producers to communicate and convince people that their products are beneficial to customers. Therefore, people tend to emphasize the strengths of the products rather than showing their shortcomings unless they are legally required to do so. For example, when we listen to a TV or radio commercial for cosmetic items, we feel like those items can be the solution to all of our skin problems. The ad does not say how time-consuming or expensive the products can be. That is, I think, one of the reasons that certain products such as cigarettes or sleeping pills are required to state the possible side effects. Unless the law requires it, companies would not want to show their shortcomings.\n\nAs I stated above, advertisements are used to promote sales and communicate with customers and viewers in favor of the products. Consequently, I am truly convinced that products are better projected in advertisements than they are in reality in most cases."}

The first one is that there will definitely be fewer cars in use than today because there might not be enough oil to provide fuel for the millions of cars. But one has to consider that the consequence is that not only cars are affected. One could easily say that a car is not that important, but if there is no fuel left for the cars, there is neither any for the bus, for a taxi, for the lawnmower, nor for airplanes. Nobody will go anywhere. I personally could take my bike and go to the grocery store, but what for? There will be no possibility to do my groceries because the shelves will be empty. If there is no fuel for cars, then there is no fuel for trucks that take the groceries to the supermarket. And this is only the tip of the iceberg. There will be no production, no traffic, and even today's high-tech might break down.\n\nI do not want to paint this vision of the future too bleakly. There is another possibility. Since we know that the whole traffic system, and one could even say the world, is too dependent on fossil resources such as oil, we could change that. There are so many sophisticated scientists who work on solutions for how to gain energy. And they have results, like wind and sun as renewable energy resources. We could already reduce the need for oil if, for example, we buy our vegetables from a farmer in our town. Then fewer trucks would be needed. Whatever we do, we need to start changing our energy-wasting habits now. Then in twenty years, there might be as many cars as today, but they will run on non-fossil energy. But I do definitely think that there will be fewer cars that run on fuel in twenty years."}
{"file_id": "1020691.txt", "output_essay": "The issue of specialization is difficult to deal with since plenty of different views have been expressed on this subject. On the one hand, one can be tempted to think that a great variety of knowledge allows someone to enlarge his view of certain matters. However, we cannot deny that deeper knowledge in a specific subject can sometimes be required to solve some technical problems. Taking all aspects into account, I am strongly convinced that specialization does have more advantages than broad knowledge.\n\nTo begin with, specialization surely allows for better efficiency in problem-solving. Who would ask a mathematician to read Molière while he can ask an actor? As far as I am concerned, I am firmly convinced that each of us has one or several special skills that make him different from the others: one plays the piano, his brother cooks well, and I see no reason why the pianist should learn to cook! On the contrary, he should continue learning piano to improve this particular skill.\n\nAnother way to justify my point of view is to consider it under the professional aspect. In relationship marketing, one makes the difference between the 'waiting time', which is the time the client waits before their problem is taken into account by a firm, and the 'solving time', which is the time needed to solve this particular problem. By choosing specialists, the firm considerably reduces its 'solving time'. Furthermore, the more different these specialists are, the shorter the 'waiting time' will become, since a great variety of problems will be thus quickly taken into account.\n\nLastly, specialization may require from a firm to have a good internal organization. Indeed, without such an efficient organization, the special skills of each employee may not be used as well as they should be. However, if a firm does establish such an organization and does prefer hiring specialized workers, its efficiency will surely improve.\n\nTo conclude, my strong belief is that specialization is a key answer to some persistent economic and political problems. A major stake will thus be to accept the fact that one could not do everything perfectly. After all, Billy Wilder was probably right when he wrote that 'Nobody is perfect'!"}

First, I think that travel must be free. If I have an opportunity to plan my trip, the place I want to go isn't the same as my friend or the whole group members. Joining a group and being led by a tour guide makes it impossible to go to the place where I want to go. A tour is a thing that goes only to the place someone selected before starting.\n\nSecond, I think that travel should be flexible. You may want to visit many places, like the place you see from a train window, or you find a place that isn't printed in your guidebook. To change the route from what you thought before your trip is one of the pleasures of travel.\n\nIn the end, I think travel gives a chance to meet new friends. I don't need group members because I can find new friends who have the same opportunity as me. If I have a question, there is someone who has a lot of knowledge about the area.\n\nSo, I think the best way to travel is to go alone."}

And that's the fun part of your younger age. When you are young, you normally don't know that much about life, so you have to explore it. Normally with no or much less money than you will earn when you're getting older.\n\nAnd that means that you can concentrate more on the real things you are interested in in life. As an example: When you are young and you want to go on vacation, you're looking for a cheap way of doing it... Maybe a very cheap flight to Mallorca, Spain, a youth hostel for 10 bucks per day. No breakfast, because you still have enough alcohol in your stomach from the night before...\n\nI am 30 now. And this kind of vacation would be way too hard for me now. But when I think back... 5-10 years ago, I would have loved it.\n\nNow, I would rather fly somewhere very nice, with a nice hotel, maybe a rental car. Some sightseeing.

{"file_id": "1024659.txt", "output_essay": "I do not agree with the statement here which says that advertisements make the products seem much better than they actually are. I really feel this because a product owner knows how the product is made and how it works, so all the other matters he will be thinking about are the quality of the product and how it will reach people in the correct way and thought. To make this possible, the only thing he has in his hand is how to advertise it. So, he finds a better way to advertise the product so that it reaches the people and they come to know how worthy it is. Without advertising nowadays, it takes a long time for a product to get settled in the market and make its own stamp on that field to go into people's minds. \n\nThe advertising may not be thought of as a thing that makes people totally believe it, but in the advertisement and also on the product, the producer clearly says what it does and how it does it, so based on requirements only the consumer buys the product, not the way it is advertised. Here we have to be careful about how it is advertised; to make an advertisement, only the product must pass many tests before the product is introduced to the market, so by certifying only the product is released to the market. So, based on the requirements fulfilled by the product only, the advertisements are done. Not all producers follow the same method, but based on how much the product costs, the advertisements are done. The advertisements are done according to the taste of the owner, that is, how it could be advertised. Some use media as the advertising agent, some use marketers, some use paper pamphlets; there are many ways to advertise. Based on their taste and their capacity, producers advertise their product. \n\nThe ways that the advertisements are very interesting in such a way that, by seeing them, people would get the thought of buying them. Some producers, to get hold of the market and sales, would use celebrities, well-known persons as their suit for advertisement by paying them a large amount of money. As advertisement is the only chance of making people know, it's a very important one. For example, now governments are also depending on advertisement to make people know about things; projects are done. Here in my state, a celebrity is the one for advertising about the polio programme done by the government. So that people will know about it very quickly and correctly. So, governments also rely on advertising, which shows us how important the advertisements are. \n\nTo make the conclusion of the thing that advertisement is the best instrument and as fake advertisements are not done, they make the product seem to be as it is, but they do not make them feel better than they really are."}

If in past centuries technological progress was often linked to negative consequences like deep industrialization and exploitation of natural resources, in more recent years the idea of technological progress that can coexist with nature or even help it has spread both in the scientific community and public opinion.\n\nThat is why modern scientists are looking for a kind of car that does not pollute the air, working on a project about a car engine that does not use petrol but something alternative.\n\nThis alternative power could be hydrogen, and rumors have it that scientists have already invented it, but it cannot be sold because of market reasons. Moreover, public transportation is becoming more and more affordable, so that in the future, most people will use it.\n\nPeople in the future will be much more interested in environmental problems, just like we are more respectful towards nature than our ancestors. It is said, in fact, that in the past cities were noisier and more polluted than they are today, and some ancient authors wrote that when Rome was the capital of the Roman Empire, it was almost impossible to fall asleep in the city even at night, and that the noise was unbearable.\n\nGovernments, especially in the Western world, have started to recognize the problems connected to the uncontrolled use of cars, and they will probably enact policies to make people prefer non-polluting engines or other kinds of transport.\n\nAlso, since they have learned the lesson from their own past, Western governments will teach the countries that are now industrializing new ways to produce and get richer without deeply exploiting the land, which may cause natural disasters like those that have happened in recent years in some areas of the world."}

But at the same time, it is also important to learn facts because with the knowledge of the process of the facts, people can replicate what was right in the past and avoid what was dangerous or wrong.\n\nFor example, I think that the concept of peace can be better understood if you know history. In fact, with that knowledge, you understand that war brings people only poverty, difficulties, and nothing good. I think that it is easier to understand concepts if you have a real environment in some facts.\n\nThe ideas and concepts, along with the study and learning of facts, give us a strong base for our education and it is important for a good future improvement.

By traveling with an experienced person, you learn from that person's knowledge of the place, and you are able to develop a deep and intelligent opinion about what you see and experience while traveling.\n\nTwo years ago, I visited New York with my family, and I was surprised by the great difference between traveling on your own or with a tour guide. While we were traveling on our own around the city, we realized that we were only wandering in the streets, looking at the tall buildings, but not learning anything interesting about the city; besides, without appropriate knowledge of the city, we had a lot of problems trying to find our hotel after we walked some streets.\nThe next day, we decided to pay for a tour guide in order to learn more about the city and its most important touristic spots. With the help of the tour guide, we were able to know more about the city's stories, important places, good restaurants, and many other useful facts that we would have ignored if we had continued our self-guided and ignorant traveling. Traveling with a group led by a tour guide surely has more benefits than just avoiding getting lost in the streets: you learn more about the facts, the secrets, and the essence of the place you visit.\n\nAnother example I can mention to reinforce my opinion about tour guides is the trip I made with my family to China last year. As I said before, with the help of a tour guide, you can develop a deep and intelligent opinion about the place you visit. When we arrived in this Asian country, I had the idea that we were going to find poor people living under a communist regime; after we traveled some time by ourselves, my opinion about this communist country didn't change. However, when we took our tour around Beijing, the guide began to explain the current situation of the country from the Chinese perspective. I was surprised by the significant knowledge I acquired about the Chinese culture after hearing the tour guide's opinion of her country and the information she had regarding the situation of Communist China. After learning from this new perspective, which I may not have noticed without a tour guide, I was able to change my point of view about China, and to develop a more critical and intellectual opinion about the Chinese culture and current economic, political, and social situation.\n\nAfter traveling in New York and China in a group led by a tour guide, I reaffirmed my opinion about this kind of trip. I hold my position of complete acceptance for guided traveling. If we had not had the help of a tour guide, my family and I would never have been able to visit New York as a true New Yorker or to learn from the Chinese culture from a reliable and original source, an authentic Chinese tour guide."}
{"file_id": "1024264.txt", "output_essay": "Understanding ideas and concepts is very important for students because it helps them remember processes easily, for example. In the subject of biology, it is very hard to learn facts without knowing what the facts are necessary for in a biological system or process. In history class, it is also important to know the dates of events. But if you understand the ideas and the development of an event, you can more easily put the event in chronological order.\n\nLearning facts is very important for students who are learning a language, for example. They have to learn vocabulary to improve their new language. Law students have to learn facts, too, and they cannot omit that. Students who study medicine also have to learn a lot of vocabulary for anatomy.\n\nLearning facts about a theme takes a lot of time and is not really helpful in your later work for an enterprise. Understanding ideas and concepts is more useful. It is easier to learn and understand than to memorize facts. Facts are just fictional, and you often do not know how to use them properly in an important situation.\n\nFor example, if there is a machine that does not work anymore, it is very difficult to check every single fact of the machine. It is easier to think about the whole concept of the machine: How does it work, and what does it produce? In this way, it is easier to find the problem with the defective machine.\n\nSo, I think students who want to take a job in an enterprise that is in the trade business or in businesses with processes need to know more about ideas and concepts. It is very important to know about the whole workflow of a process rather than to know facts you can easily look up in a book. Understanding ideas and concepts supports the ability to think about a problem. And the skill of being able to find a solution for a problem is a skill that makes you desirable to many employers.\n\nIn my opinion, it is justifiable to declare that understanding ideas and concepts is the most important skill for business. And that is what students should learn at their university."}

Young people are healthier than older people and more adaptable in acquiring new information. Thus, they have more opportunities to secure jobs and earn money. Imagine having to work and earn money when you are very old. It is very challenging for older people. I know two individuals who exemplify this topic well. One man worked very hard and saved money while he was young. Years later, he married, bought a beautiful house, and could afford to educate his children. However, another man did not save money and did not work hard. He enjoyed his youth, drinking beer with friends, buying expensive clothes, and purchasing costly gifts for his girlfriend. Years later, even though he married, he still lived in a rented house. Of course, we can enjoy life while we are young. I am not saying that enjoying life in youth is bad. New experiences and traveling are important for young people. However, we need to focus on self-improvement during our youth. There is a fable about two types of insects. The ant worked very hard during the summer, so he could enjoy his life and rest during the cold winter. In contrast, another insect just enjoyed himself and sang songs in the tree all summer. Consequently, he could not eat anything during the cold winter. Think about it. Isn't it easier for young people to study and earn money?

But usually, they do not have much time to realize that since they are busy with school or a job. Older people, when they are already retired, have a lot of time to do all those things they have not had time for yet, for example, reading literature or even beginning to study, as an old teacher of mine who started studying philosophy after he left school.\n\nBecause of their many experiences, it is also easier for old people to deal with problems, while young people are often discouraged and feel insecure about the future. Old people have already lived through many things; they do not have to worry about finding a job or a partner anymore.\n\nWhile young people often have problems with their families, old people already have their own and can spend nice times with them.

It is much more dangerous for old people to walk outside if it is cold; they might get pneumonia, while young people remain healthy and could slip on the ice and break a leg, whereas their grandchildren are able to fall without hurting themselves.\n\nIn addition, it is very sad to be old when one's friends, or one's partner, become older too, and die one by one. My grandfather became 93 years old and had not had friends for the last ten years of his life, which seems incredible to me.\n\nFinally, a young person still has all his life before him; an old one expects death to come soon. Both can be positive or negative; it depends on the specific person's situation.\n\nOn the whole, I think it is possible to enjoy one's life at any age; it just matters what one makes out of it."}
{"file_id": "1041350.txt", "output_essay": "I think that for a student, understanding ideas, concepts, and learning facts are very important. However, I don't agree that ideas and concepts are more important than learning facts. The following reasons support my viewpoint: first of all, it is useless if we understand a lot of concepts and ideas but don't use them to learn facts. I want to say that learning concepts is very important, especially if we are able to use those concepts to do useful things. Therefore, learning new concepts is very important, but we must also learn from facts to see how those concepts are used.\n\nFor example, I am a university student and every day, during the lessons, I learn a lot of concepts. But I study at a technical university; therefore, for me, it is very important to gain a lot of experience to improve my preparation in a particular subject. Furthermore, it's very important to learn facts because they can always come in useful in the future. The second reason that pushes me to think this way is that if we only understand ideas and concepts, we will not fully understand how those concepts work. I want to say that there are a lot of things that we can learn only from facts and experience. I think that a student has good preparation in a particular subject if they learn both concepts and experience. In fact, in a lot of companies, if a person wants to gain advancement, they must have a lot of experience and a lot of knowledge."}
{"file_id": "1037397.txt", "output_essay": "I think it is essential for a student to understand ideas and concepts rather than merely learning facts. These days, technology has developed, and new things are being invented. This is primarily due to logical thinking about something. The invention of the telephone did not require Alexander Graham Bell to refer to the facts. Instead, he thought about it logically and implemented physical experiments using concepts. When we look at many early scientists, they did not focus much on the facts; rather, they understood the ideas about how to implement them.\n\nTherefore, it is better for a student to study different concepts and implement his or her ideas. Let us consider another example. If students think only about the facts, they concern themselves with only a few things, such as oil, petrol, kerosene, and white petrol being the combustion fuels, and that automobiles cannot run without petrol or diesel. If that were the case, Sastry, who was a student, would not have discovered an alternative fuel for automobiles. He extracted a solution by using a plant's leaf, mixed it with some chemicals, and finally used it as fuel for automobiles. This mainly depends on a thorough understanding of the concept and a hard effort to implement his ideas. This idea could be greatly beneficial for society.\n\nAnd coming to the secondary aspect of the topic, which deals with learning facts, it is useful to some extent for students. This is because when we deal with the solar system, and a student is asked about the shape of the Earth or how many planets there are in the solar system, then the student may refer to the facts rather than experimenting on that."}

Publicity is one of the trends man uses to increase the popularity of his products. So, I am kind of disagreeing with the statement that 'most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.'\n\nNowadays, we get to see big celebrities like TV and film actors and actresses, and even sports persons, flashing every now and then on the television endorsing a product or in newspapers. People may fall for these traps and can end up having a product which is actually not worth those huge amounts if not inspected properly. I can't deny the fact that, sometimes in competing with similar brands, these advertisements do show some false statements and, just because people trust these brand ambassadors blindly, end up buying that product. So that's why I don't completely disagree with the above statement.\n\nBut at the same time, in my opinion, viewers should see these advertisements vigilantly and before buying them, they should examine the product and check out the validity of the statements and claims made in those commercials. It is the duty of the customer to keep in mind that there are some agencies who overrate their own products to improve sales.\n\nAlso, in a country like India, there is a governing body called 'ISO' which checks the authenticity of products and, after a series of close inspections, gives them the authority to be sold in the market. So with such authorities like 'ISO,' overrating a product and advertising it is not easily possible.\n\nAdvertisements help the viewer to discriminate between the good and bad qualities of the product by comparing it with other similar brands. It also creates awareness in the minds of customers about newer and technologically advanced products.\n\nSo in conclusion, keeping in mind the advantages of advertising, we can't make a generalized statement that products are made to seem better than they really are. It is, as a 'customer,' our job to check the authenticity of such products."}

The reason I prefer this approach is that someone who is specialized in a single subject can seem quite boring. Let's say he knows very well about the animals in the sea, and whenever you meet him, he talks only about his area of expertise and nothing else. As a listener, I would have a very boring time.\n\nOn the other hand, if you have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects, people who talk with you think that you are very smart. You don't have to talk that much, just a little bit of information about many things is all you need. Usually, listeners don't try to argue with you, unless they are professionals in the subject you are discussing.\n\nOf course, it is also good to specialize in one specific subject, especially if you are a teacher or a doctor, or anyone who teaches or gives advice. Then, that one specific subject would be very valuable.\n\nActually, both personalities are valuable and better than knowing nothing because at least you know something. I had one friend who was usually quiet. But when I let him talk about cars, he didn't stop talking until I changed the topic. He was so interested in cars and liked to spend his time on them."}

In my experience, the best time I had was with a group of teenagers my age in the USA because we were all the same age and of different backgrounds. However, it wasn't entirely like a vacation where you had your peace of mind and complete freedom to enjoy your time the way you wanted to.\nRather than waking up at 6 in the morning and going according to set guidelines made by the tour guide, I would choose to roam the place alone, discovering numerous places on my own and taking the vacation as an adventure.\n\nAlthough moving in a group can be fun, I believe going with a small group of maybe about 2 or 3 friends that think alike is a better option. Even though going with a huge group is amazing fun, the tour guide is what spoils all the fun. Tour guides usually have the whole vacation planned out with set timings, making the holiday seem like another school day where you have a worked-up schedule to follow.\n\nTherefore, in my opinion, the best way to travel would definitely be in a group but without a tour guide, because then you get the freedom to do what you want and the liberty to make your own decisions rather than following a tour guide. But if the tour guide is another person similar to the group you're traveling with and knows the place well, the tour could definitely be the best one.\nBut going to the Himalayas for adventure with a tour guide would definitely kill the adventurous feeling that could be achieved by going alone.\n\nTherefore, the statement has its pros and cons depending on your tour guide, the group, and the situation. But if all three are perfect, then the statement is definitely justified."}
{"file_id": "1030265.txt", "output_essay": "\"Fact\" - \"a true statement\" is the literal meaning of this word. Facts are facts which cannot be challenged or changed. I believe that learning facts is important, but more importantly, it's the ideas and concepts generated in a student's mind that are helpful for successful learning. When a student grasps a concept clearly, he is able to apply his own brain and produce more important concepts, which are absolutely irreplaceable by anything else. I understand that knowing and learning facts is important, but without a good understanding, a student's knowledge is crippled; he cannot shape his own opinion and originate ideas on his own. His knowledge will be fact-based rather than based on good reasoning.\n\nIt's important that a student should devote time alone for himself to build and construct his own ideas, as when he/she steps into the practical world, there one needs to face a lot of practical hurdles where facts might not be of any use. Take, for example, when a student grows to become a doctor and is challenged professionally to deal with some medical issues urgently. I don't think in that situation he/she can use his/her factual knowledge, because facts will only satisfy his query about the ailment maybe, but the treatment would be according to the patient's behavior, which he has to judge and analyze on his own. Maybe the process is not the same as it was in the textbook.\n\nAlso, conceptual knowledge always helps a student to progress and build and provide this world with new ideas. It might be possible that the possible source of information has any kind of discrepancies which can only be resolved when the concept is clear. Then only a student can question and probably will be able to look for an answer on his own rather than waiting for someone else to provide him/her with a new set of facts and figures."}

Often, an older person says that young people have changed, are very different from people of their time. These changes can be found in all aspects of our lives.\n\nNowadays, young people always have a lot of things to do, so I agree with the statement. Nowadays, young people often have a very busy life. Almost all people aged 19-25 go to university, and sometimes they work too. In fact, working during the week is often a possible solution to resolve economic problems, but at the same time, it allows them to attend school. Then they play different kinds of sports, they want to go out with their friends, and they also want to have time to relax at home. So, they do not have any time to help their community or to do some social and useful activities. If I look among all my friends, I think that only a small part of them reserve part of their time to help communities.\n\nI do not think that it's the right behavior, but I think it depends on our society also. The most important values of our society seem to be our career, to enjoy, and to have a relaxed life. Most people do not consider the importance of helping people who live in worse conditions.\n\nEven if I recognize the importance of these aspects, I can also say that it is very difficult, also for me, to concentrate on these kinds of people. I do not have enough free time: I have to study, I have to go to university, I have to work on the weekend, or I have to clean my house (I have been living alone for 3 years), and so if I have free time, I prefer going shopping or to the cinema.

I think they should make a special place to check if the advertising is exactly like what is shown on the bottle or whatever it is.\n\nIf I were in charge of this country, I would create a special place to gather all the statements from all the companies that our country buys from, so I could know what's right and what's wrong.

Then people would be satisfied and happy.\n\nThis is all I can say about advertising products that seem much better than what they really are, and lying on the television, on the radio, and also in the newspapers.

However, when you are traveling in a group led by a tour guide, you can miss the most important things from the places you are visiting.\n\nHaving a tour guide will definitely take you to the most 'common' areas, and you will be able to have a picture of yourself in front of the most known places in the world. Nevertheless, you can also do this by creating a photomontage and placing yourself wherever you want to.\n\nWhat really gives value to travel and what makes it worth visiting a new place are the people and the new cultural differences they can show and share with you. The people are what build a specific society, and the people are the ones that give the specific place its own personality, either shown by a building or even also shown by their particular dishes.\n\nThere are many examples of the new wonders you can find if you are really willing to talk with the locals. However, there is not enough time to share several examples, so let's take one specific country like Germany. This example can be narrowed even more by taking one of the areas like Baden-Württemberg. This area is known more for having the very famous castle known to almost everybody, the Cinderella Castle. Disney took this castle as its most important logo and practically immortalized it, and now it is being visited by people all around the world. However, once you are there, even though the sight is beautiful and the walk to the inside of the castle shows a very nice passage, there is almost nothing else to see there and almost no time to enjoy it since there are too many people in a queue in front of you and behind you. In the meantime, you are losing the great opportunity of visiting other castles, even nicer ones, in a more calm manner.\n\nThe food is another very good argument for why it is better to travel by yourself and give yourself the chance to relate with the local people. It is amazing, but no matter where you go, you will find a McDonald's. If you are with a tour guide and there is time, maybe he or she will take you to a very expensive restaurant and most probably will not have the typical meals of the area. On the other hand, if there is no time and the tour guide considers that there is not enough time, and let's emphasize the fact that this tour guide is the one making decisions for you, there will be a high probability of having the famous hamburgers mentioned before. If you take the time, the locals will really appreciate it, and you may even be lucky enough to have a meal at grandma's place. There is nothing more delicious than that.\n\nThere are many reasons to say why it is better to travel on your own, which does not mean to travel alone, than to travel in a group led by a tour guide, but self-experience will determine it at the end and it will give you the true reasons to choose between them. If I have to choose, I will definitely always try to have my own trip with my own itinerary."}
{"file_id": "1033252.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with the statement based on my experiences, what I have observed in the past and present, and my ability to predict the future through reasoning. The fact that cars cause significant pollution, are inefficient, and require oil to operate are key reasons for my agreement with the proposed statement.\n\nMost importantly, cars have significant detrimental effects on the natural environment around us. This suggests that there will be a decrease in the number of cars in the future. First of all, the exhaust from cars pollutes the air we breathe, sometimes triggering diseases in infants, children, adults, and many others. Given that the natural environment is a resource that people value and wish to protect, it is clear that cars will be used less as people become more aware of the dramatic and harmful effects they have on the Earth's atmosphere and overall human health.\n\nOn the other hand, cars require oil to operate, which makes them inefficient for future use. Oil is currently a very delicate and priceless resource in this 21st millennium. As oil prices increase at an alarming rate, people may not have access to oil or petroleum in the near future. Therefore, it is obvious that oil is not a renewable resource that can be replenished quickly enough to sustain its availability as humans over-exploit its resources. As a result, with the current rate of natural gas and oil consumption, how can we be sure that there will be enough resources for cars to run in the next 20 years?\n\nLastly, from what I have observed, governments are actively trying to decrease the number of cars for critical reasons. Cars may be convenient for the individuals who use them, but they have numerous detrimental effects that governments and the public must address and mitigate. Consequently, every year governments allocate a large percentage of their budget to cover car-related expenses, such as pollution, car management, car accidents, and many more. Because of these expenses, governments are promoting public transportation, such as railways, buses, and subways, which are suggested as substitutes for cars because they are more cost-efficient and convenient for users at the same time.\n\nFrom my beliefs and opinions, I agree with the specified statement, given that cars create major pollution, are inefficient, and costly."}

For example, when they have a brand new car, you find them spending a long time driving this car and going on trips with their friends, and they are satisfied with the compliments about having such a car.\n\nOn the other hand, when you look at older people, you will find them busy with life's concerns and family issues, if they have a family. Also, they don't have a lot of time to spend on fun; mainly, you find them concerned about different issues like politics or building up a good future for their kids. However, some older people, who think that vacation is as important as work and money, always find the time to enjoy their lives and invest some time for entertainment and recreation.\n\nIn conclusion, I think young people are more able to enjoy their lives because they are still young and are looking forward to the coming days with a bright future. But as I said before, older people can enjoy life as much as the young do because they have experience and can organize their lives obviously better than young people."}

This is especially important in classes that contain a lot of information and facts, like history or medicine. Most classes also end with a test or an exam, and in order to pass this successfully, you definitely need to learn the facts by heart.\n\nOn the other hand, it is so much easier to learn the facts if you really understand their ideas and concepts first. In this way, you are not simply memorizing the facts to reproduce them later in your exam, but you are able to explain their meaning and purpose. This makes it much easier to remember them, especially if you really think about the concepts and discuss them with others.\n\nIn addition, you should be aware of the point that you are not only learning for school or university but also for your whole life. Especially at university, you are able to get to know a variety of things that won't only help you achieve high grades in your exams but also prepare you for your later professional life and expand your general knowledge. You definitely won't learn as fast and easily anymore as you grow older, and you'll never get the possibility to get to know so many different facts for free and with as much pleasure as you can during your studies.\n\nAs I already said, in my opinion, it is not possible to simply decide for one of the opportunities. By expressing this, I mean that it is helpful to find a way between them, a combination of both, which means to first understand the facts and concepts and then later on learn them as preparation for your exam. That's the way I do it in my university studies, and until now, this has been a very successful concept!"}

The challenges are more important now! In the field of science, new results only come from new challenges or ideas. Already known work only produces already known results.

And what will make people not agree with the statement is maybe because they think that taking risks is not what a successful person is based on. It's a matter of different opinion.\n\nThe reason why people believe in this statement is that, in business studies, they learn about successful people and about how you can be a successful businessman when you grow up.

By trying new things, we can discover something new. For some people, after taking a lot of risks, they may not achieve success and so they continue with their same work. I don't agree with this because without trying new things we cannot move forward. For example, if a country is a developing country, it remains a developing country forever if they don't try new things and make their country a developed country.\n\nAnother example, if a person wants to become a top ranker or an engineer, he needs to take a lot of risks to reach his destiny, by trying different things, thinking differently, and working on it. I think it will definitely give success to the person.\n\nAn example for which I disagree with the statement is if a person is not working hard or not trying anything different, then definitely he will not reach his goal and he cannot be a successful person. Similarly, take Sachin Tendulkar; he was very poor in studies and was very much interested in cricket. His father took a lot of risks and started practicing cricket with him rather than giving him coaching in his regular studies. So, because of taking a lot of risks and trying new things, now we have a world-class cricketer, and India is very proud to have such a player. So this all happened just by taking risks and trying new things rather than continuing with known work.\n\nSo finally, I say, \"The people who try different things and like to take risks rather than doing the same work will definitely achieve success and stand on top of all.\""}

To me, this is a must for the learning process. I strongly believe that we need to differentiate the concepts, ideas, and facts. To me, students need to learn what is necessary to analyze and differentiate the facts and results. To analyze the facts and results, they need to learn ideas and concepts; okay, why?\n\nFirst of all, ideas and concepts are the main resources of behaviors, inventions, expressing emotions, and so on. So, to make a connection with results, we need to consider ideas and concepts that they are based on. To me, students will learn both of them; unproved concepts or ideas can turn into facts tomorrow. But also, learning facts is necessary to analyze the root of facts. What are the sources of the facts?\n\nAs a second point, students need to learn the methodology of comparing concepts and facts. This helps students to analyze the facts and also makes it easy to learn. In the learning process, as an additional thing, we can include learning how to make comparisons.\n\nFurthermore, while determining the aims of learning, it should be to learn facts but being aware of ideas and concepts. It is like learning the three states of matter, but now scientists have proved that there is one more state of the matter. So, being aware of concepts is helpful; it is like not closing our eyes to what others are thinking.\n\nAs a consequence, students should have an idea of why they need to learn, and how?

For example, you can see a sad person on a gray, rainy day whose mood changes to absolute happiness as the sun rises automatically when they drink a Coke. Even though the weather has nothing to do with people drinking Cokes, they try to sell the idea that a refreshing drink can make you happy no matter what.\n\nOn the other hand, magazine and photograph-based advertisements usually tend to use very simple tricks, such as showing products bigger than they are, or accompanied by a lot of accessories which are not included, and sometimes not even sold at all, but make the real product look a lot more attractive.\n\nFurthermore, some advertisements show results that cannot be completely achieved by the product itself, to convince people to use them. This is very common in diet products, where a very thin model wakes up in the morning to do some exercise, but she just goes to the refrigerator and drinks a diet yogurt. Despite the fact that the yogurt could only prevent you from gaining extra weight, the propaganda makes it look like it actually can make you lose weight.\n\nFinally, another issue is that the advertisements don't show the disadvantages of the products, or if they do, because of some regulation, they do it as fast and illegible as possible. This is the case of alcoholic beverages' advertisements, which show a very small and really fast-read phrase where they advise that drinking in excess is not good for your health.\n\nAs a conclusion, it can be foreseen that advertisements don't usually tell the whole truth about a product, and one has to be very careful in examining the real characteristics of it before buying or using it."}

I think that a person should travel in a group, as this can provide more security. If a person is traveling in a group of friends or family members and they are visiting a new place, they will need a guide. A guide can tell us about the historical importance of the places we are visiting. Since the guide knows all the areas and places of interest, he can guide us well. Also, if we are visiting a place where a different language is spoken, a guide can act as an interpreter. So, I fully agree with the idea of traveling in a group led by a guide.\n\nThe first reason why I am in favor of a tour guide is that the guide can tell us the importance of that place in detail, which otherwise we can't get enough of through other sources like books, etc. For instance, last year my friends and I visited some historical places in India like Agra, Delhi, and Jaipur, but we didn't think about hiring a guide, so we faced many problems there.\n\nThe second reason in favor of hiring a tourist guide is that the guide is well-known to the area we are visiting, and he knows very well about other places which we had not heard of earlier. So, he can make our travel experience more interesting by introducing us to new places.\n\nAnother important reason that I am in favor of a tour guide is that we can easily overcome the language problem if we are visiting a place with a different language. For example, if we are visiting European countries, then we might encounter a language problem there. And we can come across the difficulty of interacting with people. A tour guide can act as an interpreter between us and the people of the region we are visiting.\n\nTo summarize, the best way to travel is in a group led by a tourist guide, so that we can come to know in detail about the places we are visiting, we can enhance our experience by the introduction of new places, and we can handle the situation of a language problem. Last but not least, by traveling in a group, we can have a sense of security."}
{"file_id": "1037349.txt", "output_essay": "\"The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.\" Traveling is really important to my life. Traveling can show us a lot of things and make us learn about a lot of cultures. Traveling in a group can certainly make the trip fun and nicer. In my opinion, a group does not need a guide to help them. Discovering and taking risks, in a group, of getting lost is fun and is an unforgettable memory.\n\nTraveling in a group is always part of my vacations. Last summer, for example, I traveled with my friends to Spain to discover the country and to see a new culture. There, when we arrived, we didn't have any guide. So we took a taxi, gave him the address of the hotel, and he dropped us at the right place. After we deposited our bags in our rooms, and talked to one of the employees, we went to the restaurants he told us about and had so much fun. On our way back, we got lost in the city and couldn't find the hotel. After three hours of walking and the help of others, we arrived at the hotel and slept.\n\nWhat is interesting is when I talk to my friends about how we got lost and how scared we were, they laugh and they dream if those days could come back.\n\nSo we can think that traveling in a group with no guide and getting lost is an entertaining part of the trip.\n\nAnother reason why people don't need a guide anymore is because of the internet and the easy way to know the places where we want to go. When my family organizes a trip to a country or anywhere, they take and do everything on the internet, including the addresses. Also, with the flourishing of technology, we have GPS that can locate our places if we are lost.\n\nIn the end, traveling with a guide is not necessarily the best way to travel. There are a lot of other ways that can be enjoyed."}
{"file_id": "1036451.txt", "output_essay": "I cannot really agree with the opinion stated above. I think that understanding concepts, as well as learning facts, are equally important.\n\nOn the one hand, it is very important to understand an underlying idea. It is the base for applying it to new contexts and for connecting it with other concepts. It is an essential ability to succeed in exams, and it even enables the further development of new hypotheses or even whole theories. In my opinion, real understanding proves if someone is an intelligent, independent-thinking person. And these are necessary attributes for a successful researcher and a satisfying academic career.\n\nFor example, the principle of many basic learning theories, investigated by Skinner, was cited by numerous other researchers. These researchers conducted many interesting experiments, resulting in highly useful applications.\n\nOn the other hand, you cannot deny the importance of knowledge of facts. Surely, the sole learning of facts was exaggerated for a long time. Whole generations of students only had to repeat information without having to prove their understanding. I totally agree that this does not make any sense. I also admit that it is hard work to learn them and it seems senseless from time to time.\n\nNevertheless, facts are important. It is not sufficient if researchers have understood a main principle. They have to know all the included variables of a theory, how the experiments were conducted, why, in which context. They should be aware of which time period a theory was invented and a fact was discovered, and by whom. This is all fruitful background information.\n\nThe first things to learn are facts. Then, understanding of the underlying idea is the next important step. And finally, the further connection and application follows. The last step could not be achieved if one of the earlier steps were missing.\n\nTherefore, I draw the conclusion that you cannot say which of the two learning strategies is more important for a student."}

Indeed, it seems that young people want to enjoy the present before getting old. But we can wonder if young people really enjoy life more than older people do. In the first part, we will examine arguments in favor of this statement. Then, we will consider older people in order to conclude on that statement.\n\nWhy is it thought that young people enjoy life more than older people do? The first reason is that young people are more active. They are more dynamic. They have no fear because they are young. They feel invincible. They are in a period of their life where they have dreams and are ready to do anything to realize those dreams. It can be traveling around the world or pursuing a special career...\nAnother characteristic of young people is that they have more free time that they can spend with their friends or doing their hobbies. Because they are young, they have fewer restrictions...\n\nIt is the reason why they can do what they like. They always find time to do it because they are dynamic. Another reason why they enjoy life is that they are discovering life since they are young. A lot of things are totally new for them. Finally, people meet their best friends when they are young.\n\nNow, why is it thought that older people enjoy life less than younger people? The first reason is that older people have a lot of obligations such as a job, a family, children... All those things take a lot of time and can sometimes become tedious.\n\nBut the matter is to define what 'enjoy life' means. In my opinion, young people enjoy the present, whereas older people enjoy life over a longer time."}
{"file_id": "1029696.txt", "output_essay": "I believe that marketing and advertising have started to play an interesting role in our lives. The number of products available in the market today is increasing very rapidly, and therefore, manufacturers are racing with each other to make their brand names and products known to people. The question is, why does a potential customer remember one product, while on the other hand, forgets another? The answer to this question is trivial; somehow, the potential customer is convinced (this can also be on the subconscious level) that one of the products is better than the other, and therefore remembers only the better one. This gives advertisers all around the world the motivation to show their products as better than they actually are, because they need to demonstrate that their particular product is the best.\n\nThe first proof of this can be found in advertisements that present a setting that is not, or cannot be, real. This could be a beach so amazing that it can only be a painting, or a photograph modified using software. I think that the setting is the key to making people believe that what you are offering is something better than what they have, because it is being displayed in an environment that is superior to theirs. Another example of this might be the people in the advertisements; most of the women in them are very beautiful, and most of the men are very handsome. What an advertiser is trying to achieve by using nearly flawless characters is to convince us that we can be like them; all we need to do is buy that new cellular phone.\n\nThe worst case, of course, is when an advertiser claims that a product can do something that it cannot on average. Most advertisements only provide information about the best cases; an extreme example could be how a toothpaste made someone's teeth as white as pearls from the ocean in a clinical experiment. During the time interval, this information is being transmitted to our brains, a fast subtitle written in a tiny font size indicates that in this experiment, some kind of chemical was also used to amplify the effects of the mentioned toothpaste.\n\nThis situation will continue to become a bigger problem as long as new products are introduced to the global and local markets every day, because this will increase the motivation for advertisers to do so."}
{"file_id": "1039141.txt", "output_essay": "The issue that will be discussed here is whether young people nowadays give enough time to helping their communities or not. Some might say that young people are more educated today and more aware of the problems in their community, as well as more enthusiastic to help. While on the other hand, some might say that young people today are too busy with their own lives to look beyond them and help their communities. Well, I would agree with the first group of people who think that young people nowadays take out enough time to help their communities.\n\nFirstly, the reason I think that the young crowd nowadays gives enough time to help their communities is that they are more educated and are aware of the problems that lie in their community in which they have grown, more so than the young people of the generation before this. Let's take an example of a young man who has faced difficulties in his childhood because of the lack of good schools in his village. Now that he has managed to get an education and secure a good job in a multinational company, he knows the benefits of good educational facilities. He knows from his experience and exposure to the world that his village can grow and develop if the children can get a good education. So, he would take out time to put conscious efforts into the development of his village.\n\nSecondly, taking the same example of this young man who is employed in a good company and also earns well compared to the young people before, he has enough money to help the people in his community and the will to change the infrastructure to facilitate the younger generation in their development.\n\nFinally, I believe the younger generation today is more enthusiastic and filled with more zest to take out extra time to change the conditions existing in their community and help the people who need it. The education system today has changed, which teaches more moral values and inculcates a sense of responsibility in the younger generation to help their community and their country. The young people today have learned to prioritize their work and have become more effective in managing their time.\n\nSo, I think today's generation is more effective in helping their community."}
{"file_id": "1044849.txt", "output_essay": "I totally agree with the statement because if product sellers make advertisements for their products, it will affect the product's sales. For example, in my country, some companies make cheap products but they advertise them as if no one else can make this product like us; we are the best. After that, they sell millions of it. Then, some people get poisoned by that product because they use cheap materials.\n\nAlso, in the US, some companies give advertisements to a television channel like 10 times a day. They are making their product in Asia because there is no manual labor there. So, they can make whatever they can't in the US. Most countries do that, even though a person can make his or her product by themselves. Because they just print where the product is made in.\n\nHowever, people know advertisement is a way to introduce and sell. So, people could decide whether to buy it or not. If the producers make their advertisement well, everybody will agree that the product sells very well. A person can recognize that a product is most powerful or harmful. People should get the idea of the advertisement; if they don't, they can feel like, \"What was that advertisement all about?\" So the person will be confused.\n\nFinally, if producers want to sell a lot, they should make good products. Also, they shouldn't use cheap materials."}
{"file_id": "1031531.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with the opinion that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are for the following two reasons.\n\nFirst, I think that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are in order to attract many people. For example, I think of the advertisement for the Nintendo DS, which is the portable video game machine sold by Nintendo, a famous Japanese company for video games. In the TV commercial, Fujisaki Nanako, who is one of the most famous actresses in Japan, seems to enjoy playing it. Then, last year I bought it. At first, it was interesting to me. By contrast, within three days, I became bored. Now my Nintendo DS is put at the bottom of a box. The Nintendo DS is not attractive to me. This example illustrates that in order to attract many people, advertisements try to show that products are better than they really are.\n\nSecond, many people agree with the situation that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. For example, when I was a student at Kyoto University, which is one of the most famous colleges in Japan, I took a brand strategy class, in which we thought about how to create the brand image of a company through case studies. When Professor Okada, who was my teacher in the class, discussed an advertisement for a car. In the class discussion, Okaie, who was the best student in my class, stated that in the TV commercial, for companies such as Toyota and Nissan, the cars run along a very beautiful road which we had never seen. He mentioned that this situation was only a brand strategy and everyone knew that there was not such a beautiful road in Japan. Every student agreed with his opinion. At that time, I understood that advertisements made products seem much better than they really were.\n\nTherefore, I definitely agree with the opinion that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are."}
{"file_id": "1043817.txt", "output_essay": "There are many ways one can travel. People can travel alone or in groups, led by a tour guide, or travel in groups without one. I prefer to travel in a group led by a tour guide because, with their help, we can save time, save money, and make effective use of their rich knowledge about the places.\n\nI prefer to travel in a tour led by a tour guide because they have experience in planning and arranging tours. This way, we don't need to scratch our heads to plan the tour. For example, once our family planned to visit Singapore. In Singapore, we missed many important places to visit. This was because we had limited knowledge about the place and the language. We would not have faced this problem if we had hired a tour guide.\n\nWith the help of a tour guide, we can complete our tour at a lower cost because they have a complete database of hotels, travels, lodges, and other important things around the world. They can find an effective tour plan that will fit into our budget. For example, one of my friends who also visited Singapore with his family and a tour guide completed the tour with only 10,000 dollars. But on our trip, I spent more than 15,000 dollars. So, I think a good tour guide will help us in saving money.\n\nBy hiring a tour guide, we can save time during the tour because they can plan a good schedule so that we will visit the maximum number of places in the limited time. Also, by choosing a good and experienced guide, we can get to know the historical facts behind the place or city.\n\nThough there will be the added expense of paying the guide, I think it's more worthwhile than the amount we pay them. So, considering all the important facts mentioned above, it's better to hire a tour guide when we are going to travel in a group."}
{"file_id": "1028744.txt", "output_essay": "Personally, I do not think that fewer cars will be used in twenty years than today.\n\nProbably, the author of the statement bases his view on the fact that the increase in the number of used cars has been decreasing for the last 25 years. Furthermore, another thesis supporting his view might be that public transport will become not only more accessible but also less expensive. The invention of a new form of transportation might as well contribute to a reduction in the number of cars. Another very important point is that the streets are overwhelmed by the number of cars and simply cannot provide space for even more vehicles.\n\nThe last point seems to be pretty evident, especially in a country like Germany. However, in countries like China or in other third-world countries, space is not a restricting factor. On the contrary, the development of those countries will even increase the demand for high-priced technologies such as the car. Development happens rapidly, and the chance that countries like India or South Africa will join the club of developed countries within the next twenty years is more than realistic.\n\nAlso, the invention of a new form of transportation might not be absolutely out of the question, but it is nowhere in sight, and it would take much longer to gain general acceptance than the given 20 years to have any impact on the number of cars in use.\n\nWhat I definitely hope and believe is the fall of prices for public transport and its spread over the world - even in countries where it is not established yet. However, I am afraid that the car, as a much more comfortable choice, will always attract humans enough to convince people to use it. I myself used the car for my way to this TOEFL center instead of taking a bus or train. Germany again serves as a good example. While the public transport system surely is one of the best in the world, streets are filled with cars. This demonstrates that even the existence of a public transport system does not have great effects on the number of cars used. Furthermore, outside Europe, countries are much more rural than here. The establishment of a public transport system is by far more expensive than the building of roads.\n\nThe statement that the increase in the number of cars is decreasing is definitely true, but this does not necessarily mean the end of an increasing number of cars is close. As stated before, though Europe has reached a peak which can hardly be increased, in other countries the demand will rise during the following years and outnumber potential decreases in Europe.\n\nThis effect is even promoted by a rising population in the world. Though in Germany and in other highly developed countries, the number of inhabitants decreases slightly, the total number of people still increases rapidly. This will not change during the following 20 summers.\n\nConclusively, I cannot see any convincing reason why the number of cars might decrease during the next two decades - maybe an atomic war or a meteor - but nothing realistic to happen. Though I do not appreciate the trend of more cars, I am absolutely sure that it will continue."}
{"file_id": "1045034.txt", "output_essay": "Yes, I agree with the statement, \"In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.\" Currently, technology has improved. At the same time, the number of car models has increased. Twenty years ago, there were only two or three models of cars available. But now, there are many models of cars, and with technology, cars are being manufactured that keep people safe even if an accident occurs.\n\nFor example, in the olden days, there was no facility to watch television or listen to music in the car. It was used only for travel purposes. But now, we can even drive a car while reading a newspaper, such is the advancement in technology. If a car is in an accident, there is no harm to the human beings because all safety measures have been arranged in the car. The old cars polluted the climate so much by emitting smoke. However, the current cars use gas instead of petrol or diesel, which will reduce climate pollution. This facility was not available in past cars. Different cars have different technologies. Currently, the population has also increased, and at the same time, the usage of cars has increased.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that in twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. At present, technologically advanced cars have good sales in the market."}
{"file_id": "1041462.txt", "output_essay": "Advertisements are used by many factories and companies to inform people about their new products. Sometimes they tell the truth about their products, and sometimes they do not. So, how can we know the truth?\n\nFirst of all, we can determine if a product is good or not by asking people who have tried it. For example, if your cousin saw an advertisement on TV for a useful machine, let's say a sports machine, we know that the TV will say many things about it that will make people like it and buy it without considering the cost. So, your cousin bought it. Then, you hear about this machine and wonder if it is good because if it is, you will buy it. You decide to ask your cousin about it, but unfortunately, he or she tells you that it is not good and that it broke on the first day. When you hear this, surely you will decide not to buy it. This is one way to determine if a product advertised is worth buying or not.\n\nSecond, if you really like a product that you saw in an advertisement, why not buy it? You won't lose anything by trying it; perhaps it will be better than you thought. Anything is possible, but be sure of what you are doing and try not to spend too much money on things you don't need. Just buy the things that you really need.\n\nTo sum up, advertisements can be useful because they let you know about new products that you may have been searching for a long time, and then you find them easily. Therefore, you should stay up-to-date with new advertisements because sometimes they are beneficial."}
{"file_id": "1046064.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with the statement that it is much better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject. This is because if you have only one way to approach a solution, sometimes you may not be able to find a solution, so it is very important to have a broad knowledge. For example, if you are only able to write with your hands and you are not used to writing on a PC, you will get into trouble in many situations in daily business life. Another problem can be if you are specialized and somebody wants to discuss a problem with you which is also important for you to be aware of, but you cannot say anything because you do not understand what the problem means to others. That is a big problem in our society, because everyone is somewhat specialized in one's own life and you often see only your problems whereas others may have much more severe problems. The next problem for specialized people is that they normally can only do one job in their whole life. I think if you lose the job you have, it is much better to have the ability to change it, and that will be much easier with a broad knowledge. But if you are specialized in one specific subject, it will be very hard to get another job without losing time by taking courses to 'improve' one's knowledge. Not to forget the money you cannot earn during this period of time. As a result, I would say that a broad knowledge gives you much more quality of life and a higher variety of jobs."}

Although some people may agree with the statement, I disagree because we have invented useful and high-tech cars, such as hybrid cars that do not cause air pollution. And during twenty years, it is hard to invent something new, such as flying cars.\n\nWe have invented useful and high-tech cars. This proves the ability of the car industry. So, we will be able to drive more useful and high-tech cars. As everyone knows, cars are not always advantageous because they can cause air pollution. However, cars are one of the most efficient forms of transportation. For example, now we can buy and drive hybrid cars. They do not seriously pollute the air. I agree with the opinion that they are expensive. However, companies will decrease the price of hybrid cars as soon as possible because the government helps them by providing funds. In twenty years, there will be more cars on the road; also, these cars will definitely be hybrid cars. Or someday we may not have to worry about paying for gas or insurance.\n\nIt is hard to invent something new, such as flying cars. We usually see flying cars in movies. However, it is just a movie. We should distinguish between fantasy and reality. Twenty years are too short to invent something new. When I was seven years old, I dreamed about a trip to the Moon and believed that I would be able to make that trip after twenty years. Of course, today we can go to the Moon, and I heard about news that an American woman visited the Moon recently. I also heard about the expense, which astonished me. In this way, someday there may be fewer cars than today, but not after twenty years. I think that it will take almost 100 years.\n\nTaking all of these things into account, we need more attention and innovation when we want to get rid of cars on the road."}
{"file_id": "1036284.txt", "output_essay": "The success of people is strictly related to the level of risk taken. The real success is the materialization of people's ability to differentiate themselves from others. A good example of a success story could be Steve Jobs' adventure in the technological world. Steve Jobs, the father and creator of the Apple company, knew very well that to be a successful man, you must take some risks and try to do things differently compared to your competitors.\n\nAs Professor Porter says, the real and most valuable competitive advantage for a company, but at the same time for a person, is the ability to be different. Being different does not mean only doing new things; being different could also mean doing old things but in a different way.\n\nEvery time that we try to do new things, we take more risks at the same time, but to be successful, we must be able to evaluate the different risks and figure out what our return could be, and to what extent failure could affect our lives.\n\nThen, from my point of view, success is related to a multitude of different factors: the ability to create, to imagine, or to perform something in a different way compared to other people; a predisposition to risk, in other words, it could be very difficult to reach success if the subject is risk-averse; but at the same time, it is very important to have the ability to measure this risk and to create different scenarios, to be able to predict what could happen if everything takes the wrong path.\n\nReturning to the Steve Jobs example, what marked the success of the Apple company was the visionary ability of Jobs in figuring out what would distinguish a product like the iPod from other MP3 devices. He chose an innovative path, he calculated and evaluated the risks associated with his ideas, and, after experiencing some failures and losses, he finally succeeded with his device.\n\nThen, when someone achieves success, it is ultimately because he was able to understand and learn from his failures and mistakes, which could derive from trying to be different and taking some risks.\n\nSuccess, in my opinion, is the prize reserved for those who have the courage to be like no others."}
{"file_id": "1035814.txt", "output_essay": "Last year, my girlfriend and I went to Disneyland in Hong Kong, led by a group. After the whole trip, we found that we did not have many memories of Disneyland because the group rushed us so much that we didn't even have enough time to take more pictures. As a result, I decided to organize my tourism with a tour guide forever.\n\nThere are several reasons that helped me make this decision. Firstly, some people argue that group travel is much more economical than being led by a tour guide. As far as I am concerned, this is questionable. The tour guide you employ is not very expensive, and the guide will offer you much more than you can imagine. It is the dream place that does not appear in your tourism book. At the same time, you will have enough time to take photos and breathe the air of freedom away from your city. We spend our money to enjoy our lives, but in the tour group, we just keep moving to another place without recognizing what we have seen here. It is really a waste of our money and our lives, in my eyes.\n\nSecondly, we can find ourselves with the help of a tour guide. In the group, we are workers; we must listen to this, listen to that. We spend our money to enjoy our lives; we do not need a leader to dictate our tourism. It is no longer our office. There is no boss! Nature and we are here! That is true life; we are the leaders of our lives, we are the leaders of our tourism. Where I want to go, I make the decision.\n\nThirdly, perhaps traveling in a group is safer, as we can face problems together that happen during our tourism. But we should know that everyone should be brave enough to face any challenge in life. Solving problems is one part of tourism that we really appreciate. And you have a tour guide who will help anytime because we are the boss. We spend our money and time to enjoy our lives, to enjoy the problems.\n\nFrom what we discussed above, we can safely draw the conclusion that although the advantages of traveling in a group, such as safety and relative economy, are considerable, they cannot compete with the true experience of tourism led by a tour guide when its benefits are taken into consideration. So pack yourself up. Now, enjoy our life!"}

Broad knowledge affects our analysis of events, and it also determines how we will think in certain situations. It is difficult to think about topics that you have not heard of before. You cannot even express your feelings without having knowledge about that topic. It is better to have broader knowledge of many academic subjects rather than to specialize in one subject. Specialization would restrict your worldviews, and it is also difficult to decide in which subject you are going to specialize; in that case, you would lose your other chances.\n\nSpecialization should occur after the broad knowledge of many academic subjects. For instance, I am studying International Relations, and my department underlines the importance of having broader knowledge. I could not just focus on the Cold War without having knowledge of the results of the First World War. Also, the broad knowledge of many academic subjects will help you to analyze events in different dimensions. With the broad knowledge that I have, I can analyze the actions of states in different aspects.\n\nIn addition, if you specialize in one specific subject, you would not even know so many things about other subjects. It seems dangerous. It is difficult to face a subject about which you do not have any opinion. Also, examples can be given from daily life. For instance, you can be an excellent cook, but it would have no worth if you did not know how to wash the dishes. They would complement each other. This is a simple example, but it reflects the importance of having broad knowledge.\n\nFinally, with the broad knowledge of many academic subjects, people will have the chance to see events from different perspectives, even when reading a newspaper; they can create strong relations with other events.

Traveling has proved to be fundamental for many countries' economies.

First of all, the tour guide would probably know about the place where the group is traveling. He would have taken the essential measures which are required for that particular place. For example, if a group is traveling to a hostile area where the roads are not properly constructed, the climate is too cold, and there are possible chances of injury, the tour guide would have taken the medical aid equipment, he would have taken care of where to sleep, and he would have made a list of places which are worth visiting.\n\nPeople who travel in a group led by a tour guide are relaxed as the guide would have given the list of the equipment which is required, the places to see would already be known, and the number of days they are going to visit would be known. Whereas, if an individual travels, he would take precautions; there is to be taken he would carry extra things which he would not require. He would have no idea what are the places to be seen or what time they are open. He would be worried about various things unlike the people who travel in a group. Also, people who travel in a group are not tensed about the initial problems which a traveler faces such as food, where to stay, and how much the trip would cost him in the end as all the group members would have to pay a fixed price. These are the reasons to travel in a group."}
{"file_id": "1039861.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. There are two reasons to support my opinion. The first reason why most advertisements make products seem better is that the most important thing for producers is to sell more products. In selling products, advertisements are very important because there are many products of the same kind in the world today. In this situation, attractive advertisements are indispensable to compete with products from other companies. Let's take cell phones as an example. There are many companies producing cell phones all over the world, and each company also provides many different types. Last year, I lost a cell phone and decided to buy a new one. I was at a loss as to what to buy, and I finally bought one with the most attractive advertisements in a store. After I used it for a while, I easily found that it was difficult for me to use it because of many unnecessary accessory functions. I usually use cell phones only as a mobile telephone, and so I do not need a function of taking a picture. Therefore, I really found that it is important to discern the advertisements more carefully.\n\nThe second reason is that producers partly believe that the real quality of the products is first known after many people use them. In this regard, producers are eager to sell the products in the first place. They consider the problems of the products after the consumers claim them. It is not really a good attitude, but this idea is also rampant and is derived from the idea that selling products is the most important thing for producers, as I mentioned in the first reason. However, society has changed its regard of a recall movement, so this attitude becomes riskier and riskier in developed countries.\n\nIn summary, I agree with the opinion that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are."}

Life has changed from the past; I mean, everything has become faster and faster. Everyone is busy with his own life.\n\nFirst of all, young people are busy with their studies and their own lives. In the past, they were not worried about their studies. However, now they worry a lot about their education and want to make something of themselves in their society.\n\nNext, young people have a lot of things they want to do. For example, they want to enjoy their free time with friends. They want to go to the mall or visit some close friends. On the other hand, in the past, they had a lot of time to help their communities.\n\nFinally, year after year, young people will become busier than now because of the technology that develops year after year, and life will become more difficult. I think young people should organize their time because then they can do what they want. Also, they can help their communities."}

As the number of cars increases day by day, this rise leads to traffic problems. One has to spend at least one hour to reach his destination. This creates stress in the person, and eventually, the person becomes more aggressive towards everything. As a result, the person becomes unhappy, and his efficiency at work decreases by half each day. Try to imagine this situation happening to most members of society!\n\nThe second problem is car accidents; each day, we hear about car accidents just because people do not obey traffic rules, leading to fatalities. Imagine also the psychological effects of all these accidents on society. The third problem is air pollution. Because there are too many cars nowadays, this creates a pollution issue. Especially in big cities, it is very common to smell the exhaust from cars, which is, of course, very unhealthy.\n\nSo, as a result of all these problems mentioned in the previous paragraph, people are looking for new ways to increase the efficiency of transportation and, as a result, decrease the negative effects of the car industry. In each country, people are trying to develop their railroads. With this help, traffic can be avoided, and people can reach the places they want to in a shorter time. This will alleviate stress in people, and they can travel peacefully. Also, in some countries, people are encouraged to use bicycles, which, in my opinion, is a very efficient way. Because it helps relieve stress and is also healthier for one's body.\n\nAs a result, as the number of cars and their effects become more and more disturbing to people, they are looking for new ways to solve this problem. With the help of railroads and bicycle paths, people will eventually stop using cars, and as a result, in twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today."}

People become successful when they achieve a goal which is considered to be appreciable not only by their peers but also by society as a whole.\n\nConsider the stock market, for example. One of the leading men in investment banking is Warren Buffett, who made his fortune by investing in ideas that others were scared to support. Eventually, he became one of the richest men in the world. \"Taking the beaten path won't take you anywhere\" is what he said.\n\nI have seen my father benefiting from investing in a contra fund, i.e., a mutual fund that invests in stocks which contradict the market dynamics and trends. So, it does pay to go into uncharted territories.\n\nSome of the most important discoveries of modern times have been electricity and antibiotics (like penicillin), which wouldn't have taken place if people like Faraday and Fleming didn't dare to put their lives on the line. Thus, I would say that the people who dare do reap the fruits of their success better.\n\nFamous explorers became successful because they believed in their instincts and sailed on for days in search of new and promising lands. The most important discovery has been that of the Americas by European explorers. And look where America is today, arguably the most powerful nation in the world.\n\nWhen you are one in a million, you are not recognized; you have to stand out from the crowd and make your own space, create your own niche. And there are many stories of success where an individual attained success when he goes out and takes some chances. So, I do think that a person's willingness to take risks, along with a dash of hard work and dedication, will eventually make him successful."}

Knowledge can be broad as well as narrow. But which one is better to have?\n\nTo be able to answer this question properly, this topic will be divided into two parts: the undergraduate and the graduate students.\n\nUndergraduate students will take a diversity of courses. This will provide them with a large opportunity that allows them to choose which field to go into later on.\n\nFor example, in the first two years of the pre-pharmacy degree, we used to take, for instance, cultural study courses and arts courses, which are not related to pharmacy. Many students shifted their major after taking these courses. They found themselves brilliant in other fields. This diversity in courses gave them the chance to choose the major that suits them best. Imagine if the students took only major-specific pharmacy courses from the first year. This could lead to the failure of many students because they were not given the chance to study other courses. It's a serious situation, especially in the academic majors that are related to public health and safety, such as medicine, pharmacy, engineering, etc.\n\nHowever, graduate students don't have this problem. They decided to go through a specific field after taking this diversity of courses when they were undergraduate students.\n\nSo, having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects will not last forever.

To what extent do you believe that you are enjoying your life? Firstly, young people have the energy and spirit to take risks to have fun or any kind of adventure, but they do not have enough time to do that because they have to work to earn money to survive and to achieve their goals. However, young people are very lucky because they have a lot of means to enjoy their life, for example, the computer, clubs, sports, and more.\n\nOn the other hand, older people do not have enough power to practice activities that need effort or energy. Also, they have a number of diseases. One of the most serious problems they face is that they cannot deal with the new and modern equipment of entertainment. Secondly, money is a great factor to enjoy your life as a tool to use to fulfill your satisfaction. Despite this, older people may have enough money from their previous working life, young people can be happier and enjoy their life with a very little amount of money.\n\nYoung people represent energy, hope, happiness, success, and life without deformation. To put it in a nutshell, I agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do.

Even if we do not have one ourselves, other people utilize them to make our lives easier—be it a transporter bringing food to the supermarket or the car that brings us to the hospital in case of a severe accident.\n\nIn my opinion, we need cars, and the population in our country knows that. This is the reason why I think that the number of cars will not diminish in the next 20 years.\n\nThere are a myriad of arguments for and against the use of cars: The major argument against cars is certainly the pollution of our environment. And it is true—cars, as we know them today, need certain natural resources and do pollute our environment to a certain degree. If this is always true, there will probably be fewer cars in use in 20 years than there are today. At some point in time, people would recognize the harm of cars and would definitely try to reduce the number of cars to protect the environment.\n\nBut this may not be a realistic case: I am of the opinion that our scientists get smarter and smarter. Until today, they have already invented hybrid engines and engines that are only run by solar energy or plant oils. Today, those inventions cannot replace cars that need gas to produce power because scientists are still trying to get more out of the new findings. But consider the time the gas engine needed to be as perfect as we know it today: It took many years for the car industry to be able to produce those engines.\n\nGiven this evolution, it is possible and very realistic that our scientists will make a huge contribution to the improvement of the 'new' engines in the next 20 years. Even if 20 years might be too short to develop a car that does not pollute the environment at all, I think that the scientists are on a good way to find an engine that drastically reduces pollution. And after another 20 years, we might already use cars that do not need any natural resources like gas. If this is the case, everyone will recognize the outstanding advantages of cars, so that the number of cars will rather increase."}

What can you do when you are young that you can't do when you are old? This question will help determine which one is better.\n\nNightlife, responsibilities, and money are the differences between them.\n\nLet's begin with nightlife. Some young people between 15 and 20 don't even know what nightlife is, so if you are an adult, you can enjoy a night club without any restrictions. Another important point is that you don't have to tell anyone where you are or what you are doing because you are old and you don't depend on your parents.\n\nAlso, another important aspect in the lives of young or old people is responsibility. If you are young, you will always have school, which is a big responsibility, but if you are old, you can do whatever you want and only have to worry about yourself.\n\nThe last and most important point is money. When you are young, you have your parents, and they are the only ones who are worried about the economy. However, you will not have everything you want simply because it's not your money; it's their money, so if you want to buy something they don't want, you just cannot buy it.\n\nIn conclusion, life for old people was, is, and will always be better, and if you are young, you can enjoy it but not as much as you want.

There are two important points to learning something and keeping it in our cultural baggage: to understand the concept of the main idea and to practice the concept in some real-life situation.\n\nMost of the time, when a student has an exam, the student wants to memorize all the dates, places, names, and rules that could help to answer correctly. But frequently, we forget that this is not the most important part of the learning process.\n\nThe first thing a teacher has to do is to make the student understand the concept because when the concept is understood, it is easy to apply it to the problems and, most importantly, in real life.\n\nWhen an elementary school student understands why the citizens of some country had to wage a civil war against their government, the student has understood the importance of a government that takes care of its people and does not take advantage of them.\n\nWhen a student understands the main idea of a problem, he will never forget that, and he will be able to apply it in real life. Then, after understanding, it is very important to reinforce the idea by practicing with examples and possible situations where the student can apply his or her judgment and form a personal opinion about it.\n\nTo practice is to face the problem in many other situations, each one with different characteristics, and that will shape the student, making him think of some solution or creating a personal opinion.\n\nThat is why I said that if you make a student learn the date when human rights were signed, he will learn just a date, but if you make him or her understand the importance of human rights, you will form an excellent human being."}

{"file_id": "1021281.txt", "output_essay": "Nowadays, there is a hot topic about whether young people enjoy life more than older people do. Some people think that old people have more time to enjoy life. Others may disagree and contend that young people are more energetic and more likely to enjoy life. If I were faced with this issue, I would definitely support the latter point. There are numerous reasons to support this point, and I will only explore some of them, described as follows: The first and foremost reason to support my point is, just as someone said, young people are more energetic than older people. This is easily seen in the entertainment fields. For example, young people are more concerned with entertainment events like movies, music, and entertaining stars. They will spend lots of their leisure time talking about and watching them. Their physical conditions also allow them to do so for a long time. You seldom see old people in a disco bar. In a word, since young people have more power, they are more likely to enjoy life.\n\nThe second and significant reason for my view is that young people are more creative than older people. It is obvious in teenagers. Scientific research shows that since young people's brains are in the formative period, they can accept new things easily. For instance, the Internet has been widely used in recent decades. The users of it are mostly young people. No wonder someone represents young people as the rising sun at about eight or nine o'clock. Their creativity enables them to enjoy life the most.\n\nIn conclusion, it is not hard to find that young people can enjoy life more than any other age group because of their energy and creativity. But we also encourage older people to learn from the young and never give up on life."}
{"file_id": "1040073.txt", "output_essay": "Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are; yes, of course, I agree with this. The way advertising is used nowadays has lost the meaning of its original purpose. In the early days, its purpose was to inform people, to make them aware that a certain product was available in the market, which benefited customers in different ways. In those advertisements, they clearly gave a description of the product and ways it could be used in real life.\n\nThe very purpose of that advertisement is lost nowadays; they are just showcasing the product, then it originally exhibits its characteristics, comparing it with another product and fooling the public about the worthiness of the product, then really it has.\n\nThey use some girls for advertising face creams. Before they use this product, they look not beautiful, but using the products for a few times brings change in them, it seems. They will be looking charming. How does this happen? It's just the camera trick and the makeup they are given. If we use it originally, will we get that change? No, definitely not. For example, take a product, namely toothpaste. The companies related to it are Pepsodent, Colgate, Closeup; all these products have the same ingredients and mixtures of the same level, but while advertising, each company showcases its own product differently, comparing with others, not mentioning the name of the different company, that their company's product has better features than others. You just tell me how the product designed with the same formula, but with companies different, have different features.\n\nSo the way advertisement is now used is just showcasing the product more than it originally is, making the product seem much better than it really is.\n\nAnother example is soap. The company JOCIL designs soaps, and they sell those to branded companies. They just label the paper on it and advertise about the product and simply express the features of it without knowing it.\n\nFor advertising, nowadays, the famous body is used, such as an actor, sportsman, singer, and so on... So the people who like the famous body will automatically buy the product, and others who don't like it, they don't go near the product. This is one of the ways that the product is being showcased more than it is worthy of, as people like the words of famous bodies. They feel that the product is really worthy of being purchased, and they simply buy it because his/her famous body advertised the product.\n\nThus, I feel that the advertisement is just showcasing the product more than really the worthiness of it, making the product seem much better than they really are. There is no doubt that certain qualities are there in the product, but not all the qualities mentioned in the advertisement are necessarily in it; it's just added qualities to attract the public to the product."}

Education should give students the main ideas and concepts, things that they can absorb, make their own, and use as a basis for further education or even for their choices in life.\n\nFacts are like evidence in a trial, things that support the main ideas and concepts. Students have to read the facts, understand them, and, even more importantly, understand how the facts exemplify or explain the main idea. They are very important for the understanding process, but in the end, they are notions, something specific that we learn and eventually forget. On the contrary, what really lasts in our memory is the main idea, the concept, and this is the very important thing.\n\nThe first example that I can cite is history. When we study history, we learn a large number of facts, dates, events, meaning that we learn a large amount of notions that we are most likely going to forget in the future. But all these facts are necessary to understand what happened in a specific period and to analyze the causes and effects that took place in those years. The facts are the instruments at our disposal to build a broader vision of the period at hand and to have a general idea of the economic, sociological, or religious forces that interacted in that historical moment. Even if we eventually forget the specific dates or facts, we still retain a concept, an idea of what was happening in the past.\n\nMoreover, I think that it is sometimes even impossible for our mind to store and remember all the notions and information we read. Computer databases are, in fact, very good instruments to store and retain information. Our mind, on the contrary, has the wonderful ability to elaborate information, put it together, and draw conclusions in the form of main ideas and concepts. Again, we see what is really important: ideas and concepts.\n\nIn conclusion, I definitely agree with the statement at hand, as I demonstrated with the examples I gave."}

Some older individuals who survived the Second World War understand how important food and money are, so instead of wasting wealth on enjoying life, they choose to lead a quite simple life. But they never feel their lives are boring.\n\nSecond, young people have a strong desire to express themselves to attract a boyfriend or girlfriend. In order to be popular, young people may like to stay in pubs and bars, where they drink, dance, and joke with each other. However, almost all older people have already found a companion, and fashion and cars are less important to them; they do not wish to live as the younger people do. If it is not necessary, it doesn't make sense to judge that young people enjoy life better.\n\nIn addition, age may be very important in some cultures. For example, older people can control the younger ones in China or Korea. In these countries, age can influence many things, especially when people are having fun. In these cultures, society will provide more benefits to older people. If there is an abundance of food, the older ones can obtain more. So, it is not true that young people can enjoy their life better with a lesser supply.\n\nIn conclusion, older people are equal to young people, which is why nobody argues about that at all."}

It is very common to hear in the media, or simply when older people are chatting, that youngsters don't participate or that they are not interested in community problems. However, I completely disagree with this opinion, not only because I think that it is only a prejudice, but also because from my own experience I can state the opposite.\n\nOn one hand, the basis on which the opinion that youngsters don't give enough time to helping their communities lies is the comparison with the behaviors of older people nowadays and in the past, when they were young. In the first case, it seems to me that there is no data to support any different behavior between the different generations. In my opinion, what creates this perception is the recall of past days, which is never accurate. In the second case, I think that the great demonstrations that happened during the 60s and 70s, related to the wars that took place and the tension between the Eastern and Western blocks, help to a large extent to magnify the false impression that youngsters used to be more committed.\n\nOn the other hand, I can say from my own experience that young people dedicate time to helping their communities. I collaborate as a volunteer in a local NGO, and there, the great majority of the volunteers are as young as me or even younger. But young people are also committed to their communities in many other ways that perhaps are not so visible as struggles in demonstrations. I have friends who are part of political parties and who are very active in any action that is carried out within the community.\n\nIn conclusion, young people are as committed to their communities as they used to be. The reason why it is believed that their commitment has changed is that the ways of participating and helping the community are less visible, such as can be an NGO."}

All they do is spend their valuable time on something invaluable, and it is a pity for them.\n\nActually, we can find that young people nowadays do not dedicate enough time to helping their communities. Due to modernization, parents bring their children with them to cities to find jobs. When they go to work, their children are either left at home or sent to daycare. These children can't find role models who dedicate enough time to helping their communities, and all they know is to enjoy life and have fun. There are no doubts that parents are always role models for their children. That is the reason why young people nowadays do not dedicate enough time to community service. Besides, the public media often delivers erroneous messages to young people. All the media talk about is having fun. This is also another reason for this problem.\n\nIn conclusion, young people need more education and training to teach them to dedicate enough time to helping their communities, and parents should also be trained to be role models. The public media also need to create good programs to teach the young about their social responsibilities. Through these activities, we can eventually find young people dedicating more time to helping their communities. And we will have a better world than before."}

However, I firmly believe that people still want the convenience of a car and eco-friendly cars are now being developed.\n\nFirstly, the amount of car manufacturing is increasing continuously. This is because people would like to have their own car for the convenience of movement. A study by the Korean Public Transportation Institute showed that the main reason Seoul citizens prefer to go to work by car is the convenience it offers. They can enjoy driving except during traffic jams and engage in their favorite activities freely, such as listening to music. Even though the government improves the condition of public transportation, people will not be satisfied with their efforts.\n\nAs for the environmental issue, it is not a big problem since many countries are trying to develop eco-friendly cars. This investment also means that people still value the practicality and convenience of cars more than other modes of transportation. Several months ago, in Japan, some researchers innovated the electric vehicle, which can be used by ordinary people. So, in the future, more people will use nature-friendly cars.\n\nIn these respects, I disagree with the statement that the number of cars will be low."}

On one hand, some people think that in twenty years they will use more than there are today. Indeed, having a car is becoming more and more expensive. On the earth, there is less and less oil, so the price increases a lot, and not all people can afford it. Moreover, in the biggest cities, public transport will be very developed, like in Paris, where the government is creating new bus routes. They want Paris to become a city with no cars. Indeed, some people think we need to stop using cars because of the increase in pollution.\n\nOn the other hand, cars are the best way to move around. Indeed, with cars, you can go everywhere and whenever you want. You do not have to wait as you do with buses and subways. Maybe the price of oil is increasing; however, all governments are trying to find a solution. For example, in France, the government wants to introduce a new oil product made from cereal. This oil is already used in some countries like Brazil, where a lot of cars use this oil and where it is less expensive than in France. Moreover, this vegetable oil can reduce pollution in the biggest cities. And finally, with a car, people can do what they want, just like at home. They choose the radio station they want to listen to, they can smoke, they can phone.\n\nAccording to me, public transport can still develop a lot. But with new technologies, all people would like their own cars, and I think in twenty years there will be more cars in use than there are today."}

However, in the future, as portrayed in some movies, which depict it as more speedy and comfortable than nowadays, we may discard our cars as they will become just a huge matter of waste. There are some reasons to explain this opinion.\n\nThese days are changing and developing faster than in the past. Some people have already visited outer space, and lots of satellites are orbiting the earth. Instead of using cars, they will move by their personal flying devices, similar to planes, or by themselves. From past times, many people have wanted to fly in the sky, and they finally made an airplane. The more wishes, the more developments. The airplane was not our final destination; therefore, a lot of scientists and dreamers are creating new technologies and making them a reality.\n\nSecondly, the future will be a robot world. We always aspire to more comfortable things and have already created some devices to work instead of us. There are many kinds of robots, such as those working in the kitchen or playing with children, and there is even a dancing robot. Therefore, most of the lighter productive work, such as household chores or delivery, will be done by robots. Cars will no longer be needed, and we will just call our personal robots when we need help moving or with delivery.\n\nSurely, the car has been the most successful asset to humankind for a long time. We also utilize cars nowadays almost every day; however, the changing of the times and techniques is more important and influences our life. We cannot deter the change."}

Every economist today knows that it is more important to know how to sell the product than the quality of it.\n\nIt is well known that huge amounts of money are invested by many enterprises in advertisements. There are many statistical studies about publicity and its effects. For example, they have discovered that the effect of advertisements takes some months to manifest. That is the reason why we can see advertisements for a film that won't be in cinemas until three months later.\n\nOne important thing to consider is that we don't buy the product; we buy the concept of the product. Sometimes we have tried many products, and we know the quality of each one, therefore we can choose the better one. But many times, we are faced with a multitude of products to choose from, and we don't know which is better. Then, if we remember the advertisement of that product which explains its advantages, we probably will choose it, although it might actually be worse than others.\n\nSome years ago, a child asked for a pirate ship toy for Christmas. When he opened the box and found his present, he started to cry under the surprised gaze of his parents. Then the child asked his father where the sea was, the one on which the ship sailed in the advertisement. The child had never seen the sea, and he really wanted it from the toy. This is only one example of the effect of advertisements.\n\nIn fact, many times we are not only buying the product. We can be buying the image of the product. For example, several brands of clothes are a social distinction.\n\nIn conclusion, advertisements are a key factor for selling products, not necessarily related to their actual value."}

According to The New Times, everything is changing quickly. Take technology, for example. We can find everything from simple calculators to modern satellites in space. The new technology is giving us the opportunity to learn faster and better. Without new things, life would be dull. Thomas Alva Edison, the great inventor, for example, invented more than fifty devices and gave us light. He changed the world forever.\n\nInnovation gives us a better quality of life. Take computers, for instance; you can use the media for many purposes. You can shop, bank, learn, and take the TOEFL test on the internet. This is because admirable people have innovation and creativity. Not only in the technology area but also in the medical field, we have improved our lives. Innovations allow diseases that killed many people in the past to be cured with new technology and knowledge.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that innovation and risk improve the chances of having a better life.

Look, if you were an advertisement creator and knew of innovations for this product that should be emphasized—the things that improve its usage—you would have to focus on them. Make the commercial appear as if it's an incredible invention made by the company, exclusively for the viewer of the ad. It has to be attractive to the consumer so that they consider buying the product.\n\nIf there is an advertisement telling me, as a consumer, about the advantages and a lot of other things, I wouldn't think much about it because it's only one in a million new things. But by highlighting the outstanding advantages, the product could attract me and lead me to a shop to buy it. To reach this point in the minds of people who see this commercial, you have to emphasize the improvements and even make them appear much better than they are in reality. You can also use a comparison between the product you are advertising and another one. In doing so, the other product has to perform very poorly, while 'your' one acts normally or even unbelievably well. Now, presenting the poor performance as the standard before the new advertised product was invented also creates an overrated image of the new one.\n\nCreating advertisements in this way is the only opportunity to lead people to buy this and not another product. It is even the only way for a commercial to get recognized by the audience.\n\nThe way advertisements are made leads to the statement that most advertisements produced make products seem much better than they really are."}

If I had the chance to experience the same situation, I would not have second thoughts about paying for a tour guide again. So, I am completely in agreement with the idea of traveling in a group led by a tour guide.\n\nFirst of all, I agree with paying someone to show me around because it is the best way to visit everything in a city about which I know nothing. Furthermore, this guide can show me the history, the monuments, the anecdotes, traditional restaurants, and places to party, all for the same price! For instance, on the trip that I mentioned at the beginning, the one I took with my mother, this guide showed us every single place in France; actually, my mother went by herself three years before we did, and thanks to this guide, she learned many new things about Paris.\n\nSecond of all, if I travel with a tour guide, I am going to be safe because this person is supposed to know the right ways and the best times to visit the city, so I do not have to worry about which route I should take to avoid any problems.\n\nTo summarize, I prefer to travel with a tour guide because I think that it is the best way to learn about a new place. In addition, a person is better than a book because any question you have, he or she can answer it on the spot, and also the personal experiences of a tour guide are more interesting than the ones that you can find in a book."}
{"file_id": "1038976.txt", "output_essay": "I do agree with the statement that \"successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.\" Successful people usually come from many failures and risks, and after overcoming all these situations, they gain success. So, those people have a clear idea about how to tackle or overcome risks and problems. The man or woman who is usually successful prefers gaining more success from new things or the things with which he or she is unfamiliar.\n\nAnd in order to try new things, they never hesitate, whereas the man who is usually in a non-successful stage fears trying new things. There are many examples that support this answer. For instance, in the construction field, people usually succeeded in constructing huge buildings, dams, towers, and flyovers, which was usually a risky factor in those days. Because they have succeeded in their field, they are trying for more new things like going for more huge or enormous works, which is also a bit risky. Because the construction field people know a lot about their work and the failures they will meet in achieving things, they try to solve them in a more logical manner or say in a planned order.\n\nNot only in the construction field, but we can also look at other fields like the most happening scientists' field, where they try only for new things rather than going for the known ones. Scientists always think of inventing new things. If they had thought that they couldn't take risks in inventing anything we have now, then we couldn't have gotten many luxuries and also disease-preventing medicines for many hazardous diseases, which are usually harmful to humans.\n\nWhen we go for new things, then only do we get new things in our day-to-day life, which are becoming part of our daily life nowadays and also daily routines. Hence, in this fast-moving world, successful people should try for new things and should take the risks to become more successful, rather than sticking to only doing what they already know how to do well."}
{"file_id": "1041086.txt", "output_essay": "I clearly disagree with the notion that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide. I will explain why through three main points.\n\nFirst of all, in my opinion, I truly believe that trip preparation is an integral part of the travel experience. If you follow a group led by a tour guide, you will not have the opportunity to discover the country or city you are going to visit in advance. Reading the Lonely Planet, spending hours on Google searching for advice on the best places to go is a great part of the anticipation.\n\nSecondly, in a group led by a tour guide, you have to follow their schedule. For me, this means that you are not free to do what you want, when you want. The worst part is that they dictate when you have free time! During a trip, I experience a lot of different moods. Sometimes I like moving quickly from one place to another, but often, it is a real pleasure to relax, take time, and enjoy the moment. From my point of view, it's essential to follow our own rhythm.\n\nLast but not least, the departure and return flights are most of the time scheduled in the middle of the night and at unknown airports. We all know that tour guides want to reduce costs and increase profitability. That is why they prefer to choose large charter planes with small seats to fit more people in them. Additionally, they use smaller airports which are clearly cheaper. The journey becomes painful, and it affects your overall enjoyment of the trip.\n\nThat is why I disagree with the idea that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide. There are many other ways to have a better time on a trip than this one."}
{"file_id": "1041264.txt", "output_essay": "Traveling is one of the most effective ways a family or an individual could spend quality time, relax, or have fun. Therefore, it is essential that tourists have their vacations organized so that they can have the largest amount of fun possible. To have a perfectly organized vacation, people should travel in a group led by a tour guide.\n\nThere are many benefits to traveling with a tour guide. Firstly, the tour guide is a trained professional in tourism. He would know which are the best attractions to visit, and what would be an appropriate length of time to spend at each one. He would be able to plan how to spend the whole day efficiently, unlike if a person was alone and had to spend hours deciding where to go next. Secondly, the tour guide would have tickets ready prior to the visit, and this would enable the group to go straight to the attraction without wasting time. For example, to go up the Eiffel Tower in Paris, France, it would, on average, take a person 2 hours to get a ticket in the high season. However, a tour guide would get you the ticket well before you arrive there, and then you wouldn't have to waste a lot of time waiting in line. Thirdly, the tour guide would arrange all the transport in advance, and for example, would make arrangements with bus companies to have buses present at the correct times, and tell them exactly where to go. If, on the other hand, a person is traveling alone, he would waste a lot of time trying to get from place to place.\n\nThere is also a social benefit to traveling with a group, as it would be likely that your group consists of people mainly from your home country, and therefore you would be able to socialize with them and discuss the attractions you visit, along with the fact that you make new friends.\n\nHowever, some people may argue that having a tour guide deprives them of making their own decisions, and their personal choices. Also, it would not allow them to do things that they have always wanted to do if they visited a certain country, but this can always be easily solved by extending the vacation a day or two, or if that is not possible, missing the certain guided tours they are not particularly interested in.\n\nAll in all, I strongly agree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide. Its advantages significantly outweigh its disadvantages, and I believe that most people would have more fun if they traveled in a group led by a guide."}

Currently, I have to think about many things that I did not have to consider when I was 10. Now, I live alone and I have to do all the things I did not do before. For example, now I have to cook because there is no one else to do that for me. In addition, I have to buy my food and wash my clothes.\n\nOn the other hand, when I was a young child, I thought about playing with my friends. I liked to play football, and I played football with my friend for many hours each day. In addition, I went to the swimming pool with my friends and stayed there all afternoon. At the swimming pool, I played volleyball with friends of mine, and we were very happy.\n\nNow, I cannot do what I did when I was young because I have to go to work, and I do not have enough time to play football or go to the swimming pool.\n\nIn conclusion, I agree with the statement above because when I was young, I enjoyed life more than I do now.

Indeed, older people are aware of the world which surrounds them. They have already experienced most of the feelings a person can undergo or simply feel. Young people absolutely want to try new things, to experience other feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, they are actually younger, that's true. So they can take advantage of everything, do some very physical sports that an older person couldn't do; they also are faster. Everything has to be quick; it's because we want to discover other things.\n\nI take part in that phenomenon; I'm young but nevertheless, I don't think that I enjoy life more than my parents.

{"file_id": "1047079.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with the statement that \"Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.\" I feel this way because if we choose products based solely on advertisements, we cannot really judge a product by sitting at home and watching an advertisement.\n\nThe first reason I think that advertisements don't make products better than what they are is that what we see cannot be true or the right thing most of the time. For example, an advertisement on TV shows a new car launched by some XYZ company. To buy a car, we really need to go out to a showroom, have a look at it, and test drive it. But just by looking at an ad, we can't predict how the car will handle at severe turns and bends.\n\nSecondly, nowadays a lot of advertisement endorsements are done by popular figures like actors and sportsmen. I saw an advertisement for a bike recently on TV. This bike was endorsed by a rising sports star. In my hometown, many people, after seeing this advertisement, went to the showroom and bought that bike. However, from the feedback I am hearing about the bike from my friends, it wasn't even worth a penny. It was so poorly designed. The electronics and the engine were the major problems concerning that bike. Now my friends are complaining to the dealer about their sorry state. So, I do feel that by just following an advertisement, one should not lose his normal senses and end up buying false products.\n\nAdditionally, do the people who make these advertisements and those endorsing these products really use them? It seems to be an interesting question. For example, an actor in my hometown is endorsing a product of personal computers and laptops. But recently, at a film production unit, my friends saw him using a laptop of another brand. This means that he is sure that the product he is endorsing is unreliable. Mostly, we would not find all of the above people who make these advertisements using these products. They would be using products from more famous and reputed brands. Hence, we should not always look at an advertisement and buy the product.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the above-mentioned points, I firmly believe that today's advertisements are no more than a fake piece of information shown on television to make money out of innocent people. Thus, I believe that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are."}
{"file_id": "1048903.txt", "output_essay": "It is undoubtedly true that in twenty years, the number of circulating cars will be strongly reduced. Although many people may believe that this statement is simply ludicrous, it is possible to provide some good reasons to support it. Two main aspects of this explanation are the consequences of the environmental problems caused by cars and the problems caused by the constantly rising oil prices.\n\nAs everybody knows, cars produce toxic smoke that pollutes the air in big cities. For this reason, many governments and city administrations are restricting the number of cars that are allowed to circulate in city centers. In the long term, this will lead to a change in citizens' preferences, i.e., they will prefer using public transportation to using their cars because it will become simply too difficult to drive a car in a big city. To support this opinion, I could quote a research study on this topic carried out at my university that shows that people are becoming more and more unwilling to drive their cars in big cities.\n\nAnother point that could be made is that having a car is becoming more and more expensive. The first reason for this phenomenon is that oil prices have become very prone to rise consistently at any threatened decrease in production. Grassroots people already have many economic problems, and this one will become too awkward for them. Another thing that influences the cost of having a car is the fact that governments are discouraging car buying by imposing taxes on some ecologically dangerous cars. For example, the Italian government is willing to pass a law that imposes a tax on big cars.\n\nGiven these two reasons, it is not difficult to understand why I think that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years than there are today."}

{"file_id": "1044456.txt", "output_essay": "There are two types of advertisement according to chronological order. One is post-modern advertisement, and the other is modern advertisement. The start of advertisement was with modern advertisement, which concentrated on the utility of the product. Later on, after the Cold War period, post-modern advertisement, focusing on the image or impression of the advertisement, began flourishing and has been the mainstream of advertising technology until the present. Now, here comes the problem. Post-modern advertisement ties mainly with an appealing method of impression, and to appeal to others, it needs such accentuation of positive portions and slipping out negative aspects. To cover the weakness of product competitiveness in utility, they will have to concentrate on overwhelming the person with the other good aspects of products, such as design. This can be said that advertisements nowadays make their products seem better. It might be a limited example for my country, but as it is a fair example, I'll discuss it. In my country, insurance companies invest tremendous assets in visual advertisement. They put some words like 'No additional money to pay for 2 months' in big letters while they put some negative but crucial information in letters that can't even be seen without glasses. People see the conditions only written in the big letters, which seem pretty charming to us, people. However, they realize that they were deceived when they actually borrowed a loan from that company. There is another method in making a product seem better than it is. It is not telling about utility or any other practical values but merely depicting beauty. This is especially severe in visual advertisement. An impressive image overwhelms the person so that they forget the real use of the product is actually limited, and sometimes, advertisement uses a person's tendency to follow celebrities and hires celebrities in making advertisements. People just mimic celebrities then. Surprising psychological methods inherent in post-modern advertisements tempt a person to purchase a product. By minimizing shortcomings and accentuating merits, or by visually overwhelming a person without any utilitarian usefulness, advertisements show products to be better than they actually are, and people, often naive, get deceived by advertisements. Definitely, we have to be aware of this so that we don't get deceived. Due to the reasons above, I think that most advertisements make products seem much better than their reality, successfully."}
{"file_id": "1046927.txt", "output_essay": "I totally agree with the statement that most advertisements make products appear more attractive to the consumer than they actually are. Nowadays, it is very difficult to find a product that works exactly as promised. In a globalized, market-oriented world, it is challenging for manufacturers, companies, or retailers to launch a new product and compete successfully against other products. Therefore, marketers must devise clever marketing strategies to capture the customers' or consumers' awareness and interest. To achieve this, promotion is needed, including advertising. Advertising enables the company to present its product and highlight its advantages. I certainly have the impression that it is almost presented in a propagandistic manner. The most effective channels used for advertising are, on the one hand, billboards in the streets, which make use of visual effects, while TV advertisements are even more convincing as they also utilize sound effects. So, if you are the target audience and watch the advertising on TV, you might go into the shop and buy the product. Thus, the marketer has partly achieved his aim by then. It is probably not his goal to leave you unsatisfied, but most of the time, the consumer is. I often think about such deception when I see advertisements for McDonald's. Doesn't the food look so fresh and tasty? But what you eventually get looks and tastes different."}
{"file_id": "1050304.txt", "output_essay": "Nowadays, a product is 80% sold thanks to the marketing department. This implies that marketers have to prove and show us that the product they sell is the best in a certain market. It seems that everyone from the twentieth century must be aware of the great impact that enterprises have on our shopping habits.\n\nIt is entirely right that a firm will try to transmit a message through its product in order to reach our desires and needs. They put all their resources into communication; everything depends on it.\n\nKnowing this, customers should be able to distinguish reality from the dream. Enterprises exploit the naivety and innocence of some people a lot. Consequently, it is our role as consumers to understand that an advertisement does not reflect the real qualities of a product. Everything is based on the image the firm wants to project.\n\nFor example, a toy for kids will always seem better than it really is, mostly because children will want to see it that way and be attracted to it. It is exactly the same for a target market like elderly persons. The entire society is conditioned to be—or at least to seem—perfect and beautiful at any age. Enterprises know this and use this influence extensively to sell their products.\n\nIn conclusion, it is difficult to define whether advertisements are more or less representative of reality. It is certain, though, that the objective of an enterprise is to make consumers believe that their product will give them beauty, health, or anything else they are seeking. Moreover, it depends on the personality of the buyers because they don't have to buy the product. They will make the final decision. In other words, it is up to us, the consumers."}
{"file_id": "1036331.txt", "output_essay": "I strongly agree with this statement. Let me explain why. We live in the era of information and technology. Our everyday life is surrounded by this fact: computers and the Internet, television, cinema, etc. Enterprises take benefit from this new way of obtaining information and settle their advertisements everywhere. We can see publicity on the streets (for example, bus stops), on the Internet (while we surf the net, many different advertisements will show up), in the cinema (films usually contain hidden references to products), and more. But the main way enterprises expose their products is through television.\n\nMost of the population has a TV at home, or at least, has access to it in the neighborhood or at school. Who doesn't watch television? A person who might admit not watching it would be treated as an alien or something similar. Publicity on television is the main support of a TV channel: enterprises pay large amounts of money to have a space after a program so they can show their products.\n\nAnd what about the products shown on television? Well, as we can daily see, all types of items are announced: cars, perfumes, films, drinks, food, etc. But are these products exposed from an objective point of view? No, I don't think so. Publicity experts design the advertisements in a way that will call the spectator's attention, but not because of the product's nature. Instead, they will talk about its effects, about the feelings or impressions you will experience if you buy it or use it. Have you ever seen a 'high quality' perfume advertisement? This publicity will not refer to the way the essence is made. No, this advertisement will talk about the effect it might have on the person and all the people that surround that person. For instance: the perfume will make you feel fresh; or make all the men fall in love with you; or make you the sexiest girl in the city; or even compare the perfume's effect with the great pleasures in life! The thing is that we don't realize this isn't true until we buy the product, and then, it's already too late. So finally, we conclude, as the statement says, that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are."}

After my graduation, I can say that I had a good knowledge of a series of academic subjects, but I realized that this was not so beneficial for those who are searching for a job, particularly their first job experience. In fact, like all my friends did after graduation, I began to search for a job.\n\nIn trying to find something adequate for my generalist preparation, I've understood that it is difficult for people who don't have a specialization to find a job, especially a qualified one.\n\nTalking with some friends from Economic studies, they all told me that the labor market has notably changed in recent years. These changes occurred because a strict division of labor had become a necessity for companies and factories, for example. Consequently, it could be noticed that employers are generally looking for qualified candidates, for people who have a high knowledge of a particular topic, or, in better words, who are specialized in a specific subject.\n\nI have found that this is true because all my friends who obtained a PhD or attended technical faculties have found a job in just a few months, while others with more generalist knowledge or a university degree are still searching for a job.\n\nIn conclusion, I agree with those who prefer to specialize in a specific subject because I think that in doing so, they could have more chances to find a job."}

In our everyday life, we have many examples that confirm this opinion, but the most important one is given by our entrepreneurs.\n\nEntrepreneurs are always risking a lot in terms of money and time. Moreover, entrepreneurs are always innovating, trying new things in order to survive in the market, to be competitive, to improve their position in the global market. The main result of this behavior is the success that everybody can recognize as typical of entrepreneurs.\n\nOn the other side, we have the low-level employees. They only do what they have been taught to do at the beginning of their career, and they do this work for their entire life. Very often, these kinds of people are really very good at doing some specific work, and they usually work for the same company for their entire life. Generally, they never take any risk, and the company fully protects and supports them because they have a very strong know-how. But if we analyze the lives of these people, we can see that they never achieve any success.\n\nTo conclude, I think that to be successful in life, we need to take risks and try new things. Moreover, in this way, we can keep our minds alive, we can train our creativity, we can better express ourselves as human beings. I think that we need to live our unique life as deeply as possible; therefore, we must try as many new things as possible!"}

Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. There are many characteristics that make a person successful. Tenacity and intelligence are only two of these.\n\nFirstly, if a person has tenacity, he/she never gives up, never accepts 'no' for an answer. He/she studies hard to succeed in his/her goal. He/she is curious about his/her target. He/she does his/her best to achieve his/her goal for this target. He/she is so willing to learn new information and make new inventions. For example, one of the great geniuses of our world is Einstein. He was a big inventor. And we are still using his theories in our classes. I think he gathered his ambitions, intelligence, and tenacity to form a person who will not be forgotten at any time in the world.\n\nSecondly, intelligence is a very important factor that makes a person successful. If a person is intelligent, he/she can understand problems easily and does his/her best to cope with them. If people in our world do not become curious about new inventions, nothing could be found. For example, technology cannot be improved widely, beneficial investigations about our era's disease, cancer, cannot be conducted. These are all beneficial to human beings.\n\nTo sum up, nothing can be done without risking anything. The world is improving rapidly. People must always learn something to cope with these changes. They must not be frightened of the new improvements and new technology. Also, they must think 'what must I do to improve myself?' instead of doing well what they already know. They have to do this not only for themselves but also for the benefit of all people around the world."}

The result of this development is that our society is anonymous and there are no real communities.\n\nDuring the last thirty years, I think most of the communities grew into large cities because of the process of globalization, which is a main factor why communities broke and even break.\n\nIn this case, it is not really surprising that many young people do not spend enough time to help their communities. Another reason why I think this development is not surprising is that most cities and communities do not offer young people the opportunity to help. For example, in Germany, where I live, the government decided to close more than half of the institutions where young people can get involved and help the community, maybe to plan a party for the whole community or even a special event for Easter.\n\nThis aspect is also the reason why I say that most do not recognize that a lot of young people support the community because they do it in private organizations or only for their own.\n\nSo my conclusion is that it is not only the fault of the young persons that they do not help so much because they cannot change the developments of the last years and the process of globalization, and also they cannot influence the decisions of the government because most of them are not allowed to vote because of their ages.\n\nHowever, I think that young persons are responsible for the community and so I think they should support them in any way. I also try to support my community. I live in a village with a large and beautiful landscape. The problem is that this area is divided between two states, and so no state thinks that it is responsible for maintaining this area. So, the young members of the riding club, including myself, clean it twice a year. However, the state governments do not realize that."}

When I asked him about the reason for that, despite having gotten excellent marks, he answered that all companies want a variety of skills in the employee who will work with them. It is better to have broad knowledge to get a good job, big salary, and high position in any company.\n\nIf you have different majors in your education or a breadth of knowledge, you'll have a better chance to get a good job. For example, if you have an engineering major with some courses in computer science, you'll get a job faster than if you have just an engineering degree. Also, you'll work in different departments, and that will make your job more exciting.\n\nIt's not hard to get a job, but to have a good salary is the hard thing. To improve your skills and to get a nice salary, you should be different from the other employees. A lot of people try to get one major in their education and then want to work; if you want to be different from the others, you have to have a breadth of knowledge.\n\nNot everyone can be a manager or an important person in his company. The manager has special properties different from the others, more education, and strong behavior. We can get different education by having a breadth of knowledge. If you study different majors with a variety of people, you'll develop strong behavior.\n\nIn conclusion, you can be an important man with a big salary in an excellent job if you have a breadth of knowledge and a variety of education.

{"file_id": "1047838.txt", "output_essay": "It is important to know both the ideas and concepts as well as the facts. Of course, the ideas of a topic or a problem make it easier to understand and to remember, but it takes much longer to be taught these concepts. So sometimes it is easier to learn only facts, even if they are dry and boring. It depends on what you have to do with the information, whether you have to write an essay about that or if it is just for your own general knowledge. Knowing facts is sometimes important when you are talking to or discussing with other people. To show them in a short time that you have a broad knowledge about different subjects, you will need facts.\n\nTo come back to the ideas and concepts, I can say that if you have a great interest in something, it is not enough just to know about the facts. Also, for yourself, you want to know more and understand the whole thing. If you have exams on this topic, it is much easier to answer the asked questions because you have the background.\n\nFor myself, I prefer to learn ideas and concepts. I am studying, and at the university, it is very important to understand the problem. The exams are very difficult and hard. So if you are not prepared and only know the facts, you are lost. But sometimes, if I read the newspaper or watch TV, I try to remember short facts. Usually, I do not have the time to read about every topic too long, so I just remember the most important things. After that, I know what other people are talking about, not in detail, but I can understand the problem or topic because of the learned facts.\n\nTo summarize, I would say that ideas and concepts are important to know when it is your course or work.

{"file_id": "1048738.txt", "output_essay": "Most companies allot a huge amount to advertisement. Why do they do that? Is it still beneficial after spending thousands of dollars just on advertisement? As a matter of fact, it is. I actually read an article about a drink advertisement featuring a top Korean star. The sales of the product increased dramatically after the advertisement. Why has this phenomenon happened?\n\nFirst, most advertisers try to create a good image of the product through the advertisement to attract customers. There's actually no one trying to complain about their own product on TV. Hence, the consumers unconsciously accept that the product on TV or in the papers is actually better through the images that the advertisement presents. For example, creating an image of beauty or health by using Jessica Alba in the picture makes people think, 'Oh, if I use that product, I will be beautiful and healthy like Jessica Alba.'\n\nFurthermore, advertisement instills unconscious trust in people's minds. It is a human instinct to believe that the product we know is better than one unknown. And advertisements make products more widely known. People simply can't trust things that they don't know about. Hence, by using this phenomenon, advertising creates a kind of fake trust in the product. For example, which would you use between Pantene or a shampoo you've never seen, even if you've never used either? Most people would choose Pantene because they know it.\n\nAdvertising is a kind of magic or trick that attracts people to use it, and that's actually the purpose of the process. By associating a pleasant image with a Hollywood star, for example, and using the human instinct of preference for famous products, it paralyzes people into buying them. However, we have to be aware that 'A picture means more than a thousand words.' We have to experience things for ourselves rather than just experiencing them through a TV."}

On the one hand, I agree that learning facts is significant, but on the other hand, only understanding ideas and concepts allows students to really move something.\n\nLearning facts, a deductive method, is, according to my view, an important basis for inventing something, doing research, or working on new programs for the government or society in general.\n\nTo illustrate my thesis, I would like to explain how my father works. My father does research concerning synapses, the junctions between neurons. Together with his student research group at the university in Munich, he reviewed all the known facts about neurons. That was the basis for the research and experiments.\n\nAfter becoming aware of the way a signal is transferred from one cell to another, they started working on concepts of how the information transfer can be blocked. Therefore, they employed poisons like atropine, which is responsible for preventing specific neurons from passing through a cell membrane.\n\nWith this illustration, I would like to emphasize the combination of knowing facts and discovering concepts.\n\nAnother example that conveys my opinion very well is the political system. Of course, a student can learn all the facts about the German democratic system, for example, that it was established after World War II with the help of the Americans, British, French, and (former) Soviets, etc., but this is not necessary when he should think of new opportunities for citizen participation.\n\nFacts are sometimes an important, essential basis or background, but to be innovative and creative, it must be guaranteed that one has understood the gist of an idea or concept.\n\nDrawing a conclusion, I would advise students to learn facts and regard them as a measure for understanding sophisticated ideas and concepts without any problems."}

Therefore, you should be more different and effective than the others, and this is possible only by having broad knowledge about various academic subjects.\n\nTo begin with, it is a clear fact that the world is crowded, and people have to compete to have good living conditions. While their academic education process is continuing, they should try to develop themselves in different fields because being specialized in one subject is not enough to surpass other competitors. For this reason, if they want to be successful, they should take into consideration this difficulty.\n\nIn addition to this, people live in a competitive world, and if they want to be in the high class or if they want to have good living conditions, they have to be powerful, and of course, they should have enough equipment to fight and compete with other people.

Although real weapons such as guns were the most powerful equipment to compete with other countries and people in various fields in the past, now people are in need of different things such as intelligence, ability, and of course, wide knowledge to show their difference from other people.

The art of advertising has brought a dramatic change to the marketing world.\n\nThe products shown in the 'ad,' the short form of advertising, may not be the same as they really are. The purpose of advertising is to grab the attention of consumers towards the product. If a product captures the attention of consumers, it may lead them to buy it. However, the sample shown in the advertisement may vary from the real product.\n\nFor example, in the automobile industry, they showcase the performance and accessories of their product in a speculative way, but the reality often differs from what is shown. Also, during the advertisement, they make an asterisk mark on the mileage or any other feature they show, but none observes that, which means 'under standard testing conditions.' Generally, consumers do not notice this because the font size is very small.\n\nNot only in the automobile industry, let's consider the financial sector. Here, finance companies claim their insurance plans are much better than others. They announce only the benefits of the plan but not the risks. This is a clever way of misleading the public.\n\nA company can only survive long with profits if it makes a good reputation in the market. To achieve this main objective, products are often shown in a much better light in advertisements. Of course, there are some products that are real; for example, the jewelry products shown will be the same as the real ones.\n\nThe use of the latest technology in photography is also one of the causes of this debate.

It depends on whether the subject pertains to:\n\nA. Scientific subjects: I will say it's not important to understand because the student should approach the subject from a different perspective. For example, if the teacher talks about the sunrise from the east, there is no need to debate the teacher on this because there is no benefit from the discussion. Even if they talk for days, they would not gain any additional information. Therefore, I believe that in scientific subjects, it is not important for students to understand ideas, but perhaps the teacher could briefly explain this based on the Earth's movement.\n\nB. Art subjects: Here, the subject is open-ended because it does not have any constants, unlike scientific subjects. The teacher may present information to the students, and some may agree with it while others may not. For instance, let's talk about the beauty of the 'Mona Lisa'. Some students may agree that there are secrets in her smile, but not all may interpret this aspect of art in the same way, or it may have been created unintentionally by Leonardo da Vinci. So, I think it is not important for students to understand ideas and concepts.\n\nC. Medical subjects: This pertains to medical students who must understand everything about human anatomy. No detail should be overlooked; every detail should be discussed. Here, I think there is a need for students to understand in order to learn the facts.\n\nFinally, I am discussing the subject from an external perspective, and my opinion may be mistaken.

My opinion may be more applicable to higher-level students, such as those in university.

However, we should not ignore the benefits of advertisements for this reason.\n\nTo begin with, I admit that most advertisements do exaggerate the qualities of the products. It is also the reason why manufacturers are so fascinated with making advertisements. The ads arouse our interest by demonstrating how excellent the products are. For example, we can always see ads for hair cleaning products on TV. Some models or famous stars come out to show their extremely shiny and smooth hair, and they tell us the special product is the reason for their beautiful hair. It is really attractive. But when we buy the product from the market and use it, we will find that the result is not as good as they claim in the ad. From this aspect, we are deceived by the ads.\n\nHowever, the various advertisements play significant roles in our lives. On the one hand, we can receive some introductions and suggestions from them. Imagine when we are shopping in the supermarket, we must face thousands of brands. There could even be hundreds of kinds of soft drinks. If we know nothing about the products, we must spend a lot of time on selection. With different ads, the situation changes. We become aware of several brands of soft drinks, and then we can choose from this smaller range. On the other hand, advertising has become a big industry. Both customers and manufacturers need the ad firms. And these firms supply a large number of job opportunities for our society every year. Therefore, advertisements are necessary for us.\n\nLast but not least, the quality and services determine the products' fates ultimately, not the ads. We customers may be cheated once, but not always. Besides, not every product is bad. The famous and lasting brands in most fields are good enough for the customers, in fact. For this reason, I think it is acceptable when some advertisements exaggerate the benefits of the products.\n\nBased on the above reasons, I believe that advertisements serve good functions in our society, although they sometimes make the products seem better than they really are."}

This is due to the expertise and experience that a tour guide can offer. Moreover, the guide can show the travelers the important and interesting places that the group should visit during the trip. This is very important because it can save money and time. You go straight to the point. It is fantastic.\n\nOn the other hand, if we travel in a group led by a tour guide, we can feel uncomfortable with many things. One of them is that you cannot visit some places when you want to because it is common for a tour guide to have a travel route decided and scheduled before the trip has started. Adding to this point, you cannot enjoy isolated spaces and activities because most of the time you have to share different activities with the entire group, and it can be a boring experience.\n\nFrom my point of view, it is very important to travel with someone else, but if I have the opportunity to do it in a group, it is wonderful because of the mutual cultural and interpersonal exchange. You can enjoy and get involved in many activities easily. But if your group has a tour guide, it is an excellent tool to know a lot of places using less time and money.

Although it might not be exact for every advertisement, this gap between reality and representation is experienced on a daily basis.\n\nFirst, we have to keep in mind the primary goal of an advertisement, which is to attract customers to a specific product. Hence, advertisement makers have to rely on commercial techniques that give the impression that their product is not only good but that it is better than other products of the same category.\n\nIt is precisely in this process that a gap may occur between what the product really is and how it is presented to the customers. Even if we assume that the advertisement makers are aware of the basic qualities of a product, what is to be understood is that their goal is to make you think that you need this particular product, hence emphasizing its qualities and, of course, passing under silence its negative aspects. This unbalanced and biased view on the product's inherent value will surely produce a distorted perception of its real desirability, making it seem much better than it really is.\n\nThe car industry provides numerous examples of this phenomenon. This very competitive market forces advertisement makers to present every car as if they are perfectly fitted for you, which is not always the case. For example, American car makers have the tendency to promote their vehicles by stating their durability and their power. But they naturally never mention the fact that these vehicles are much more energy-consuming than non-American cars. Hence, if one relies only on the advertisement, he will be convinced that this particular American automobile is a really good product. But, if he buys it, he will soon realize that his vehicle has a high gas consumption rate. He then might have the feeling that he made the wrong choice, that the vehicle was not as good for him as the advertisement pretended.

There are two important reasons why I think that this statement is true.\n\nFirst, today, in our society, the most important thing for people has become appearance, not the real essence of things. In the everyday life of each individual, the aesthetic and exterior aspects, such as clothes, beauty, money, wealth, and material things are more relevant than the interior aspects, such as ethical values, love, friendliness, helpfulness, etc. For this reason, people think that it is right to appear and to demonstrate these aspects rather than their essence.\n\nSecond, today TV, radio, newspapers, and other forms and sources of information, like mass media, have developed very quickly, connecting groups of different people all over the world. So individuals are slaves to this information sphere that influences them.\n\nSo we can transfer these two concepts from the life of people to their relationship with the different kinds of products, which they see and consider all day. I think that because people are influenced and pay great attention to exterior aspects, most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.\n\nIn conclusion, I think that this process is really developed, but it is wrong and it damages our society within a few years."}
{"file_id": "1055163.txt", "output_essay": "There are two reasons why the number of cars used by people might be reduced in the future. The first reason is that people will take the environment into consideration a lot more than they do now. Another reason is that economic status may be affected for the worse in the future.\n\nPeople will appreciate a good and healthy environment more in the future because of the fact that it is rapidly changing for the worse now. If we looked at the Earth as a creature, it would not be in good health; it would be 'ill,' and it won't take people a long time to notice that. As soon as they do, and as soon as this fact shocks them back to their senses, they will act in more responsible ways and will take immediate actions to prevent further illnesses from appearing, and that's where the reduction in using cars must take place. Take the global warming issue, for example; it is already capturing people's attention and driving them to want to do something about it.\n\nThe environmental status will have a larger impact on human society and will most probably change its economic structure. Once that is done, the individual won't be able to afford the luxury of having his/her own car, and therefore, will force the reduction of car usage onto society. Other methods of transportation will become even more popular than they are now. For example, public transportation will be a must and not an option, not neglecting the fact that they are being used now very often. But is that for the right reasons?\n\nPerhaps if more people understood that fewer cars would do good for our planet, we wouldn't have to wait for twenty more years for people to stop using these harmful machines."}
{"file_id": "1040502.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with the statement that says, \"In twenty years, there will be fewer cars than there are today.\" In fact, I have to admit, from my personal experience, that in the last ten years this has been the tendency we are observing, even if it is not a good result.\n\nI think that in twenty years there are going to be fewer cars for several reasons. First of all, cities are getting bigger. I read last week that most people now live in cities. That means they are going to have to move within the city, and the bigger the city becomes, the more people will need to have a car (unless the state offers the possibility to move with alternative transportation).\n\nSecondly, cities are often overcrowded, and people who do not have much money are obliged to find another place to live outside the city. This means once again that they are going to need a car to get to the city for work, for example. Also, there are people who dislike the lifestyle that a city often offers. They would probably try to find a place to live that is outside the city but from where they can still commute to the city by car.\n\nMoreover, I think it also depends on how the state, or the local community, would act. There are several examples that demonstrate that when a local community does not want to have too many cars in the city, some solutions can be found to resolve this problem.\n\nThe first thing is to make a good city plan, which can really help. If a city is planned in a smart way that considers different factors, such as where to put major roads or how to plan alternative transportation, then moving in the city is definitely easier.\n\nSecondly, the state should try to sensitize more and more people who live in the city, who often do not care about this topic because they are more comfortable moving with their own car or because they think this problem does not affect them. Which is not true, because they do not feel comfortable at all while trying not to get stuck in traffic or when air pollution reaches really dangerous limits!\n\nFinally, I agree with the statement, even if I think that it will be a huge problem if this actually comes true."}
{"file_id": "1050463.txt", "output_essay": "I totally agree with the statement given above.\n\nFirst of all, advertisements only show the advantages of a product and not the possible disadvantages. I have had this experience myself several times. I remember the first advertisements for the iPod from Apple. The customers really got the feeling that the iPod was not only a simple music player with a good-looking design but also the handiest player on the market. I was one of the first people who bought an iPod, but after a short period of time, I was a little bit disappointed with my decision. The advertisements did not show, for example, that it was only possible to change the recorded music with one specific software program and only on one computer at a time. I still have the iPod, but in the future, I will be better informed about the features of a product before I buy it.\n\nFurthermore, quite a lot of products do not live up to the characteristics in the way the advertisements portray them. A good friend of mine works in the marketing department of a company that does advertising for different companies. It is always very interesting and amusing when we get together for a drink and talk about our jobs. Every time, it is the same: he tells me about new customers and their products. My friend and his colleagues sometimes do not even see one advantage of a product that should be advertised by them, but it is their job to present the product in such a way that people feel the desire to buy it.\n\nAs I have shown above, advertisements do not always show the truth about a product and often cast it in a much better light than it deserves. I have had these experiences several times and I have learned from them. I think everybody should be aware that the product they buy may not be as perfect as the advertisement made it seem."}

It is certain that having several opinions about different subjects should be better than not having any. However, a lot of people specialize in one specific subject, and there are good and bad points about that too.\n\nPeople who have knowledge of many academic subjects are certainly more advantaged than those who have knowledge in only one subject. First, it is better to know about many subjects rather than to be limited to only one. We can talk about everything, which makes us more interesting to people. Nowadays, it is really important to maintain good relations in our society. Then, someone who knows a lot about various things can serve others by helping them. I know someone who is knowledgeable about quite a lot of things and is able to help his friends due to his knowledge.\n\nHowever, someone who only has broad knowledge may be at a disadvantage at some point. He may not be able to continue a conversation or to express his ideas because he would need to have deeper knowledge about the subject. That's why someone who has only broad knowledge of many subjects can be at some point disadvantaged.\n\nSomeone who is specialized in only one specific subject can certainly speak and work on something related to his specialization. Nevertheless, he would also be disadvantaged if faced with something that is not his subject. He would then feel useless in the conversation or work project. This person may also seem less interesting to others than the person who has broad knowledge of many academic subjects, because of his lack of knowledge in other areas.\n\nTo conclude, a person who has broad knowledge about many subjects may be more interesting, but unfortunately, he could be disadvantaged because of his broad knowledge.\n\nI think that someone with broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better than someone specialized in only one area."}
{"file_id": "1049574.txt", "output_essay": "Some people believe that successful people take risks and try new things in order to accomplish their goals, while others believe that doing what they know well will get them where they want to be. I believe that successful people always have to take risks and not just do what they know how to do well.\n\nI will explain why I agree with the statement using an example from a specific career like engineering. Risks can take you to fields of your career that you did not even know exist, because you are always too busy doing what you already know. For example, the development of new technology or the expansion of one that already exists. If you don't take the risk to explore new things, this new technology might never be developed because you, as an engineer, are doing the same thing over and over again.\n\nAnother advantage of taking risks is that if you fail, you can always go back to what you were doing before. Let's think of a new product we want to develop. If the engineers have a specific product, for example, deodorants in roll-on plastic containers, and they never try to invent another way to apply the product, they probably would not be able to create the spray applications. But let's say they formulate this new application using aerosols and they find out that it is affecting the ozone layer on the planet because of the gases expelled. They can always go back to the roll-on application and help the environment. They took the risk with the new technology, but it brought a lot of problems, so they can go back to the old way to apply the product and solve the problem.\n\nThese main two reasons explain why people have to take risks in their professional environment. However, this applies to other things in your life. Like, for example, in a personal field, let's talk about marriage. When you get married, you are taking a lot of risks. You are signing a contract that lasts forever, not knowing what is going to happen in your life. But as I mentioned, this contract can be voided, and if things are rough, you can get divorced and go back to your single life. You took the risk looking for success, but it did not work, so you can go back and start all over again."}

{"file_id": "1057485.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars than there are today. Cars mainly depend on conventional fuels, and their resources are limited. This might increase the demand for petroleum and its products. After some years, or due to a continuous increase in fuel costs, people may be forced to move away from cars and mostly depend on public transport, which is quite economical and has several advantages.\n\nThe government will implement different plans to discourage people from using cars by levying heavy taxes on registration, insurance charges, road taxes, and yearly renewal charges, which makes it unaffordable for many people to own a car. Due to the continuous decrease in petroleum resources, auto manufacturing companies are focusing on non-conventional sources like electric and hybrid cars. An electric car is limited to a certain distance and requires time to charge, which is a major drawback.\n\nA hybrid car, which uses more than one type of fuel to run, is quite costly but is stated as the car of the future. In the future, we may see only these types of cars running on the roads.\n\nDue to an increase in population, the number of car users increases, which will raise the emissions of gases like CO2 and lead particles into the air. This will damage our environment and is hazardous to health because these gases may cause lung cancer and respiratory problems.\n\nTherefore, it is the responsibility of the government to encourage people to use more public transport, which is less dependent on petroleum, environmentally friendly, less crowding on the roads, and also economical."}

They spend time doing sports, dating people, and going to clubs and pubs to find their fun; they drink and smoke to make themselves feel higher, more excited. It's not a healthy life, nor is it a responsible one. When people are young, mostly they spend money given by their parents, instead of money earned by themselves.\n\nSecondly, young people tend to be selfish and take less care about others. They don't actually know how important other people's roles are in their lives. In that case, they will contribute less to either family or community. So, in my view, young people do not know 'how' to enjoy life.\n\nIn contrast, older people think otherwise. 'Enjoy ourselves with other people, have fun while we can.' is what they think. They are more mature and know what they are supposed to do. Older people usually travel when they have free time and extra financial resources. They go to clubs too, but for a different purpose, to have a drink with friends or old classmates. Most of them know how to lead a life that is healthy and full of happiness.\n\nAlso, older people know how to make themselves helpful and valuable to others.

{"file_id": "1051912.txt", "output_essay": "Yes, I agree with the statement. We need to keep broad knowledge of all academic subjects when compared to a specific subject. Because in preliminary studies, each one of the subjects is interlinked with other subjects. This means that acquiring some knowledge of each and every relevant subject is good for the basics of studies. Veins are connected to every part of the body and supply blood to function in good health. If a person is suffering from internal pain, the patient is to be taken to the hospital and checked by the doctor, and some deficits are identified. Planned to do an operation, each and every doctor should have some knowledge of all parts of the human body; otherwise, that doctor cannot perform an operation without having knowledge of the relevant parts. Suddenly, if the doctor has good knowledge of veins, for example, a general doctor cannot just read about one topic or one specific subject. In the human body, each and every part is related to another part, so the person studying to be a doctor needs to know all relevant subjects of the human body to be a successful doctor.\n\nWhereas in mathematical calculations, to calculate the estimated cost of a project, one needs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Then only the final result will appear. So, in some cases, there should be good knowledge in relevant subjects, and similarly, we can improve communication and good relationships among people. We need to have knowledge in all aspects; then only can we survive in society. Having good knowledge in all areas is beneficial. Each and every genius has vast experience.

Yet, by drawing comparisons between different communities all over the world, I would like to present my home community in order to illustrate the youths' commitment to their communities.\n\nFor my working definition, I see 'helping communities' as a willing and unpaid commitment to local affairs. There is a huge amount of youth groups covering all ages and interests, which meet once a week in order to pursue their common interests and aims. There is a range from choirs to playgroups to sports clubs. By coming together, they foster the community; some arrange public events like summer parties where everybody can take part, and the profits are donated to local institutions.\n\nAdditionally, many youths willingly become members of, for example, fire departments to be able to save their families and neighbors when required. Weekly meetings and trainings prepare them for this task. Moreover, there are many who decide to be social workers, at least part-time, some even full-time for a whole year. They can work wherever they desire. Either they help in old people's homes by taking them for a walk, doing their shopping, or simply spending time with them. Others decide to work with disabled people, helping them to manage their daily lives. Some others prefer to work with young children who have problems at home or at school, etc. There is a variety of possibilities where they can and do spend their time in order to improve conditions.\n\nAnother possibility to get engaged in the community's affairs is to engage in local politics. Thus, young people's ideas and suggestions can improve the community. For example, I have just run a youth campaign which informed the citizens about, and collected signatures against, the poor conditions in our local kindergarten. Soon, we achieved the necessary pressure to realize our demand."}

I agree with the opinion that advertisements often make the product look much better than it actually is.\n\nThe growth of communication media, widely in the form of television, newspapers, the internet, and various other platforms, has led to an outright increase in the promotion of any item. People come to know about any new product on the market through these media.\n\nThe mindset of people has changed considerably in the sense that they have shifted their preferences from buying the necessary items to those that are endorsed by celebrities. Gone are the days when people used to go outdoor shopping to get the required products. A new era has begun with internet shopping, which reduces the burden of going out to shop. People can sit in their homes, and if they find something interesting in the advertisements, they opt to buy it through the internet.\n\nThe previous notion of purchasing a product based on its requirement and merit has totally changed. People have altered their mindset to buy products that seem appealing and interesting in the advertisements.\n\nAs an example, consider the good old days when there were not many advertisements for a product. People used to get a clear understanding of the product they were buying and then opt for it. Nowadays, the scenario has changed where people buy the product only because their favorite celebrity has advertised it.\n\nFurthermore, people are more interested in buying an item their neighbor has just bought. They aim to be one step ahead of them and buy that product even if it is irrelevant to them. In this way, word-of-mouth has created problems.\n\nThese advertisements nowadays make the products look much more valuable than what they really are. Going through various advertisements provided through the communication media and opting to buy a product is not a wise decision. These advertisements generally hype the product. One comes to realize the seriousness of the mistake they have committed in choosing the product based solely on the impression of the advertisements once they receive the original product. Next time, they might be careful enough in selecting the products to buy.\n\nSo, in my opinion, it is always better to select a product based on its merit rather than following the advertisements and choosing the product."}

First, I believe that the governments of many countries around the world have recently begun to restrict the use of cars due to several serious problems. For example, cars emit carbon monoxide when they burn gasoline, which is poisonous to people, animals, and plants. In addition, cars also emit carbon dioxide, which is responsible for the greenhouse effect.\n\nSecond, governments also restrict the use of vehicles due to the fear of depletion of natural resources, especially petroleum. That valuable natural resource is necessary for vehicles to move—i.e., to burn gasoline. Moreover, it is necessary to manufacture vehicles. For example, the process of manufacturing cars requires high temperatures, which are provided by petroleum. Furthermore, cars use plastics as parts thereof, and needless to say, plastics are produced from petroleum.\n\nIn addition, according to media and recent official reports by the United Nations, the governments of many countries are not only beginning to restrict the use of cars but also trying to find alternative transportation methods that do not have the problems cars have. For example, in my nation, Japan, the government has been investing in the research for the commercialization of the 'linear motor car.' It moves by the energy of magnets, so it does not emit any poisonous gases. Experts estimate that the linear motor car will be used more popularly in 15 years.\n\nTherefore, I agree with the opinion that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today for these reasons."}

Therefore, it is impossible to make a fair comparison between generations.\n\nSecondly, in my country, Turkey, although the sharing and helpful community of past Turkish culture does not seem to exist as it did 15-20 years ago, there has been a significant increase in both the quantity of charity unions and their member numbers in comparison.\n\nMoreover, according to my observations, 3 out of 5 people who join these kinds of organizations are mostly in the age range of 18-30.

When I was in middle school in Korea, students had to learn many more subjects than in New York, where I now live. We had to master subjects from Physics to Engineering and had major tests each term. Studying the twelve or more subjects that I was supposed to get as high a score as possible on, I wondered if that type of study really helped me to learn and achieve what I needed to survive in society. Many of the subjects, such as engineering, cooking, or music in my case, were unattractive to me, and most of all, unnecessary for my future. Many other students would have a similar problem. Also, it is very hard, or impossible, for a person to master so many subjects.\n\nOne may argue that in order to be well-adapted in our society, people need a multitude of fields in which one can do well. For example, in typical companies, employees need to be good at calculating and analyzing information, socializing with other people, which might require various kinds of skills. However, if one tries to master too many disciplines, it is more likely not to be helpful for one's career, because still, he/she needs to be professionally good at only one discipline, which the person will be working on throughout their career.\n\nThe most ultimate reason for studying many disciplines is that it prevents one from truly learning something, no matter what it is.

Therefore, we can sum up that it is more important to grasp concepts while at school than to merely register facts and forget them later on.\n\nThe endless chapters on history often fail to teach us what we are supposed to 'learn.' For example, Alexander the Great was a great conqueror. He conquered endlessly. However, being murdered and left was what led him to the almighty. Here we need to appreciate his dynamism and heroism, not failing to see the other side of the coin, that is, he was overconfident and was consumed by his own avarice to conquer.\n\nWe need to formulate our education system where students can develop their mental capacity. A developed individual would be self-confident, reliable, and a good human being. In this context, the earlier system of education in India is worth having a look at. The then schools, called 'gurukuls,' meaning 'house of the teacher,' were considered sacred and holy. Students would focus more on learning and understanding. Of course, they were taught facts, but they knew how to use them and gain knowledge as well, which is the ultimate aim of education.

In today's society, many companies exist, and they produce numerous products. As a result, companies tend to draw people to buy their goods. In this sense, advertisements are one of the best ways to increase selling rates. To illustrate, every day, people are surrounded by a countless number of advertisements. To hold people's attention, the functions of goods in advertisements are portrayed differently from their original functions. My mother is a case in point. She often suffers from bad flu and buys medicine after watching medical advertisements. However, she always fails to find effective medicine for her flu.

As illustrated above, most advertisements deceive people to a certain degree regarding the functions of products for more profits.\n\nWhat is more, the time for advertisements is dramatically short, and companies have to give people impressions about their products in this short time.

These programs include activities such as cleaning side roads, collecting charitable donations, and engaging in different socially responsible endeavors. Based on research conducted by a leading consulting firm in Europe, it was shown that 5% of a young person's time is being dedicated to assisting their local communities.\n\nSecondly, social responsibility and helping communities is becoming a very hot topic in the corporate world. This phenomenon has extended its effect beyond the corporate world to involve the rest of society. Therefore, many people are becoming more aware of the importance of being socially responsible; hence, they are starting to convey the benefits of being socially responsible to younger people (i.e., their kids, students, dependents, etc.).\n\nFinally, many youth groups are being used as great examples of time dedication in helping communities. Not only their own communities but also international communities. For example, a group of kids from France gathered their toys and other belongings and sent them to Lebanon to help the children who were displaced from their homes because of the current Israeli-Lebanese conflict."}

But are you happy only when you have fun? I do not think so. I believe that at each stage of your existence, you 'enjoy life' in a different way.\n\nFirst, when you are young, you have no children. One can consider that, as he has no constraints such as feeding his offspring, he is enjoying life more. But I think that I will be deeply happy when my child grows up and becomes an autonomous human being. At that time, despite all the constraints, I think that I will 'enjoy life'.\n\nIn addition, when you are young, even if you entertain yourself by playing tennis, for example, you cannot do everything you want. You have to respect your parents' rules. Being an adult allows you to choose your activities and experience new leisure. For example, my mother used to prevent me from swimming because she was afraid of water. I discovered this sport quite late, but now I really enjoy it. Moreover, when you are older, you start appreciating new activities. When I was young, I found the idea of watching paintings for hours highly bizarre. But now, I am fond of art exhibitions! In the meantime, I learned to enjoy life in a different manner.\n\nBeing older also enables you to have a professional life. You can manage to reach great achievements and be financially rewarded for it. When I received my first income, I was really happy! The idea of making money just using my brain still thrills me. It is a way of enjoying life that I never thought about when I was at my early ages.\n\nIn a nutshell, I think that being happy and enjoying life is not a matter of age. It is more an ability to enjoy the best moments and learn from the worst. I hope to be happy with such a philosophy of life!"}
{"file_id": "1058201.txt", "output_essay": "Broadening knowledge of many academic subjects is much better than specializing in one specific subject, in my opinion. Not only because it will be more interesting, but also because people will benefit more if the subjects are varied.\n\nThe main reason that broadening knowledge is more helpful is that people will be aware of many things in this world. They can expand their knowledge in an easy way, too. If the subjects are limited, a lot of people won't care to know about other things in the world or in the kingdom in which we live. They will be satisfied to have the information that is circulated around the environment they live in. I can't judge and say that all people will have poor knowledge, but I'm sure that the majority won't have that good knowledge. In other words, our society will be weak.\n\nAlso, if knowledge is limited to only one subject, scientists wouldn't have reached the success which they have today. For example, if Newton didn't bother to expand his research on gravity and stayed on figuring out why the apple had fallen toward the ground, I don't think he would have known the formula of gravity at all. He could have spent his whole life thinking alone and not knowing the reason for gravity. I think that his effort in studying every single detail made him conclude the concept of gravity.\n\nIf I were given the choice in any university or in any school whether to study only my major or have additional subjects, I would choose to study both my major and other additional subjects. That way, I will be not only well-educated but also my mind will have a good understanding of the world in which I'm living."}

More and more people from Asian countries are able to buy a car, and they do so. And this is just today. Probably in twenty years, people from Africa will also be able to buy cars, so a greater need will be there on the market.\n\nSecondly, the automotive industry develops new cars each year. This tendency to create nicer and fancier models from year to year will probably continue. The public responds excitedly to it. Just have a look at the crowded exhibitions like the IAA or Geneva Salon. People from all classes come there to watch the cars, and they are fascinated. So, in spite of not having enough money to buy a certain car, people tend to do so anyway. This is shown in the statistics of car dealers, which show that more and more cars are not paid for when bought, but on a monthly basis afterwards.\n\nThere might be some critical voices stating that there will be some laws in future days to cut the use of cars extremely in order to protect the environment. Being an engineer in the automotive industry, I do not believe that might occur. Teams of experts spend hours day by day to improve the cars, to make them more efficient and to reduce the amount of poison that comes out of the exhaust. To be prepared for the days when oil will become a rare commodity, engineers are already thinking about methods of building new engines that work without oil.\n\nSo, to summarize my statements, it cannot be said that there will be fewer cars in twenty years than today. For reasons such as general wealth development, no political restrictions due to better technology, and mainly because people will be just as fascinated as today by the new cars developed by the automotive industry."}
{"file_id": "1053480.txt", "output_essay": "In this essay, I am going to discuss whether I agree with the question or not. One idea suggests that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts, while another posits that learning facts is more beneficial. I support the former idea. Understanding ideas and concepts is crucial for students because, in order to discover something new, they must first grasp the basic concepts and ideas. Learning facts is part of the process, but comprehending ideas and concepts is paramount.\n\nIn the academic world, particularly at universities, we are taught that grasping concepts and ideas is essential because it enables us to understand facts and use them more effectively for the benefit of humanity.\n\nConsider an electrical engineering student who aims to innovate in the field of transistor technology. Transistors are devices used in all electronic equipment. If the student focuses solely on facts without understanding the underlying ideas and concepts, they cannot become an engineer. Engineers must be innovative and think creatively. To invent something new, one must thoroughly understand the concepts and ideas.\n\nIn the realm of communication, consider how mobile phones were not widely used 15 years ago, yet today, everyone uses cellular phones. Technology has become more efficient over time. If engineers and students only memorize facts without grasping the underlying ideas and concepts, they will be unable to advance technological levels. By understanding the concepts, they can share information, and technology can be utilized more effectively.\n\nIn conclusion, I want to reiterate that understanding ideas and concepts is more important for students than merely learning facts. If a student wishes to innovate, they must be familiar with the ideas and concepts. In my opinion, if they only learn facts, they cannot introduce anything new. This is the approach to academic learning taught at universities. They emphasize the importance of using ideas and concepts as a way of learning. Through this approach, we can learn facts, but if only facts are taught, there will be no advancement in humanity or technology; diverse opinions are necessary."}
{"file_id": "1054730.txt", "output_essay": "There are two ways to train for work and life. One of these is specializing in one specific subject, while the other is studying to have a broad knowledge. In my opinion, each of these methods has some advantages and some disadvantages, but the second is the best.\n\nAs regards the first possibility, that of having specific knowledge, I think that the most important advantage is that those with specialized education have a high possibility of finding a job, a well-rewarding job, in the field where they have studied in depth. Indeed, nowadays, firms and companies look for people who can provide sensible help to the firm. Students who are well-prepared are a competitive factor that allows firms to earn much money.\n\nOn the other hand, people or students who have a wide range of interests, who study different subjects, have the possibility to use the information they gather during their training to create a good social life. Moreover, I think that these people are more flexible in changing their work during their life.\n\nFor these reasons, even if at first glance, the first kind of knowledge could seem better, I think that, especially in the long term, for example, during one's entire life, the second kind of knowledge is more useful for people.\n\nI think so because I chose to study a subject in depth, that is, management engineering, and I study this subject in depth to make myself more competitive than other students in the job world. When I have some free time, I prefer not to spend it reading because I'm very tired from my work at university. But when I meet people studying something different from economic, mechanical, or industrial subjects, and I talk with them about something they have discussed in class or they have read in a magazine, I always feel that I'm incomplete, my education is incomplete, because even if I'm clever, I don't have the basic information to express my opinion about the topic. So I think that everyone should spend part of the day reading magazines, journals, and so on in order to have a rewarding life."}
{"file_id": "1054917.txt", "output_essay": "Nowadays, it is important when applying to a university to consider whether to study generally or specialize in a certain subject. Before applying, students should take the following aspects into consideration.\n\nFirstly, it is often mentioned that being a specialist in a certain area makes it easier to apply for the position you are exactly trained for at an organization once you finish university. However, having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects gives you the possibility to apply for a wider range of job ads. Being generalistic offers you a way to enter a company more easily. Once you have received the job, you still can, and you even have to, no matter being a specialist or a generalist, adapt to the needs of the company you are working for.\n\nSecondly, it is argued that specializing in a certain field does not take the same time as studying the basics of many different areas. To some limited extent, there is some truth in it, but, undoubtedly, experience shows that no matter what way of studying you have chosen, the time until achieving a degree is the same. Nevertheless, doing a generalistic degree is, in my point of view, better than completing a specific degree that takes the same time. In other words, your possibilities are much broader after the study time finding a job than they would be only being specialized. And the time you have spent remains the same.\n\nTo summarize, students should first of all be aware of the consequences when considering applying after they have obtained a degree in a specific subject. Furthermore, they should mistrust the rumor that studying with the objective to get a broad knowledge of many academic subjects takes the same time as it would achieving a specific degree."}
{"file_id": "1050622.txt", "output_essay": "In today's professional and academic world, it is important to have profound knowledge of a specific subject to be able to deal with the specialized tasks one is confronted with. Students should achieve profound expertise in a special area. However, one should be aware of the following: The question of whether a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is preferable to specialization in one specific subject can mislead the discussion. Actually, specialized knowledge on its own won't be enough to deal with the needs employees and researchers are faced with nowadays. To put it precisely: Your expertise in a specific subject must be accompanied by at least some broad knowledge of related academic subjects and common topics in general.\n\nToday, our society is a very complex and fast-moving entity. That is why it is impossible for a single person to have useful knowledge in all areas of academic research. Therefore, it is important to have a specific academic field in which one develops profound expertise. By doing this, one is able to understand the complexity of the subject concerned and follow the innovations in this area. This wouldn't be possible if one had a broad but purely superficial knowledge of a wide range of subjects. In this case, one's understanding of each single subject wouldn't be sufficient to solve the tasks and problems that could arise. Furthermore, our society, as well as the academic world, is moving very fast. It would be impossible to be up to date in a wide range of subjects. But being up to date is a key qualification in our times. In this context, it doesn't matter if one is talking about technical, economic, social, or political issues.

{"file_id": "1060401.txt", "output_essay": "It all depends on what enjoying life means for people, to live or to live in excess, as much the better. I believe that young people enjoy life if that means going to parks or beaches and practicing extreme and difficult sports. Young people can stay up late at night, drinking or dancing, but they also can wake up early in the morning and go to work. They don't have limits on how much risk and danger they take. Many young people receive economic support from their parents, and that gives them more time to enjoy. Parents always try to give their kids the lifestyle they never enjoyed. Society and the process of evolution in technology also give young people an advantage to experience new ways of enjoying life. Young people don't focus too much on the future; they just want to live and enjoy the present.\n\nOn the other hand, there are the older people who feel the weight of life in their bodies. Even if they take good care of their bodies, older people can't practice sports or have a social life for long periods of time. Sometimes that's not really important because everything in excess is bad. Older people see life from another point of view. They do the same as young people but not with the same intensity. They discover the beauty of life and develop the quality of looking for the detail. The detail gives you the ability to recognize when someone or something is special. Seeing the quality versus quantity when you give or receive is an art that needs to be cultivated. The precious reality in this situation is that everyone is going to experience both sides of human nature at some point in their life. I am a 37-year-old male with a Latin tradition. I love my Lord Jesus and believe that at this point in my life, I stand with the older people. I prefer quality over quantity."}
{"file_id": "1053966.txt", "output_essay": "I do agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. It is a known fact that in today's society, the word 'community' is not as common anymore. It surely still has a strong meaning in villages or small towns, but if you look at bigger cities, you will find most people living alone without even knowing their neighbors' names.\n\nEspecially young people are not involved in the communities, so actually giving time to helping their communities probably does not occur to them at all. One problem is definitely that young people already grow into a society that does not really care about community anymore. So they do not really have a chance to learn how to be part of a society, and that being part of a society, in this case, a community, also involves being motivated to give something back to it.\n\nOf course, they are supposed to learn it at school, but if the parents do not care, then the children will likely keep it the same way. Another problem is that young people often have a lot of other stuff on their minds, like going to town with friends or to a disco. Working for your community is not really considered as 'cool,' and your friends might even start making fun of you if you start giving your free time to help your community.\n\nLastly, helping your community normally means working for it as a volunteer, so you will not gain any money for it. Many young people who want to finance their lives or have a bit extra will invest their time doing something they will be paid for.\n\nAll these reasons show why young people do not invest enough time into their communities. But it would be so important that they do so. First of all, your community is not just a couple of people living at the same place on this planet, but it can be a wonderful social network that might help you in hard times. But if you want to be part of it, you will have to get to know the people and be part of the team. That is only possible if you show that you are interested in your community and really try to be part of it. Communities also have a lot of financial problems. So they need volunteers working for them so everybody can maintain the standard of living people now have. Young people tend to believe things would just be given to them without thinking about the work behind it. If the people giving time to their communities become fewer, things will start to disappear. Probably young people then will wonder where the bus went that drove kids to school or where the mall comes from where there used to be a park. All these reasons make it so important that young people start to learn how to be an active part of a community and why it is so important that they start giving time to helping their communities."}
{"file_id": "1058104.txt", "output_essay": "In my opinion, young and older people enjoy life equally but in different ways. Being young or older has advantages but also disadvantages. First of all, when you are young, you do not have the same pleasures as when you are old. On one hand, when you are young, you enjoy your life at the current moment. Indeed, during your studies, you prefer to go out with friends, to do sports, and to discover new things by traveling. However, on the other hand, when you are older, you enjoy different aspects of life. Indeed, you may want to get married, have children, buy a nice house, go on holidays with your family, and succeed at work.\n\nSecondly, the responsibilities of a student are totally different compared to an older person. Indeed, as a student, you do not have many responsibilities because in most cases, you do not have a child to take care of and you depend slightly on your parents who help you financially. The main responsibility of a student is to achieve good marks and to succeed in their studies. When you are older, you have many more responsibilities. If you have a family, you have to take care of them by working, buying food, paying bills, etc. Having responsibilities as an adult may enable them to enjoy life less. However, having responsibilities can be a good thing for some adults because it makes them feel useful.\n\nFinally, young people can enjoy life less than older people do because they generally have less money. If you are a student, it is more difficult for you to go on holidays or to go regularly to the cinema. In most cases, students have to work and attend university at the same time in order to pay for their entertainment and their education. Conversely, older people do not have to work and study at the same time and generally, they have a better salary.\n\nTo conclude, whether you are a student or an adult, you enjoy life differently because your life situation is different."}
{"file_id": "1045426.txt", "output_essay": "There is no consensus among people regarding the argument that it is beneficial for a group to travel led by a guide. With an increasing number of people claiming that it has many disadvantages, some more sensible individuals tend to consider the notion that traveling with a guide is amazing. This latter point coincides with mine for the reasons below:\n\nFirstly, we can never remain suspicious of the fact that traveling with a tour guide has an extremely positive effect on the mood of the group members. For instance, statistics indicate that 70 percent of people who have the experience of traveling with a guide will have a good mood. Another example is when I often travel with my parents, and we always travel with a guide. Because of the professional knowledge the guide has obtained, he can arrange our activity schedule, and we do not have to worry about anything. What we should do is just watch and enjoy the charming views passing by. Travel is so easy; we never feel tired because we can focus our mood on the beauty of the scenery. Thus, the trip becomes happy and easy without worrying about where we should go or what the most famous place is because we can learn everything from the guide. It is so cool, and the group members will have more time to chat with each other.\n\nFurthermore, it is no exaggeration to say that traveling with a guide has a huge influence not just on the mood we have, but on our finances as well. For example, without a guide, we are likely to buy something useless but attractive at the moment. However, if a tour guide accompanies our group, it will not be an issue. Once, our family went to Qingdao, which is a charming seaside town with charming views where the seabirds sing in the sunshine. We were so attracted by it that when a man sold some seafood, we were tempted because at that moment we forgot everything but the amazing view. At that time, the guide stopped us because he thought the price of the seafood was too high. With his advice, we were alerted. Thus, thanks to his help, we saved a lot of money to buy something useful. Therefore, traveling with a guide has many benefits that can influence us financially.\n\nAs we have discussed above, we can safely draw the conclusion that traveling with a guide not only helps us obtain a good mood but can also save our money. Therefore, it is high time that we raise public awareness of the significance of the guide. Only in this way can we ensure a wonderful journey with other group members."}

{"file_id": "1046103.txt", "output_essay": "The issue at hand is whether successful people should take risks or do what they already know how to do well. The issue is important because we are faced with a lot of daily 'risks' in this manner. I believe that one should try new things and explore all the opportunities around him/her. I believe this because life is full of risks, and if someone (a successful person) does not take any risks, then he/she will end up losing/missing a lot of good opportunities that life brings in.\n\nFirst of all, I believe that all the risks generally offer a great benefit in return. If one does not want to take any risk, he/she will receive no benefits. For example, a bank offers you a new type of bond which can bring you an additional income of $1000 per year. That is great! Why not go get it, and go for a $100 'safe type' because 'you already know how to do it well.' In my opinion, a person who goes for $100 is not aware of his/her abilities, and it is a shame not to take a risk. In my view, a successful person would never miss it, and that is why they are called successful!\n\nSecondly, life is full of risks and one cannot be successful by choosing to stay conservative. Every day, life brings in thousands of new opportunities to a lot of people, and most of those opportunities can add beauties to your life (of course, not everything is related to money). For example, take a risk and join a good club to meet new people: beauties can be in terms of friendships, why not? That is why I believe that a person who always goes for what he/she already knows can never discover new opportunities in life, but a successful person utilizes these opportunities in all the good ways.\n\nFinally, in my opinion, successful people do not lose opportunities. When one observes, I believe that one can, in fact, detect successful people by detecting their risk-taking behaviors. Successful people are generally the ones who not only take but 'catch' more risks.\n\nTo summarize, I would like to say and suggest that everyone should take more risks to be more successful. Taking risks will always bring them better things in many ways that will make them successful. If Napoleon Bonaparte were alive, I believe he would say 'risk, risk, risk, success, success, success' instead of 'money, money, money.'"}

However, I have other opinions on why there will be more cars on the road instead of a decline.\n\nFirst, people try to have their own car personally, not just one in a family. In a family, for example, the father needs his car to go to his workplace. The mother needs her car to go to her workplace. Even though she does not have a job, she also needs a car to pick up her kids or go shopping. There is also demand from children when they grow up and become of age to own a car; when they go to college. As a result, all members need one. Therefore, each person needs a car. As a result, there is an increase in cars in society.\n\nSecond, the trend of living a little distance from the workplace increases the demand for cars. Nowadays, people in Korea, and internationally also, prefer to live 30 minutes to 1 hour distance from their work. This means they need automobiles to go to their work. For instance, my professor, who lives one hour's distance from college, has her own car. She comes to school every morning using her car, not the subway.\n\nIt is true that there is an increasing number of people who use public transportation to save money, oil, or etc. However, this does not mean they do not have a car. They have their own car but just use public transportation in order to save money. When they run out of time, when they feel too tired to wait for the bus, or when they want to go somewhere where public transportation does not go, they will take out their personal car and drive.\n\nTherefore, the need for owning a car for each person, and the trend of moving a distance from the workplace, make for an increase in car demand. Furthermore, even though some people use public transportation, they surely possess a car. As a result, there will be more cars on the road than now."}

But as the saying goes, 'All that glitters is not gold,' the same can be applied to successful people as well. The fundamental cause of this problem is not in the people we talk about, but it's within us. It is because we always measure a successful person only when his/her work achieves more recognition, fame, or money and that he/she is really worth something, which most of us are not. Thus, it's very hard to judge and measure success in terms of money, fame, or recognition, as for him it's just a task he wanted to accomplish for himself.\n\nLet's consider a sport, say soccer. We know that some of the players play very well compared to the rest of the players of that game, but in reality, they only play those games which they practiced for years without having to gain success in other games. The very same way, we cannot just say the founder of Microsoft has been a very successful person as he did not do anything apart from being in the business of providing software for computers. I wonder how much knowledge or expertise he would have in the area of mining; the same would be the case in the designer ware and clothing segment of business. Interestingly, there was an argument that Walmart or the other chain stores should be considered successful people. I would opine against the people as well in terms of success, as what they had been doing is that of selling.\n\nI definitely would have said someone successful if he would have achieved a good name and money in the area of selling, also gaining the same momentum in other areas such as manufacturing and in research.

{"file_id": "1052180.txt", "output_essay": "This topic reminds us of the popular question: 'Which is better: quantity or quality?' The essay will focus on the advantages and disadvantages of having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects versus being specialized in a particular one.\n\nThe first part of our essay will enumerate and explain the advantages of each approach, and the second part will discuss the disadvantages. Elementary and secondary education is mostly about teaching a variety of subjects rather than specializing in one. It gives students the opportunity to have an idea of different fields of study and also gives them a variety of choices for their future career or post-secondary education. In many cases, the student has enough time to see if they would choose a particular option or career orientation. For example, a student who takes physics and biology has various career choices: they could decide to go into the technical or engineering field or the medical field.\n\nOn the other hand, a student who focuses on a particular subject will definitely excel in it in the future because of the time spent studying it. This is particularly true for students in technical schools, who choose their career option from the elementary or secondary level. A student who attends an aviation maintenance school from his secondary level would have all the necessary tools to succeed in aeronautical engineering, for example.\n\nRecalling the popular saying 'Jack of all trades, master of none': we see that students who focus on too many subjects end up not mastering any. Having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects could lead to confusion also when the time comes to choose a specialization. On the other hand, being specialized in only one subject reduces or limits your options for a future career and also exposes you to economic and geographical changes. After specializing in only one subject and if the career is no longer attractive, we will be forced to change orientation and start afresh. An example of a student who specializes in nursing from the secondary level would only end up enrolling for a nursing degree. In conclusion, we would say that what is better depends greatly on the individual and their ability to use what they have learned."}
{"file_id": "1055820.txt", "output_essay": "The word 'advertisement' comes from the root 'advert,' which means 'to draw attention.' The central motive of all advertisements is, in fact, to get considerable attention. And the advertisements generally go beyond simple enumeration of product features. They try to make a product look much better than it really is. I totally agree with the statement.\n\nWhile advertisements today are much more sophisticated than they were a few decades ago, the chief theme of an advertisement has always been to get more public attention so that the products could sell better. Initially, in the '70s or '80s, only the features of a product and customer testimonials were greatly exaggerated. This made a product look much better than it really was. Inflated customer testimonials helped create a sense of a happy consumer. While such techniques were already creating a sense of false product perception, it is only in the past one or two decades that advertising has become so complex and sophisticated. People, children and adults, are beguiled by the aura that 'modern advertisement' creates about a product. This aura is better known as 'The Brand' among marketing and advertising firms.\n\nThese modern advertisements basically create implicit associations of certain product types with certain behaviors in the consumers' minds. Associations like - if you drive 'Car Z8,' you are cool. Or if you use certain perfumes, you will be much more attractive to the opposite sex. These associations create illusions in front of consumers, hence ensuring that they cannot make rational and logical choices about products. Moreover, with such advertising, it is no longer necessary for a product to be good in order to be commercially successful. A regular garment line with similar designs could command twice the price with a celebrity endorsement. Such techniques ensure that consumers and the manufacturing companies ignore what is really important - the product, and not its aura.\n\nAlso, this false image contributes to what is called mad consumerism. People getting insane to get certain products is not good for society. With advertisements and branding, people are sometimes unable to separate the wheat from the chaff. What is really important and what is just fake.\n\nI strongly believe that advertisements make a product look much better using various methods. However, such marketing does harm to society in general, and consumers in particular."}

And we can't live anywhere without seeing cars running on streets, whereas we can use some alternative transportation such as trains, tubes, and motorbikes. Many people have started walking or cycling to work or schools, caring for their health. Using cars regularly or using another way to transport, both of them have their advantages. It's difficult to guess whether in twenty years there will be fewer cars or not. But if I had to predict our life in twenty years, I wouldn't say there would be fewer cars than now. I disagree with the idea the test had given me. There are some reasons underneath.\n\nFirstly, having cars is one of the popular habits among men. After working hard to earn enough money to buy a cool car, they show off how cool the cars they have bought by driving through cities. It might be like their dream to buy a good car.\n\nSecondly, Toyota, which is known as the leading company in Japan, has been making a big profit and provides Japan with a lot of profits. Now we can say it's necessary for our economy in Japan. In short, we can see the fact that there will still be lots of demand in twenty years.\n\nThirdly, for families, I'll recommend going on trips by car because it helps them feel closer more than staying at home. On holiday, even if they get stuck in a traffic jam, they can have a good conversation. Using cars is a good enjoyment.\n\nIn conclusion, for those reasons above, I disagree with the idea the question gave me. Of course, on the other hand, we have to think about our environment more carefully."}

In my opinion, however, I disagree with this. I think it is better to specialize in one specific subject. Having broad knowledge of many academic subjects can lead to many negative results.\n\nFirstly, if you want to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects, you must spend much more time working hard. You will have to give up many other important things. You will not have enough time to play sports, and your health may suffer. Additionally, you will not have enough time to communicate with your family and friends. You will feel lonely after a long period.\n\nSecondly, even if you have spent so much time working hard and you have broad knowledge of many academic subjects, you will probably only know some basic information about many subjects and not be proficient in one particular area. For example, consider a physician who knows a lot about history, computers, plants, and so on. He must not have enough time to study his medical knowledge, so he will not be a good physician. Moreover, if everyone has broad knowledge of many academic subjects, they can do all kinds of jobs but they cannot do them very well.\n\nIn conclusion, I think people should have specialized knowledge in one specific subject and review broad knowledge of many academic subjects but not spend too much time on them. Broad knowledge can give you more ideas about your special subject."}

There are two reasons that I think so.\n\nOne of the reasons is that our populations are increasing in number because of the population explosion all over the world. This is to say, our population is 6.0 billion right now, and it will increase to 6.5 billion in twenty years or less. Therefore, the car usage percentage will increase in number.\n\nAnother reason is that our social attitudes toward young people have changed. Comparing the past with now, the latter is much more liberal to young people. As long as 50 years ago, in many countries, cars were driven by men, not women, but nowadays a lot of women drive cars because of the social change from conservative to liberal. The age at which people are able to get their driver's license differs from country to country, and in some countries, young people who are 16 years old are able to get their driver's license. With the social change, some of our countries might adopt such a law.\n\nFor these reasons, I don't agree that we will have fewer cars in the future. However, even though we may have more cars, the fuel will totally change, from oil to electricity or something like that."}

Generally, I think that a man's finest hour comes when he has worked hard for years and years, to finally discover that he was right in his life and so were the things he had worked toward, and this discovery happens when he finally lies on his battlefield, exhausted, but victorious. Homer said that men become more tired of drinking, dancing, and making love than making war: so he would say that men are always at war, and only the dead saw the end of it, not because they are bad or barbarians, but because they enjoy living their life on the edge, to take on each day, to demonstrate they are victorious. I think this is the meaning of 'enjoy life': to take part every day in new competitions, going away victorious, in the end. Now, I'm not able to say when occurs our best hour, it may happen when we're old or when we are young, the important thing is to enjoy this moment. Young boys, probably, live their lives and don't think too much about the far future, when they will be old, like De'Medici said in his poems. Contrary to this argument, we can say that old people have a heavy bag full of cultural notions and experience, and they think much more about the things they have to do, caring not only for themselves but for all the people they have around and with whom they have relationships. In ancient times they said: 'Only the good die young', but this thinking was strictly joined to a pagan vision of the world and life. Now it is the culture of the Christians that found its way to rule the world, and we can say that we have not only a heroic youth but also a respectable middle or old age: this period of life is not yet rated like the autumn. We can enjoy life in every period of our lives in the same manner, it doesn't matter how many years you carry on."}

Even though most people enjoy their life in their own way, I agree with the claim that young people enjoy life more than older people do.\n\nThere are various reasons for the opinion I share. Firstly, young people are much healthier and more energetic in contrast to older people. A lot of activities that an individual may enjoy require physical energy. This physical energy diminishes with age in most people. They have to worry about their health at all times since it deteriorates with age. They might have a particular activity that they enjoy, but it may be restricted due to different reasons. For example, an older person who enjoys listening to good music may have a problem with his hearing due to age. Such people are highly dependent on medication, which has its share of side effects, such as drowsiness, etc. On the contrary, young people have all the energy in the world to enjoy. They do not get tired easily. They are very enthusiastic and in the best of health most of the time. Their lifestyle is at a faster pace as compared to the older generation.\n\nYoungsters can indulge in adventure sports, traveling, partying, eating, and drinking without any restrictions, which would be troublesome for the aged. Secondly, young people are far more independent than older people. They are not dependent on somebody to take care of them, nor are they dependent on asking someone to drive them somewhere. Moreover, the older generation spends a lot of time worrying about trivial issues and restricts themselves from experimenting. They are more orthodox in comparison to the younger generation and consider a lot of things that youngsters refer to as enjoyment as taboo. The older generation by far has more value for money, and they believe in saving it for a later day. Youngsters, on the other hand, may use up that money for luxury or for a pleasure activity that will assure them a feeling of fun and happiness.\n\nI conclude the essay by restating my opinion that young people enjoy life more, and I'm sure most older people would also claim to having enjoyed more in their youth."}
{"file_id": "1061522.txt", "output_essay": "I do agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. Advertisements are produced to promote a product and to make it sell better. So, what do we do if we want people to buy our product? We try to tell them that our product is the best choice on the market, which may not be true, but people need to believe it to choose our product. That is the reason why many advertisements make their products seem much better than they actually are. In our everyday lives, we are confronted with many examples. My favorite example is the washing powder advertisements on television. Wouldn't it be wonderful to put your clothes in the washing machine and when taking them out again, all the ugly stains are gone and the clothes look newer than before? I have tried several times, but it just does not work. So there, the advertisements definitely make the washing powder seem much better than it is. Another product that has to be incredible according to advertisements, are energy bars for sports. You do not only get superhuman power and condition, but the bar supposedly turns your outer appearance into an athlete's body. 'This is much cheaper than the fitness studio,' I thought and tried. But again, I was disappointed. Neither did my condition improve, nor did my body shape change. Disillusioned by advertisements' promises, I resigned, until recently, when I heard Ovomaltine's new publicity. The advertisement for the chocolate powder to flavor your milk does not claim to make you stronger, but more enduring. It says: 'Ovomaltine - not better, but longer.' So this is the one and only exception I have seen in my life, where an advertisement does not make a product seem much better than it is."}

He learns rules, such as standing straight and in line before entering a class, or not walking around while the teacher is giving a lesson. These rules are transferred to him before the notion of good and bad; he understands the consequences of his actions earlier than the reasons for their necessity and acts consequently. In our school systems, learning prevails over assimilating, at least at the beginning.\n\nThe expectations necessarily evolve with the age of the students. In higher grades, it becomes almost impossible to learn by heart without understanding. Assimilating a concept is likely to develop the cleverness of a student, while learning will only fill his memory. As school is supposed to teach children how to think, learning becomes of lesser importance from a certain age.\n\nYet, learning is still necessary for exams, for proving one's ability to memorize combined with one's intelligence. Also, as it is the only means by which one can assess a student's motivation at work and ability to memorize, learning cannot be neglected as a key factor in a student's success and in the whole school system.\n\nFor a student's personal development, understanding concepts and ideas is obviously more important and almost necessary, but it doesn't suppress the learning part, which is much more easily assessed on a copy, for example.\n\nThis raises the question of the role of school. Indeed, if it is only supposed to insert people into their future professions, the ability to learn fast and a lot prevails inevitably. But school is also supposed to be the fundamental pillar of a nation, as it structures people's minds and is therefore essential in a democracy, for example."}
{"file_id": "1056329.txt", "output_essay": "Advertisements are everywhere: on TV, in shopping malls, and in newspapers. Each brand and product seems to be the best in its category. But do advertisers tell the truth, or do they lie or exaggerate about their \"perfect\" products? This is exactly what the given statement addresses.\n\nI agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. Take laundry detergents, for example. Every brand claims to be the best, promising to make your clothes look like new and to remove every single stain. They compete by comparing their products to one another, and their product is always touted as better than their competitors'. However, I believe this is not true. Some advertisements claim that their detergents don't bleach your clothes and that they will still look like new after 30 wash cycles. But no detergent can truly fulfill this promise.\n\nAnother example is shampoo. If you were to trust the advertisements, every shampoo could make your hair shiny, strong, and no longer greasy. But this is so far from the truth. Shampoos often don't meet consumers' expectations.\n\nMy last example is cigarettes. Advertisements portray cigarettes as something that can make you feel free, happy when you are sad, and even transport you to another world. But is this really true? Aren't there any disadvantages or even dangers?\n\nOf course, there are! Only a few years ago, no cigarette advertisement disclosed that cigarettes could affect your health or that they could cause cancer, sometimes resulting in death. Today, they warn customers in advertisements and even on cigarette boxes, but the warnings are usually written in very small print and are often ignored or not noticed by consumers. Some consumers even take these warnings ironically.\n\nIn conclusion, you always have to be aware that advertisers are trying to sell their product to make a lot of money. That's why they sometimes exaggerate or even lie about what their products can do. You should be careful and buy different products to compare them to one another and to consider how they might harm you or others. Only then will you find out which products are the best for you or which products you shouldn't buy because of their potential harm."}

It is because technology now is much better than before, young people are too happy, and the effect of the media is significant.\n\nThe technology we have today is way better than it was 10 or 15 years ago, and young people have more entertainment in their lives. The downside is that most young people spend most of their time engaging with these forms of entertainment, such as TV, video games, MP3s, and computers. Compared to the older days, people would be more helpful in their communities since they did not have as much entertainment. They would spend a whole afternoon in a community center to help and learn. Young people now spend most of their time in front of a computer or TV instead of helping their communities because there are too many appealing alternatives.\n\nMoreover, not caring about other people is the point of view that young people mostly have now. It is because they have not been through hard times in their lives since birth. They are too content, and so they do not see the need to help others. Older people would spend time helping others because they know that even a little help can be a gift for some people. Thus, young people do not spend a lot of time helping their communities because they do not realize that their help could be a great reward for some people.\n\nFinally, the attitude of young people is a problem as well. If the media encouraged them, there would be a lot of helpers in the world. The media is the pathway that young people relate to the most, so if the media encouraged young people to spend time helping their communities and told them that many people need help, they would likely spend more time helping.\n\nTherefore, the improvement of technology, the current attitudes in society, and the effect of the media are the most important factors that cause young people not to give enough time to help their communities."}

However, each stage differs from the others in terms of enjoyment, where some people say that young people enjoy life more than older people do, and it's true to say that.\n\nFor young people, we can see that they enjoy life more than the older because they are still young and new to exploring life. They have new things to see, learn, and enjoy. They are free to go wherever they want and will have many new opportunities to choose their path in life, make friends, go out partying, and participate in real life. For instance, they can join service groups or political groups, share in the political life, and have their opinions. They will decide what they want to be in their future life, such as an engineer, so they will join the university. Afterward, they will dream about their future life, and they will really enjoy life when they fall in love, dreaming about starting a family. Thus, they will have many things to enjoy and to share with others.\n\nAt the same time, older people enjoy life in many ways. They will reminisce about their own lives that have passed and the things they did. They will see their family growing up and will be especially happy when they hold their children's children.

At the same time, they may have problems, but they will still enjoy life with what remains.\n\nFinally, whether young or old, people will enjoy their life in different ways, but we can say that young people enjoy life more than older people do because they have many different ways to enjoy it that older people may not have."}

For example, in World War II, some countries said that their country did the right thing, and on the other hand, their enemies said that they were just defending their country, so they were right. I can give more examples, but I want to try to explain this example; if you want to do something, you have to have a reason, so it cannot change from person to person, so it is real.\n\nBut everybody has an angle to look at the situation.

Although I think it is not always true, and each case should be considered apart, I agree with this statement for several different reasons. Nowadays, we are living in a world much more competitive than the one in the past; furthermore, families today are normally composed only of parents and children, and this fact doesn't help young people to develop their sense of community.\n\nFirst of all, the world where we are living is getting more and more complex: for a young person, it is more difficult today to achieve his or her goals, to have a successful career and a good job in order to provide safety to his or her new family. This fact implies that today there is generally not enough time to spend on taking care of someone else, like their communities.\n\nThe second problem is related to the normal structure of a family. Living in such a small unit doesn't permit the development, from childhood, of a sense of community and solidarity for other persons.\n\nIf someone is used to living in a family with many brothers and sisters, and also grandparents, uncles, and aunts, he or she would be maybe more sensitive to the problems of others.\n\nIn conclusion, I have to agree with the statement that says that today young people don't spend much time on helping their communities for the reasons that I explained before. I've said 'I HAVE to agree' because I think this is not a positive fact, and it gives a bad idea about young people, but, with regret, I have to say that this is the truth."}
{"file_id": "1053319.txt", "output_essay": "Unfortunately, I have to agree with the statement that nowadays young people do not invest enough time to help their communities. In my opinion, a possible reason for this development might be the lack of a strong incentive for young people to spend their precious free time helping the community instead of, maybe, hanging out with their friends, playing video games, etc. As cities grow and become more anonymous, young people do not see the reward of their work in the community as they would in a smaller one where everyone knows each other, and the youth would get more appreciation for their voluntary work. This is, of course, a misconception because volunteering for a good cause is appreciated in both environments; it just may not be as obvious to the young people. So the question is: What do the youth do with the time that they once spent on helping their communities?\n\nThey spend it on activities that they simply find more pleasurable. In fact, this is a trend that we can detect in all layers of society and in all ages; we do not need to search for this phenomenon among young people only. Of course, it is more fun going to the cinema than helping elderly members of the community. So what we need is incentives. We could get incentives from the parents, helping their kids realize at a young age that it is important to take responsibility and help out in the community at least every once in a while, depending on the child. Small activities done for the community may be more important and more valued than one might think, and every kind of work is strongly welcomed and appreciated.\n\nThe community itself must have a strong core in order to create networks and to attract young people through, for example, specific institutions and activities only for the young. I say this because I believe that only if young people can identify themselves with their community, at least to a certain extent, will they be willing to become an active member and help by investing a bit of their work as well."}

Advertisements play a tremendous role in our lives. Let me first state my personal feelings about the situation in our society today. I am often irritated and confused when I see all the different advertisements. When I turn on the TV, read the daily newspaper, or even when I go outside for a run in the park, I am influenced by advertisements. Everywhere in the media and in public, advertisements are present, and people are oversupplied and do not recognize them anymore. Therefore, in order to gain the attention of consumers, companies have to exaggerate in their advertisements. They praise their products extremely in order to be noticed by people. The competition is very stiff due to the huge variety of products. The increasing significance of communication channels like the internet makes the competition even tougher because people are now bombarded even more with advertisements and commercials. Only if the advertisement is extraordinary and special will people eventually buy the product. However, in reality, the product is not as good as the advertisement has promised. I have also been disappointed by a product that I bought several times. One example is the new iPhone, which promises to be much better than it really is. However, that is a very subjective impression because other people like the product and are satisfied. In conclusion, one can say that the attitude towards a product is a very personal feeling and differs greatly."}

They think that the younger generation is selfish and only wants to earn a lot of money. There are a few points supporting this opinion, but there are also a few against it.\n\nThe first thing to say is that the traditional bonds between the younger and older generations have nearly completely dissolved. For example, it is not common anymore for both generations to live together in one house. Therefore, the younger generation cannot feel the strong sense of community that once existed. From this point on, I think that the younger generation is involved in several other activities to help their communities. First, there are a lot of teenagers who help the church or the local administration, for example, during elections. I have some friends doing that, and I can say that the work they do there is really admirable. Second, there are many teenagers who are involved in fighting against environmental problems. These activities are really beneficial to the local community because they help to achieve a sustainable lifestyle. The last point is that many students are working hard for school or university. That does not only mean that they want to achieve professional success, but they also want to improve life at school or university for themselves and for all other students.\n\nNow let me talk about a point I've just mentioned: the hard work for school or university. Of course, this means that they have to spend a lot of time learning and not directly helping their community. But I think that learning is the best way to achieve a good life for the whole community. The young generation knows that without working hard, they won't be able to achieve a good life for their community, for example, if there are no skilled workers in the town, the economy and finally the whole community will suffer a lot.\n\nFinally, you could say that it's not true that young people today do not spend enough time helping their community.

They spend too much time studying for their classes, waste much of their time on personal enjoyment, and do not understand the real meaning of helping their communities.\n\nAs a fact, parents in Taiwan always want their children to have good academic achievements more than other things. They want their young people to study again and again, and do not expect them to pay any attention or spend much time on other things except reading and studying. As a result, young people will not spend much time on other activities such as helping their communities.\n\nYoung people are still like children, so they prefer to play, such as spending their time playing computer games or watching TV in an air-conditioned room during their vacation or off-school time rather than helping their communities outside the door, especially in the hot summer weather in Taiwan.\n\nFor example, my nephew is a teenager, but he did not know anything about the community where he has lived for more than ten years. He prefers to talk to his friends by cell phone and have dates with his girlfriend. He spends time helping his community only when his high school asks him to hand in a report about his service in the community, and the report will be graded. Except for this, when I suggested that he might do community service in our community, he was surprised that I had such a strange idea that he had never considered.\n\nIn conclusion, it has become a common social phenomenon that young people do not give enough time to help their communities because their parents and the whole community do not facilitate them to help their communities, nor do they provide good rewards or help them to understand the real meaning of helping their communities. As such, young people are losing their recognition of their own communities."}

For example, an ad for a car would usually include the car speeding away really fast and showcase the interior technology and luxury of the car. However, what the ad does not tell the consumers is that speeding away can cause accidents, and technology advances every day, etc.\n\nA good ad should be planned in a manner to show the use of the car, that is, how it can help not only you but other people as well, or even the environment. If the ad for the car displayed the comfort, the space available in the car, etc., it would be more useful for the people.\n\nAdvertising is taking over the marketing sector tremendously. Ads in forms of banners, flyers, stalls, etc., are providing all the information to the people, and these methods make sure that the consumer looks at the product in a positive manner.\n\nUsually, the quality, functioning, and looks of a product are quite different from what they appear in an ad, and this makes the consumer suffer. Some of the ads provide us with information we don't need, and some of them display material which offends people culturally, religiously, or makes them feel at a low status in society. For example, an ad for underwear might display a man wearing it and running behind a horse, which is not realistic.\n\nI conclude this essay by urging people to be aware of what they consume and how it is going to affect them or others, and whether it will still be of any help to the consumer in the future."}

Many people think that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are, while others believe that most advertisements portray the products as they truly are. I think that advertisements make products seem better to make more money, attract more people, and expand their business.\n\nOne reason is to make a lot of money. Many of these owners don't have any respect for others. These persons just want to sell you something for a high price, and maybe the price is lower than they claim it is. Like my grandfather. He wanted to buy a computer and he saw an advertisement on TV that said the computer was worth three thousand dollars. Because he was naive about computers, he bought it. When he told my father that he bought a computer for that price, my father was furious because he said that the computer was only worth one thousand dollars.\n\nAnother reason is because the owner wants to attract people with their product. They just care to attract the maximum number of people. For example, my mother bought a vacuum cleaner that she saw on TV. She said that this was the best one that she had ever seen. When the vacuum arrived, she was excited and started to use it. In four days, the vacuum broke and she couldn't use it anymore.\n\nFinally, these advertisements make products seem better because the owners want to expand their business. For this reason, they can sell more items and also make more money. First, they start selling only one product, but with the money they make from this product, they will start producing other products. As a result, they will expand their business.\n\nTo conclude, I would say that many advertisements make products seem much better than they really are because the owners want to make more money, attract more people, and expand their business. I think that these people should have more respect for their customers and create advertisements that show the product the way it is and not the way they want it to appear."}

Due to the increase in companies and their products, each one wants to increase their share and dominate the market. Advertisements seem to play a key role in the sale of the product.\n\nI agree with the fact that advertisements make products seem better than they actually are. In order to trap customers, the company shows the products in a great manner, gives great publicity, and employs celebrities in publicizing them. Ultimately, when a customer buys the product, what happens?\n\nThe customer feels cheated and becomes irate with the company. For example, it was claimed by a company, as part of their publicity stunt to have an upper hand over their competitors, that they had produced a bike that would give a mileage of 120 km per liter of petrol. To attract customers, they hid the truth that they had overstated the mileage. Many customers bought the bike and practically experienced it by riding the bike. What they felt was that the product is underperforming. They went to the company and asked for the facts, but the company officials' response was not up to the mark, as the customers expected. They went to the consumer court and got their money back.\n\nIn the above-stated example, the case sheds very good light on the topic. It is true that the company lost a lot of money in refunding their customers and, instead, it gained a bad reputation. Any person doesn't even think about having that company's product. The company feels that publicity is everything; they think that seeing is believing. They are in that vision and advertise hugely on the qualities and standards that the product doesn't accomplish, but in reality, seeing is not everything we might believe. Usually, we should not believe in everything we see.\n\nCompanies should be transparent and should advertise what the product really has in order to maintain a long-term good relationship with the customer and maintain a good name for the company."}

Actually, it might be helpful to have a broad knowledge base, but objectively, it is less necessary than specializing in one specific subject. Anyone can acquire a broad range of knowledge by spending some time on it. However, if you specialize in one specific subject, then you will gain more specific knowledge that others may not know about. This specialized knowledge is more useful to have. For example, let's say you are the owner of a company and you want to hire someone for the marketing section, and there are two candidates: one attended a general university and another attended a specific business college. Whom are you going to hire for your business? I am not saying that the person with a general university background is bad, but objectively, I would hire the graduate from the specific business college. This is because I want someone who has an idea of a specific section, which is business, and who has extensive knowledge in that field. This is not just my opinion, but it is also how the real world operates. There are many people who achieve success in their field, such as the CEO of Microsoft, who was not only good at his job but also specialized in one specific subject. Perhaps having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects will help you to decide on your field, but if you already have your goal, then I suggest focusing on knowledge in one area. And even if you think it is a waste of time, do not stop. Because nobody else will put in the effort you do, and you will reach a golden age of appreciation for your efforts."}

I will present my reasons in the following passages.\n\nFirst, as a Japanese citizen and a resident of a developed country, I believe there is a possibility that the number of cars in use will be reduced, particularly in cities. In urban areas, a person can easily transport themselves without a car thanks to the sophisticated network of trains, subways, and buses. Similarly, I think that suburban areas may develop comparable methods of transportation. However, what I want to emphasize here is that this opinion is too narrow to consider the global picture.\n\nSecond, I think we must adopt a more worldwide perspective. On Earth, there are many countries that aspire to become more developed. In these countries, I believe that the number of cars in use is increasing. The reason why developing countries will use more cars in the future is that, to enhance their economic capacity, the need for cars will increase to transport goods for commerce. I think transportation capability has significant meaning to these countries.\n\nIn conclusion, when considering global development, I disagree with the opinion."}

These elements will continue to push up demands for cars.\n\nFirst, we are now developing new energy resources to substitute fossil fuels; for example, solar energy and hydrogen energy. These energies have two fascinating points; they are safe for the environment without producing any chemical substances that cause pollution problems. Additionally, they are obtained almost infinitely. By refining these new technologies, they can be applied in twenty years, and we can use cars without harming our planet. That can be a strong element in favor of cars.\n\nSecond, the convenience systems in cars are enhancing their utility. For example, today we can reach destinations without losing our way thanks to the navigation system supported by satellite communication. Moreover, the safety of cars is improving; the physical strength of the car body is becoming incredibly strong these days, saving many drivers' lives. These new supporting systems or technologies provide more comfort to car users, which means the consumption of cars will remain strong in the future.\n\nThird, the rapid growth of the population in the world is ongoing for at least twenty years. This means there will be a continuous growing demand for cars. Although we are also trying to create new types of trains, such as the linear motor car that is moved by magnetic power, I think people tend to buy cars that can provide safe energy and fabulous convenience. Actually, I experienced that the subway newly constructed was not so used by citizens in New Delhi, India.\n\nAs stated above, there are three aspects supporting the strong demands for cars: the development and application of new resources, new technologies, and systems that give drivers a more relaxing atmosphere, and the explosion of the number of people who need cars in the world. In twenty years, it is quite certain."}

That was because of the great enthusiasm young people had towards accomplishing their responsibilities. For example, the percentage of failure in senior high school was 30% in the Middle East between 1989-2000. However, between 2001-2006, the percentage of failure increased significantly to 70%. This statistic indicates that young people nowadays are not fulfilling their responsibilities, which they should be passing on to several generations after them. This may also cause the community and society to lack education, which might affect the city's finances.\n\nMoney has been one of the main problems society is facing.

The present generation faces various challenges, works with too many responsibilities in a world of immense competition. They hardly have ample time to help their communities.\n\nMan's life today has changed tremendously with the advancement in science and technology. The more the changes over the years, the higher their aims have become, the greater the responsibilities to be carried out, and the greater are the accomplishments to be made. His needs have changed tremendously with advancements in technology and science. This change has not only made his life easier but also more challenging to succeed.\n\nMan, irrespective of his age, is working harder than what he was doing 20 years back. If we consider a small kid, he too is busy with his academic schedule with a change in his syllabus, the amount of material to be studied. He hardly finds time for his co-curricular activities. If a teenager is considered, he is busy making a career for himself. A middle-aged man is quite occupied in improving his skills or standards of living. It's only a retired person who seemingly has time for activities but lacks enough energy.\n\nThe change in technology over the past few years has brought a change not only in man's life, making things easier for him but also in his way of thinking. Today, even a small kid thinks about what advantages he can get for sacrificing something. Every individual is more focused on what he or she can become, how much he or she can earn, and how to make more profits. They lead a very mechanical life where they mainly believe in the famous saying 'Time is Money'.\n\nThey would not like to spend their time on something that does not benefit them in terms of money or luxury. As considered in management science theory, man's social needs come only after his financial needs.\n\nIn such a society, people hardly think about their communities and take out some time to help their communities.

However, more than the disappearance of the use of cars, I think an evolution of them is going to happen.\n\nEven if the gas issue may raise questions about slowing the use of cars for different reasons—for instance, because it entails environmental problems such as ozone layer depletion, and also because while resources are decreasing, gas consumption is still rising—in my opinion, it won't happen.\n\nIndeed, cars are a fundamental part of civilians' everyday life; they have been one of the most sold items since the 1950s. Today, in most cases, it has become very difficult to live without a car unless you are living in a very big city. Although prices are lowering, other ways of traveling are still much more expensive than by car. For instance, most of the population who can afford it goes to work driving a car.\n\nIt is true that other ways of traveling have been enhanced in cities, such as the underground or buses; however, the car remains the easier and more common way to travel.\n\nNevertheless, I think there will be some change concerning how cars work.

{"file_id": "1055205.txt", "output_essay": "In the next twenty years, there will be fewer cars than at present. I don't agree with this notion because the demand and the importance of the car are ever-increasing day by day.\n\nWith the advancement in technology and the statistics produced by car manufacturers, if anything is to go by, then in the next few years there will be a major increase in the number of consumers for cars. I think that there could be an increase in the number of cars used, depending on the policy issues. I say so because with the ever-increasing development in technology, there is a reduction in prices of the previous models, and certain additional features are being added to the new cars, which would only have been a dream a few years earlier.\n\nMoreover, the notion of a car being a necessity rather than a luxury is changing, as even members of not-so-affluent families or well-to-do families also own cars. This change could be attributed to various factors such as easy payment options given by car manufacturers or the installment plans offered by them. Other reasons could also be the willingness of bank authorities to give various loans for the purchase of cars or for the changes to be made in a car. Another reason could be the company's exchange offers, which say that you can exchange your old car for a new one with an additional payment, which keeps on increasing the sales of cars.\n\nPlus, there are additional benefits of using a car which make it a hard-to-resist object or abandon. The benefits of the car are that you can go with your family wherever you want and at whatever time, plus it's useful in cases of emergency. More than the benefits, cars are usually associated with social status. There is ever an increase in the demand for a new car with certain added features that its predecessor is not having. Then there are cars which hold special status as being the royal cars or having your own vintage collection.\n\nBasically, you can reach different destinations according to your own schedule at your own speed. Nowadays, there is a whole lot of variety being offered wherein special additional features are built in it like a conference room setting or bedroom setting. With such offers, it has a lot of benefits for people who are really busy and can't afford to waste time.\n\nWell, with so many benefits, it's really hard to think that there will be a decline in the number of cars in the near future. With the benefits, there are also certain disadvantages, like the gas emitted from the exhaust of the cars is polluting the environment, and that the fuel used for the functioning of the car is depleting the natural resources. Well, for the fact that cars are increasing air pollution, with the development in technology, various models are being developed which do not emit any dangerous gases into the atmosphere, and for the second disadvantage that they are using energy resources, new cars are being developed, and some have already been developed, which use solar energy as fuel or run on electrical energy.\n\nThus, with so many advantages, I think the demand for the increase in cars will outnumber its decrease, or there won't be any drastic change in the number of cars in the near future. Thus, I think that in the near future, there will be an additional number of cars than there are today."}

Latin is really similar to math, and it can permit you to elaborate more sophisticated concepts when you know how to use words or sentences in a logical way. My high school was called 'Classical High School', in opposition to 'Scientific High School'. I didn't learn specific and practical subjects like math, physics, or geometry, but I learned to think.\n\nDuring my university time, at the Architectural School in Milan, I found out how much my professor's statement was true because I didn't have any problems studying really difficult subjects like math, structure, calculation, etc., because my mind was able to process every kind of data, even if they were different from what I studied in high school.\n\nFor this reason, I think it's really important for every student, with any kind of personal background and goal, to understand and to learn how to understand ideas and concepts instead of just merely learning facts.\n\nWhen you are able to understand an idea or a concept, you can approach these things with a critical view, elaborate on them, and create a personal view about them, and not just learn facts without understanding why they happened, which reason generated them.\n\nFor students' futures, understanding ideas and concepts is the most important thing, and it will give them specific skills to approach every kind of problem in life."}

That is a very difficult question, taking into account that most people would think that young people might have more fun than older people, just because they think that they are healthier, faster, stronger. As my mom used to tell me, teenagers think they are Superman. They take risks that older people normally wouldn't take. They stay up all night, go to parties, drive fast cars, and maybe even do illegal drugs. But that does not mean that young people have more fun. I once read a very good book, 'Tuesdays with Morrie.' It's a book about life. It shows the experiences of a young man interacting with an elder. The elder has gone through various experiences, and the youngster wants to learn from those experiences. Eventually, the teacher tells him one thing, 'You first need to learn how to die, then you can learn how to live...' That tells the student that he has to absorb all that he can from his experiences, and then let go of some of his emotions, and then he can know how it feels to taste success, or love, and even pride. Morrie, who is the teacher in the book, tells the main character that once you know how it feels to die, you know how to live because you learn how to enjoy life even more. The point I am trying to make is that older people know how to take more and more from each new experience, and they probably enjoy life even more. Although there are a few exceptions, some young people are very mature and find a way to have fun even in the worst situations, like people that don't have as many economic resources. They learn how to take advantage from the few opportunities they have to go out, or party as we say nowadays. I honestly think that older people have more fun because they have learned how to enjoy life, and young people are just living at a hundred miles an hour, trying to do too many things to have fun, and not getting a lot out of the experiences that they go through in their daily lives."}

Indeed, they believe that you need to go through all the details of a specific field if you want to be efficient. Is that true or not?\n\nI don't agree with such a prejudice. On the contrary, I think the more you know, the more efficient you are. For example, if someone wants to work in a library, will he be more efficient if he knows everything about books, publishing, and printing? I don't think so. I think he will be more efficient if he knows about different things such as history, anthropology, philosophy, literature, or science. Practice can give you all the technical knowledge, but it will never replace the broad knowledge provided by schools and universities.\n\nThe second reason why I think broad knowledge is important in our society is that people who have broad knowledge are more flexible. They are able to switch from one field to another. In other words, they are what I would call 'complete persons.' They can adapt themselves to every change. For example, you can be a banker today and become a manager tomorrow.\n\nMy last point is about my political vision of a modern society: I think that a good citizen needs to have broad knowledge of all academic subjects in order to make good choices. Reality is complex: if you want to understand what is happening in your country and in the whole world, you need to have a solid knowledge in different fields such as geography, economy, or technology.\n\nTo conclude about this subject, I would say that the British ideal of the 'gentleman' who knows about all aspects of human things continues to be important in our modern world."}

When faced with the decision of who enjoys more, quite a few would claim that young people have more energy to enjoy life, and that is my point. There are numerous reasons why young people enjoy life more. I will explore a few of the most important ones here.\n\nThe main reason for my opinion is that young people are at the beginning of their lives and they have more advantages. Take my father and my brother as examples; my father has a lot of responsibilities while my brother doesn't have any. When my father wants to do something new, he has to think about himself and his family. My brother, in contrast, goes out at night and comes back whenever he wants, and he isn't the breadwinner.\n\nThere is another factor that deserves some mention here. People are different. They have different traits, customs, beliefs, and lifestyles. Some prefer to stay at home when they get older, while others go out more than they did when they were young.\n\nSimilarly, these reasons also apply to young people. When we consider that some young people have a lot of responsibilities, while others don't. Young people have the opportunity to choose what they want. When they have opportunities, they can go for it and they can make the most of it.\n\nIt seems very difficult for us to prefer one to another because some people are very emotional, others very strict, and small problems don't usually get to them. In short, even though young people have some problems choosing their career, they have more advantages to enjoy life. But that doesn't mean older people don't have fun. They do. Sometimes more than young people."}

I encouraged more of my friends to join this service, and we all learned different things from it. One of my friends once participated in a service at a hospital. She talked to the elderly people, then read books and newspapers to them. She told me that participating in community service was a really different experience, and it would lead you to learn more about life, about helping others without expecting a reward.\n\nYoung people do participate in helping their community without boasting about it; they choose to help society quietly.

Advertising is used to enhance the market presence of a product, but in a fair market, advertisements cannot be deceptive; they must present the product realistically.\n\nIt is true, though, that most advertisements portray products as being much better than they actually are. However, the point is that the product remains the same, while underneath lies a communication strategy that can alter people's perceptions. Sometimes it's the music, sometimes the combination of colors, or other times the scenario that is depicted. Thus, the focus is not on the product's quality, but on how you feel when you possess that product.\n\nI believe that consumers should be aware that advertisements sometimes distort the true significance of a product, playing a psychological game. It's important to understand what information is genuine and what is fair in the marketplace, and to question whether it is acceptable for advertisements to make products appear far better than they are. A prime example is cigarette advertising, which demonstrates how a harmful product, detrimental to our health, is marketed as if it were beneficial.\n\nI think that everyone should think carefully before making a purchase."}

In fact, many grandparents and parents claim that their children do not fulfill all their responsibilities to the community. They suggest that young people today do not allocate enough time to assisting their communities. They often reminisce about how their own childhoods were more challenging than ours. It becomes tedious when parents constantly criticize what you do or have done. That is why I disagree with this statement. I will elaborate on my reasons in the following paragraph.\n\nIn my opinion, this statement is incorrect. In reality, many young people help the elderly when they require assistance. They frequently aid their parents at home and engage in numerous activities. I believe that helping the community is important, don't you? Attending school may not seem like it directly benefits the community at first. However, if young people do not pursue education, the community will suffer because we need well-educated individuals to manage it.\n\nFrom my perspective, older people hold this belief because they engage in activities that we do not. For example, visiting the elderly in their homes or organizing events for their town, such as the next party. These are activities for which we simply do not have the time. Between classes, sports, and general social activities, it is difficult to find a moment to do what they do.\n\nIn conclusion, as you have seen, I strongly disagree with this statement. And I do not appreciate it when my grandmother tells me that!"}

In fact, when I was at school, I studied a variety of subjects, including Latin and ancient Greek, and when I was at university, I took twenty-five exams on different aspects of economics.\n\nI think that it's important to have broad knowledge of many subjects because today, when you work, you need to be more flexible than before; a lot of things have changed, and it's quite different from the beginning of the twentieth century when Ford theorized the concept of 'work specialization.'\n\nHowever, in some cases, it should be different; for example, an engineer needs to know a lot about a specific subject and must specialize in a specific construction sector, and, I think, it's similar for physicians.\n\nOn the other hand, my preparation is general because I want to become a manager, and it's known that a manager must resolve a variety of different problems in different ways; you may use your ability to find new solutions to problems.\n\nFor example, if you have a problem selling a product because the market doesn't like it, you have two choices: the first is to withdraw the product from the market, and the second, which is more creative, is to find a good marketing solution to make the product 'pulled' by the market.\n\nIn conclusion, I think that you must choose your formation depending on your interests and your future job."}

I am currently working at a bank as a foreign exchange trader. Even as a professional, I make decisions and scale the timing using analysis of reading the charts, checking the orders, and researching economic data because the foreign exchange market is unpredictable. I think the same principle applies to this theory. In general, unpredictable events often occur; sometimes, people with good luck might survive these events, but I strongly believe that such luck will not continue without a solid background of knowledge and experience. Just trying new things without knowledge is merely risky.\n\nSecondly, when I play a tennis match, I do not try a new style of serve when I really want to win because the ratio of missing is very high.\n\nThat's why I strongly believe that people who succeed in the world do so based on their knowledge and experience."}

I was out shopping with my friends, and I was on the lookout for a new mobile phone which I had fallen in love with as soon as I saw it on my television screen one fine morning. I had vowed to buy that mobile phone, whatever the consequences. This action can be appraised by the fact that the phone looked really cute in the advertisement and it boasted many features as well. This phone was the ultimate gadget for any teenager. But I had the ultimate shock when I saw the same mobile phone in the mall. It did not look as cute as it did in the ad, for one thing, and it did not seem to have as many features as it did in the ad. The ad was an illustration of what is defined as cheap publicity. The phone had been wrongly displayed, and if it were not for my trustworthy friends, I would have bought it with all the love I previously had for it and then would have ended up as the loser, disappointed as well.\n\nMost advertisements seem to display products in such a way that the consumer would fall in love with the product just by viewing the advertisement. This can result in serious damage to the customers' trust in advertisements as well as in the manufacturers of that particular product. The consumers will be heartbroken when they come home and realize that the product, with which they were previously so in love, has really let them down, quality-wise. The advertisers or the manufacturers are hoodwinking the consumers into buying their products at high prices, ensuring profits for themselves, but breaking the trust of the consumers nonetheless. The advertisements should be more realistic, and they should not display something which the consumer may not find in the product later. The advertisers should only advertise those characteristics of the products which actually exist and serve a purpose, not the characteristics that ought to be in a product. If the advertisers are so keen on advertising such characteristics, they should suggest to the manufacturers to actually integrate these characteristics into the product and then advertise them, so they would not be cheating the customers but actually showing a true, realistic picture."}
{"file_id": "1041085.txt", "output_essay": "Many people have the problem that they do not know what to do regarding the subjects they can choose from in a university. Should they take their time to study many academic subjects, or should they specialize in one specific subject?\n\nThe first positive point of choosing many academic subjects is that you have a broad knowledge of many different things. That makes you more flexible when you look for a new job and also gives you more flexibility in many other situations. The second positive fact is that you are able to talk about many different topics, which can help you to increase your relationships with others. If a person talks about various topics, you are able to enter the conversation because of the fact that you have more knowledge about different things. You are able to talk about many different things than a person who just studies one specific subject.\n\nTo specialize in one specific subject has many positive benefits. First of all, people who take many courses do not have specific knowledge about a certain subject. People who specialize in one subject are more professional and therefore able to answer more specific questions because they have more knowledge. They are also able to use their knowledge to solve higher problems. Another positive fact is that companies always need professional people who have a lot of knowledge in a specific area. Therefore, people are better paid than those who are not so professional.\n\nI strongly believe that it is better to have more knowledge about a specific subject. You are more able to solve complex problems, and you are also able to respond to more specific questions. In addition, people with more knowledge about a topic are more likely to get more money from companies because they need professional people."}

Here are my reasons: More and more people are concerned about the pollution problem of the environment, and not only do governments decide to pass bills that can protect our natural environment, but also people reduce the damage to our environment. Cars are one of the vital contributors to this pollution because they release carbon dioxide. If people reduce driving cars by themselves and instead use mass transportation, the amount of carbon dioxide, which is a vital reason that causes pollution, can be eliminated. So I think there will be fewer cars than today.\n\nSecond, cities are developing gradually, and more and more cities will have their mass transportation, such as MRT, trains, or buses. This useful development can provide a more economical way to transport for citizens. In order to save money and priceless time, people will choose to use mass transportation rather than drive cars by themselves. For example, although many of my teachers have their own cars, they only drive themselves on rainy days because the MRT in our city provides a cheaper and more comfortable journey for us. And they don't need to drive.\n\nIn addition, the expenditure to maintain a car is very high. For example, the cost of gasoline, the taxes on cars, etc. This huge expenditure would affect people's willingness to own a car.\n\nFinally, crowded traffic situations would also make people not want to drive cars by themselves. And there is still a big problem for drivers: finding a parking space is extremely hard.\n\nTo sum up, the idea of environmental protection, more convenient mass transportation, the expenditure of owning a car, avoiding being stuck in a traffic jam, and worrying about how to find a parking space on time, all of these considerations would make fewer and fewer people plan to have their own cars."}
{"file_id": "1070118.txt", "output_essay": "Why do young people not give enough time to helping their communities nowadays? I presume there are several reasons for that.\n\nFirst of all, young people have increasing possibilities and money to spend their leisure time, so they might rather spend their time enjoying themselves with friends than helping the community.\n\nAnother reason might be the changing living conditions. People nowadays have to be and are more flexible. The number of young people leaving their hometown to study in a city far away has increased. Young people are changing jobs more frequently than before and thus have to move houses. The time a young person spends in one site has shortened, and accordingly, the feeling of being a part of a community. Helping a community means to be motivated as you feel responsible for it. Without having spent a certain time in a community, you are less motivated to help, as you do not know a lot of people personally. The personal knowledge of people, though, increases your motivation to help strongly.\n\nThe strongest reason for the fact that young people nowadays help less in communities is the changed behavior towards communities. People have become more individual, more focused on themselves and their needs. Families, as much as communities, do not mean as much to people as they used to in the past. People are economically more independent so that they do not need the support and help of the communities as much as in the past.\n\nTaking all those factors into account, I would agree that more and more young people tend not to give enough time to helping their communities."}
{"file_id": "1074210.txt", "output_essay": "It is difficult to say whether it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects or to specialize in one specific subject. First, I will say that it is important to have a broad knowledge. But then I will show that it is not easy or even possible to do so.\n\nHaving a broad knowledge is very good. This is why, at school, I have learned about a lot of different topics. To know as much about history as about biology or astronomy is fantastic. If I had this broad knowledge, I would be able to speak with a biologist or a historian. But is it possible to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects without being specialized in one particular topic?\n\nIn fact, my knowledge in biology would not be as accurate as that of a biologist. That is to say, somebody who has a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is specialized in nothing. So, in that case, it is hard or even impossible to find a job. I think it is important to specialize in one specific subject in order to find a job or to be able to provide accurate information about a precise topic.\n\nIn conclusion, in my opinion, it is better to specialize in one specific subject. But in that case, it is important too, not to forget that other subjects exist. So, it is necessary to read books about other topics. For example, a biologist must know about history even if he will never be as good in history as in biology because he may need historical information to explain several phenomena that he is already studying."}
{"file_id": "1069041.txt", "output_essay": "Of course, students have to learn facts from teachers and memorize them. However, it is only the first step to proceed with their study. They should spend most of their time figuring out ideas and concepts. By doing this, they can acquire application skills. Moreover, they can enjoy their studies.\n\nTo begin with, they can get highly developed application skills if they try to understand matters. You will agree with this idea: a person who knows the nature of matter can perform well when he works on new problems, rather than a person who only memorized the surface of the matter. They can apply their ideas if they know the matter deeply. Now, it is often said that Japanese lack application skills. We are ranked in a lower position when the research comes out. In contrast, countries like the US are ranked highly every time. We know the cause of this situation. The education in Japan highly emphasizes memorizing. We must take hard entrance examinations when we enroll in high school and university. So, although we often memorize the facts, we seldom have the opportunity to think about the matter deeply. Thus, students can raise their application skills by understanding the concept itself.\n\nSecond, understanding the nature of problems is much more attractive for students. They can get pleasure when they find out the solution or they could understand the concept. Therefore, they can continue studying with joy. We want to do what we like rather than what we dislike. It also helps in raising their academic skills. In contrast, in the case of learning all things, they will stop studying. For me personally, I didn't like studying at all until I entered university. I could not find joy in studying because I had to memorize many facts. However, almost all studies in universities require us to think for ourselves. Now, studying is not discomfort.\n\nBecause of the application skills and enjoyment, I believe students should concentrate on understanding. They can raise their ability and become more interested in studying."}
{"file_id": "1067037.txt", "output_essay": "A guided tour is always a preferred tour. A guided tour with a group is more fun, educational, and memorable. For example, if you are traveling alone to a historical monument with no background knowledge about the place, it's as good as seeing the monument or place in books.\n\nIf you are traveling alone, then things will not be of greatest interest. There might be moments when you want to discuss a specific painting or piece of architecture with someone. This calls for a tour in groups rather than individually. A monument or painting speaks a thousand words when you observe them, but it cannot listen to you.\n\nThere are some points of the guided tour that make it more interesting. First, the intricacy and depth of the guide's knowledge about the importance of the place, which obviously we as tourists are not aware of. Second, there are places that may not be listed or published in maps, magazines, books, etc., and there might be some local place of interest that the guide knows. The third point is that in a group, there are people with different ideologies and thoughts. The inquisitiveness of anyone in the group to know about something might prove useful for the entire group to learn more about the place. Obviously, a guide is the best one to answer such questions. Thus, the best way to travel is in a group, led by a tour guide.\n\nThere is, of course, the other side of this where the guide might try to tell things differently and might say incorrect things about the place. The guide might be prejudiced about some of the historical views and opinions. These are factors that depend on the type of guide you choose. If there is a good guide with a good reputation, then it is always advantageous to hire him for a guided tour. If you consider saving the guide charges by not hiring one, then the money spent on coming to the place may go in vain since you would have only visited the place but not learned anything more about it than what you have seen."}
{"file_id": "1072520.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks to achieve their goals. Only when there are risks will life be more interesting. Also, if we work on the same things, we will feel bored. For example, if a software engineer works on the same project for several years, then there will be no improvement in his technical skills, or he may actually lose his imaginative power. Only if he works in different scenarios can he improve his knowledge and gain experience.\n\nMukesh Ambani is the best example, I think, because he is a successful person in various kinds of businesses. Initially, along with his brother, he started industries and developed those industries to gain more profit. Then he started oil refineries, and then came Reliance Mobiles. Apart from this, Reliance Energy Resources are doing a great job in the mutual funds and share markets.\n\nThis also helps to provide jobs for people in different fields. If there was only one industry, we could support only the people who are in that field. By trying new businesses, it also helps to reduce unemployment and to develop various economic levels.\n\nAnother reason for doing various businesses is that if there is a loss in one of the businesses, we can manage the loss because of the profit in other businesses. In case we are doing one business, then we cannot manage that situation. For example, learning both hardware and software will help when there are fewer jobs available in software or hardware. So, if we learn more and keep ourselves up to date with new technologies, then there is no way for loss.\n\nMaybe there are successful people who do the same thing they know (the same business), but the probability is very low. Trying new things and developing new skill sets will put us in a good position."}
{"file_id": "1066392.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is to merely learn facts. The following points can be reasonably made to support the above statement.\n\nTo begin with, understanding of ideas and concepts enables one to really appreciate the mechanics of it and to possibly put the idea or concept into application. Take the example of an electric motor. Without proper understanding of how an electric motor really works, it is impossible for one to create motors of various sizes and for various utilities. If one merely learned the facts about a motor, we wouldn't have all the pleasures in life made possible by all the miniature motors! Look at the car's power windows, whose operation is facilitated by small motors, or at many of the useful robots whose motion is made possible by various sizes/types of motors, or at many of the precision tools that use something called stepper motors to precisely control various operations.\n\nFurthermore, understanding of a concept enables one to look for ways the concept can be extended to other applications, or to find ways two or more concepts can be combined to come up with new ideas that make exciting things possible. Take the example of a device that scans printed material and converts it into typed matter on a computer. This device is the result of a lot of different concepts put together. The scanning technology, which scans the printed material, is then combined with pattern matching technology that can look at the scanned picture and recognize the letters based on their shapes. Simple learning of facts doesn't really allow for this kind of innovation.\n\nHowever, no one can deny the role facts play in helping people visualize things and in putting things in perspective. Take for example the Saturn rocket that took man to the Moon. Unless one knows the size of the rocket, the amount of fuel used, how many inventions were required to make the flight possible, one may not really appreciate the scale of the device and the project. But one can still see that the facts help one gain a perspective of things, but the real usefulness comes only when one understands the concepts that make it possible for the device to work.\n\nIn summary, it is clear that it is far more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn just facts, despite the important role played by the facts."}
{"file_id": "1069391.txt", "output_essay": "Many students at some point in their lives wonder if they should choose a specialization in their studies or if they should attend a general university to choose classes in many different fields. I think both can be good, but everything depends on what you want to do.\n\nFirst of all, I believe that it is important that students don't specialize too early. In high schools, for instance, it is important that students learn about many different fields before being allowed to choose which major they want to study. It can thus make students discover fields of knowledge they didn't know before, but some fields that can also attract them a lot.\n\nBesides, I think that choosing to specialize or not depends on what kind of job you want to do later. Some jobs require good knowledge in many academic fields. This is the case for journalism, for instance. Some journalists do decide to specialize, but the majority are able to write about every topic, whether it concerns a pension reform or a football match.\n\nFrom a personal point of view, this attitude - to make the choice of not choosing a specialization - can be very interesting. Somebody who decides not to choose a major field of interest will be interested in many more things than somebody only interested in history or philosophy.\n\nBut I also think that there is a danger for people knowing lots of things in many fields. Society also needs specialists who deeply know some aspects of it. For instance, teaching biology requires being a specialist in biology. And it is the same for all teachers. In some countries, teachers are teaching two subjects, but I think it is not such a good idea since they can't know very well two fields of knowledge.\n\nTo conclude, we can say that societies need both specialists and people that stay in general knowledge. But personally, I like having learned many different subjects before specializing myself. Thanks to this, I discovered what biology, physics, and many other fields were, which I would not have discovered without my high school classes."}
{"file_id": "1066097.txt", "output_essay": "In my opinion, it is better to specialize in a specific subject or area instead of having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects, although it can be argued that a general education is also necessary.\n\nMost obviously, the goal of all academic education is to ultimately give us specific knowledge and educate us in a particular area or subject. It is the reason why we go to university after secondary school. Being a professional and knowing one subject thoroughly gives us many advantages on the job market by appealing to customers, clients, and future employers. After completing my undergraduate studies, I plan to get a master's degree in law and study one specific area of the law. In today's market, professionals are becoming more and more specialized because there are so many changes, and so many topics and subjects to study. When a client is having a divorce, they will not go to a surgeon or a corporate lawyer; they will go to a lawyer who specializes in matrimonial actions because he is more likely to help them, after seeing so many clients in the same situation.\n\nFurthermore, it is not time-efficient to cover many academic subjects and know them all. Some people have more than one degree and spend their lives studying and going to one school after another. They know about economics, finance, or banking, but it is not possible to know them all very well. In addition, it can cost a lot to study so many subjects and, in the end, not be able to compete with one person who spent less time in school but only knows one subject.\n\nFinally, it is impossible to learn many subjects and know them all well. It is a sign of lack of stability and indecision. Some students spend their college years changing from one major to another and can never decide which one to study. So they end up spending years in school and get discouraged by the time to graduate and quit school. In sum, specializing in one subject is the best choice for me, although I would also like to learn about other complementary disciplines like languages, sports, and art, and be able to exchange intellectually with other people."}
{"file_id": "1069486.txt", "output_essay": "To answer this question, it is important to figure out the reasons why young people support their community. Mostly, younger people join groups to have people around and enjoy time with friends. This can happen in the church community, sports clubs, or just for hanging out. Activities in church, for example, try to teach the younger ones how important it is to help people with disabilities. However, because of the increase in media consumption, especially TV, community activities are being labeled as 'uncool.' It is more important to be an individual and gain your own popularity. Another reason can be that people lose trust in their government. They feel the pressure that rests on them if they want to have success in their life. So, they try to get the best for their own advancement. This is also evident when people recognize that government members, who should serve the public, think it is more important to fill their own pockets. This can have the effect of making people more egocentric. Especially because of the new information era, people are aware of the selfishness of some government members. They are also informed about the risks in life every day in the news. I think this constant pressure and the lack of honesty has led to the point where young people nowadays do not devote enough time to helping their communities. But with society being aware of this matter, chances are not bad that a new way of thinking and acting can be taught. So, you can see a lot of effort being taken by media and government to emphasize this problem and to point out how important it is to serve the community. Hopefully, this will lead modern societies to a turning point where serving is seen as something good and does not have to be 'uncool.'"}

{"file_id": "1073147.txt", "output_essay": "My opinion about having broad knowledge of many academic subjects, rather than specializing in one specific subject, is that broad knowledge is much better for our studies than focusing on one specific subject. The reasons include that broad knowledge can open our horizon about the whole study area, and we could have wider ranges from which to choose our majors through studying a broad array of subjects.\n\nIn modern times, many jobs require various knowledge because the matters at hand require complete abilities and broad knowledge, which encompasses many academic subjects such as math, physics, and chemistry. These can provide a broader knowledge base for us, which one specific subject could not.\nFor example, if we are lawyers, we not only use knowledge about the law, but we also need knowledge about the economy and humanity. We would benefit from broader knowledge in our work. It provides us with more information when we need to solve a problem.\n\nFurthermore, we would choose our major based on what we learned in school, and studying a broad range of subjects widens the range for us to choose from. What I am facing now is deciding which major I should choose. Although I have already studied some subjects, I still have not figured out which major suits me best. This is an important aspect because I should use the knowledge about my major after graduation, and I would earn money by working in this field. If I choose the wrong major because of a lack of interest and inability to study, I could not raise myself in the future. Broad knowledge makes me comfortable to choose the one I like best and to study my major well.\n\nTo sum up, although one specific subject is a skill for certain people to use, like painters, I still draw the conclusion that broad knowledge is better than one specific subject.\n\nTime to sleep, bye."}
{"file_id": "1070349.txt", "output_essay": "In my point of view, I disagree with the statement, and these are my reasons. First of all, because of different ages, people enjoy their life in different ways, but it doesn't mean older people do not enjoy life. For example, compared with younger couples, instead of getting drunk and dancing like mad, older couples like to travel together and recall their honeymoons. Even though it looks pretty boring for younger people, those moments are significant in the older people's lives. So, older people actually know how to enjoy their time more healthily and more meaningfully.\n\nSecond, there are a lot of things that older people can also enjoy, such as younger people's favorite things—parties, clubs, and gyms. Older people like to go somewhere quieter than the party rooms, but they do enjoy dancing with their lovers and sharing their special moments with the one who is important to them. And also, they love to go to clubs to meet more people and friends. For example, my grandmother loves to go to parties and have fun with her friends.\n\nThird, here is one thing that younger people cannot understand and enjoy but older people love—garden work. Younger people assume that garden work is only for grandparents to pass their extra time. But actually, it is not true; garden work is another way that shows how much older people enjoy life. Because time goes by very fast, older people enjoy the moment when their flowers grow, or their apple tree has little apples, and so on. Because they understand the joy of creating life and in order to enjoy life.\n\nTherefore, in my opinion, older people know how to enjoy their life and even better than younger people. They won't do anything to damage their health, they won't do any childish things that are bad for the community. They have their living styles that provide for better living standards and qualities. So these are the reasons why I disagree with the statement."}

If we look at the youth around us, we find them to be self-occupied. They are busy with their own lives.\n\nThe youngsters are living a life that is all about their own dreams, their own happiness, and their own whims. Gadgets, friends, movies, discotheques, pubs, and other such things are taking them away from their families and the community.\n\nIf they are not having fun, then it is the increasing pressure of studies that keeps them inside their homes after school hours. Their studies and the style of the present school curriculum ensure that the students are studying continuously.\n\nThe curriculum of most educational institutions is designed to give theoretical knowledge to the students. A lack of practicals takes away the chance of any external exposure for the student.\n\nApart from studies, the lack of interest in extending a helping hand for matters related to the communities can also be observed amongst the youngsters. They are becoming a bit self-centered. For them, it's 'ME FIRST.' Everything else becomes secondary for them.\n\nAnother reason for their non-participation can be traced to the fact that they do not understand the importance of joint families, and thus the concept of loving and sharing is a little alien to them. Earlier, joint families kept people together. They were more tolerant, more caring, and had a better understanding of the importance of community. But, the concept of the nuclear family has taken away the element of 'together we stand' from the youth.\n\nLast month, the Mumbai blast rocked the whole nation and questioned our unity and security both.

And if we look at the people who came to help the victims, then we find out that they were not the youth but the middle-aged or old people.\n\nIt is not that all youngsters are unhelpful, but yes, the majority is far too self-centered to come out and give time to their community, to think of its well-being. Apart from this, their modern values, their distance from religion, their shyness, etc., are also playing a role in their behavior.\n\nAt times, the thought that what can a single person do keeps them away from helping others. They need to understand that they have the power to dream and change the world.

This has a vital role in someone's career because it would help the person to be recognized by others and promoted.\n\nOn the other hand, I do not state that one should always take risks and alter the ways he/she knows. The time and the place where a person would try new things and take some risks are also very important. If it is the wrong time or place, things can get worse.\n\nFor example, if your boss gives you an important project that should be prepared soon, you shouldn't take a risk in this situation, and you also don't have the right to do that because you can harm the prestige of the company you're working for.\n\nTo conclude, I think that one should try new things and take risks after gaining some experience and feeling ready for changes, which would make a person successful and admired."}
{"file_id": "1062461.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. I think success has a great deal to do with the factor of adaptation to the new environment, improvement of their own methods, and a challenging spirit. People who have these factors tend to try new things and take risks.\n\nFirst, successful people try new things and take risks to adapt to the new environment. The environment around us has rapidly changed recently. For example, the invention of the Internet makes the world borderless, and email shortens the time to convey information. Under these circumstances, we have to adapt to succeed. In order to adapt, we should try new things, or new environments, and take risks rather than only doing what we already know how to do well. For example, most related to the IT industries are successful because they can adapt to the new environment earlier than ordinary people. This is because they try to launch new things which no one has done before.\n\nSecond, successful people try new things and take risks to improve their own methods. I think that doing the same things, such as doing what they already know how to do well, provides only the same consequence. There is no improvement and progress. In such cases, we cannot be successful because success has to do with something superior to others. In other words, even if the methods are superior to others at one time, they become the same level or inferior to others after a while. For instance, Ichiro Suzuki, who is a major league baseball player, continues to seek new batting methods to improve them every year. Needless to say, he is one of the most successful people.\n\nThird, successful people tend to have a challenging spirit. I think that it is important to do new things. Doing new things brings us new skills and discoveries. Those lead to success.\n\nIn conclusion, I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well for the main three reasons stated above."}

What I try to mean is that with globalization comes competition. According to me, to stay ahead in this highly competitive race, one has to excel or master whatever academic field one may be in. This mastery of an academic subject can only be attained by specializing in that particular subject rather than having only a broad knowledge about various related subjects. The old cliché 'Jack of all trades but master of none' does not appeal much to me.\n\nI would like to elucidate my theory that specializing in a particular subject is better than having knowledge of various academic subjects by citing a practical example. Obviously, a company would prefer a man with a master's degree in Chemical Engineering to another man applying for the same job but with a diploma in chemical engineering and a diploma in biological engineering. Even if the company were to employ the latter for his skills in both chemistry and biology, he would definitely be given a post subordinate to that of the former, and a pay package which would be lesser than the former. However, if the man with the diploma were to hold a degree in, say, a management course, and if the company also required managerial skills at the same time, then it would be a different question altogether.\n\nTo sum it up, I would say that a specialized course in today's world is given a higher priority in the competitive market."}

I agree that these days, youngsters have started staying aloof, and they have begun to increasingly value their privacy, but this does not mean that they are showing indifference to their communities.\n\nFirst of all, I believe that it is very important to have faith in the community to which the individual belongs, and to make contributions to it. If a person is fully convinced about the ideals and goals of the community, then he or she would show full support and cooperation.\n\nRecently, I heard news that a former student of my college was suffering from brain cancer. As soon as this news hit the campus, many student bodies became actively involved in collecting funds to succor the patient. Thus, the young students showed great enthusiasm in order to further a cause in which they believed strongly.\n\nAlso, in my country, many political parties have special divisions called 'Yuva Shakti' which are entirely comprised of youth, and which have come into existence to exploit the strength that rests in the young generation. These young men and women actively support the party principles and do their every bit to publicize their ideals and objectives. They spend their precious time and effort to help their community.\n\nMany youths also associate themselves with nonprofit organizations, in order to help poor people gain access to various facilities. For example, I am a member of a community that aims at increasing awareness among underprivileged and uneducated people about diseases, their prevention, and symptoms, etc. We go from village to village in order to spread this valuable information. In the last few years that I have been a part of this organization, I have seen a great increase in the number of youngsters willing to join hands for this cause.\n\nThere are numerous other instances in which youngsters have been promising in showing support to the communities they are affiliated with, and so, I believe that they are standing up to the expectations of society and are still fulfilling their responsibilities very well."}

Primarily, the rate at which the environment is getting polluted, it's tough to imagine people having an opportunity to use an automobile, let alone a car. Of course, many eminent people and reformers have joined forces to save the environment from pollution; it can be just regarded as a beginning, or a renaissance in the twenty-first century, going by the number of dramatic reforms and protests going on in order to save 'MOTHER EARTH.'\n\nBasically, in day-to-day activities in the modern-day scenario, a vehicle has become a basic amenity. By vehicle, I mean a car because, on average, every 2 to 8 people use a car in developed and developing nations. A car was a necessity earlier, or a mark of an aristocrat or his associate. But these days, it has become the order of the day to use a plush car, even though there's no impending need for it. Going by the designs that are introduced in the market 'at the drop of a hat' by manufacturers in many nations, it's indeed tough to imagine a pollution-free environment. They are reaping rich profits and soaring to unparalleled heights as far as their bank balance is concerned.\n\nI do not mean that pollution is caused only by uncontrolled vehicle usage, but this definitely plays the most significant role in contributing to environmental degradation. It was given in an article of 'National Geographic Channel's magazine' regarding the hazardous effects of the increase in the number of cars in this century and their subsequent contribution to the degradation cycle. And it's astonishing to note that a staggering 42 percent of pollution is contributed by vehicular pollution. So, in the wake of so many facts coming to light and a few developed nations, superpowers like China amending laws to protect the environment and, more importantly, making their citizens abide by the laws, it just might be tough going for car manufacturers in the future. Actually, people do not use vehicles in Venice, which is supposed to be the pollution-free state in the world.\n\nBut there's a possibility of someone coming out with a breakthrough, like say an eco-friendly car; probably, we might turn to that car. Going by the theory of uncertainty, it's highly unlikely that cars can be operated with the same regularity in the future, owing to the laws of nature, demanding circumstances like environmental degradation, and the spread of various health hazards. There's a bleak future for various car manufacturers who have earned money that'll cushion future generations. I feel that there's an urgent need to address the problems of pollution and health hazards resulting from the harmful gases an automobile may emanate. As they say, 'PREVENTION IS ALWAYS BETTER THAN CURE.' We should take note of these problems and strive to find a fitting solution to the already dilapidated environment."}

Old people have no quality of life, and numerous people are saying that old people are only waiting for death. The contrary shows young people who have a variety of possibilities for how to create their lives and what to do in their leisure time. This implication suggests that young people have a better quality of life than older people. To prove this statement and conclude an opinion, existent facts have to be taken into consideration and evaluated.\n\nMany experts say that old people are not interested in taking part in society after a certain age. Furthermore, they enjoy living isolated and don't want to be members of big communities; they prefer their privacy. However, more and more possibilities for old people to create their lifetime are integrated into society. In addition, numerous old people over the age of 60 are still sporty and modern and not, like many years ago, isolated and frustrated. The interest of old people and their activity in several communities underlines the fact that there is interest, but old people have to be supported and motivated to join different clubs or activities.\n\nSecondly, some people are convinced that mostly all old people are ill and have problems with habits they used to do when they were young. They believe that older persons live with pain and are unable to create their life without help. To a certain extent, there is some truth in it, but because of the continuous innovation and the development of research concerning cancer and other illnesses old people had to deal with many years ago, specialists found many ways to enhance the life quality of old people, which can be seen as a reason for the increased life expectancy of humans.\n\nTo sum up, numerous ways are created to make life more enjoyable for old people, and the positive reaction of old people to different communities and sporty activities shows that they are enjoying their lives, although they are not able to do whatever they want. It cannot be said that young people enjoy their lives more because it is always dependent on your thinking."}
{"file_id": "1064740.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with the statement and do think that understanding ideas and concepts is really important for students. I have three reasons.\n\nFirst, it's quite necessary to understand the ideas and knowledge when students first learn them. In this way, they learn more effectively than by simply memorizing the facts we come across. Also, a good understanding of the knowledge would help students recall what they learned before. If study were all about reciting and memorizing, a computer would be a better student.\n\nSecond, as my teachers always told me, students should learn 'how to learn,' rather than just gaining knowledge. I believe that's the real purpose of education: to teach students how to think and solve new problems they will encounter in the future. My high school could be a bad example. When I studied there, although my teachers emphasized the importance of knowing how to learn, they cared too much about memorizing. This was reflected in the exams. In order to get a good mark on the examinations, all we had to do was copy the facts into our minds. What's worse, the process of study was so fast that we didn't have time to think deeply about the ideas. As a result, I can only remember a few of the things I learned from the high school textbooks now.\n\nIn addition, understanding and thinking deeply about what we learn is how we've developed our cultures from the very beginning! It's the way we gain knowledge from the people before us and create new ideas of our own. Imagine if all students didn't learn how to understand and think deeply; what would the future society be like?!\n\nIn a word, the way I see it, it's not only important but also absolutely necessary for students to understand ideas and think more about what they learn."}

It starts from helping your family with its daily chores, taking care of the neighbors' house while they are away, or spending some time in charity organizations. At the core of all the above is the recognition that we are not just individuals, but part of a community. There is also the sense of gratitude for one's gifts in life, such as youth, health, or any skills, and the sense of enrichment that comes from sharing those gifts and making them useful to others.\n\nOverall, I agree with the idea that young people do not seem focused enough on the needs of their communities, and I actually think that they are fairly detached from the concept of community altogether. I think this is a very complex phenomenon and linked to a great number of reasons.\n\nFirst of all, it seems that our society and culture put a high value on time, especially spare time. Partly because modern life is very demanding, partly because the offer of entertainment and outdoor stimulations is so varied, we prize our time as a supreme luxury and feel very frustrated when we cannot use it in complete freedom.\n\nSecondly, I think Western societies have developed more and more in a hedonistic direction. In other words, we feel it is our own right to enjoy ourselves, feel free in our choices, and simply follow instant gratification. I think this is particularly apparent in young people, as they claim their right to play and have fun, and resent any request for help or support as a form of injustice.\n\nIn a dominant culture of self-absorption and pleasure, taking the time to communicate with people who are different, from background and frame of mind, seems unjustified, and this leads to another worrying trend. It seems to me that there is a general detachment between young people and older generations or people in need. These are generally the people that need more time and support within the community, and it would be the duty of the younger generation to look after them.\n\nIn conclusion, I think that values that have become more and more present in our societies are now central in young people's vision of life. As a consequence, there seems to be a more selfish conception of one's use of time and gifts, that unfortunately leads to the neglect of parts of the community that might be in need."}
{"file_id": "1073764.txt", "output_essay": "If I were asked whether I prefer to try new things or not, I would prefer to try new things for three reasons.\n\nFirst, trying new things may involve a lot of hard experiences and risks. I think changing one's own thinking is very difficult. If I were older, it would be even more difficult. However, I would be able to gain greater advantages. For example, I could switch to a higher-paying job and acquire a larger house.\n\nSecond, trying new things can lead to connecting with many new networks. For example, in work, friendships, and one's own lifestyle, among others. Gaining more intelligent friends might brighten one's life. And if I faced very difficult problems in my life, they could offer good advice. For instance, regarding work, relationships with friends, and so on.\n\nThird, trying new things can lead to a more sensitive mind. Tackling more difficult problems can strengthen one's resolve. Having a stronger heart can enable communication with many kinds of people, I believe.\n\nSo, I think trying new things is better than not trying. I believe selecting many things is good for my life overall."}
{"file_id": "1059344.txt", "output_essay": "\"Life is just one, and we have to subtract from it all we can,\" I mentioned and used that phrase all my life. Since I was a kid, I understood that I had goals, the ones that made me work and continue through school and college. I experienced a lot of things, which made me the man I am today. I took risks during that time, like moving from my town to get a better education, but at the same time, I continued with the same goals and doing what I did best, maths and sciences.\n\nI understand that people do both; they take risks while they do what they know how to do well. For example, a story about a guy who knows how to sell TVs to people. After doing that for a long time for company 'X,' he realized that he could do that kind of job with his own company, and he quit the job. Then he started his own company named after his son's name. That was the huge risk he took, but he understood that people like him had choices, and that he would be successful because he knows how to do the job.\n\nWith that story, an integration of risks and experiences can be observed. He does know where he is good at, and he uses that to try new things. My experience tells me that I should integrate both, as long as they are acceptable. My life is made of experiences, and each day I take risks to keep living.\n\nOverall, I do not agree with the statement, 'Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.' People are the owners of their actions, and success will depend on it. A person can be successful by just doing what they know how to do, or by trying new things, which will take them again to the point of doing what they know how to do.\n\nI know that my future is around sciences, but I do know that I have to take risks to achieve my professional goal, to be a Meteorologist. I have to move from my home country, knowing that it is for my own good. That's the biggest risk I will experience next year, while at the same time I know how to talk to people, make new friends, and take the best from every opportunity I encounter. Success is around the corner, and one should experience it with new things or by just doing what they do best."}

And the interest increases because he understands the idea or the concept of a system.\n\nTake global warming, for example: If a student once understands the connection between the increasing temperature and the effect on the climate, he is able to look deeper, to see how everything is connected. This can be a very fascinating experience. It is also important to have an inspiring teacher who knows how to fascinate his students. If this is the case, the teacher doesn't have to bother the students with boring facts; he just has to explain the idea or concept of a system properly.\n\nIt is also important to give the students time and support to find out things by themselves. The result is an increasing self-confidence. I guess it is like a virtuous circle in a positive kind of way. Once a student has gained more self-confidence, his interest in the matter is growing, the researches are getting more intense, the results are also getting more accurate, and he will learn the facts as a result of his interest, because he wants to know the background.\n\nHe doesn't need to have a boring lesson to learn the facts.

{"file_id": "1076020.txt", "output_essay": "Yes, I agree with the statement that \"Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.\n\nHomo sapiens can be broadly classified into two categories.\n\nThe first category consists of those people who are content to live a risk-free, normal life. They like to get up in the morning, do the house chores, and leave for the office, sit in a cubicle, and spend eight hours, five days a week there. They want to enjoy the weekend with their family and live happily ever after. The main characteristic of this category is that they want to live their life exactly in the same manner as their neighbor is living. The only example that comes to my mind for this category is the COMMON MAN. This is what differentiates them from the other category of Homo sapiens. They make a contribution to society as a whole, but their individual contribution is minimal. They will not be remembered because of the fact that they do what they are told to do.\n\nThe second category of Homo sapiens are those who actually make the world a better place to live in. People in this category have names like Albert Einstein, Thomas Edison, Mahatma Gandhi, Yuri Gagarin, and many others. What makes them special is the fact that they all were curious and excited to explore new areas in their field. Albert Einstein and Thomas Edison made breakthroughs in science, giving us gravity and electricity, respectively. Mahatma Gandhi created ripples in the political world through his approach of non-violent movements. Because Yuri Gagarin dared to enter into space, we were able to think beyond planet Earth. These people had some characteristics similar at root levels. They were ready to work in a monotonous environment. They were ready to risk anything to prove their point."}

As a result, the river has become very clean. Then, the people in the area appreciated them very much. And they are proud of the activity. This shows that young people want to receive the respect of others by helping the community.\n\nSecond, the rise of concern for the environment encourages young people to contribute to their communities. They have had more opportunities to learn about environmental issues. As a result, young people have become more concerned about the environment surrounding them. For example, when I was a freshman at Kyoto University in Japan, there were many lectures about the environment. The university students often join events conducted by the nearby cities for preserving the environment.\n\nThus, I strongly believe that young people contribute to their community.\n\nTherefore, I am strongly against the idea that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities."}
{"file_id": "1061634.txt", "output_essay": "The reasons for success are multiple. On one hand, many people think that to be successful, we need to find new solutions, anticipate new trends, and, by the way, take risks. On the other hand, people tend to think that experience prevails and that the best way to succeed is to focus on and master what you are already able to do. In my opinion, success is directly linked to the risks you are willing to take.\n\nIn the business world, one of the most common words to explain the success of a company is 'innovation.' Nowadays, clients or shareholders are attracted by companies that take risks by offering truly new products. The world is moving and changing; the company that will survive is the one that is able to anticipate new social or economic trends. For example, easyJet is very successful because this firm understood and analyzed the trends of 'low-cost' before anyone else. It was risky compared to the traditional and expensive offer. But finally, easyJet and RyanAir are the most popular.\n\nIndeed, it is quite important to focus on one specialty to be the best in what we do. Nonetheless, people who give priority to experience are more static in their way of thinking and have a weaker ability to adapt to a changing environment. People who take risks, for example in an artistic activity, will be rewarded because they go against a kind of conformism. This is exactly what we are looking for in a globalized economy. To be successful, we need to be 'different' and take risks for that.\n\nTo conclude, exploring new fields brings new business ideas. Risks are the basis of success. Simply put, we can say that 'who dares, wins,' and even if your objective is not to succeed, risks are important in life because they spice up our daily routine."}

Even though the origin of this belief is easy to understand in individualistic countries, I find it difficult to accept the idea that people nowadays don't give enough time to helping their communities.\n\nIndeed, I think that modern societies offer more structures and organizations to allow people to help the community indirectly. For instance, systems such as the social security system in France allow workers to indirectly help people needing health care by paying taxes. If this idea does not seem to apply directly to young people, once again we can argue that young people are indirectly helping their communities. For instance, when they spend time working for school in order to get the needed skills to eventually find a job and contribute to the wealth of the country.\n\nSome people would argue, on the other hand, that governments of modern societies do not offer enough to the people who still need individual help, not only in terms of money but mostly in terms of time. An example could be the lack of volunteers for the care of retired people needing personal help. If one approach consists of blaming the people having free time, like the young people, for their selfishness, an alternative attitude can be to look at who helps, and who doesn't help to change the situation. Modern societies probably reached this point of no return where people got used to relying on the government for social issues. Therefore, it seems reasonable to give more credit to the people who actually act on the government - by the power of voting, by protesting, or taking part in political life - so that social issues become a major concern.\n\nAs a conclusion, there are different ways of helping a community, and we can find, depending on the culture or the country, specific groups of young people who actually give time to make something useful, either by working hard at school or by voting."}

On the other hand, workers (and here I refer also to managers and people who have great responsibilities) also need to be specialized in a certain field. According to my opinion and knowledge, today's market needs people who are specialized but also needs people who can share their knowledge with their colleagues, in order to obtain revenues through synergy and cooperation practices; for this reason, I think that while you are a student, you need to widen as much as possible the spectrum of your knowledge, investigating as many fields as possible. In my view, it is reasonable to improve a specific technical ability just after finishing your studies (or during the last year of your academic career); by behaving in such a way, you could have both the basic wide knowledge to cope with changes, and also the specialization, which could make you the best worker in a certain field at a certain time and in a certain region. For example, workers with a low level of instruction may have many problems in the case of changes in the strategy of their company, or (and this is a more dramatic problem for workers involved in the process) in the case of market revolutions, which make a certain product obsolete or generate the so-called 'killer applications'. So, in order to be an attractive worker for the labor market, you need to specialize your knowledge, but in order to minimize risks and to avoid market changes, you have to widen your knowledge; you also need to improve your capabilities and knowledge after you have finished your studies: this is the so-called 'lifelong learning', which I believe is the best model in modern society."}
{"file_id": "1057852.txt", "output_essay": "One could wonder if, in twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. I personally think that because of a lot of factors we will explore, this statement is not accurate. On my way to this test this morning, I was able to read a copy of the 'Le Monde' newspaper. Inside it, an article stated that the State of California has decided to cut down on CO2 gas emissions by taking car manufacturers to court. The reason I mention this article is that it stated that there are about 36 million cars in California for about 35 million households. In my opinion, California is one of the best examples of a region in which the use of the car is essential in order to be able to move around its vast territory. But California is also the most prosperous of all American states and therefore can demonstrate to us the type of situation that could arise if a country developed to such a scale and therefore had this type of need for cars. It has become common knowledge, or fear, or indeed both for many people, that in twenty years, China will be a lot more prosperous than it is today. If we just considered the fact that its GDP grows at 7% a year, we could say that by 2026, China would have equaled California's prosperity. What makes me tend to refute the proposed statement is the fact that China has a population of about 1 billion; this would probably equate to about 400 million households and therefore potentially about 350 million cars needed by a new prosperous population to wander through their vast country and cities. I am of course not stating that China is a car-free environment at the moment, but the increase in the volume of cars the country experiences today would be monumental. Furthermore, one would have to consider other growing economies such as India. Europe is saturated with cars, and efforts are made in order to diminish pollution by increasing alternative means of transport. But this is possible because the territories are relatively small in comparison to immensities such as India or China. One could also say that, as demographics are increasing, there will always be more people on earth, until we finally destroy it, and therefore more potential car drivers and buyers as a whole. It must also be pointed out that, since the apparition of the Ford T model in the 1920s, the first affordable and mass-produced car, the car has become an object that symbolizes liberty. No indication seems to show that, in the near future, men will invent a new symbol and vector of liberty to replace the car. If they do, the psychological aspect gone, and only the practical aspect of owning and driving a car remaining, we might witness an increase in alternative transportation methods and therefore car usage would slowly decrease. However, it is very unlikely that this will happen during the next twenty years, and even if it did, that twenty years would be enough to witness a drop in car usage. A change of people's psychology takes time. Finally, one has to point out that the argument that petrol will not be available in a couple of decades is not valid. Firstly, this theory has been enunciated many times and new petrol reserves are being found day after day. Secondly, new energy supplies are being developed, such as biofuel or the electric car. The car may be cleaner and even potentially out of date in twenty years, but, as far as the proposed statement is concerned, there will not be fewer of them on a global scale, as long as there will be more humans and more economic growth on this planet."}

I think this fact is displayed in any family that has a grandmother or an elderly person in general, and some children. If it is true that we are used to hearing this kind of thing, I think that the real situation is different.\n\nFirst, I think that when old people talk about their health conditions, it is only another way to say, \"Hello, I am here.\" Afterwards, they probably don't feel so bad as to imply that they feel sick. When you are old, it can happen that you are alone for a long time, with too much time to think. As a result, you start to consider your feelings too much. Imagine if you start to think that your foot hurts; probably after one day, it will really be hurting. Why? It is because the power of our mind sometimes overcomes our own sight. I don't know if it is true, but often I thought to be sick, and in the end, it wasn't anything. So it can be.\n\nSecond, what can you talk about with someone who comes to meet you if you were just sitting, spending your time looking at the street all day? Nothing, I think. But now, let's talk about the young. In my opinion, it is really bad to hear some young person complain about his or her age; probably, he or she is really sick, in his or her mind. It is rare, but sometimes it happens that these kinds of people spend their time continuously claiming to be sick. You are not! You have got the common problems that a person can encounter during his or her age of growth. You are growing.\n\nIn the end, I think that every age has good reasons to be lived. When you are old, it is because of your childhood; when you are young, it is because you are full of energy, the world seems to be at your feet, waiting just for you. So probably the best thing that we can do is to think for ourselves, our achievements, and what will happen tomorrow. Life is such a gamble that we mustn't be bored because sometimes it doesn't go where we want. Life is life, and age as well."}
{"file_id": "1069829.txt", "output_essay": "I disagree with this statement. Based on my personal experience, I believe that specializing in one subject is better than having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects. As an electronics engineer, I understand that electronics is a very broad field; one cannot learn everything about every subject.\n\nFirst of all, if you cannot pick a subject, then in the future, there may be some instability in your knowledge because you are not focused on one subject. The knowledge you have from other subjects can misguide you in one specific area. However, if you are specialized in one subject, then you know all the basics and important parts of that subject, and you become the person that is required for that specific topic wherever you go. For example, my major is Robotics and Control, so I am very experienced in that area. When there is a problem with control systems in the factory, I can easily understand the problem and provide a solution as quickly as possible. But if I were not specialized in any topic, then I would have to analyze the problem, do some research to increase my knowledge, while trying to overcome the confusion in my mind from the knowledge of other topics, and then try to solve the problem. This would take more time and I guess it wouldn't be as effective. Most companies today are based on time effectiveness, and they can't wait for you to increase your knowledge for the job assigned to you.\n\nSecondly, when you have broad knowledge of many academic subjects, it is harder for you to demonstrate your expertise to people. They will ask you, 'What is your area of specialization?' If you say you have broad knowledge on many subjects, most probably they won't accept you because teamwork is the key to success today. Nobody needs a person who says, 'I have very broad knowledge, I can do everything required on my own, I don't need somebody else.' You cannot compete with a team with a mix of specialized knowledge about the topics that are relevant to them.\n\nIn brief, I think it is important to specialize in one specific topic. By doing so, you can work in any team, and with the mix of specialized knowledge, teamwork is the best way to provide solutions to problems. Today, at every company, teams are providing solutions and conducting research, and no one on their own can contribute as much."}

I agree with this statement; young people are energetic and have the curiosity to enjoy and accomplish things. Young people have good friends, they spend a good amount of time with friends, going on vacations, partying on the weekends, and much more. While older people's contacts will be very limited, they only enjoy certain times, like when a relative comes to their house.\n\nFirst of all, young people study at universities, where they not only study but also engage in so many recreational activities. The environment of the university is very good; they enjoy time in canteens with many friends, whereas older people don't have this chance.\n\nSecondly, youngsters are energetic and enjoy a lot by participating in games like playing shuttle and cricket. Other than their amusement, they can keep their health fit.\n\nIn good communities, there may be social organizations at the month's end. Young people participate in these social organizations and may arrange large events like conducting games, providing an orchestra, etc. In games, young people participate extensively and try to entertain other people in the social organization.\n\nUniversities give long vacations at the year's end, which is a good chance for the youngsters to plan and spend lots of time enjoying themselves during their vacations. They can go to other places to see their relatives and find some time to spend with them. Youngsters have the propensity to spend time by watching movies; these movies are interesting, and they enjoy themselves.\n\nTaking into account all these factors, youngsters enjoy life a lot more than older people because of the environment they have in the community."}

There are advertisements on TV, in newspapers, on the radio, on the internet, and on the street. These advertisements may guide us on how to buy a product. It is hard to imagine life without advertisements. Do these advertisements always play a positive role for us? I am afraid that I cannot agree. Too many advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.\n\nThe advertisements will make the product very attractive, so people will buy more and more products under this motive; however, after purchasing, people find that the product is not as effective as advertised. The reason is that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. For example, many medicine advertisements state that the medicine will soothe pains and cure diseases very quickly. People suffering from pains and diseases will buy the medicine because they believe what is promoted in the advertisements. These medicine advertisements have exaggerated the facts. Even though you follow the rules, the medicine will not solve your problems as easily as stated.\n\nFurthermore, in order to attract more audiences to buy the product, the advertisements may even provide false information to make products seem better. I have heard too many stories from my friends that they purchased high-priced cosmetics after seeing advertisements. When they try on the cosmetics, they do not improve the situation at all; some may even harm their skin. I have to say that these advertisements are not responsible at all. They only show us the best examples but do not explain the product in a moderate and correct way.\n\nI do not deny the fact that there may be some advertisements that truly show and promote the product, but I think the number is quite small. Most of the advertisements appear not as good as they really are."}

I agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they actually are. Firstly, advertisements should provide information about what a product offers, including its quality (whether it has reliability and a guarantee). Advertisers who use showy labels and packaging should stop, as they charge even for the packaging, which is expensive. Consequently, ordinary people can't afford these items, even though they are daily household products that are necessary. Secondly, they use celebrities to endorse the product, offering them a royalty from the sales percentage of the commodity. Thirdly, advertisers attract consumers using graphic design and animation, making the products appear more fascinating than they truly are. These tactics are particularly effective on children, compelling their parents to make purchases for them. Dazzling stickers also make the products more appealing. All these factors definitely increase the cost of the commodity. Therefore, I conclude that these kinds of advertisements, I mean, I agree with the quote that 'most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.'"}

Recently, we have seen an increasing number of newly formed organizations that specialize in helping the community. Most of these organizations consist of young people. I do believe that young, motivated people can serve and help their communities.\n\nYoung people are usually highly motivated. However, due to many circumstances, they might not find the time or the appropriate way to help their communities. For example, I am a lawyer, and most of the time, I have to work for 10 to 12 hours per day. During the weekends, I usually have papers to study and review. Therefore, I do not have much time to do any social work. But that does not mean that I don't want to, or that I find helping my community unimportant; it is just that the rhythm of the fast-paced world we live in today forces us to set some priorities first. But I do try my best to participate in any available community work that I can find.\n\nDuring my college years, I did a lot of charity and social work. I was a member of a social club, where we accomplished many beneficial projects that I'm really proud of being a part of. And we were not the only club; there were over 50 clubs at my university. We believe that the important thing is to help people who need a hand and try to make their world a better place. For example, in the summer of 2002, I participated in a project where we had to paint a primary school in a very poor district. The students of this school also helped us with this project, and it just felt great seeing those great smiles of happiness painted on their cute little faces.\n\nI believe that young people are a very important element of society.

Older people have more freedom (they can do whatever they want to and do not have to ask anyone), they earn their living on their own so they are able to plan it better than young people because they do not have to rely on their parents...\nBut I still think that young people enjoy life more than older people do. There are just many more things to do, things to enjoy, for young people. They do not have as many responsibilities as older people, so they do not have as many things to worry about.\nFor example, I said that older people have more freedom, earning their own living. It is true. But what I did not say then is that there is more fun, to me, in enjoying life basically, without any trouble in mind, or much less important ones.\n\nFurthermore, young people often have much more possibilities to meet new people and make new friends than older ones. Older people have to have a job to earn their living. And most of the time, after the first weeks in their company, they will see the same people, colleagues, maybe for the rest of their life. A young person, doing his studies, meets a lot of new people each year when he comes to a new class. He could even meet more new people if he changes universities.\n\nSo young people meet more people, make more friends, have more fun, and have fewer problems to worry about...\nWell, I am also excited to get older and have more freedom and responsibility every day, but I think that I may regret these years one day."}

However, there are also a lot of people with strong principles who enjoy expressing themselves in strikes, forums, etc. There are people who take part in different sorts of Non-Governmental Organizations, for which they spend most of their free time.\n\nMoreover, it is possible to see people cleaning the forests during the weekend, helping in hospitals, and volunteering in local campaigns for the adaptation and integration of foreign people.\n\nNon-Governmental Organizations have changed the way of working in the human rights field by introducing the figure of the volunteer.

{"file_id": "1079141.txt", "output_essay": "I think basic knowledge is necessary, but in my opinion, our society needs more people who are familiar with one specific subject. Having broad knowledge does not necessarily help you solve a specific problem. In my home country, for example, there are many people who can handle a computer, but there are only a few who have enough knowledge to deal with certain problems on their own. That's one reason why many computer firms hire people from countries like India. This situation is not so good for our inhabitants because often they do not get a job.\n\nThis is only one example of why specialization has advantages for the economy of a country. There is no doubt that employees need broad knowledge to be flexible if they, for example, lose their job, which is a great problem in our country. But I think if there are experts for almost every area, a country's economy has many advantages, although it is very risky for the inhabitants to specialize because they may not get a job in their specific academic subject.\n\nBut as I said, there are many advantages that support the idea of specializing in one specific area. However, it should be considered what size and capacity the firm has. A big company has many employees, and so each employee can handle a problem on his own. If he needs to know anything about another subject, he can ask another expert for help. So with the help of teamwork, they can nearly solve every problem. In smaller businesses, this looks a bit different because small firms cannot afford so many employees. So for smaller businesses, it is better to have broad knowledge so that you can solve many different problems."}

It can be very useful when one wants to interact with other people. It is essential to share ideas and thoughts with others. In professional life, for instance, if somebody in a company has to work with another department, his task will be much easier if he knows a little bit about the activity of that department. Even if it is not a complete understanding, it will be appreciated by the other party.\n\nTo give another example, related to personal life this time, it is very agreeable to be able to argue or discuss when we meet someone new. Without this broad knowledge, how would we make contact, at least at the beginning? We would obviously miss the opportunity to get in touch with people. I would say that having a broad knowledge is really a plus in life; it is like the promise to be welcomed and integrated almost wherever we go.\n\nOn the other hand, I think we cannot only be satisfied with broad knowledge. We need to go further sometimes. We need to be involved in something exciting to keep a goal in our life. And this cannot be achieved without being specialized in one subject. Again, professionally speaking, it is essential to be specialized. Nobody can aspire to a job, which is something specific of course, if one does not know enough about this particular topic. That is why we usually start our studies with general education, a broad knowledge, and then, gradually focus, year after year, on what we want to do.\n\nPlus, I think it is something very valuable for a human being to delve into something, to prove to ourselves that we are capable of doing something special, something that defines us.\n\nTo conclude, I would say that both approaches are necessary. We need both to learn things about our environment, about the world, in order to interact, but we also need to specialize, by saying, 'I can bring you this; I can be helpful with this.'"}
{"file_id": "1069410.txt", "output_essay": "I do not believe that young people enjoy life more than older people. What makes a young person happy may not make an older person happy. To 'enjoy life' is a very subjective concept that varies according to age, cultural background, religious beliefs, social environment, and many other factors. From my own experience, I learn to enjoy life every day.\n\nWhen I was a child, I was completely unable to socialize, to relate to other children, and have fun with my friends. Family problems that I was going through made me a very shy girl. On many occasions, I could not find the way out of uncomfortable situations. The inability to ask for help made my childhood pretty sad.\n\nYoung people today have, sometimes, problems expressing what makes them happy because of 'peer pressure.' Most of the teenagers who are 'followers' (meaning not leaders) may find themselves in awful situations, doing and performing acts they don't want to do. As we grow up, we dare to be different. We learn to say 'no' and do not feel bad about it. Our personalities get stronger, and we feel more comfortable with who we are.\n\nAs we grow up, we learn to overcome obstacles, and as we get older, we get wiser and learn from our own experiences and others' experiences. The more we know about ourselves, the easier we find our way to happiness. It takes time to discover and understand what makes us happy. That wisdom to understand and comprehend what joy means to us comes with age, with a life full of experiences, mistakes, and successes.\n\nI strongly believe the opposite of that statement. A shy girl who does not know how to ask for help, or a teenager who feels oppressed by his or her peers, and a life with no experience will certainly have a harder time finding happiness, to enjoy life. As I get older, I get wiser. When I make a mistake, I learn from it. I heard a long time ago that growing older is mandatory, growing up is optional. I agree with that."}

Therefore, it is sort of commonly accepted that older people are not enjoying their lives, or at least less than younger people. We will discuss both sides of this statement and will express our final point of view as a conclusion.\n\nYoung people have fewer responsibilities than older ones: older people are responsible for younger ones! As an example, it is rare to see parents buying firecrackers to make a joke on their neighbor, whereas it is cliché for youngsters to do so. Young people don't have to work to support their family; they attend classes and have a lot of activities; they are young and they enjoy themselves because they simply have fewer responsibilities. But this is a youngster's point of view. Do older people really enjoy their life less than younger people?\n\nObviously not. For example, having a family and giving birth to offspring is enjoyable, perhaps the most enjoyable thing in the world! If older people enjoyed their lives less than younger ones, our world would be a very sad place... Thus, some young people do not enjoy their life, and some old people obviously do. The statement can't be true because of this simple fact. Honestly, if older people didn't enjoy themselves as much as younger ones, would it be worth living this life? Obviously, if life is not enjoyable, then life loses its primary purpose, and living this life would be purposeless.\n\nI think the statement is a young person's point of view and is not really well thought out. At first, we feel it is true, but in fact, it is because what we think is enjoyable or not changes as we get older! Loving to read poetry at the age of 13 is rare, but at the age of 65, it can be fully appreciated and understood because the person has more experience and can grasp the essence of it. I think that how we enjoy ourselves is different, but no one enjoys themselves more than someone else, based on their age. Enjoying life is universal and has no age. Young people enjoy life as much as older people do, and vice versa."}

They do not think about their future. However, this case is not true for the entire younger generation.\n\nOn the other hand, older people can enjoy their lives. They have comfortable time and money. Older people who have a career and good health can certainly enjoy life. Also, they could be good role models for the younger generation. Even my parents usually have a short trip together on weekends.

{"file_id": "1062900.txt", "output_essay": "Advertisements are usually a particular kind of product developed by many people working together, each with a different role and skill set. These individuals are paid by companies and have a vested interest in improving the company's profits; if they don't, they risk losing their jobs. I think this is enough to show how advertisements present products in a better way than they really are.\n\nFirst, when a company decides to spend money on advertisement, it is usually expecting a reward from that investment. An advertising campaign is costly. For this reason, they expect more people will buy the product in order to achieve a higher profit.\n\nThis is why people who produce advertisements have to attract more buyers than their competitors and so will try to present their products as the best ones people can desire to buy. They must convince people that by buying, they are making the right choice.\n\nSecond, people who are paid to produce advertisements have a variety of skills; they usually know a lot about marketing and understand their target audience.\n\nFor example, some days ago I was in the library and was really surprised when some boys and girls near me began to talk about a marketing research project they were developing. They didn't care at all about the quality of the product; they were just focused on how to sell it. They tried to find the best way of convincing people and didn't care at all about being honest in their approach.\n\nMoreover, I can surely add some personal experience. For example, I have an eleven-year-old sister who is always asking my mom for many products she sees in advertisements. Sometimes my mother buys her the product she wants, and even if she spends a lot of money doing so, often they are not high-quality products. I've noticed this can happen easily with products sold to kids or teenagers because this demographic usually cares less about quality and more about how the product itself appears.\n\nIn conclusion, my opinion is that advertisement is often a way of earning more profits for companies or a way of creating a brand name. The market itself is competitive. How can they reveal the weaknesses of their products?"}

So, young people and older people both enjoy their life, but in their specific ways.\n\nOlder people, of course, have more time to work in their field to make money for their family. Sometimes they cannot have a break all day long. Even in Asian countries, older people cannot have a vacation all year round. They have great loyalty to their family. Although they may complain about their life like this, they will not leave it. Sometimes they enjoy this situation, having the chance to support their family by themselves and to raise their children in better circumstances. This is the life they actually enjoy every day.\n\nYoung people cannot help enjoying their time every day. They have no responsibility to work for someone except for simple homework. So young people have much more time to spend on themselves. In my experience, more time does not mean more joy. In fact, young people often spend time more uselessly than older people do. But it is obvious that if young people can manage their life valuably, they have much more chance to really enjoy their life.\n\nIn conclusion, the critical point about this question is not the quantity but the quality of life management. Although older people have less time for themselves to enjoy than younger people, they can manage their life more valuably, so they can enjoy the result."}

I completely agree with the statement that 'successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.' This can be well explained by citing some examples of a few legends in different fields, like the ones that have been mentioned below.\n\nFirstly, I would like to start with the richest person in the Indian market, Dhirubhai Ambani, who was once working as a vegetable vendor. He was a master at selling those vegetables, no doubt, but he drew interest in the communication field and started researching in that area. It's a completely different field that he opted for, but the determination he had in his work and the confidence he had in his ability made him a successful person, and finally, he became the master in that field.\n\nSecondly, the all-time legend in the field of cricket, Sachin Tendulkar, was pursuing his engineering because he wanted to become a successful engineer but had a lot of interest in cricket. So, he opted for cricket after he got into engineering, though it was a big risky decision that he had taken up, he was ready to work hard for that. And now, he's a renowned cricketer. The risk that he had taken was a huge one, but it really paid off.\n\nThus, I certainly feel that a person who is versatile in his work and at the same time diversified in his thinking and morals can become a successful person. Thus, a successful person is not the one who takes risks but at the same time strives hard for that and makes his risky decision count at the end of the day."}

Actually, we move in a very high-stress world (obviously, in developed countries), that sometimes does not allow people to enhance their human values and their involvement in their communities.\n\nProbably, many years ago, young people did not use to do such things that young people, at this moment, do. We had more relationships with each other and also we had more dependence on the rest of the people. Industrialization, technical developments, new discoveries, independence, competition, stress... have really changed the world.\n\nFirstly, parents want to give their children everything they didn't have when they were children, and in many cases, they are making a mistake, and in this way, young people can't appreciate the value of things and the cost of them.\n\nSecondly, sometimes a child's schedule is like a minister's schedule. I mean, it seems that they have to fill all their time in the whole day, going to school, learning music, sports, languages, and many other things that you could imagine. After that, they arrive at home totally exhausted, so they don't have the strength to spend another part of their time helping their communities. At least, this is what is happening in middle-class families in Spain, the place where I live.\n\nThirdly, they have a great adversary, TELEVISION!!! Oh my God!! I think it is the principal and most horrible enemy of our young people today; they could spend all their time watching it.\n\nFinally, I must say that we could try to avoid many things and be more creative with our children, and encourage them to value human relationships. Only in this way could they probably help their communities."}

Every part of the community must work to build it up.\n\nEvery person in the community must work towards achieving the community's goals. They should exert effort to reach these goals. By improving their societies, they improve themselves. Everyone should participate in helping the community. Every thoughtful person must encourage and motivate others to help in any way. For example, those who can afford it might contribute extra money to a charity that helps poor young people to learn in schools, provides food for them, homes, and perhaps clothes. Young people who may not be able to contribute financially could offer their services by teaching young kids, babysitting, preparing food, or organizing collections. Perhaps they could arrange certain days for specific activities, like a cleaning day or week, where everyone of a certain age comes to share in the cleaning.\n\nYoung people must improve their skills and themselves by reading and learning, especially in third-world countries. They need to help raise their countries and communities. Young people could hold meetings to discuss how to improve their societies and communities. I believe there are many ideas for engaging young people in contributing to their communities. They must be willing to put forth some effort. I am convinced that if young people take action, they will do so in perfect ways that lead to their communities being built up and improved.

{"file_id": "1073628.txt", "output_essay": "Some people may believe this is true, but I totally disagree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do. From my point of view, I think that young people do not enjoy their life more than older people. First of all, young people have less spare time than older people because they are young, they have a lot of working pressures and long working hours. They must strive for their future by working hard. Therefore, they do not have much spare time for their interests. However, older people have fewer working responsibilities and shorter working hours than young people, and many of them are retired from their work. They can spend more time with family and pursue hobbies they are interested in.\n\nSecondly, older people have more friends than young people. As time passes, older people have been in society for many years, so they have met a lot of people and can have fun with many friends. It is really a happy thing to stay with many friends, and there must be a pleasant atmosphere.\n\nFinally, older people have fewer living pressures than young people. Many older people have already retired from their work. They don't think much about how to keep their job or how to make more money. They have already done this when they were young. Now, the only thing they need to think about is how to spend the rest of their life enjoying the wonderful things in the world. They can travel to many beautiful places in their spare time, and they can visit their friends and have fun with them. They do not think much about work and just play for fun. However, young people still face heavy work and pressure from society. So, they cannot enjoy themselves as much as older people do. Taking my father and my grandmother as examples, my father works more than 40 hours a week to earn money to afford my study fees abroad, and he does not have much time for fun. However, my grandmother has a lot of spare time and fewer working pressures, so she can enjoy a lot of fun activities with her friends.\n\nTherefore, from the reasons I listed above, I think that older people enjoy their life more than young people do because they have more spare time, more friends, and fewer working pressures."}
{"file_id": "1080849.txt", "output_essay": "While life can be enjoyed by people in all phases of life, I personally believe that young people enjoy life more.\n\nThe main factor in favor of young people is their high energy levels. Young people are full of life and like to experiment with different options. Such experimentation builds their life experiences. Exercising different options provides multiple opportunities to enjoy life.\n\nYounger people have higher physical strength to endure outdoor activities. For example, while a senior citizen may require detailed planning and preparation before they can take on an adventure camping, young people could combine their youth with a sense of adventure to take up such a trip with little or no planning.\n\nYoung people also have time on their side to take risks. Unlike older people, who are risk-averse, young people can take higher risks. Young people realize that in case of any negative consequence, they will have time to repair the damage. This risk-friendliness allows young people to stretch their limits and enjoy life to the fullest.\n\nWhile it is true that young people do not have as much time in their schedules as compared to older people, to enjoy life, time is not the sole requirement. Young people have multiple outlets to enjoy life—at work, home, or while socializing. Hence, a person need not wait until retirement to enjoy life.\n\nMost of life's enjoyments also require the commitment of financial resources. It is likely that smart older people would have achieved financial success to enjoy life; however, it is more probable that young people will have more expendable income to enjoy life.\n\nIn conclusion, while life can and should be enjoyed in every phase, young ones should capitalize on this opportunity. Young people have all the supporting factors in their favor to enjoy life to the fullest."}

I believe that young people enjoy life more than older people because they are healthier, they have more time, and they like to go out even when they are busy.\n\nYoung people are healthier than older people. When people go out, they mostly see young people playing outside and enjoying themselves. For example, every day I go outside with my friends to play football and other games if we don't have a lot of schoolwork.\n\nOlder people are always busy with their work, so they do not have as much time to enjoy life as younger people do. Older people need to make time for enjoyment. I always ask my father to set aside time for us to have fun and go out, but he always says yes and has not done it yet.\n\nWhen older people are busy, they do not take breaks to rest, but younger people give themselves time when they feel angry or tired. For example, I give myself time when I am tired, but my father does not, and when I asked him why, he did not give me an answer.\n\nIn short, everyone who is younger will enjoy life more than older people. In my opinion, everyone should enjoy every moment of their life."}

A wide knowledge of academic topics is needed for responsible jobs such as politicians or higher managers. In some situations, they do not have a lot of time to decide what would be right or wrong. In such cases, they have to know things clearly and precisely to avoid wrong decisions.\n\nAnother point is the educational sector of work. People who work in this category have to know the majority of their subject and very detailed as well. Professors or just a regular teacher have the duty to have a broad knowledge because they must answer questions immediately and precisely.\n\nOther jobs may not require a huge knowledge of academic subjects because there are jobs that need a vast background of knowing all details and all information existing on one specific issue. People working in labs do not need to know all about chemistry when they do repetitive work such as reproducing specific drugs.\n\nTherefore, easy or repetitive work does not own the necessity to have wide knowledge.\n\nIn conclusion, it is necessary to distinguish between the huge differences in our modern job world. As I mentioned before, it is not possible to give an overall answer to this topic, and it is useful to examine every case separately."}

On the one hand, I think many young people are egotistic today; on the other, I know that it is not easy to manage social ambitions today, especially for the youth. I can imagine the young people because I am one of them.\n\nI do not help in my community, nor do I work in a social program. The reasons for that are my limited time between the duties which fill my whole day. I think the possibility to help without any pay in communities is better at a younger age for children, from eleven to fifteen. Many older young people are busy with their education and own future, and too young children may not have the confidence or the responsibility to work for the community.\n\nMuch of the work which is to be done in German communities is made by so-called young people who have finished school. If they do not want to go to the army, they can choose social work in communities, hospitals, etc. The truth is that young people do not help for free. They are always looking for payment and do not do any help beneficially. I am sure that there are many things which young people could do in a community."}
{"file_id": "1076207.txt", "output_essay": "The speaker hits the truth when he says that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. Commercials were originally a mode of informing consumers about the availability of a product. But over the years, the sheer innocence of an old banner proclaiming the opening of a new KFC restaurant in the neighborhood has been lost in the relentless wrath of commercialization.\n\nToday, a commercial informing the viewers of what the product actually is would not even be noticed, much less lure prospective buyers to a hopeful brand. In the deadlock of efficient brands we find ourselves in today, advertisements need to be one step ahead of each other, a phenomenon previously seen only among the firms employing them. And this very much involves enhancing the features of the product they endorse.\n\nThe world of advertising revolves around competition offered by others, and that has brought it to such a stage where enhancing a product is a common practice. Probably the most appropriate example would be that of a recent advertisement my eyes fell on a few days back. It promised a 'mansion draped in greenery,' but the actual house was ironically different. It was a modest two-bedroom flat, hardly something you could refer to as a mansion. But sometimes advertisements cross the limits of what would still be classified as acceptable. Perhaps the most blatant of these are the ones employed by the automobile industry. In a recent controversy, one automobile dealer in New Delhi was fined and barred from operating for a year because he had promised a prospective buyer a sedan, which turned out to be a mess of pure lies and thievery.\n\nAlthough sheer malpractice is evident in this 'enhancement' of products, some people still advocate the validity of these advertisements. A recent survey in the United States of America brought to light a staggering number of people who see nothing wrong in this new trend. It only goes to show one thing; that we have learned to live with it and, although unwanted, it has become an integral part of advertising today. So much so, that all you need to do to be sure of it is look into the local newspaper. Even though it might not tickle our fancy, if statistics are anything to go by, this practice is here to stay."}

For instance, a manager has to know advertising and also have knowledge of accounting in order to be effective.\n\nAs far as I'm concerned, it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject. There are many advantages and disadvantages to having broad knowledge of many subjects. However, I want to explain its advantages because they are more significant than the disadvantages.\n\nFirst of all, knowledge does not damage the brain. It is always useful. For example, I am a math teacher; nonetheless, I have many hobbies like painting. I took courses on this topic, such as drawing and colors. My friend invited me to an exhibition; as a result, this knowledge about painting gives me an advantage, such as having intellectual knowledge.\n\nSecondly, life is so complex and full of tasks that we need various kinds of knowledge at different times in our lives. Consequently, it makes our life easier. Let me explain this with an example. For instance, I am a student, and in my daily life, I don't need knowledge of economics, such as interest rates. But on the other hand, when I want to be a cashier in a bank, the manager might ask me during my job application if I know what the interest rate is, how it is calculated, and how it affects the amount of money. Thus, without this knowledge, I have no chance; I have to know it if I want the job. Consequently, it makes my life easier, such as when attending a job interview to earn money.\n\nMost important of all, people who have broad knowledge of many academic subjects are always achievers. For instance, I read about Einstein's life a week ago and understood that Einstein was one of these kinds of people. He had a wide range of knowledge about everything, such as science and also math. This knowledge enabled him to establish new scientific research.\n\nAll in all, having knowledge of many subjects makes our life easier and also makes us happier while simultaneously leading to success."}

First of all, because I know many boys and girls that do not enjoy their everyday lives. They seem to need something else; they are not able to be happy with what they do. Everything becomes a problem: the wedding, the children, the job. I recognize that we live in difficult times, with political affairs and the economy not being very good, and there is also the war... But I ask myself: what are the differences between the actual and past times? My father told me about the Second World War, and also about the problems he had had finding something to eat and then the problems he had had finding a job. My father died three years ago, but I think he enjoyed his life more than many young people. I want to talk about another point: marriage. I see that many people now prefer divorce to the possibility of solving their problems. I do not understand this position very well. For me, having a family is a way to improve our life, but probably I am wrong because many people I know do not think the same way. They want to enjoy living alone or going out until 5 or 6 a.m., so they refuse the idea of building a family until they are 35 or 37 years old. Probably I am the first person who does not enjoy her life enough. I try every day to put passion and love into what I do, especially since the time I have been living alone; now I have no father and no mother, but I see that if I am correct with other people, I am not alone."}

This is because feeling satisfaction through the trip and spending time well are important.\n\nFirst of all, people have to be satisfied with their trip. People usually want to see, hear, eat, and feel what they want and have wanted when they are traveling. However, in a group tour, people cannot experience whatever they want because they have to follow their guide. For example, when I went to Paris alone, I unwillingly took part in a guided tour one time to go to a museum because the museum entrance fee is cheaper for groups. Unfortunately, I did not have satisfaction with the guided tour for the museum, because there were so many people, so I couldn't see all that I wanted to see and couldn't get as much information as I expected.\n\nIn addition, traveling individually is better for spending valuable time. Time cannot be returned or used again, so it is very important how to use time. However, in a group tour, it is easy to waste people's valuable time. To demonstrate, according to research at Harvard, individual trips spend time two times more effectively than group tours. Moreover, according to this study, people who travel individually are also more satisfied with their time consumption and overall traveling experience.\n\nIn brief, the best way to travel is individually, not in a group, because it makes for a better experience during the trip and more efficient use of time."}

They mostly indulge in activities that they want to do or in having things they desire, instead of looking at the problems affecting their homes and localities.\n\nI myself, being a young person and living alongside numerous other fellows in a hostel, have lots of experiences of such neglect shown by young individuals towards social and community needs. Most of the time spent by young people goes mainly into fun activities like partying, gaming, chatting, etc., or either into studying, preparing for exams. There seems to be no thought process in the mind that deals with the immediate difficulties, shortages, or problems that are going around the place which need to be solved.\n\nFor example, in our institution, there is a major problem of standing water bodies in and around campus which provides a typical breeding ground for mosquitoes that can cause dangerous infections to the locals living in and around the area. But despite this, there seems to be no concern shown by the students who themselves might be affected by it. The situation can grow worse if not taken seriously. Effective measures can be applied with the help of young students if they are willing.\n\nSimilarly, there are issues like the education of poor workers and their children, who work on the campus for the construction of new buildings. Young students can really help such poor people by organizing free weekly or monthly classes within the area, and it could be of great help to the children who can think of having a much better life in the future. But till now, nothing has been done by the young people living here.\n\nYoung people mostly don't listen to the advice given by seniors or elderly people. They always do what they feel is right. Spending time to help communities is not the popular choice in their minds. Going by what I have seen in my campus hostels, most young people, including me, like having fun, going to bars and restaurants, having nice unending chats, or just studying the curricular courses and interest-related subjects. Spending time for social and community services is not there nowadays among young people."}

I disagree with the statement that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject. Specializing in one specific subject is a more definite way to succeed, it lets you focus better, and it is less stressful.\n\nOne reason to support my opinion is that specializing in one specific subject is a more definite way to succeed in the future. I feel that having a broader knowledge of many academic subjects only helps you in your childhood. Trying to earn good grades in all of the classes you are taking may be the pressure for thinking that it is better to have a broad knowledge. Having a broad knowledge may also set you off to find what you are good at. However, I believe that what is most important is what you become, and working hard on what you are good at would actually get you somewhere in life.\n\nAnother reason why I feel that specializing in one subject is better than having a broad knowledge of various subjects is so you could focus better. Trying hard on one subject when you know you have to study for another one could be distracting. I feel that working hard for one subject would let you concentrate better.\n\nFinally, I feel that it is less stressful to specialize in one subject. For example, I believe that it is difficult for someone to be good in both writing and mathematics. I believe that people usually do not like what they are not good at. If there are subjects that you would prefer not to take because you know that you are not good at them, you should rather work hard in a subject you know you like to do. My friend, who is very talented in arts, is unfortunately not very talented in mathematics. So, what she does is that she does not take any mathematics classes.

People receive information faster, the world becomes smaller, and many things are interrelated. Therefore, society needs elites who are well-rounded; people have to know more than one aspect of a specific subject and should have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects.\n\nStudying widely can teach people many different ways to solve various problems. It gives people a wide perspective. Different courses have different logic for solving problems. For example, in Geometry, problems are usually solved using diagrams, lines, and curves. A Data course uses a logical approach to think about questions. So, when people encounter a problem, they can think about it and solve it in different ways.\n\nHaving a broad knowledge of many academic subjects can make people feel confident. They can know many things in different areas. They can have topics and ideas to discuss with other people. Just like a student at a party, if he/she has a broad education, he/she can communicate with people who study other majors. If a person only studies one specific subject, it is hard to find topics to communicate about with others, leading to silence in the corner. This lack of interaction can result in a loss of confidence.\n\nIn conclusion, it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.

First of all, when we were young, we tried lots of new things because we had to, but sometimes, we took risks to be successful. I believe successful people are different from normal people; they are not scared of risks, so they try new things. Therefore, we always enjoy new high-technology products because they try.\n\nSecondly, if people just do the same thing over and over, they will not know what they are good at, and they will never improve themselves. They should try new things when they are young, to tell themselves they can do what other people did, even better than them. For example, you are the vice president in a company because you did a good job in the company, but the president gets fired. You want to keep your position or get the highest position if you take the risks, which is getting fired by the boss. You never know if you don't try.\n\nThirdly, since we already did well in something, why don't we challenge a higher level to widen our horizons?

For example, you work in one store for a long time, you have already tried lots of things, learned a lot in the store, you know how to run a company and do well, and now you want to open your own store.

Everything is organized and put in a way that each little thing is different from the other. The perfect example of this is a career in college. The programs are divided into faculties, and the careers that a person can choose from, like Engineering, Business, Teaching, Music, Medicine, etc. Each one of the aforementioned is specialized in a field of study and deals with different aspects of knowledge, such as Math, Biology, Languages, Politics, etc. A world of possibilities.\n\nIt is not possible for a human being to know all about something; just a little bit of everything. If a person dedicates their entire life to studying astronomy; investigating, conducting studies, asking questions, promoting projects, etc., they will surely go far and acquire a huge knowledge in this field. That person will go beyond someone who studies a little bit of many academic subjects. This takes time and effort, and there is not enough time in a human being's life to gain knowledge in many different subjects and get as far as if they were specializing in one specific subject.\n\nIn school, children acquire all the basic knowledge they need to start. Then it is their decision to pursue the subject that they are most interested in. This does not mean that a person has to specialize in one and only one subject and cannot know anything about anything else.

{"file_id": "1076556.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with the following statement. In my opinion, successful people are successful only because, at one point in their life, they were faced with a challenge and they had to take a risk in order to succeed. People that only stick to what they are good at will only be 'good,' yet they will not succeed if they do not take risks and face new challenges.\n\nTrying new things, ideas, and being able to overcome new challenges is what defines a successful person in my opinion. For example, if a person is quite gifted at a certain sport and is considered talented, it is still not enough for him to be 'labeled' as successful. This person will have to test his abilities against other people, try improving these abilities, and risk injury or loss, and improve even more in order to move forward and become successful. If this person did not risk losing to people better than him and overcoming them, he would never know how good he actually is.\nAnother example could be opening a new business. If a businessman does not risk losing some of his money while starting the business, he would not be able to make up for his loss and gain even more money. Not only is it important for a person to face new challenges to improve on himself, but it is also important to proceed forward, and see his level compared to other people or any other competition around him.\n\nFacing new challenges and taking risks is the only way a person would be able to succeed in life overall. Talent is important, yet it's not the only factor towards success. All the famous athletes, businessmen, superstars, etc., have faced many challenges and were able to overcome them regardless of how talented they were, and that's what makes them successful."}

For example, if a scientist didn't try new experiments, and went to new places, and learned new concepts, he could never come up with a fact that everybody studies and knows.\n\nUsually, a fact is more respected than a concept because the fact is certain, and it's there to see or to check, but the concept may be a little frightening because it's hard to predict whether it is going to be a fact or if people will simply forget it. Therefore, people prefer to study a fact-filled major than a concept major at the university.\n\nAll the new cars and the new buildings start as a concept, and the engineers modify it as they want, and when they are all done, they start doing the project. After the project is introduced, it becomes a fact for everyone who doesn't know about the concept in the first place.\n\nDenying that facts are important in our lives is wrong, but I think that they are less important than the concepts. For example, the fact is a result of long-time thinking and studying, ready to read and learn in a number of lines, so it is much easier to learn an existing fact than to think about one using concepts and ideas.\n\nFinally, if a person wants to get the best possible knowledge, he should consider and study both facts and ideas because the start of every fact is to prove the idea and introduce the concept."}

There are various points for me to discuss this issue.\n\nFirstly, young people are mobile. In other words, they have young minds, young blood, and dynamic energy. If someone is mobile, they can reach anywhere to satisfy their need to live life and make it full without any compromise. Whereas older people are at an age at which they have at least one problem, which makes them immobile. At this age, they are out of energy and likely to have at least one health problem, making them stay at home and dependent.\n\nSecondly, young people are engaged in at least one task like studying, working, etc., and this makes them come in touch with lots of people and new friends. This gives them the opportunity to make new friends, with whom they can enjoy life by weekends, long drives, etc. On the other hand, older people are handicapped in this regard since they are compromised through health, which makes them sit at home and alone with their health. So, no health, no going out, no friends, and no enjoyment of life.\n\nMoreover, young people are twenty-first-century people. They utilize all the latest technology by gaining its knowledge through reliable sources, since they are intelligent enough to utilize it and convert it into a new source of enjoyment of life. On the other hand, older people still have an older mindset which is outdated enough for the enjoyment of life.\n\nIn conclusion, younger people do have enough energy, the chance to make friends, and adequate knowledge to live life at its fullest, which older people lack."}

They also enjoyed their lives at that time. This is the reason why they always give suggestions to young people about how to enjoy their boring lives.\n\nFirst, they cannot do what young people are doing with their fresh bodies anymore. They want to do the movements that young people do, but their bodies don't allow them to. They cannot understand what is going on because they were once healthy and could do what they wanted with their legs, their hands, and other organs, but they can't use these organs anymore. It's like a drama for them in which they are acting the main character.\n\nSecond, young people are excited about this because it is a new field for them; they were born and they didn't experience this life in their mother's womb, life is starting from the beginning for them. It's normal to try everything, especially for fun. Human beings can live on this earth only once, and you cannot choose your end, so human beings must enjoy their lives. Young people are much braver than old people because they can do everything they want to with their bodies, but old people can't do those kinds of actions. They have regular lives and they support their children to do what they personally can no longer do. Young people enjoy it when their children can do what they advise them to. They really enjoy it when the children listen to their suggestions.\n\nIn my opinion, young people have advantages in enjoying their lives, and they know what will be in the future."}
{"file_id": "1071692.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. Consider scientist Einstein, who developed the power and light source for the world because he had conducted his experiment sixteen times and he saw the same result, which was failure. But he never gave up and conducted the same experiment a seventeenth time, and at this moment, he achieved a result and became one of the most recognizable persons in the world. There are so many people who try until success meets them.\n\nNow, we look at the present technology and the innovations that are happening in the world. Before the centuries, if a person wanted to develop power, there was no way for obtaining it. But another scientist named Edison, who is famous for his wooden block model bladeless turbine, which is used to develop power from water. He might not have been a successful person at the beginning of the era, but he conducted many experiments and revealed the result from greater risks and won an international award given by the American society.\n\nI disagree with those people who will do the same things that they have already known. Because God has gifted people with superficial knowledge, and one has to aspire to that knowledge and should increase their potential skills to develop new models. When people do things that are very known to them, they will never obtain something different in their life, and they always seem to be in the same position. One should try for new things which involve risks and many hurdles, but when you pass through the risks, there will be a result waiting for you. So, everyone should try for a new thing.\n\nLet us consider an example of the person named Newton because he was unaware that he would be the most successful person in the world in the field of science. He was just sitting under a tree when suddenly an apple fell on him, and he questioned himself immediately about how it falls, and as a result, he discovered Newton's law of motion. So, I would like to conclude that when a person takes risks and passes through the difficulties and hurdles instead of doing the same thing that was well known, he will meet success."}

It is true that it is easier to work on tasks with numerous strategies that have already been discovered. However, I strongly believe that truly successful people try new things and take as many risks as they need.\n\nTo begin with, although money is not always the best material to measure one's success, most billionaires started something on their own for the first time. Bill Gates created the Microsoft program to improve people's efficiency in using computers at affordable costs before anybody else thought of it. To pursue that business, he had to drop out of Harvard University and concentrate solely on his new venture. It must have been a hard choice to make, since Harvard is an extremely competitive school to get into. Now, Bill Gates is one of the richest men in the world.\n\nMy own father is another good example of the same situation. Born to a poor family, he entered the hardest medical school in my hometown in South Korea through his own efforts. However, he changed his major to engineering, giving up the easy path to success by staying in medical school. After studying in the engineering school, he pioneered biomedical engineering and became the first doctor of biomedical engineering in Korea by founding the subject at his college. If he had not done this, he would surely have been a medical professional, but not the first biomedical engineer in the nation.\n\nI myself have already taken one big risk in order to be successful—coming to America. I could have continued my education at high-level institutions in my native country, as a selected student in science in previous years. Yet, I had a strong desire to try new things, even at the cost of risking what might seem important at a certain moment, and I still do. Of course, there are many obstacles I need to overcome, but I believe it will pay off if I try hard enough, just like Bill Gates and my dad did in their youth."}
{"file_id": "1082308.txt", "output_essay": "Some people think that nowadays young people do not help their communities as much as they should. I think this statement may be true for some people, but not for many other young people who actually make a great effort to help the communities where they live.\n\nIt is true that modern society is becoming more and more individualistic, and this means that more people only care about themselves, disregarding the lives and potential problems of other people living in their community. This phenomenon is especially affecting young people, as they are growing in a society in which the most important values are related to personal achievements. The position a person occupies, the salary he or she receives, the comforts of his or her house, the car, the clothes, and other material things that a person may own are nowadays far more important than the ethics of a person and his or her behavior towards other human beings and the place he or she inhabits.\n\nHowever, it is not fair to affirm that all young people act in that way. There are many young people that really help their communities in many different ways. Some of them apply to take part as volunteers in programs designed to help people with different kinds of problems that range from disabled people, immigrants, children who suffer from cancer, elderly people who live alone, and so on. Some of them even travel to remote areas in Asia, Africa, and South America to enroll in international aid organizations that deal with very serious problems affecting millions of people in those continents, such as natural disasters, wars, and epidemics, among others.\n\nSumming up, because of today's society, there are some young people who are forgetting to take care of others and their communities, but there are many other young people who dedicate an important part of their lives to help people that are in a difficult situation. In my opinion, everybody should follow their example."}
{"file_id": "1074721.txt", "output_essay": "Let's define what we mean by 'young' and 'older' person. For me, a young person is typically a student. On the contrary, an older person will be someone who has accomplished their professional career.\n\nFirst, we will try to define how young people enjoy their lives. I am convinced that students try to experience lots of things. It is said that it is the best age to travel. In fact, young people do not need great comfort to travel. Moreover, the connection with their parents begins to break. They do not really have many things that can make them stay in the same place. So, it is true, they really have all the arguments to travel, discover new countries, customs, and civilizations. But is it really enjoying life? It is certain that it is easier for them to travel, but are they mature enough to keep in mind their experiences? They certainly do not have the same approach their parents would have when visiting new countries.\n\nIt is also important for them to experience new things like being responsible and having a budget to maintain. These things can inhibit their lives.\n\nThen we will describe what life can be like for an older person. If this person is healthy enough, I assume that it is the best period. Your children have finished their studies; you managed to educate them. You can finally enjoy your life and reap the benefits of your years of professional activity. Traveling, taking time to cook, doing sports, taking part in associations. In fact, you have time for doing what you want. On the one hand, you have lots of time, but on the other hand, you do not. Certainly, you had established lots of things to do, but it is hard to manage to do all. Usually, the question is also, 'Am I still able to do this?'\n\nTo conclude, I would say that older people may enjoy their lives more. Principally, it depends on their health. It is certain they will be quickly tired, but they have their experiences to choose essential things to do. Younger people do not have this experience but are working on it by trying to enjoy their lives as much as they can."}

In my opinion, every activity that helps people to have a good day or some nice moments counts. For example, helping at a sports event or babysitting the kids of your neighbor is also a good thing. With this, you help your neighbors to have some time off and enjoy their own interests. Nowadays, many young people have a lot of different hobbies. So they are involved in other things and do not want to cut their spare time down. They are not as motivated as they were some years ago. You can see this by different organizations; they lack students to help them. Another point is the money. It is not certain that they will earn money for their help, but money has become so important for young people. Why should they help other people and offer their time and get nothing but a smile? These things do not count for much. I am pretty sure most young people would have the time to help, but they are not interested. You could get back so much if you help others. If the parents would help in the community themselves, it would be a motivation for some children to do it too. Mostly, I agree with the statement, but there are still some individuals out there who do their best. They offer their time and are not interested in money. I know some people who tried to get money to help children so that they had the possibility to buy toys. I babysat at various events so that the parents could enjoy their time and did not have to worry about their children."}
{"file_id": "1076066.txt", "output_essay": "In my opinion, this is a very strong statement, and I cannot totally agree with it in the way it is currently phrased. As a first general point, I think that similar statements can never hold absolutely true or false, so before discussing the merit of my opinion, I would like to narrow down the reach of the statement by specifying a particular geographical or cultural setting that we are referring to when talking about young people and their communities. I will therefore take my home country as a reference.\n\nCommunities face constant changes as society as a whole changes, and most of these changes result in challenges and demands imposed on individuals of all ages. In particular, the beginning of the 21st century has seen a macroeconomic revolution in terms of the labor market - in particular, highly specialized and trained labor - and information technology resources. Extensive outsourcing of certain services to Asian countries and moving big parts of the manufacturing industries to the Far East caused many young people to be unemployed in Europe, and in my home country too, as a result. Where once communities used to be wealthy and secure employment could guarantee social welfare and enough free time for everyone to spend with their families or in social activities, now the younger generations face difficulties in earning enough to maintain their usual standards of living.\n\nI agree that they spend less time helping out their communities, and therefore, it is understandable that they will have to dedicate a lot of time to job hunting or even engage in a second and a third occupation, and will have no time or energy to spend on helping the community they live in. Well-organized activities such as participation in charity work, or more spontaneous and 'private' ones such as caring for an elderly member of the family or a disabled neighbor will eventually have to be put aside by those young people who face economic difficulties, and will only be pursued by the luckiest individuals who do not have to worry about earning enough to feed themselves and their children."}

Younger people have many relationships with other people from the community such as school, company, or internet society. I believe that maintaining relationships with others makes life more enjoyable because I can communicate and share happiness or pleasure with others if I am connected with someone. Of course, older people have relationships with people, but it is much smaller than what younger people have. Old people do not go to school and are probably retired from their jobs too, therefore younger people have larger relationships with others.\n\nYounger people are more aggressive, active, and powerful. They can act and do what they want to do. They can go to other places whenever they want to go, and they can play sports or other activities whatever they can do. It is hard for older people to move their bodies.\n\nI think many old people enjoy their hobbies inside their house or around their house by themselves, but I do not think that those are truly enjoyable things. My grandfather has lived by himself since my grandmother died, and he says he enjoys watering his bonsais and walking around his subdivision with his dog, but he does not seem truly happy. If I did not have many relationships with people, it would not be so much fun at all. I think people can feel that 'I really enjoy doing this!' from the deeper part of their heart if they are connected with other people.\n\nTherefore, I agree with the statement that 'young people enjoy life more than older people do.'"}
{"file_id": "1079500.txt", "output_essay": "There is a common belief that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. Some people believe that advertisements do not tell the truth, while others disagree. I also agree that advertisements tend to make products appear better than they are. Here are three main reasons why advertisements may be misleading.\n\nFirst, consider the purpose of advertisements. They are designed to convince consumers to buy or use a particular product. To persuade a consumer, one must make them believe that they truly need that product or that the product is the best available. For either purpose, the product must be portrayed as the best. This leads to the possibility that advertisements may present false information about a product.\n\nSecondly, advertisements are created to increase profits for a specific product. Producers, who aim to maximize profits, may agree to display an unrealistic advertisement to make the product appear better and thus increase sales. When sales increase, profits also rise. In short, if the product appears better, its sales will likely increase, leading to higher profits for the company.\n\nFinally, the third purpose of an advertisement is to help the company dominate the market. Companies must compete with one another regarding their products to survive in the market. An advertisement that portrays a specific product as better than that of another company can help the former win the competition among companies. This suggests that advertisements are not designed to accurately describe a product but rather to make it seem superior.\n\nIn conclusion, people who believe that advertisements make products appear better than they really are have a valid point. Advertisements are crafted with financial gain in mind. A company would not agree to tell the truth at the cost of earning less."}
{"file_id": "1085733.txt", "output_essay": "I totally agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. I have three reasons to explain this.\n\nFirst, the aim of the advertisement is to sell more products. No producer wants to decrease the functions of the products in the advertisement. On the contrary, the producer will try their best to show the positive aspects of the products and minimize the negative aspects. Thus, the products in the advertisement will only have the advantages. For example, the advertisement for medicine will only tell the customers which disease it can cure and neglect the serious side effects of the medicine. Some customers will be additionally harmed by the medicine due to its negative aspects.\n\nSecond, in order to sell more products, producers exaggerate the functions of the products in the advertisements. The products in the advertisement will seem much better. For example, mineralized water is good for the health of the human body. Some producers present mineralized water as a panacea which can be used as medicine for some illnesses.\n\nThird, the advertisement is a product too. The advertiser can sell it only when it can satisfy the producer of the products. That means the advertiser needs to ensure the product in the advertisement appears excellent, even better than it actually is.\n\nFrom the above, we can draw the conclusion that the products in most advertisements are not the same as they are in reality. Their functions have been exaggerated in the advertisement. Therefore, the government should address this problem to let the consumer know the truth about the products."}

Through careful observation, I believe that young people nowadays do give enough time to help their communities.\n\nThere are several ways to help the communities, such as by volunteering, caring for people, and participating in community activities. Many young people today make contributions to their communities by participating in volunteer jobs. A recent news report in Taiwan has shown that more and more students today are willing to volunteer at places including libraries and hospitals during their summer vacations. This may seem common in America; however, it's a revolutionary trend in Taiwan. Ten or twenty years ago, students in Taiwan were urged by their parents to only focus their attention on their studies. Young people during that time were educated to only care about themselves and their studies and were not allowed to do 'unpaid' work such as volunteer jobs. However, in recent years, young people are more willing to sacrifice their time to do volunteer work, which shows that young people today spend more time helping their communities.\n\nIn addition, young people today care more about people, even animals, in their communities. There was a horrible news story about a man who abused cats in his home recently in Taiwan. The man forced his cats to drink detergents and made them produce bubbles. Then, he took pictures of this abuse and posted them on the internet. The young people in Taiwan were irritated by his actions and, through cooperation, tracked down the man's internet IP address and located where he lived. Consequently, the man was punished by the police for his actions, due to the help from these young people who care about animals.\n\nFurthermore, many young people participate in their community activities. For example, I have a friend who joined the dance club that is held by his community. He was able to meet lots of people with similar interests in that particular club. And if members from that club have problems, he would try to help them at no cost.\n\nFinally, young people today do give time to helping their communities. And this trend can be easily found through careful observation."}

But serious study is critical for success. No doubt, reading various subjects helps broaden one's thinking. However, one could gather basic knowledge and information about other subjects without much effort. In this age of information and technological revolution, one can have easy access to information. Furthermore, we do not live in isolation in society. So, social exchanges and interactions would help build our information and knowledge base on other subjects.\n\nThe modern world is driven by technology and science.

I am talking about money because my major is international trade at my university, and I would like to do this business by buying and selling something. I know how to do this job, but I think trying new things is beneficial; for instance, you can buy another product, modify it, and sell it. It has more risk; maybe you cannot sell the changed product.\n\nSuccessful people in my country are always trying new things to achieve their goals. They sometimes lose, but if they win, they can make a larger profit. Take, for example, the biggest Turkish company. Initially, it was a shoe company; they produced shoes and exported them. They knew how to make good shoes. One day, the owner, who had a company, tried something different: he sold all of his property (his factory, his business, his car, etc.) and bought land to produce onions. He didn't know anything about how to grow onions or how to sell them. It was like gambling. He found a farmer living in a rural area who helped him with the onion production and selling process. They also found small packages for the onions, such as 1-pound and 3-pound packages, and they sold them directly to markets. This approach was more profitable and more useful for consumers. Now, the former shoe producer owns big onion farms and earns 1 billion dollars a year; he is exporting onions all over the world, which is a big deal.\n\nIn my opinion, trying new things and taking risks is not good for everyone because you need a bit of good luck in your business life."}
{"file_id": "1076492.txt", "output_essay": "We do not have any proof about this statement, and so we can say many different things. When I talk to my father and we are involved in traffic, he carries on saying that when he was a teen, there was not all this mess. Streets were not full of cars because there was only one car per family. Now everything has changed. First of all, every year we hear about statistical investigations that give us a completely different point: the number of cars is increasing. This may be caused by the improvement of our wealth conditions. When my father was young, Italy was a poor country and it was just at the beginning of its transformation into a modern country. So the actual situation does not seem to support the statement.\n\nThere are, however, some other considerations that we can make. Our development cannot be sustained by our planet. Our supplies of oil are getting fewer and fewer, and we have not found valid alternative powers to substitute for oil by now. There is hydrogen, but it is more expensive. At the same time, electrical engines do not have the same performance as the actual engines. So, if for example hydrogen will be our only alternative, it will probably be impossible for a family to have enough money to pay for more than one car with hydrogen as a propellant.\n\nThe other thing that can influence the number of cars is the policy of our governments. As I have already mentioned, traffic is increasing more and more every year. But it will not always be possible to build new streets and new routes. There will be a limit. This fact can already be seen in the choices of some important cities. To get into London with our car, we must pay a ticket. Also, Milan is going to adopt similar decisions. So perhaps there will be a strong development of public transport.\n\nInstead, some countries have already found different alternatives. The Netherlands, for example, is the country where there is the highest number of bicycles in the world. If you walk around the streets of Amsterdam, you will see bicycles everywhere. Even in front of bars, megastores, and fast foods. But this result is related to the choice of the government to build streets for bicycles. So the politicians have encouraged people to lock their cars in their garages.\n\nIn the end, I do not see the possibility of a spontaneous reduction in the number of cars. There are too many interests, often related to the oil industry and to the factories that build cars. They are often important parts of our economy, and the governments do not want to damage them. But they will probably be obliged, along with us, to change our lifestyle when the situation becomes unsustainable."}

For example, if we consider the case of my brother, he enjoys a lot. He goes to college on his bike, meets friends every evening, has a big chat with them about movies, then goes to his classmate's house to have a fun time with them, discussing the funny things that happened that day. Finally, he comes home, has a good meal, and then goes to sleep.\n\nIf we take the case of older people, they have work to be done. For example, my grandmother is quite relaxed. She gathers other people and starts chatting the whole day, which is a kind of entertainment for her. She watches old devotional movies with them, enjoying feelings about God. Sometimes she goes to pilgrimage places like Tirupati, Shirdi, etc. She eats what she is interested in and spends money as she wishes.\n\nI think both younger and older people enjoy life very much, but not in comparison to each other; they enjoy it in their own way according to their age. If we consider the real-time facts to better understand this concept, we just consider a normal teenage person who goes to college or some other job. They lead their life in a luxurious way, thinking that this age is not going to come again.

For a student, the more knowledge one gets, the more beneficial it is.\n\nIf everyone starts practicing learning through facts, then there won't be any room for research to take place, and people will stop showing interest towards innovation and new things. For example, the fact is that a school bus fetches kids from school to home, whereas the idea and concept behind it is to make their journey more comfortable, safe, and enjoyable.\n\nUnderstanding a subject in depth is the basis of gaining knowledge about it.

It is clear that students learn more from their ideas and concepts rather than the facts in classrooms. So, I agree with this statement. Generally, any subjects are classified into two ways: either science or social. Especially in social subjects, we learn so many things like history, geography, economics, and civics. It differs from what we see to what we learn in history. Suppose a few countries' history is less than 500 years, but those countries are now the world's biggest economies and they rule the entire world.\n\nAt the start of the twentieth century, there was no development of electronic science. Now, we cannot think without electronics and computers and power, but it is the truth. So many things, the ideas and concepts, are very important, like materials. Their chemical bonding, conductivity, types of material, these are learned from ideas and concepts only, not through facts. In materials, we have different types of classification from their characteristics.\n\nSuppose now we are discussing a science class. In this case, I would like to discuss the solar system. In the solar system, the sun is not revolving, but we feel the sun is moving from east to west. In reality, the Earth is moving from west to east. And I will give another example: if we travel in any vehicle, we feel the surroundings are moving, and we feel we are stationary. Another example is that we feel the Earth is flat, it's not like a sphere shape, but actually, our Earth is a sphere shape, not flat. But generally, we feel it is a flat shape. If it were flat, sunrise times and sunset times must be the same, but it is not true. I feel from the above three examples we understand ideas and concepts better than it is for them to learn facts.\n\nI give one technical example in this case. In general, we do not accept energy transfer in real life, but energy transfers from one form to another form of energy. But from facts, we disagree we can produce from heat to cold. In our fact life, we feel it's very difficult. But it is produced: the heat in a boiler creates some kinetic energy; this kinetic energy is converted into electrical energy with the help of a turbine, and finally, electrical energy into cold form with the help of refrigeration process.\n\nSo, I strongly agree with my entire part of the discussion.

How can I touch the soul of other forms of human beings' culture with only a few days or even only a few minutes? So, I think making a precise schedule and getting through the background before the tour and staying there for a couple of weeks until we slightly get in touch with the spirit of the place is essential. After that, I will not feel regret for spending the time enjoying my visit.\n\nAdmittedly, there are several advantages to visiting with a group and a tour guide. For example, I will not worry about house renting with a low payment; I will not need to check out the background of the place's virtues, rituals, history, and culture—the tour guide will explain it all to us. However, I have to pay the tour guide and the company a lot of money, even if we know it's not worth it, just because of our laziness.

So, in a word, I can have more fun if I arrange the tour myself.\n\nIn addition, I like to travel with my lover together, so for this reason, I will not choose to go with a group because of the lack of private time and space.\n\nFrom the argument discussed above, I hold a negative attitude towards the idea that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide, just for the reasons stated."}
{"file_id": "1075051.txt", "output_essay": "I both agree and disagree with this statement. On one hand, a broad knowledge of academic subjects is often, dare I say, always good to have. It is important for a person to have knowledge of as many fields as possible. As human beings, we always want to learn more, and in university, for instance, one subject is not enough at all.\n\nI am currently a student. I study at La Sorbonne Nouvelle University, which is the top university for foreign languages. I am majoring in both English and German, but there are many other languages you can learn, such as Spanish, Italian, but also Arabic, Chinese, or Hindi. After graduating from this university and with this major, students often apply for jobs in commercial trade or international business. In this context, the knowledge of many academic subjects is much more than useful. In the case of two graduate students applying for the same job in international business, somehow I know that the one who has knowledge of different foreign languages will get the post. My university is also famous for cinema, dramatic art, and communication, and it is absolutely possible to major, for example, in both foreign languages and cinema, or follow theater classes.\n\nBut on the other hand, I think that there comes a time when students have to focus on what they really want to do and what they really want to be, and then, according to it, try to get as many chances as possible in order to succeed. For example, the knowledge of many academic subjects could lead students into confusion. They try to learn as many subjects often because they are interested in all sorts of fields, and if you ask these students what they prefer most or what they would rather study if they could only choose one academic subject, they do not know. This fact can explain why a lot of students fail their first years of college. Most university failures in France are caused by a mistake in the choice of majors, which are due to bad information after the twelfth grade.\n\nI would say as a conclusion that it is always interesting to have knowledge in as many fields as possible, but students have to focus on the main point, which is success."}
{"file_id": "1080585.txt", "output_essay": "At first glance, it seems to be a baffling question, but if you take a closer look, you might reckon that this subject needs to be examined. This essay deals with a broad description of why it is necessary to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects.\n\nFirst of all, I would like to say that it is indispensable for any kind of student to broaden his knowledge. Let us assume that you earned your Bachelor's degree in sports and that you would like to get some overseas working experience. Due to the fact that you attended a university that didn't allow you to learn a foreign language, it won't be possible for you to fully indulge in new surroundings.\n\nFurthermore, you can just work in a small working field that doesn't allow you to obtain more responsibility. I am quite sure that you will soon feel uncomfortable and that you might regret that you didn't take the opportunity to broaden your academic skills. Rome was not built in a day, and it is quite apparent that you can hardly obtain more knowledge from one day to the next.\n\nIf those students who just focused on a specific subject, such as sports, attended different classes besides their major, it would be easier for them to survive in the capitalistic world.\n\nI am trying to reinforce my point of view with a quotation from Darwin. 'The survival of the fittest,' expresses a fact, based on several incidents that took place in the early 19th century. You can easily link it to our assignment.\n\nThus, what happens to those students who attended business classes besides their normal major? Let us assume that they have learned how to plan tasks and how to meet their targets via schedules and agendas. Maybe these business classes taught them how to control people via 'carrot and stick' or through normal philanthropy.\n\nThese skills would truly broaden their possibilities to apply for other jobs, such as managing sports events or leading an enterprise in the fields of sports. I am pretty sure that everybody takes advantage of a broad knowledge of many academic subjects, as I've examined in the lines above. I grew up with the belief that a person never truly finishes his education and that there is something new to learn each day. Referring to my introduction, it is vital to succeed academically due to these hints."}

Nowadays, more young people are studying until they are 25 years old, and so we travel to attend university. This takes up more time in the day.\n\nFor example, I live in Como but I study in Milan, so every day I must travel from Como to Milan and I spend 2 hours commuting; and on the weekends, I prefer to enjoy myself or stay with my parents or my boyfriend.\n\nBut 30 years ago, it was not like this: many young people worked either in a factory or at a family's house, and there was a strong regulation, such as going to church every day, helping the elderly, and serving the community.\n\nFor instance, my father grew up in a big family and he always helped with his parents' business, worked in a large company, went to church, and my father entered the political world when he was 18 years old and he was the youngest leader in the country by the age of 25.\n\nToday, the number of young people helping their society is small, and generally, it is people who need this to be happy. This is their dream. I know people who help their community, but they are the ones who study psychological or social subjects.\n\nI have helped my community many times: for the country's festivals, in the service, in the oratory as an animator for women with children, or on mountain holidays with children. These are experiences that are very important to me, for my development and my character.\n\nHowever, I agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not have much time for helping."}
{"file_id": "1062151.txt", "output_essay": "About this topic, different people have different points of view. However, I think it is true that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.\n\nFirst of all, we should know what an advertisement is: it is a way to sell the products a company makes. That means the advertisement has to make the products attractive to people, which is a main reason that leads people to decide to buy it or not. For example, if you want to sell cookies, you may want more and more people to buy them, so you have to catch people's eyes. You may need to use some technology to improve your cookie's features, like making the color brighter or suggesting the best way to eat this cookie. Thereby, it is impossible just to use the original features of your cookie to make its advertisements. So, you have to make your cookie seem much better than it really is.\n\nAlso, there is an interesting thing that advertisements may trick kids into being interested in the products, like a transformer advertisement. In that advertisement, you will see that the transformer can fly. We all know that is impossible because the transformer doesn't even exist. So when you buy a transformer for your children, they may be disappointed with this toy because it is different from what they saw in the transformer's advertisement. That is another reason advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.\n\nBesides that, competition is another reason that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. Because we live in a competitive society, all businessmen compare with others, so advertisements are another way to improve their business. Sometimes, they may focus on the effect of advertisements instead of the quality of the products. When you watch the advertisement, you may have the desire to buy it; that only proves that the advertisement of the product affects you, but not the real product, because before you want to buy it, you may have never used or tasted the product before.\n\nFrom what has been discussed above, we can safely draw the conclusion that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are."}
{"file_id": "1064511.txt", "output_essay": "In this fashion era, people usually want to try diverse new things such as food, technology, and clothing. Successful people normally try new things and take risks rather than just doing what they already know. This is why some investors are so successful nowadays. People would love to try products and styles which they have never seen rather than just repeating the same idea over and over again.\n\nInvestors usually try to make a high profit from business. In order to make the customers feel different, the company needs to keep changing. If a company sells housing technologies such as freezers and microwaves, and suddenly it starts to produce cell phones and computers, customers will rapidly have a different impression about the company since they think the company only sells housing technology. Buyers now will not need to run to a couple of different places to buy freezers and computers if they want to buy them at the same time.\n\nBusinessmen should also love to take risks. Risk does not necessarily mean a harmful thing. People who are willing to take the risk are most likely to achieve success. Creative work can open customers' minds. We will never know what customers want. If buyers are surprised by the company, they definitely will have an excellent impression of the company. For example, in clothing, designers sometimes need to take the risk if they have a very different idea of what to design. The designers are not sure whether the audiences and buyers will like it. Even if they do not like it, at least he tries.\n\nTwo common methods should be used in order to achieve success: trying new things and taking risks. We can find out from almost every single great investor around the world. Without these methods, they would probably not be as successful as they are today."}
{"file_id": "1089472.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with the statement because when students understand ideas and concepts with clear examples in class, they retain more information over time. Then, they can use these ideas and concepts in both the near and far future. I think this because I apply this principle all the time during my studying life and in my professional life. In fact, many times I use information acquired in my first years of university, especially in topics of biology and chemistry, subjects that I do not normally use in my work. Another point is that when students understand ideas and concepts, they can relate these ideas and concepts to others, to understand new knowledge, or to create theories about unknown topics. This is very important in the creation of new concepts or the development of science and engineering. Moreover, it is the foundation of the evolution of society; the more ideas or concepts students understand, the better development they have in their studies and future work. On the other hand, if students learn facts, it is more difficult for them to make relationships between different facts because it is possible they do not have a clear relation. Normally, to find a relationship between facts, ideas and concepts are necessary to help find the connection."}
{"file_id": "1086384.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with the opinion. It's because I have really experienced such cases. I love a model from the fashion magazine. Besides, if she wears a certain piece of clothing, it encourages me to buy the same one, just by seeing the photo. However, actually, when I visit the shop for the clothing, it doesn't suit me at all. Some of my friends have told me that they have experienced the same thing. Therefore, it is common for advertisements to seem much better than they really are. We can say the same for other occasions.\n\nLike my experience, people are easily made to want products that popular and famous individuals, for example, artists, models, actors, or actresses, use. Companies use this method. As a result, today, we can see advertisements in many places. These include commercials on television or radio, in newspapers or magazines, and even on trains or buses.\n\nTake, for example, online shopping on TV. The buyer shows us his or her pleasure after using the products on the screen. Or, clerks or famous actors appear on the screen, insisting that the products are good. Then, people who saw the TV program are persuaded to buy the product. Until we touch the product directly, we don't know whether the comments on the screen are true or not.\n\nBesides, the clerks emphasize that the product is cheap, or comes with gifts, but only for now. It is a way of making the product look good by the clerks. So, the more effectively they introduce the product, the more people want to buy it.\n\nTherefore, I agree with the statement."}
{"file_id": "1081519.txt", "output_essay": "The issue statement states that there will be a decline in the number of cars in the next twenty years. I strongly disagree with this statement. Moreover, I think that the number of cars being used is going to increase in the near future.\n\nThe first reason I would like to give is that the cost of cars is going to decrease gradually. If you observe the past trend, it used to be a luxury to possess a car. But now, it has become a necessity. Also, the cost of cars, when compared to the past rates, is very low now. Hoping that the same trend continues, in some 5 or 6 years even the common man will be able to afford a car. So, everybody will be rushing to own a car, and hence the number will rise exponentially.\n\nThe second thing is that cars are thought to be safer when compared to other two-wheelers. This feeling is gradually spreading in countries like India, where two-wheelers dominate the roads. If this notion becomes stronger, present two-wheeler owners will replace them with cars, and again the number of cars will increase.\n\nThe third idea is that cars can transport many people at a time when compared to bikes and scooters. So, these bike or scooter owners also will be trying to purchase cars. Also, as the prices of petroleum products are going to increase, people will think of spending money on cars and have combined transportation rather than investing in individual transportation means such as two-wheelers.\n\nLast but not the least, many people think that owning a car is a kind of prestige issue. In this modern world where people are constantly trying to show off, it won't be a surprise if more number of cars are purchased. Hence, in the near future, more number of cars are going to land on the roads throughout the world."}
{"file_id": "1084478.txt", "output_essay": "The world has changed, and so have people. Young people have become more irresponsible; the world has become more competitive, and young people have started to ignore the events happening around them.\n\nFirst of all, young people are irresponsible in their actions. They are not helping their communities as much as they used to. We can't say they don't help at all, but it has decreased compared to the early 1900s, when revolutions occurred. At that time, university students were the leading group. But nowadays, those of the same age are causing harm and ruining society. Since they don't face difficulties such as coups d'état, wars, or revolutions, they have become addicted to drugs, crime, and other harmful activities. They are not accountable for their actions, especially the wealthy, who rely on their parents to resolve their problems. These irresponsible acts by young people are damaging society more than in the past.\n\nSecondly, the world has become more competitive. Unemployment rates are high, and competition is rising. Young people don't have time to help their communities, aside from the community service they must do as schoolwork. They should spend more time studying to secure a job or to expand their businesses. Otherwise, they will be left behind by society. For example, in my country during the 1970s, university graduates could choose the company they wanted to work for. But nowadays, even graduates from top universities can't find jobs. The employment rate for them is 77 percent, indicating that it is becoming increasingly difficult, and competition is intensifying.\n\nLastly, young people do not care about the things happening around them. They have become selfish, which has made them indifferent to others' suffering and difficulties. For instance, when they see elderly people standing on the bus while they are seated, they choose to ignore them or pretend to be asleep. Young people don't want to get involved in others' affairs, especially if it's something dangerous. I once saw a news program that featured a survey asking people what they would do if they saw a pervert in a crowded subway. Most respondents said they would ignore it, thinking it's not their business.\n\nAs time goes by, the world becomes a tougher place to live. Fewer people are helping with societal challenges, even though society is becoming more difficult. I want to encourage young people to assist their society. When they ask me why, I will answer, 'You will see the difference.'"}

Young people have fun and feel very psyched at times when they believe they are being praised by others. I remember, for a while in my life, anytime I would walk into someplace with a slick and snazzy new haircut, I would believe people looked up to me, and it would be for the rest of the night that I'd enjoy myself, due to my newly installed confidence. However, no matter how illogical it is, that would be my almost only way of having fun.\n\nToday, I have fun when I am with close people such as my good friends or family. I also enjoy locking myself up in my room and programming websites. Three years ago, I would mock someone who would tell me such a thing. I wouldn't consider it fun, and on the contrary, I would consider it ridiculously boring.\n\nFor my parents, they have fun playing the slowest card game ever (which I think is called Bezique). At this age, I don't understand how they consider that to be fun. They also enjoy going on boat trips. To me, nothing could be more monotonous than the empty sounds of the lonely sea.\n\nHowever, you never know, maybe in around 30 years, those may be my pleasures in life. Maybe, I will begin jogging every morning by six a.m. at the age of sixty. What my pleasures will be is certainly not certain. The same applies to everyone.\n\nTherefore, I don't believe that the question posed can be answered. I believe all age groups have their own way of having fun.

{"file_id": "1087972.txt", "output_essay": "I think education is a combination of understanding concepts and learning facts.\n\nConcepts are important in that they are the essence of the knowledge that the teacher needs to transmit to the students. They are the structure, built to support that strong construction which upholds all academic tasks. Without concepts, we would live in a world that doesn't worry and take the time to penetrate the deepest parts of understanding and mental capacity.\n\nSometimes education can turn too rigid and bore learners, because everything is about ideas and how to grasp them. To peel the onion or to get to the core of the matter, we need details, little facts that enrich our lives and the way we learn to see and understand the universe.\n\nGood educators are the ones that can awaken their students through a simple fact, such as a date or a number (which can be easily forgotten), using it as a door to walk through and search into an unknown universe full of possibilities that allow them to understand the ideas that, once introduced, we never forget.\n\nIt is like a game. When we play to find the treasure, we cannot forget our objective, but we have to be careful of the facts and the extra information that we collect during the search. The middle way is the best way to educate and help students understand different disciplines, from mathematics to arts, because it is the perfect combination of body and what is inside it.

{"file_id": "1085178.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with the statement that people who achieve success do try new approaches, rather than sticking to the older things which are familiar to them. For example, ancient people were under the impression that the Earth is a flat surface. Scientists who proved the theory of the universe did not stick to these preformed concepts but rather thought innovatively and achieved success. So, new ways and ideas are always essential for the success of a person. They allow us to increase the horizons of our knowledge and perception of facts.\n\nTechnological advances are demanding that people acquire new skills and approaches. Only those who adapt to these circumstances will flourish in the present-day competitive world. To illustrate, suppose a person is well-skilled in typing on his typewriter and is complacent with his skill, with no interest in learning computer skills. He will not meet the new expectations of the employer and might lose his job. Moreover, a person who adapts to the new demands and learns computer skills will flourish in his career.\n\nA successful person has the habit of exploring new ways and new things, and he tries to put himself in a superior position through his hard work, which is also innovative. If a person sticks to the methods well known to him and refuses to acquire newer skills, he does not get increments and promotions in his job.\n\nSome people do not dare to risk new changes in their work. But we can never discover anything new without experimenting. So, people should try new things to improve themselves, but that move should be genuine. For example, a wealthy businessman who invests all of his wealth in shares might experience a severe loss and may become a pauper. So I feel that new approaches should be definitely encouraged, but the person should judge his move rather than hastily implementing his idea. If the person is reasonable in his approach, risks due to new approaches get minimized, and he enjoys the fruits of his innovation. So it is not always risky to take up a new thing. Rather, we cannot achieve anything in our life without facing that minimum amount of risk."}
{"file_id": "1084466.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with this statement partially because although we have to explore new areas to pursue success, it is almost obligatory to gain a high level of expertise to attain it.\n\nIt should be admitted that there are several good reasons for trying new things. First of all, it is difficult to be successful in an already developed field. People in that field have been specializing and putting their effort and energy into it for a long time. For example, the techniques for shoemaking are already very well established, and people in this sector know very well how to produce high-quality shoes at low costs. Secondly, change is unavoidable in virtually all areas of human activity, and people not taking any risks to explore new things are deemed to be surpassed by the 'risk-takers.' Sticking to the same example, a person using leather as the raw material for making shoes and not willing to learn about how to use other potentially useful materials would one day have to retire. Perhaps the most important reason for trying new things is the potential of generating synergy between what we already know and what we will explore: the world is divided into 'things' artificially by humans, and we can always find fruitful relations between one 'thing' that we already know and another that we get to know.\n\nOn the other hand, history is also full of famous people who achieved success by persevering in a well-defined field, from army commanders to artists to shoemakers and athletes. The reason is that in any given area, there are many very talented people trying to be number one; through improving their related skills and also by obtaining relevant knowledge, both of which require long periods of hard work. So the definition of success is always pushed further in terms of required perfection.\n\nAlthough the first man on Earth naturally had to try new things, he also had to improve his skills to avoid failing—if he had not, we would not be here.

They have made our lives faster, easier, and have helped to spur industrial growth. However, technological advancement, the increasing reliance of people on other modes of transport, and the more organized lifestyle that this new age is coming up with give me the impression that over the years the number of automobiles will reduce.\n\nTechnology is advancing at a rapid pace. In recent years, we have witnessed new modes of transport coming up. Hovercrafts, underground rails, overhead rails, and supersonic aircraft are just a few of them. With such novel and efficient means of transport springing up by the minute and with people becoming increasingly reliant on these novel means of transport, we can say for sure that the number of cars on roads will reduce.\n\nWe often read in daily newspaper reports that new airline companies are opening up. Low-cost airlines have been a big success in Europe, and the same model is being tried out in countries like India. People have changed their preferences for traveling from one city to another or from one country to the neighboring country due to the new form of airlines. This is because these low-cost airlines offer cheap rates, especially to the everyday business traveler, and these travelers have such a plethora of options in choosing the cheapest deals. As a result, people have started abandoning cars as their mode of transport for short routes. With the success of such airlines, it is definite that in the near future we will see many more such business models, which will ultimately result in the number of cars being reduced.\n\nThe organization of society is fast changing. Two major forms of establishments are coming up. One, in which the residential and business localities are under one roof, and the other in which they will be independent. If such structures are adopted on a worldwide basis, then people will have to resort to different modes of travel. In the first case, they will not need to travel, and in the second case, they will prefer public transport modes such as underground or overhead rails. This is because it will help them reach their workplace faster. This, in turn, will decrease the reliance of people on automobiles.\n\nThus, we see that with times changing, people have come to rely on various other means of transport which assist them in reaching their coveted destinations faster and in a much easier manner. These factors give us an indication that over the years cars will be replaced by many other means of transport. I only hope that, like the dinosaurs, these four-wheeled species do not become extinct."}
{"file_id": "1088092.txt", "output_essay": "In my view, while one may say that people in general do not give enough time to help their communities, I do not think that young people fail to help enough.\n\nThe first reason for my view is simply that I know many young people who care a lot. Some of them help their communities directly by spending time with elders or taking care of adults' children. Others even undertake larger projects to help people around the world. For example, I have a friend who left France last year to work as a volunteer to build a school in a certain country in Africa.\n\nThe second reason for my view is that we have never seen young people caring and participating as much as before. In the last presidential election in France in 2002, when Jean-Marie Le Pen, known for his racist and segregated opinions, reached the second phase of the election, the first group to demonstrate in the streets to express their reluctance at the prospect of such a man becoming president was a group of students and some high school teenagers. I believe this would have never happened in the past.\n\nFinally, I think it is important to say that young people do not always have the possibility to show that they care. Indeed, young people do not earn much money, if any at all. They are at an age where they have to give priority to their studies, or have just started a job, which can be a very difficult period. Because of all these reasons, I think that even if some people think it is too low, the level of help provided by young people to communities is largely sufficient.\n\nTo sum up, I believe that while it is sometimes difficult for young people to find the time and the money to help communities, they are caring enough, especially compared with the past. In my opinion, young people increasingly understand that they are crucial actors in the community."}

A car is emerging as a basic need in the world today. Technological advances have made the dream of a common man, to own a personal car, a reality. The rates of cars have never been so low, and this sharp decline in prices will continue as technology progresses. This would further encourage their sale in the near future, as more and more people will be able to afford one.\n\nIn earlier times, cars were meant only for the main member of the family, the earning heads.

This means that if a family of four members uses a single car today, they may go on to use two 2-seaters in the future.\n\nFurthermore, other modes of conveyance like buses or three-wheelers generally cause more pollution than that generated by cars.

Thinking about the controversy over Article 9, the argument is whether to revise it or not. Surely, understanding its history, which has kept our country peaceful for 60 years, and its idea and concept of renouncing war after the tragic memory of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, is very important. But by just 'understanding' the existence of it, we cannot protect ourselves from the threat of terrorism.\n\nSo, what do we need to live? We are strongly in need of 'learning' the facts of the Japan we are facing now, and the ways we can take to maintain peace. What happens when North Korean missiles are launched at Japan? Do we not fight back? Or do we fight with self-defense forces, which are well known to be unsuited to Article 9 itself?\n\nTherefore, understanding the ideas and concepts is not helpful in our lives. It is very idealistic. It's good to have, but it does not do anything for us. It's not practical. What I want to claim in this essay is that it is not the importance of Article 9, but that learning facts and knowing what we can do about it next, is much more important in our real lives."}

Instead, they are now focusing on their own leisure time, such as playing video games and watching television.\n\nIt is a fact that many young people do not give enough time to helping their communities. Since today's development of technology, many things seem fascinating to people, especially to the young, who are curious about society. There are too many things that young people want to experience and try, and this also includes many negative things, such as smoking and drinking. Unlike today's people, our previous generations learned to treasure their communities because they felt responsible for their own environment; it is something they were taught when they were young.\n\nUnfortunately, today's values are different from before; people concentrate on physical enjoyment. But while they are experiencing the sensation of enjoyment, they are also ignoring their obligations to their communities and society. In schools, we all have learned to be responsible for our surroundings; however, many of us have forgotten the real concept of this responsibility.\n\nFurthermore, there are many examples of helping communities. For example, maintaining the cleanliness and order of a community is everyone's obligation because everyone is a part of the community. But many young people do not realize the importance of this obligation. When the elders ask them for some work, they usually respond with bad or displeased attitudes; they think it is a waste of time to help the community. By looking closely, I see many negative things that will happen as those young people become adults. Our society will become decadent if the government is ruled by lazy people; more frighteningly, it is not only a joke but a truth of today's young men.\n\nHowever, our society has already realized the importance of correcting young people's attitudes. They first begin the work at school by requiring community service for each student before they graduate from school. This is an important step to start with because school is the place where everyone goes. Besides the effect of community service, many schools are now also spreading the idea of protecting our environment. Personally, I see these two things starting to work in many young minds.\n\nFinally, before we act on anything, we should first recognize that Earth is our home; we are all the owners of this planet; therefore, while we are enjoying our physical happiness, we should also do something for our community. The community is not only our home but also belongs to our offspring. Even a bit of work we contribute to the community can make a change in society. Lastly, we should provide a clean and healthy environment for our children."}
{"file_id": "1078916.txt", "output_essay": "I agree that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects because this gives you the experience to talk with different types of people and can also help you in looking for a good job.\n\nOne of the good things about having broad knowledge is that you have the chance to talk with different types of people. Knowing, having experience in, or being specialized in different topics gives you the possibility to talk and discuss with people of different knowledge and ideas. A good example can be when you are in a conversation about Organic Chemistry and you know about this topic; you can ask questions or get into the big discussion with the other specialists on the case. This will give a good impression to the other people and help you make more friends or become more knowledgeable.\n\nAnother reason that it is good to have broad knowledge is that you can get a very good and well-paid job. Today in our society, big institutions and companies are looking for people who are very smart or have a good understanding of something. If you have a good understanding and know what the things that good companies ask you to do, you can have a very good fundamental job. For example, today it is really essential to use a computer. Well, if you know how to work the computer and how to use many programs on the computer, you can have a good paying job and security.\n\nToday it is really good to know about different topics or issues because this new society is changing really quickly. To have broad knowledge in this new society can help a lot to survive or even to have a good understanding of what all this new vocabulary is about because many people who study only one thing can sometimes know nothing about other topics."}

One might agree with that statement because in many situations it has happened to me that I had to learn all the facts for a test, and I end up learning them all, but at the end of the test, it's like everything is wiped out of my head, and that happens exactly the same with all of my classmates. But when we learn the concept of the fact instead of the fact itself, it stays with you forever. Many times, when I am in a conversation talking about history or chemistry, I start talking about concepts that I have learned over a period of time and explaining my knowledge that I have obtained by understanding the concepts. These are the reasons for which I agree with this statement. Knowing the facts can work for a day or maybe a week, but the concepts stay with you forever."}
{"file_id": "1087758.txt", "output_essay": "In our childhood, we try to imitate others' behavior and handle new things. We learn how to stand up properly. Sometimes we fail and cry, but soon we try again until we succeed. Then, we attempt other new things and gain more and more ability. To me, I believe learning new abilities is a lifelong process for successful people. We should take risks to try new things in order to succeed because it provides us opportunities to benefit from life, improvement, and correction.\n\nTrying new things benefits people's lives because they can gain many usable skills that will be useful in the future. For instance, Bill Gates acquired valuable knowledge of computing in his early life. He then used this knowledge to establish a unique computing system - Windows. The new ability allowed Bill Gates to become the richest man in the world later in life. Trying new things always leads people to gain wealth. Thus, people continue to pursue studies even after they have been working for a long time.\n\nWhen people try new things, they achieve improvements that they could not get from doing things already familiar. For example, if I read a book that I have already read before, I would probably learn very little or nothing. The book is of no use to me. In contrast, if I read a new book about 'How to Straighten Your Personality,' I may alter my old way of doing things. I could improve my way of thinking. Last but not least, people can make corrections while they try new things. The reason for that is, people can make comparisons. New things allow people to rethink the way they do old things. They thought they did things pretty well, but actually, they did not do it right. Therefore, successful people always try new things in order to correct the mistakes that they did not realize before.\n\nIn order to be successful, people should not hesitate to try new things. They can thereby enhance their lives both intensively and extensively."}

I think when I travel without a tour guide, I can go to any place I would like to go, find my favorite places or things, and forge stronger friendships.\n\nFirstly, without a tour guide, our travel plans are more flexible regarding where and when to go. For instance, when I traveled with a tour guide, there was a place where I wanted to stay longer, but he insisted, 'We must go to the next.' I felt unsatisfied.\n\nSecondly, it is possible for me to discover a place or thing that is not well-known. In other words, I can find my own special spot or item. I do not like crowded places, so if I can find an obscure yet wonderful place or thing for myself, I think I will be happy.\n\nFinally, without a guide, our group will come together to make our travel more meaningful. I have a friend who is skilled at scheduling, so with her, I feel happier, and our travels become more valuable. Moreover, our friendship grows stronger.\n\nFor these reasons, I believe the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide is not entirely accurate. Traveling is very exciting, and I wish I could go everywhere."}
{"file_id": "1083779.txt", "output_essay": "Traveling is always an enjoyable, sometimes tedious, leisure activity. Nowadays, with traveling being such a normal thing to do, one is confronted with the choice of choosing between traveling with a group or by oneself.\n\nSo, can one choice be better than the other? First of all, most of the time, traveling with a group tends to be relatively cheap, and with the tour guide usually being a local, allows the tourists to receive additional information during the trip.\n\nAlso, since the tour guide is doing this for a living, preferably as a professional career, it is ensured that the quality and quantity of the information given during the trip will be better than a tour organized by oneself.\n\nSecondly, a point that is often missed is the socializing factor. While traveling with a group, it is impossible for one not to get to know anyone. It is not a given, though, that one's fellow cohorts are as gregarious as oneself.\n\nLastly, efficiency is the key, meaning as much as: Seeing a lot with little time. This allows the traveler to see as much as possible in a limited time. On the other hand, efficiency, like many other things, is a double-edged sword. Being as efficient as possible prevents the tourist from savoring his moment during his travel, such as at Mt. Rushmore, for example.\n\nOn the other hand, traveling without a group releases the tourist from the shackles of time. One can enjoy every moment of the tour, go back to an exhilarating sight, or just relax for a day - freedom is the key element here.\n\nInforming oneself is of the essence when traveling without a tour guide, though, since nothing can be worse than a tourist without an idea of what he is doing. This doesn't mean that one may not opt for a private tour guide, though.\n\nOf course, all of this comes with a price. With this, one can conclude that if one wants a truly informative and economically feasible trip, one should opt to travel with a group. Yet, if one wants to truly appreciate the true enjoyment of traveling, savoring every moment of one's trip, then one should opt for the other."}

The definitions of enjoying life and how to enjoy life can differ from young people to older people on a huge scale.\n\nAs a young woman, I believe that youth enjoy life for the sake of enjoying it and not for the happiness that this joy can result in. Young people think that there are many years left in life and we should enjoy it as much as possible before they have serious responsibilities such as a career and family. Unfortunately, sometimes enjoying life for young people means irresponsibility and carelessness in life. This is not true for all young people, but many of them interpret it this way.\n\nAccording to what I mentioned before, I don't agree with the statement that says 'young people enjoy life more than older people,' as I believe that older people do enjoy life, but in a different way than the younger generation would understand. This is due to many reasons, like the lack of communication between older and younger generations, and their different definitions of enjoying life.\n\nFor example, I enjoy life by traveling around the world and by meeting new friends and new contacts, and I always request my mother to do so. But she, as an older generation, tells me that her biggest joy now is to raise her children well and to watch them get successful and happy, while years ago she used to enjoy herself differently.\n\nTherefore, I believe that older people enjoy life as much as younger people, and sometimes even more, but the difference is about the thinking of older people and their experiences after growing wise and mature, which are great things that the younger generation can learn from, and therefore enjoy life more."}
{"file_id": "1086263.txt", "output_essay": "I do agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.\n\nA possible explanation would be that these advertisements are based on different surveys made by professionals in order to know what the target public wants to hear. For example, if a company wanted to sell a new skateboard, it would interview teenagers who skateboard to know what they are looking for in a perfect product. They would do the same with the parents of the skateboarders because they are the ones who will pay for it. Once this information is analyzed, publicity will be created out of that. The content of this advertisement would be based on scientific data. The target public will see in the products exactly what they are looking for; it will appear as the perfect product. However, they might be disappointed once they have bought the item, realizing that it is not that perfect.\n\nAnother way to illustrate my point is the advertisement for Kraft's dinner products. This publicity targets whoever makes lunches at home, i.e., the mother and their kids. The product is sold as a healthy and convenient lunch. The kids look really happy to eat it, and it seems really tasteful. However, one can easily realize that Kraft's dinner products are not healthy meals and are not tasteful.\n\nThe publicity creators know that someone will be more likely to buy a product if it has a pretty presentation. That is the reason why all the products are in nice little boxes with bright colors and printed with impressive designs. Another way to make a product look attractive is by using the picture of a good-looking woman or a handsome man. Therefore, the client will purchase the item in order to be closer to the model on the box. But the product inside might not be that exceptional.\n\nIn conclusion, I think that advertising companies are able to identify the desires of customers and create nice publicity featuring all of them. They are able to show a way for people to reach their dreams. But dreams do not always come true..."}

Today's technology is more advanced than in yesteryears, and there could be more advancements in the near future. With the advancement of technology, cars may be replaced by newer inventions.\n\nFirstly, if we consider the time fifty or sixty years ago, there were a greater number of bicycles. And after that, with the invention of bikes, people mostly traveled on them. Further, with the invention of cars, the number of bikes and their usage decreased.\n\nAfter twenty years, there may be another advanced invention that could replace cars. For instance, if a flying machine is invented for the benefit of the common man, then there will be more flying machines and fewer cars.\n\nSecondly, it can be said that the needs of people keep changing with time. After twenty years, if something cheaper or more advanced than cars is made available, then there could be fewer cars than there are today. With the increase in the needs of people, any other advanced invention could replace cars, and the number of cars could decrease.\n\nLastly, I conclude that in the next twenty years, there will be a smaller number of cars than there are today."}

It is true that today's youth are not as concerned about the well-being of their society, being busy pursuing their own individual interests. However, they are not entirely to blame for this, as there are various factors that prevent them from contributing to their society and community.\n\nTo start with, take the example of the cutthroat competition around the world in every field due to technological advancement, where every individual and firm is striving hard to achieve maximum efficiency and, hence, maximum benefit from the limited resources available to them.\n\nFrom the moment a child is admitted to primary school, he has to meet the expectations of his parents and friends. Then, with the population increasing and resources diminishing, there are limited vacancies in higher schools, colleges, and good universities for students. There, they also have to compete in entrance examinations for the limited seats. Even once admitted, there is not much relief, since the academic curriculum is so hectic that one does not have enough time to look after others who need help. In this situation, we cannot expect someone to take time out of his busy schedule and devote it to the community.\n\nThen, when one gets a job and starts working in a business or firm, young people are expected to work hard if they want a better and secure future.\n\nHowever, despite these points, I will not deny the careless attitude of the youth towards their community. Due to globalization and the mixing of cultures, young people are more attracted to materialistic pleasures and are not ready to understand the responsibility they bear for the society and community, which has given so much to them. It has shaped the person he is today, and now, from an ethical standpoint, it is his obligation to give something back to the same community."}

To be precise is not a bad thing because you are good at what you're doing; that is part of being a successful person, but it does not make you a successful person because you cannot do more or simply do not know more, and that is why being precise is not the same as being successful.\n\nI agree that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.

However, nowadays, many young people within communities are striving to effect positive change. These young individuals contribute to their community by improving schools and participating in social groups.\n\nFirstly, young people are keen to upgrade the educational facilities where they receive their education. They engage with building societies to renovate old schools and join groups concerned with the redistribution of used books. This community initiative involves collecting old books from various schools and exchanging them with libraries. Additionally, they support those responsible for environmental cleanliness. For example, these youths assist by helping to clean up their surroundings and by planting trees in barren areas.\n\nSecondly, young people participate in social groups dedicated to aiding the elderly and the impoverished. They organize events, and some organizations assist by collecting ticket fees. Nowadays, we can observe numerous social groups that contribute to community improvement through such events. These initiatives generate significant funds. However, the money raised is not directly handed to the elderly and the poor by the young people. Instead, it is used to provide for these individuals' clothing and food needs.\n\nIn conclusion, there are many young individuals currently eager to help and enhance their environments and communities.

Also, they attract consumers and make them buy their products by advertising. However, there is a problem with most advertisements. It is that the real products are often worse than the products shown in advertisements. Advertisements often deceive consumers by hiring famous actors and hiding the bad characteristics involved.\n\nWith such a famous actor, companies could make a lot of money from advertisements. Suppose a certain company hired Brad Pitt. In that advertisement, Brad Pitt uses a new aftershave lotion that the company has made. Then, consumers think the company's aftershave lotion is of great quality because a well-known actor uses it. In addition, people believe that if they buy that product, they could be like the famous actor, or they could at least follow the actor's fashion. Unfortunately, the products are not as great as people expected. Although well-known actors use them, it does not mean that their products are well-made.\n\nObviously, companies often highlight the good characteristics of their products, but they often hide the bad aspects in advertisements. There are a lot of research studies done by undergraduate students related to this topic. They have found that even though companies are required by law to inform consumers of all characteristics, they often make the negative characteristics invisible. Companies usually place the negative information in fine print under their products so that consumers cannot see it. People often see the highlighted words such as 'This product is free from pesticides' or 'This product is the first invention in the whole world.' Truly, there are some people who say that making great advertisements is obligatory for companies that want to earn a lot of money. However, they have gone too far.

{"file_id": "1084470.txt", "output_essay": "I mainly agree with the statement that people enjoy life more when they are young than when they get older. However, some details need to be analyzed to prove this idea.\n\nThe first point is related to birthday anniversaries. It is common that children and teenagers are often very happy when they get one year older. This is often related to presents, parties, and lots of friends wishing a happy birthday. But older people are very often sad and ashamed of getting older, and their anniversaries remind them of those feelings.\n\nThe way people enjoy life depends on their age. It is different if we consider children, teenagers, or adults.\n\nChildren seem to be happy very often. They can enjoy any little trick for hours and keep smiling and laughing without any relevant reason. Children do not have to worry about important things; indeed, they do not even know about them, thanks to their parents who try to keep them apart from any troubles.\n\nThe way of enjoying life changes as children become teenagers. The main reason teenagers enjoy life is freedom. Even though this often goes along with little fights with their parents, teenagers have the will to create their freedom by proving that they can be independent. As they feel free, teenagers have new hobbies, sometimes forbidden, but they enjoy the risks they take.\n\nIn opposition to the happiness of children and teenagers, adults cannot enjoy life as easily. Being an adult means having responsibilities. Adults have to work to earn money and have lots of obligations which keep them from entertaining and enjoying life. Moreover, when adults have children, they strive to offer their children the happiest life they can. So they do not hesitate to sacrifice their own happiness for the benefit of their family. But even if that is difficult, parents enjoy every little moment of happiness they can share with their children."}

When a student is forced to go to several private academies by his mother's wish, like one of my students, she won't have the chance to consider what she wants to know the most. As a matter of fact, the student spends lots of time studying English, math, and science, but all she wishes about the academies is to quit them.\n\nMoreover, just gaining more knowledge beyond the student's understanding is not efficient at all.

{"file_id": "1085024.txt", "output_essay": "Yes, I agree with the statement \"it's more important to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts.\" I feel it's very important for us to understand an idea rather than simply knowing it. If you are good at understanding ideas and concepts, then you can make yourself think of the facts pertaining to it. An idea, when brought into implementation, can reveal the good and bad associated with it, thereby making us think about the facts related to it.\n\nI feel the sequence related to this idea concept is, firstly, the generation of an idea is important and is followed by its analysis; this is made in our brain, thinking about its results. Next, its implementation and thereby deriving the facts out of it. So, the fact can be derived from the concept itself.\n\nIn my opinion, simply learning facts without knowing any information regarding them will be like \"eating food without knowing what it is.\" The food that you are eating may be tasty, and you are enjoying it, but not knowing what you are eating seems foolish.\n\nIn this contemporary world, understanding ideas and concepts is in existence. So, when the world is advancing, if you still continue to be lethargic, it's not good on your part, and you can't do justice to your profession.\n\nUnderstanding an idea makes a person think about it, thereby making him develop or innovate new ideas regarding the topic. It enables a person to be thought-provoking always. Knowing the fact will be a part of this process if a person adopts the habit of understanding the concepts and thereby filling the essence of studying.\n\nThus, I feel it's more important for a student to understand concepts and work upon them, mindful that he is also filled with the fact along with the idea."}
{"file_id": "1088250.txt", "output_essay": "In my opinion, it is better to have extensive knowledge of one specific subject rather than having some knowledge in all fields. There are a few reasons, namely accuracy, dangers of half-knowledge, and the fact that specialization comes after some general knowledge, that I venture to opine in favor of specialization.\n\nFirstly, if a person is more knowledgeable in the field of his own interest, he not only performs well but also is able to contribute his own efforts in the form of information to be used more accurately. For example, a doctor who is specialized in the heart and its related aspects is capable of helping a patient more efficiently than a general physician would.\n\nSecondly, like I said, the dangers of half-knowledge are not unknown to us. If we have not mastered even one subject, we cannot put in any effort to get something out of our knowledge. We do not have a sense of direction in which to proceed, and we have to stop in the middle of an invention or discovery because we do not know what lies ahead. This can also be decisive for the growth of a society as a whole.\n\nFinally, for any specialization to occur in any subject, we start with knowledge of various fields, related or unrelated, which might help in better understanding our field of interest. Thus, the knowledge of all academic subjects is, in a way, the foundation stone of any specialization and is therefore a part of the learning process. Like I stated, if it is a cardiologist in question, then he would have some knowledge of the whole body's functioning, as that is evidently related.\n\nThus, I can safely say that specialization not only helps in developing our skills in our own field of interest but also is the destination for some knowledge that we acquire in all the subjects. It eventually helps us to mature as an individual, as an adept in our field, and in the growth of society as a whole."}
{"file_id": "1088126.txt", "output_essay": "Although I understand why some people think it is more important for students to learn facts, I believe that it's more efficient for them to understand ideas and concepts. In my view, there are three reasons why ideas and concepts prevail.\n\nFirst, ideas and concepts enable a student to understand not only one fact but also many other facts because facts occur once, and ideas can explain numerous facts. For example, you can know how to cook a specific cake, but if you understand how cakes are made in general, you will be able to cook any cake. It means that by understanding a fact, a student would be able to anticipate only this precise fact the next time he experiences it. Instead, if a student understands the concept, he will be able to anticipate the outcome of many related facts.\n\nSecondly, ideas and concepts are the first things that you learn at school, and I think this is efficient. For instance, in mathematics, you always begin by learning the rules before applying them. Moreover, theory is something that gathers information from the experience of other people. That is exactly what the teacher is teaching: concentrated experience rather than a fact.\n\nLastly, according to my personal experience, I think it's more important to understand ideas and concepts first. I created a fashion company but knew only a few things about this industry. Thanks to my knowledge that I learned in class, I was able to adapt and anticipate things as I already knew the industry. For example, marketing concepts can be applied to every industry. By using them, I was able to clear the hurdle which was my ignorance of the industry.\n\nTo conclude, I think that ideas and concepts prevail over facts, and that is why. Still, as I said at the beginning, I understand people who think the opposite because you need facts to understand how to apply the theory."}

For example, I trust people who have more knowledge than I do. My football coach has more experience than I do because he played in the NFL for four years. His professional skill and knowledge earn him everyone's trust. I've realized that the more knowledge you have, the more trust you gain from others. Trust unites the team and makes it stronger. This is not only true for sports; the same principle applies in a company. A trustworthy boss can create more unity in a company than an untrustworthy one. Thus, broad knowledge can change your surroundings and also help you become a great leader.\n\nPeople tend to believe in those who have more knowledge, so broad knowledge is essential for those who want to have many friends. People with many kind friends usually have broad knowledge. They have friends who are good at history, math, computers, and sports because those with many friends have connections with people skilled in these areas. Without any connections, nobody would want to be friends because there would be no common topics to discuss. Therefore, broad knowledge is necessary to make many friends who will support your life after graduation.\n\nIt is better to learn about a variety of academic subjects before you graduate from university because it will help you after school life."}

They force their families to cater to their wants with crying and other behaviors, which the family does not recognize in their child. They act like this because families don't provide them with the thinking skills to understand what is happening in the world and what they should do to survive in this world. They grow up and enter a world with which they are unfamiliar. They are not ready to face the real world; how can they live in it? They did more things when they were growing up, but they didn't take the time to understand their communities. So how can they help their communities if they don't know their communities' needs? However, I think this is not the young adults' fault. This is their parents' fault; it is the fault of those who manage their country or their world.\n\nBecause of all of these reasons, young people do not devote time to helping their communities. Yes, I accept that it's not entirely their fault. They can be easily trained to be good children, good citizens, and so good people. We can solve this problem with some formulas if we really want to solve it. We can give our teens responsibilities in their communities. We can provide them with good opportunities to think more and help their communities."}
{"file_id": "1076869.txt", "output_essay": "I am of the opinion that it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject. There are many reasons and examples that I would like to list in support of my position.\n\nFirst, let us consider those cases in which the author's contentions, in fact my contentions, hold good. Firstly, let us consider the field of science and technology. Consider, for example, a biology student faced with the problem of replacing a burned-out fuse. If he does not have any knowledge about the electrical subject, he may not be able to fix a very simple task.\n\nAlso, a student of technology should have a minimum idea of what medicine to take when a minor health problem arises. So, a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is necessary.\n\nSecondly, if, for example, a student is confined to study only the history of his own country, which is his specific academic subject, then he may face problems when asked about world history and some important events in world history.\n\nThirdly, consider the example of designing a computer. Many people who perform different tasks are involved in designing a computer. If the person who designs a part of the computer does not understand the functions of other parts and the link between those parts, then a computer cannot be designed.\n\nFinally, also a person of science or technology may find difficulty in the business world if he knows nothing about the stock market. This can be extended even to politics. If the party members have an idea only about their own party, then they are at risk of losing their position if they do not have knowledge about the other parties.\n\nIn sum, I would like to reiterate that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject, which helps an individual enhance his general knowledge in addition to the regular subject."}

Sometimes they work for a long time and can't take time for themselves. Some of them work hard depending on their jobs. These days, people work hard because time is very important to them. They want to use their time efficiently in their jobs. During this period, they can forget to help their communities. I agree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.\n\nFirst of all, young people have a lot of things to do. Business is very important in their lives. They want to have a perfect life and to be good family members. They work in a hard or an easy job, and time is limited for them. Their community is a secondary concern because of their job lives.\n\nSecondly, young people want to have time for themselves. They do something to relax. For instance, they go somewhere during their free time. They have various hobbies, and some young people want to be alone. They can help themselves. There is no time for their communities.\n\nFinally, the rhythm of young people's lives is very different and changeable. This situation depends on their personal characteristics. Some of them are very workaholic, while others are very lazy. Furthermore, environmental changes affect them. They can easily change their behavior. Indeed, some things are not important to them. They do not have a good relationship with their family or friends. Most work or jobs can affect them easily. They can forget that they have a family or friends.\n\nIn brief, it can be hard to find time for some specific reasons to give enough time to helping someone. Indeed, giving time to help someone depends on our own efforts. These days, everybody wants to have a good life or a job."}

On the other hand, there are also some who believe that advertising really has a lot to offer, and I think I would be counted in the second group.\n\nAdvertising can enhance anything by providing a good picturization of the product. The better the picturization, the greater the fascination towards the product, and looks matter a lot. For example, when we go to a coffee shop and see a lot of coffees, all of which are totally unknown to us, which one would you choose? Certainly, the one that looks most appealing to you, isn't it? That is where advertising comes into the picture. It's the magic of advertising.\n\nAdvertising enables us to show the good sides of anything. As we all know, nothing in this world is perfect. All things have their dark sides too. So, with a little help from advertising, we can highlight the positive points of a product and can conceal the negative aspects.\n\nFor instance, let's take the example of cold drinks like cola, Pepsi, etc. These drinks are so popular among people. But the question is, why are they so popular? We know that these drinks are not good for health. Even then, they do a great deal of business all over the world. The credit for this should go to advertising. Advertising completely hides the negative effects of the drinks and makes them popular.\n\nNowadays, even some schools are providing training on how to do advertising. These schools consider advertising an art. And we all know what art is for: to increase the beauty of something. And that's what an advertisement does. An advertisement increases the worth of the product.\n\nA coin has two faces. Now, it is up to us how we are going to show it to others. Advertising not only tells us how we should present something but also how to present it with even better looks. In conclusion, advertising enhances the worth and beauty of products, and that makes people buy them."}
{"file_id": "1089601.txt", "output_essay": "When it comes to students' learning, the discussion of the issue has become vogue over the last decade. Considering the social atmosphere today, some people hold the opinion that learning facts is more important and superior to understanding ideas and concepts. Others, however, contradict this by emphasizing the importance of learning facts. Personally, I agree that understanding ideas and concepts has more advantages.\n\nFirstly, those who agree on learning facts forget a universal truth, as an old saying goes, 'You don't know the smell until you taste it.' As I remember, the people who are popular in society all have strong abilities that play a role in their work areas. These abilities cannot be learned in classes because they require more practice in the real society.\n\nIn addition, another essential factor why I advocate for understanding being more important is that learning facts without understanding will be forgotten soon. An example I can give to detail the argument: some people like to copy others' work in order to hand it in to the teacher, but they never understand what the answers mean because they just learn to do, not understand to do. Thus, they couldn't acquire the knowledge.\n\nOf course, choosing to learn facts also has advantages to some extent. For example, the teacher always gives us the right answer, which could avoid a waste of time; they also guide us on the shortest way to reach the results; and they do good for us to make a better life, and so on.\n\nBut if all these factors are contemplated, the advantages of understanding ideas and concepts carry more weight than those of learning facts. To sum up, based on the above discussion, it is obvious to conclude that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts."}

Just as engines require petroleum products to function, communities need the attention of young people to be strong and well-organized. However, due to the education young people receive, the lifestyle of those they live with, and daily events that lead to pessimism, young people do not pay as much attention to their communities as they did in the past.\n\nFirstly, the education we receive throughout our lives has significant effects on our lifestyles. It is evident that well-educated individuals care more for their community than those who are less educated. For example, consider someone who has graduated from university. This person has knowledge of what a community needs and can make informed decisions about what to do for the community.\n\nSecondly, young people are easily influenced by the people they live with. Isn't it true that young people want to emulate their parents? If their parents do not care about the community they live in, then the young people, who are often seen as smaller versions of their parents, are likely to behave similarly.\n\nThese are not the only factors that can negatively influence young people. Has anyone considered how daily events might adversely affect them? Take, for instance, the topic of war occurring in Middle Eastern countries. This could be one of the reasons young people are pessimistic about the future and their community.\n\nIn conclusion, from my standpoint, it is true that young people do not dedicate enough time to their communities. I strongly believe that this can be changed."}

However, once he/she has found it, he/she must specialize in his/her own work.\n\nSometimes, a license in a particular field is not required. A simple course can help you to find a job.

In fact, from my point of view, young people are less responsible than other mature individuals. Generally, in recent years, the way to enjoy life has changed. In fact, today young people have fewer problems than young people did forty years ago, for example. Today, a boy is totally dependent on his parents. In this way, he has less responsibility, and this causes total dissatisfaction for all.\n\nContrary to young people, older individuals have achieved a level of maturity that allows them to enjoy life more than young people with simple things, like a dinner with friends or a trip with family.\n\nIt is also true that young boys have a lot of enthusiasm compared to older people. But this concept doesn't overshadow the problems. There are also cases where older people don't enjoy life because they have very big problems, like the inability to find work or because they are very tired.\n\nSo, my personal opinion is that a young boy, given the same conditions, doesn't enjoy life as much. In fact, even in my family, I see that my parents enjoy life more than my brother and me. Finally, I must say that I disagree with the above statement."}
{"file_id": "1088827.txt", "output_essay": "I agree, it is the best way to travel in groups led by a tour guide because in groups the tour may be filled with fun and joy.\n\nOne can always find it boring to travel alone. The tour in groups can feel like one family with brothers, sisters, uncles, grandfathers, and grandmothers. So, we feel very happy spending time with all the group members, and there are no worries as there is a guide who helps and shows all the locations along the way.\n\nIn groups, there is no need to worry about security problems or feelings of loneliness. In groups, we may receive many concessions on fares and some packages which are offered at low rates; this is an advantage of traveling in groups.\n\nThe best example is when I was in high school; we had a tour to New Delhi. Meanwhile, we enjoyed the journey on the train by singing songs, dancing, and joking with one another. After reaching there, we visited all the tourist spots as a group and had a very jolly time.\n\nIt was different when I visited the same locations alone; I felt very bad, even uninterested in seeing all the places. Another reason is that the people with whom we would like to tour may always be busy or unable to find the time to come with us. So, we never feel like we are missing them when we move in groups. We don't realize how time flies with them; it is like magic, and we may forget all our worries and move into a new world of dreams.\n\nEveryone likes to visit places, but mostly they think about the travel time and the expenses. If we travel alone, the expenses will be more, and we should spend more on commodities for our needs. In group travel, expenses per person may vary as the number of persons increases; the cost per head may decrease. So, within a low budget, with security, and with company, we may have our tour successfully with a lot of joy and happiness."}

For example, opening a new business, like a restaurant, would be a risk for people who do not have expertise in that type of business. However, if they seek advice from experts in that area and make a sound judgment of the possibilities of that particular business, it is good to take the risk.\n\nAnother example of a type of risk that people can take in order to reach success is taking the chance to apply to a university to get a degree. Some people think that they will be rejected and because of that, they just stay in the same position that they are at that moment, maybe because they have a fear of failure. If they do not work hard to get what they want and do not risk the possibility of feeling rejected, it is something that, I believe, will affect them in the future when they think about the things they have done in their past and did not do. That won't make the person feel successful.\n\nFor all these reasons, I believe that successful people should take risks and learn to do new things in life."}

People can travel for pleasure to exotic places like Hawaii or Bermuda, or they can travel in search of culture, such as to Egypt or Japan. Usually, couples go to these places looking for relaxation.\n\nIf people travel for pleasure, they do not need a tour guide because travel agencies usually offer packages with all the activities included. These activities are for relaxation and fun. You do not need a guide for that. However, if you are planning to go to Egypt, for example, you will need a tour guide.\n\nA tour guide is a person who knows about the area and, most importantly, knows about history. When people travel, 'time' is very important, so you need to see and learn as much as you can in less time. Therefore, a tour guide is the right person to accomplish this goal.\n\nA tour guide not only knows about history and important places but also about good restaurants, places to have fun, and places to avoid because of security concerns.\n\nI remember when I went to Mexico, my friends and I visited some ruins and we hired a tour guide. While we were on the bus going to the city 'El Carmen,' the tour guide started explaining and talking about the ruins; by the time we got there, we knew what to expect.\n\nI would like to go to Egypt in the future with a group of friends, and we will definitely be led by a tour guide.

{"file_id": "1086925.txt", "output_essay": "Everybody is confronted with advertisements in their daily life. About 5,000 different kinds of advertisements influence us day by day. But do the advertisements reflect reality, or do they just make the products seem better than they are? I think that ads definitely show the products in a better light because they don't mention the dangers of the product. Furthermore, the real price is often not shown.\n\nFirstly, advertisements should change our consumer habits. Thus, the products are displayed better than they really are. For instance, McDonald's tries to attract people by showing consumers photos of their burgers. The burgers in the photos are made of plastic because they look fresher than the real burgers.\n\nWhat's more, the advertisements don't show the dangers of these products. Let's take McDonald's again as an example. It is commonly known that the products of the fast-food restaurant lead to overweight. Nevertheless, the advertisements don't mention any of these disadvantages because McDonald's wants, of course, people to buy their product. Another example is toys for little children. As they are often produced in China, they contain materials of low quality. In some cases, the toys are even toxic for the children.\n\nThese are dangers which are definitely not mentioned in the advertisements, an unacceptable way to distract from dangers, in my opinion. Thirdly, the real price is always hidden in the advertisements. For instance, the big airlines try to attract people with cheap offers, e.g., one flight from Munich to Berlin for only 30 Euros. In fact, this offer doesn't represent the real price because it doesn't include the additional fees of airports or the extra costs of fuel. Actually, the flight costs about 55 Euros, almost double the price advertised.\n\nAll in all, advertisements distort reality. McDonald's tries to offer its burgers with photos that don't show the real burger. Additionally, the hazards of the products aren't mentioned. Hence, McDonald's and Co. distract from the problem of overweight by showing salads which seem to be good for health. It is a fact that these salads even have more calories than normal burgers. Moreover, toy-selling companies want to make their toxic products attractive to consumers. Finally, false prices annoy the consumer.\n\nAs far as I'm concerned, I think the development of advertising should be stopped. Products should be bought by people because they are of good quality, not because the advertisements make them seem much better than they really are."}

Conversely, if you just learn the facts of the events, they won't last in your mind as much.\n\nAn example that I believe can be given is when high school students learn about historical events. If they just memorize dates, names, and places, they will be able to remember them only to apply them in a test, unless it's a super important subject of history.\n\nBut if they analyze the situation, analyze the events that occurred, and comprehend why that event occurred in the first place, they will like the subject more. They will feel a little bit smarter, and the dates, the names, and the places will take a back seat. This will even help them when they have to memorize dates and such because they will be able to associate the purposes and reasons of the events with the numbers and the names.\n\nI believe that learning does not have to be boring. If you just memorize everything and study just because you want to get a good grade, you are not fulfilling the real purpose of learning. You're just dealing with a lot of problems, getting yourself tired and bored.\n\nStudying can be fun. If you understand everything, you will feel smart. If you just learn the facts without actually understanding what they mean, you will feel bad and less intelligent. So, I think that teachers should encourage students to exceed themselves and to develop their intelligence, not to memorize a thousand books without understanding anything or without even learning things that will truly be helpful in their lives.\n\nPeople who are truly smart can solve a problem without the necessity of consulting someone else who's supposed to be more intelligent. And if you need to read something a thousand times to actually grasp the idea, you're just a mere puppet. It is pointless to live as a puppet because, at the end of your life, you will feel bad for having restricted your true intelligence."}

However, this propensity of both groups to behave in a certain manner does not determine the exact outcome of individual personality development, which is a key factor that truly determines how effectively a person chooses to enjoy the beauties of his or her existence. Hence, when we speak of a vast majority, one should definitely consider the fact that youngsters are more open to challenges and ecstasy than senior citizens, who seek a calm state of being, which, in the eyes of society, is less likely to express the true enjoyment of life.\n\nYoung people have the strength and availability to discover new grounds; it is part of our nature that whenever we discover and explore, sentiments of joy fill our souls. That is what young people take advantage of, that is, their physical condition and psychological standpoint that drives them to seek gratifying experiences more often than elders do, and finally accomplishing such a goal.\n\nMy grandfather used to play soccer when he was young, and that was his favorite sport. He received so much joy and gratification from this activity that he would never miss a game. Now, he is 70 years old and all he wants to do is rest. He used to tell me, 'Soccer is it, son. Once it's gone, you only live from your memories.' Now I am a soccer player, and this sport has become part of who I am, like a blueprint. My life would not be the same if I did not play, due to the fact that I find so much joy and happiness in it.\n\nThus, I believe young people do enjoy life in a more complete manner, not to be unjust or partial, but because it goes beyond what is palpable; it is a cycle, the cycle of life. Just like a flower reaches its most beautiful point and opens up in all its splendor and, after a certain time, dries up and dies, so is a man who lives and finishes his race. Even though older people might find joy in different tasks, their cycle already allowed them to reach a certain climax that was once considered as true enjoyment, therefore leading the way for those behind them to discover and search for the same type of gratification, making the levels of joy definitely higher at a young age."}

Going to school, exercising my body, and exploring the new world are all enjoyable for me and other young people. To do them, pioneer spirits, healthy bodies, and motivation for getting new things are required. However, these are heavy tasks for older people. Among them, some still have those powers, but most tend to be less motivated. For example, my grandmother does not want to do anything except for her routines, which are to take care of the household or talk to only similar people during the day. One time, I asked her to travel with my family. But she refused, even though she was very healthy. She just did not want to leave her house and the normal environment she was accustomed to.\n\nOn the other hand, we young people are not afraid of a new life or environment because we have a lot of dreams for a new world. It makes us more enjoyable than the older generation. I think that older people ought to have interests to enjoy their life. It might help them to fit into society and the public.

First, I think that continuing one thing for a long time is capable of making a person successful. For example, a doctor has looked for a more effective cure for his patient to alleviate the patient's suffering. He has to consider risk and return. He should not take high risk with high return, high risk with low return, or low risk with low return. He has to aim for high return and low risk. If the doctor tends to take risks, what happens at the end? Second, I think that it is more important to be concerned about old things. Trying new things means throwing away old things. But old things that you had thrown away long ago may bring you a great chance. That is a possible story, isn't it? Third, obeying that statement has the possibility of losing tradition.

Enjoying life doesn't depend on a person's age; it depends on their vision, expectations from life, and spirit.\n\nEven though some people are young, they aren't happy with life because their vision is not sufficient for happiness. They think that small obstacles prevent them from being happy. For instance, I know many older individuals who try to enjoy life despite having some disabilities. They attend various activities to learn new things and have a good time. This is normal for them because it aligns with their vision.\n\nPeople's expectations from life change as they age. Older people believe that the most important thing in life is to be happy, and they strive for happiness in their later years because they understand better than young people that life is really short, and they are doing their best during this time, unlike young people.\n\nLastly, a person's spirit is another essential factor in their lives. Being a younger person is not important; it only provides some advantages. For example, young people can spend more energy and do many things in a short time, but older people organize their lives to do more things, like travel and sports, to enjoy life.\n\nConsequently, being happy is not really related to a person's age.

First, knowing a wide range of subjects can be useful for understanding various situations that require background in different fields.

Second, knowledge of many subjects can provide the advantage of making analogies.

Specialization is a theory that emphasizes the importance of concentration in one particular field. When this theory was employed by factories and manufacturing plants, it resulted in a dramatic increase in production. Of course, specialization has its drawbacks and faults, which are caused due to a lack of knowledge in other fields, but the benefit of knowing one thing really well greatly outweighs the faults of specialization.\n\nA reason why specialization is so successful is because eventually (usually after 12 years or so of schooling), people realize that they are better at some things than at others, or they realize that they have a passion for a certain field and that that's what they want to do for the rest of their lives. At this point in time, it becomes apparent to them that other knowledge, that doesn't further their understanding of their subject choice, is a waste of time. After all, if someone wishes to be a mechanical engineer, why does he need to know the literary features that Shakespeare used to capture his audience's attention?\n\nI've already decided what I want to do in life, and to tell the truth, studying things like Spanish and Business seems to divert time away from my goals of becoming a research scientist. I love reading about the latest medical breakthroughs and discoveries, but all I get from learning Spanish is frustration and low marks. I sincerely doubt the importance of Spanish in the long run; I mean, sure, it might help me communicate with people who only know Spanish, but how many people will I meet like that? Through my personal experiences, I've learned the importance of knowledge in all areas, but I've also seen the importance of specialization, and in my opinion, to know one thing very well is a lot better than knowing relatively nothing about everything."}
{"file_id": "1094106.txt", "output_essay": "People have to study a variety of subjects throughout their lives. Some are interested in a wide range of topics, while others prefer to focus on specific areas. Although having a wealth of information related to anything is valuable, it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.\n\nIf you want to have broad knowledge, you must work hard in all areas. This approach is very challenging for people. In addition, you cannot achieve something properly if you choose broad knowledge. Furthermore, you cannot know everything about your subjects because you have to study each subject.\n\nOn the other hand, specializing in one specific subject is not as difficult as the other because you only have to work on one topic. This specialization provides some advantages for you. For example, because you focus on only one topic, you can conduct your research more thoroughly and know everything about that subject.\n\nAs a result, specializing in one specific subject is better than having broad knowledge of many academic subjects. I believe people use this method to be successful."}

There are a few reasons for this. First, recently, concern for environmental pollution is getting higher. Of course, it is not caused only by cars, but the great number of cars significantly affects air and water quality, among other things. Moreover, in our daily lives, the car is a very noticeable element in the environment.\n\nSecond, stemming from the aforementioned first reason, the number of car owners is not increasing as before. For example, my parents saw owning a car as a dream when they were young. Now, at almost the same age as they were at that time, I do not need any cars. I do not feel it is necessary. The significance of having a car is changing more than before.\n\nThird, many vehicles have been developed very well, so we can go anywhere using them, such as trains, airplanes, or ships. Moreover, although there is not just one company but many offering their vehicles competitively, we can use them more cheaply than before.\n\nSome people may disagree with my opinion. The market for motor cars is still strong, and therefore, their number may not decrease. Of course, in Japan also, the market is still vigorous. If I watch a TV program, I can see a lot of commercials throughout the time. Even now, many people may be purchasing new cars. But I think that the recent mainstream has obviously changed; that is to say, the most noticeable trend is the new type of car that does not emit any pollutants. In addition, eco-cars, which use electricity instead of nonrenewable resources like petroleum, are famous and popular. I think that this shows our views have changed from before.\n\nTherefore, I agree with the statement that recently fewer cars are in use. The number of cars will decrease."}
{"file_id": "1099256.txt", "output_essay": "Yes, I agree that most advertisements make products seem better than they really are. Advertisements already focus on encouraging consumers to buy products. Their way of reaching this goal is by making consumers admire the product. Thus, products must be attractive and appeal to the various senses of the consumer. Demands must be creatively generated by advertisements.\n\nAdvertisement is one of the marketing tools. It doesn't deliver a direct message; advertisements are generally imaginative, colorful, and attractive. They must not be boring. Advertisements cater to the six senses of humans to create demands.\n\nFor example, orange juice advertisements can target people of all ages. The messages might convey power, energy, sex, dreams, health, and even present the product as if it were medicine. Even the pictures of nice, real oranges are more colorful, but they include added sugar, water, fruit perfumes, glucose, fruit nectar, etc. There may be an enjoyable atmosphere in the background of the advertisement, for example, a party with young people. That could convey messages of sex, romance, etc.\n\nSo, successful advertisement will be determined by the rate of consumer engagement. How much it separates people from other products, earns profits, and adds value are important points in making advertisements that make products seem better than they really are."}

There are two reasons for this: being more active than older individuals and having fewer experiences.\n\nFirst of all, young people are more active than older ones. Therefore, they have so much energy to do everything. For example, body condition is quite different between young people and old people. When our family tried to hike Mt. Fuji, which is the tallest mountain in Japan, my sister and I could get to the top. However, my parents could not do that. Moreover, obviously, young people's body function is better than that of older individuals. If they have a physical examination, the result is easy to predict. Thus, young people ought to enjoy their life.\n\nSecond of all, young people need to have a lot of experiences. They are very young. Their experiences are naturally limited. Older people have already experienced many things and have stepped into adulthood, which means that they can make decisions for themselves.\n\nIn conclusion, I support the idea that young people enjoy life more than older people do. If they enjoy their life, they will become good people."}

I believe that it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.\n\nIf it is better to master one specific subject, why do schools teach numerous subjects to students? A student might argue that the subjects they are learning in school are useless and meaningless to learn. This is not true because as you grow more mature, you will realize that the things you learned in school really come to help in real life. So, it is better to study and have knowledge of various types of subjects rather than having unlimited knowledge of one subject.\n\nIt may seem better to specialize in one specific subject when you get a specific job that requires the knowledge you learned. Well, this is just in your career. When you step out into the social world, the things you learned are too specialized that no one, but you and people who work with it, understand. If you want to get involved in social life and understand life better, it is better to know many things. For example, when you go to a party where all kinds of different people gather. You want to talk to people, but you only know that specific topic and do not know other topics that people talk about. As a result, you will feel secluded and alone.\n\nIn conclusion, it is better to have broad knowledge of many subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.

For a moment, let's take the word 'enjoying life' as having fun and doing lots of things.\n\nYoung people are active because of their age. Age is a big advantage. They have the energy for doing lots of things. For example, traveling, riding a bike, running, and sex, of course, things most older people don't have much energy to do. And of course, they have kids, maybe even grandkids, to tie them into the life they currently have. This is maybe their only satisfaction in life. To be able to achieve lots of things that younger people have not achieved yet. Because of this satisfaction, they may have no need to really experience different things.\n\nOn the other hand, I cannot really say that young people can enjoy life much either. The 21st century really does not allow many of us to explore. With the need for a successful job, the need for a diploma appears. With the need for a diploma, money comes into the story. Well, we all know that we cannot grow money on trees, so we start working part or full time at an early age. On top of working, we have to study in order to graduate. Even after all of this, the only time we will enjoy life seems like retirement. Well, again, when we retire, we are considered older people. So tell me, who are the people that really have fun, younger or older people?\n\nHaving fun is not about age or activity. It is about being able to enjoy life at its most. We are the ones who determine the term 'enjoying life' for ourselves. At any age, if we are satisfied with what we are doing, who we are, and how we interact with people, then we are the ones who choose to enjoy or not to enjoy.\n\nLet's ask this question to ourselves: TO ENJOY OR NOT TO ENJOY?"}

My classmates and I, chosen to represent our school at the meeting, were newcomers and needed an explanation in order to fulfill expectations. We weren't clear about the process. Our highly demanding teacher made us participate in a re-enactment of last year's meeting, and even though it took us a while to get the idea, once we got the hang of it, we cleared our doubts and understood the concept. Model UN is not just another extracurricular activity; it was an opportunity for success. We were training our minds to think for others, to speak for those who can't speak for themselves, and to come up with resolutions to worldwide problems. That is the truthful concept of Model UN, and we knew that even before getting there. Once we arrived in La Ceiba, the Model UN scenery, we had an ultimate learning experience.\n\nOur instructor could have listed a series of facts, and sure, it'd help, but we'd have to wait until the next meeting to stand out and get the idea.\n\nIt is always a clever move to have an image of what the teaching is supposed to convey and not walk blindly through a learning path.

As we know, cars are a source of pollution, and as their use increases, pollution worsens due to carbon dioxide and other harmful gases emitted by vehicles. Therefore, people will reduce their car use.\n\nSecondly, when everyone uses a car, it creates traffic jam problems, causing people to spend their lives on the road, unable to do what they want on time. Consequently, they will prefer other forms of transportation such as buses and subways, which are faster than cars.\n\nThirdly, it is evident that people will continue to die even as medicine advances. In the future, with many people choosing not to marry and have children, there will only be a slight increase in population. Hence, the situation will not be much different from now.\n\nTherefore, people will not use cars more in the future than they do routinely.

{"file_id": "1098127.txt", "output_essay": "An ancient Arabic saying goes, \"Take whole things from a particular thing, and take something from all things.\" Having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better than focusing on one specialized subject for many reasons: it enriches strict sciences, provides another scientist's perspective, and expands personal awareness.\n\nFirst, sciences are complicated and interconnected. By way of example, there is an intersection between Law and Politics, so any specialist interested in Law needs to study a little about Politics. And there are many sciences which are concentrated from many sciences, such as Biochemistry, Economic Law,\n\nFurthermore, specialists need to know some information about broad sciences to build bridges with other specialists; they and other people need each other to share their knowledge, experiences, researches. For example, a professor of Physics will benefit a lot from a professor of Math, which will encourage their ideas and theories, so\n\nMoreover, a broad knowledge expands the awareness of the mind; it provides a lot of information that cannot be found in the similar labs where specialists stay. As an example, a professor of Law cannot know anything about periods of Arabic poets if he does not deal with an Arabic Literature professor. Also, he can enjoy people's inventions and gain more diverse perspectives on life.\n\nAs a result, I agree with having broad knowledge because it has a lot of advantages, changes the relationship between scientists, and expands awareness."}

Therefore, it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject because it can help people to improve their social lives, develop other skills that they have not yet known, and secure good jobs.\n\nHaving a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better because it can improve people's social lives. For instance, when one talks to other people who like sports, even though one does not like sports, he can still talk about sports topics with other people. Because he knows about sports, he can create good friendships by communicating easily.\n\nMoreover, learning about various subjects might help people to discover other skills. For example, a doctor who works every day might study dancing and find that dance is her interest. Therefore, she has another skill and interest, which is quite different from being a doctor and a dancer.\n\nFinally, having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better because it makes it easier to change to a better job. Because people have a lot of skills and knowledge required by some companies, they can probably be hired by any company. For example, consider two people interviewing for a job. One has wide knowledge, while the other has specific knowledge. There are much more chances that the boss will hire the first person.\n\nConsequently, having broad knowledge of many academic subjects can help people not only to have good social lives and develop other skills but also to secure good jobs."}

From my former experiences as a student and as a worker, I would like to support my point of view.\n\nThrough studying International Relations at a top Mexican university, I was able to understand the global context in which we live. Nevertheless, early in my studies, I realized that to enhance my criteria regarding international dealings, I would have to delve into the area of sociology.\n\nIn-depth personal research on this subject has not only refined my capacity to understand but also my capacity to negotiate and go beyond the evident, especially when dealing with different cultures and perspectives. Among my favorite authors is Dr. Kevin Skandia, who in his work 'The Clash of Civilizations,' strongly emphasizes, in one of his chapters, the subject of leadership and how to be successful. He states that in order to become a leader and a pioneer, you have to get out of the conventional; you and I have to go beyond the 'establishment' to break the way things are done so as to create a better way to carry on things.\n\nObviously, people have to take risks and be aware of failure, so successful people will go after their goal knowing in advance that they probably will fail, knowing that this is the best way to succeed.\n\nMy work as a specialized purchaser for Walmart, one of the largest retailers worldwide, has faced me with enormous challenges that have demanded full effectiveness to work well under pressure and competition. This experience has helped me to realize that innovation and imagination are two important tools to succeed anywhere you are, and again, in order to be successful, we have to go beyond and try new ways to do our duties.\n\nSince it is company policy to upgrade the expertise of employees, we are consistently enrolled in conferences and meetings, many international in nature, that have given me many an opportunity to exchange ideas and share decisions that helped us in our everyday jobs. While exchanging ideas or having conversations with people from around the world, our conversations often drift to more casual topics like the everyday decisions we have to make in our lives, and we remind ourselves of the importance of being sure of yourself and sure about the things you are to carry on in order to be successful.\n\nIn the end, I have always thought that only a few people have the courage to do something else in order to break their 'status quo,' and those kinds of persons are the ones who change and succeed in what they are after.

Young people are able to travel to different countries easily without worrying about anyone staying back, like children. For example, my parents have three children, including me. If they want to travel to Spain during their free time, they cannot leave their children because children need to be looked after. In this case, young people who do not have any children can easily go traveling.\n\nMoreover, young people usually want to learn and gain a lot of different kinds of experiences during their early ages. I can remember when my brother was nineteen, he used to go to music festivals, theaters, and travel a lot. Basically, he enjoyed a lot because he had time, a sufficient amount of money, and energy. Also, he could easily adapt to difficult conditions whatever he faced. I cannot imagine that older people join a party and a boat trip on the same day.\n\nIn conclusion, it cannot be compared whether young people enjoy life more than older people or not.

I believe that having a tour guide is the best way to travel in a group. To begin with, the tour guide should be someone who lives in the local area of the travel destination. This way, the guide is familiar with the local customs, beautiful sights, and people. For instance, my hometown is Shanghai, a city with a rich history and revolutionary significance from the last century. I would take a group of travelers to notable places such as the 'Chenghuang' Temple and the 'Wai Tan' bay, among others. I can offer a glimpse into the variety of their lives, from food to communication. I recall a story from my country where a group of travelers from a foreign country visited Hunan—a province in our country. They stayed there for three days without any guidance for their travels. Heavy rain caused a flood, and subsequently, they fell ill without any medical care. Fortunately, a local tour guide helped them out of danger because she could communicate with them and found some pills made from a special plant. This illustrates why traveling in a group led by a tour guide is the best way; it could even save lives. Finally, I would like to mention a tour guide from ancient China—Xu Xiakeng. He once said, 'Do not change your travel purpose, but a guide will help.' This statement emphasizes that a tour guide is crucial for a group, as everyone who wishes to travel shares the same dream."}

I remember when I was young, there were not that many possibilities to help the community, and they were also not attractive to young people. There is also a big difference depending on where you live. In a large city, there are not as many communities you can engage with as there are in smaller villages or towns.\n\nAnother point is the fact that nowadays young people have a lot more to do and not as much time as it was years ago. They have to go to school or study a lot, and most young people have to work besides their school to earn money to live. If they already have a job besides school, they probably will not take a community job without getting paid. They do not have the time and the money to help the community.\n\nWorking in the community also has advantages which most young people do not know about. A community job integrates you into your environment if you are new. It can also help you to find friends, or the community helps you if you have a problem. It can also give you social support if you do not know what to do or have no other things in your life. It is a good way for older people who do not have to work anymore to get a job for their life.

Indeed, I understand the logic which lies beneath that assumption, but personally, I don't have the impression that it is a veracity.\n\nFirst of all, it is important to analyze why someone who only meets success is more likely to take risks than somebody else. As a matter of fact, when you succeed in a project, you feel satisfied. The more you achieve what you want, the more confident you become. Then, it is like a spiral: the more you get, the more you want to get. In fact, when you plan to start a business and it works well, you think about expanding your activities. If it works and you are already at the head of a big company, you may diversify your business. That is why big companies like Bouygues are in building, mobile phones, and so on. Virgin makes discs but also develops its own mobile phone programs. Those companies take risks while entering new markets. They believe in their success because they are supported by their customers.\n\nHowever, new things are not always done by successful people. Creativity, for instance, has nothing to do with success; it is about personality. So an artist does not always meet success. Nonetheless, his or her desire to create will still go on. That explains why a lot of painters made a lot of breakthroughs after many failures. Another example is Alain Baraton, a famous gardener in Versailles. He failed during his school years, but then, while he worked in Versailles, he developed a passion for gardening and created new arrangements around the castle. Besides, you cannot be successful all the time, but it does not mean that you are less willing to do new things. In addition to that, someone who really wants to be recognized by society and has never achieved that goal will probably try everything he or she can.\n\nIn conclusion, success is not so closely tied to 'boldness' as the statement suggests."}

I considered this piece of writing for a very long time and came to the conclusion that it is more worthwhile to distinguish between young and old people than between females and males. Nevertheless, I am of mixed opinion concerning this question.\n\nOn the one hand, you might get the impression that young people enjoy life more than older ones if you observe from the outside. But the only reason for that is that young people live their lives more actively than older ones. They try new things, have fun whenever there is the chance, and make their own experiences in order to develop a personality. Students, for instance, like to go to parties or hang around at the beach playing soccer because they know that in later professional life they will not have the chance to act like that.\n\nOn the other hand, older people have gathered a vast amount of experience during their lives. Consequently, they no longer feel any pressure to act like younger ones. I believe that they also had an active, exciting life in their youth. But with a certain decrease in age, other things like family, health, or financial security become more and more important for them. So in my view, they simply have a distinct way of enjoying their lives. They get their satisfaction by going for a healthy walk in the park or having a cup of tea with their husband or wife in the nice restaurant next to the beach. Unfortunately, these facts are invisible to people observing from the outside, so the wrong impression might arise that older people do not enjoy their life.\n\nAll things considered, I would state that neither the young nor the older people enjoy their life more. Each group has its own way to enjoy life. The youth often express themselves more actively, while older people are satisfied by a calm and especially healthy life."}

For example, I am currently attending law school and I spend most of my time preparing for classes. Also, I do some part-time jobs because I need money to socialize. However, my parents are retired and they spend most of their time traveling, planning trips, and so on.\n\nSecond, older people tend to have enough budget to enjoy their life. For example, my parents love traveling and they went to Peru and Western Europe last year. I also like traveling abroad, but I do not have enough money, so I ended up traveling domestically by renting a car and staying in motels.\n\nThird, older people are more likely to have a clear objective regarding what they want to do in their free time because there were many things they could not do when they were working due to insufficient time. For example, my father's dream was to visit Peru, which he could achieve after retirement because he was unable to get a long enough vacation to go abroad while working.\n\nIt is true that young people are healthier and some older people cannot do what they want because they cannot move. However, there are many older people who are organizing poetry clubs or reading clubs and enjoying their life regardless of their immobility.\n\nIn conclusion, older people are enjoying their life much more than young people because they have more free time, more financial resources, and a stronger desire to do something they could not do when they were young."}

For example, in Japanese traditional arts like Kabuki or Noh, the performers repeat the practice of the same story every day from the day they start practicing when they are around 3 years old until the day they die. However, we all admit that they could succeed in fully expressing the traditional arts as parts of Japanese culture. The same also applies to traditional craftsmen or even professional baseball players. They improve their abilities by repeating the same things which are most familiar to them every day. These examples are enough to deny the statement above.\n\nBesides, even if trying new things brings you the chances for success, new things must mean things that are new to everyone, not just to the person alone.

People have to work individually, but they also should work for the group of which they are a member. Not a specific group I mean; they have to participate in public, for example, in a school or in a family. Teenagers are not familiar with their responsibilities as a student and also as a family member.\n\nUsually, people start learning to be a part of a community in a family. Children should study lessons, show respect to older members, while parents should work for the family and help their children to become better adults. Besides the general idea, they also have to love each other and should have a good relationship. Unfortunately, young people avoid being closer to their parents. They don't listen to the advice an experienced adult can give; instead, they start getting away from their home. Teenagers even want to be with their unknown friends rather than spending time with their brothers or sisters.\n\nAnother example where young people show responsibility is at their schools. They have to participate in classes, study for exams, and also study for the future to get a good job. Recently, students think school is somewhere to get away from home or have fun without any preparation for lessons. They see the rules as challenges that they have to break to get attention. Then school disciplines have more strict rules to control them. So the community they try to work for falls apart. Teenagers should give up some of their freedom to have a peaceful school life.\n\nTo conclude, young people should sometimes act like grown-ups to better control their lives. If they can be good students, friends, siblings, daughters/sons, they can create a better community and they also can enjoy where they are and what they are doing."}
{"file_id": "1101921.txt", "output_essay": "I disagree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities because the youth spend much of their time helping individuals with disabilities and also assisting older people. For these reasons, the statement is incorrect.\nAn example is when a young person has grandparents, such as a grandfather or grandmother. When they help them, they are aiding the community because they spend time assisting an older person with buying food, water, medicine, and other necessities. They also spend time talking with them, which in some cases is more important than simply taking a list of what they need.\nThis is the same aspect present when a young person helps someone with disabilities because the true problem isn't their inability to do something, but rather the need to speak and interact with others, similar to themselves. And these individuals are often the youth.\nI know many young people who, in addition to the time they spend on themselves, also dedicate a portion of their remaining time to help these individuals. This is very important for the community and the people who do this."}
{"file_id": "1088889.txt", "output_essay": "Many people prefer to take a trip alone without a tour guide. They say that they like it because they want to avoid crowds, planned itineraries, and take a break with some alone time. Although these are valid reasons, traveling in a group with a tour guide has many advantages that we should consider. Not only can group touring reduce danger in foreign nations, but it is also really convenient and ensures we visit essential points.\n\nFirst of all, group touring with a tour guide entails less danger of encountering problems in foreign countries than traveling alone. Since people are not familiar with foreign nations, there is a greater danger of fraud or accidents. For example, many Koreans have been defrauded by foreigners during trips to East Asia. This includes murders, robberies, and so on. Moreover, if there are accidents in foreign countries, people usually become embarrassed, so they cannot act properly. However, since guides are usually locals, they are well-informed about the country's conditions and situations, so the dangers are significantly reduced.\n\nNext, group touring is really comfortable and helps us to see essential places. Since tour companies already plan and make reservations, people can enjoy their journey by simply following the schedule. For instance, there is no danger of a lack of hotel rooms because the companies have already booked them. Moreover, as stated above, guides are knowledgeable about the country, so they can take us to the most famous and beautiful places.\n\nAs I mentioned above, a group tour led by a tour guide has many advantages. It entails fewer dangers because we are in a group and led by a tour guide. Also, it is convenient since companies have already made a schedule for the trip; all we need to do is follow the plan. Therefore, I agree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide."}
{"file_id": "1105037.txt", "output_essay": "Although some people think that it is important for students to learn facts, I believe that understanding ideas and concepts is more important for students. There are two reasons for this: the ability to concentrate and memory retention.\n\nTo begin with, learning facts is easy. I think that merely listening to a lecture can make people feel like they are learning. That is all people can do. However, understanding ideas and concepts is not easy. For example, when I try to grasp the idea of a theory, I must study very hard. Therefore, understanding is equivalent to studying very hard. It improves one's ability to concentrate.\n\nIn addition, the material that people spend a lot of time trying to understand is not easily forgotten. For instance, a theory that I only hear about in science class is soon forgotten. However, if I study the book about the theory very hard after class, I do not forget it for a long time.\n\nFor these reasons, I agree with the statement that understanding ideas and concepts is crucial for students."}
{"file_id": "1091757.txt", "output_essay": "There is an ongoing debate about whether it is best to travel in a group with a guide or not. Some people insist that it is better to take a trip alone because it allows you to explore the new environment freely. However, I strongly believe that following a tour guide with a group of people is the most efficient way to travel because people can enjoy the most beautiful and popular sites in a short time and also they can learn interpersonal skills by socializing with the team members.\n\nFirst and foremost, with a leader who knows about the sites, people can save time to enjoy the most renowned places. Some people say that this kind of traveling does not satisfy every member in the group. However, as the guide has experienced all kinds of travelers, he or she surely would be able to schedule the best course for most members. According to a survey released by the Korean National Research Center, more than two-thirds of the surveyed people who had traveled abroad responded that they would like to take a trip with a tour guide who knows about the places. In this survey, they answered that a tour guide who has already taken numerous trips would be able to lead them to the most magnificent and indispensable spots they can't miss. Also, they replied that as they have the best way to drop by all the remarkable places in their heads, it would save their time compared to traveling all by themselves with a piece of map. Therefore, traveling with a tour guide as a member of a group is the most time-saving and efficient way.\n\nMoreover, by socializing with others in a group, people would be able to have more benefits. Nowadays, social skills are considered to be important requirements to move up the ladder. And by traveling in a group, they can achieve the needed interpersonal skills. For example, an adult who decides to take part in group travel to India has to deal with troublesome behavior and incomprehensible words from others. In this process, he or she would be able to learn how to remain calm in the face of others' irresponsible behaviors and eventually be on good terms with them. Traveling in a group will finally turn out as a precious memory of not only having been to various kinds of spots but also making relationships with many different kinds of people. Furthermore, he or she would be able to succeed with the social skills they've got. In this sense, traveling in a group does good to each individual by teaching them how to harmonize with others.\n\nAll in all, traveling in a group is the most recommended way to take a trip because it is the most efficient method with a guide, and people can achieve social skills by it."}
{"file_id": "1076588.txt", "output_essay": "I certainly agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.\n\nWe all know that advertising has a high impact on people; it's the only way to promote a product. So, in order to convince them to buy, there should be a kind of exaggeration somewhere, but bear in mind that we shouldn't be unrealistic.\n\nWe have different types of exaggeration to make a product seem better, and it all depends on the type of media. For example, when talking about billboards, how many times have we seen an ad or an offer for a fast food restaurant? They show a big burger and say that we can now buy one and get another one for free. Amazed by this offer, we all go to the restaurant and order the offer, but surprisingly, we see that the burger is such a miniature that even if we eat 10 of them, we won't be satisfied! So, in this case, they played with the font of the ad.\n\nAnother example is a whitening cream. They tell us that in 4 weeks, we'll have a white princess skin. The first step for those who want to whiten their skin is to go and buy this product. They use it for 1 month, maybe, but notice no differences at all. So we all wonder here if the problem comes from us or the product itself!\n\nToo many examples can support my answer. Well, let's list another one. The best example ever is the 'best seller,' which is an advertising program seen on TV. Well, here comes a catastrophe because they show too many products and try them on TV, but when we order them for our homes, I bet we can't use them for more than 1 week because they're of bad quality.\n\nDetergents are one of the products that do not show their real effect. For example, when they show us a certain laundry detergent on TV, they bring a T-shirt and drop coffee, chocolate, ketchup, etc., on it, and as if by magic, all is gone, and the shirt becomes white as if we just bought it.\n\nAlso, advertising for clothes, home appliances, cars, technology, etc., has a strong impact on customers because some people, even if they don't like the product or don't use it, will buy it, maybe because their favorite celebrity is in it.\n\nI think that good companies do not need to promote their products aggressively. We can see very profitable companies with relatively high profits that don't put an ad on TV, but everyone goes and buys from them. That's because they are old and trusted. Also, now we can differentiate between a medicine that is good or bad. Every company that promotes a medicine is certainly facing a low return, and its medicine is not that good because, in general, we put ads in order to attract customers, and those who are not in need won't do it.\n\nAdvertising is an important thing but should have some limitations in order to be more realistic and thus can attract many people. It's better to be real than a dream one!"}

I would completely disagree with that idea for many reasons. I do think that in order for young, growing people to learn the facts of life and science in different specialties, they need to be able to form their own ideas; otherwise, they will just come up with mixed-up ideas and concepts. So, it is sort of a chronological process.\n\nFor example, I do not see how a student could come up with a certain invention or innovation in a particular machine or subject without first thoroughly understanding all the basic facts of how this machine works and the basic scientific factors controlling its function, or he may end up with a catastrophe.\n\nAnother reason is that the study of facts broadens the horizon of the student's vision. Then, he would be quite capable of discovering the concepts and basic ideas by himself, by studying how everything in life works correctly. It is only after passing that stage of basic learning that his ability to investigate and relate new concepts and theories becomes apparent.\n\nYoung students tend to be arrogant if they believe they know concepts and ideas, which would be useful only after ensuring they really learn the facts and can use them in the proper context.\n\nAnd last but not least, education is an active process, and unless students are forced from their youth to learn hard facts and given certain assignments, they would be reluctant to offer anything useful to the world or aid in the world's progress.\n\nIt is at a young age that students could be taught all the human sciences and knowledge, and if we start by dismissing the teaching of facts and basic sciences, we will end up with an ignorant generation.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe students should be taught facts and the basics of sciences rather than merely being given ideas and concepts, as it would not help them enough to proceed in their careers."}
{"file_id": "1101889.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with this opinion. Of course, there is also a chance to enjoy older age; however, it's up to the younger age which people had spent. So, I want to point out three reasons to explain why young people enjoy life more than older people do.\n\nFirst of all, young people have the power to gain what they want or to achieve some kind of goal. Physically, they are so young that they can work all day without sleeping, sometimes. Besides, they are not too tired after working. It is one of the important things to achieve a goal. Mentally, they don't feel responsibilities for society or family, so they can challenge something important or need to work hard without thinking deeply. If people start having a family or need to care for their parents, there are some negative factors to challenging something.\n\nSecond, there are opportunities to make them change, study, or grow up. There are chances to take education and study abroad, among other things. Older people, mostly it's parents, give younger people time to concentrate on themselves, in other words, to think about themselves. It is the most important thing to grow up and have identification with themselves.\n\nThirdly, younger people can have time to communicate with many people who have different backgrounds. Older people mostly have jobs, and it is limited to the opportunity to communicate with people in the office. On the other hand, younger people have the chances to have conversations and spend time together with many kinds of people. They have time to travel all around the world, and mentally, there is nothing for them to lose. There is only to gain."}

My only entertainment after finishing my homework was to watch television, swim, run, or play basketball with my dad. Very seldom would my father bring me to my cousin's home to play TV games.\n\nBut now, the only after-school activity for young people is to sit in front of the computer and chat with their friends or perhaps play online games.

{"file_id": "1099643.txt", "output_essay": "I think that advertisements are the best way to sell products. The selling and gaining money from a product is part of a very important and coherent chain. Advertisements play a very important role in this chain because without an advertisement, the product won't be known by many people. Then, you will not be able to sell your product to many people because it is not well-known, and also because you didn't sell enough to earn people's trust. Consequently, your product is not considered trustworthy, and because of this, you will not gain money. Without money, you won't be able to produce your goods, and eventually, your company will close.\n\nIf you look at big companies like Coca-Cola, you might understand what I am talking about. Coca-Cola today is a huge company and has factories in many countries because it introduced itself to the whole world through advertisements. Even in our country, Turkey, they have very big advertisements. Every month, they produce a new 'creative' advertisement to attract people to buy Coca-Cola. They know that advertisement is a very important and helpful way to introduce new products and also to remind people of their old products. That's why they invest a lot of money in advertisements to make people buy their products, even though Coke is a very unhealthy thing.\n\nTake fast food advertisements as another example. We all know that fast foods are very unhealthy for us. They contain many chemical substances that our bodies do not need. But when you watch a McDonald's TV advertisement or see a billboard for Burger King, you immediately think about eating a hamburger, drinking a Coke, and consuming extremely unhealthy French fries.\n\nSo, advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. Even though they are extremely unhealthy and not needed by humans, you immediately want them. But this tactic of making products seem better through advertisements is not just for food and drinks; it can be for a car ad, a game console ad, a clothing company ad, or virtually anything you can think of."}

Older people usually have less energy to do many things that young people can do. When you are old, your health may not be the same, and you have to spend time going to the doctors, therapy, visiting the pharmacy for medicines, and staying at home with more responsibilities, such as work and taking care of grandchildren. You think more about whether you want to go to a place. Young people and older people have different ways of thinking about life, responsibilities, and having fun. Older people are more conservative. Most young people just think about having fun with their friends, and most older people just think about work or rest."}

One simple example is when I used to love 'labeling the heart diagram' in biology class but just despise explaining Newton's First Law of Motion in physics class.\nOn the contrary, when there is a written response question on a test, it would be much easier for students to respond when they actually understand what they are talking about rather than just knowing the fact.\n\nAnother broader example is when we had to make a student committee with the job of spreading the word in school about aiding with recycling and cleaning up. Many of us did it, but I highly doubt that everyone understood why they were doing it.\n\nSo, in the end, I believe for a student to get through his life experience as being a student with a degree of some sort, he has to understand ideas and concepts and act upon them."}

I agree with this preference for several reasons. The first reason is that you can become an expert in the field. The second reason is that you can achieve professional development and secure a good job, and the third reason is to solve specific problems.\n\nThe first reason, which refers to becoming an expert in the field, explains the idea of being someone who has the knowledge to gather information and can explain and show results. For instance, people who study for a Bachelor's degree in Economics, a Master's degree in Macroeconomics, and a Ph.D. in Microeconomics could develop a profile of the kind of person who develops theories about consumer behavior and demand in relation to the National Economy.\n\nThe second reason refers to the possibility of professional development and access to better jobs. For example, if you have a Ph.D. in Computer Science, you could be a candidate for large companies like Microsoft to hire you.\n\nThe third reason refers to the ability to solve specific problems. For instance, if you are studying something related to medicine, you might find solutions to significant issues like HIV, cancer, or diabetes.\n\nIn conclusion, I agree that specializing in a certain area is better than just having general knowledge. To be a specialist is to be an expert in the field, and being an expert can lead to future professional development and opportunities to access better jobs."}

In order to manage a good way of living, we have to make choices at any time during our own life.\n\nSecondly, we can consider the problem from a different point of view. If you are living in a huge town, it will be more difficult to help the community than living in the country.\n\nThanks to their small villages in the country, everybody knows everybody. The fact of the densification of the population makes it easier and faster to make connections and create central meetings. Obviously, the community will grow with the help of younger individuals.\n\nI don't really agree with the fact that young people do not give enough time to the community. For example, sometimes in your job, the director assigns you high responsibilities, and even if you didn't choose, you have to control and help your company.

Although some might say that such people tend to fail because of the high risk, I think that most of them achieve success in terms of their personal achievement.\n\nI prefer the idea that people should try to do their best within their ability and resources. And, even if they fail, I think they have had their own success. This success means that breaking their own limitations could be happiness for people. For example, there was a man who quit a big company and started a small coffee shop. Even though he was enthusiastic about making the shop profitable, he eventually went bankrupt. However, I saw in some magazine which covered his failure story, the man said he felt so happy because he could know his limitations. I think that knowing one's limit could be a success since it could be helpful for people to have a good life in their future.\n\nAnd, it could be too easy to do what others can do easily. In this circumstance, even though people can make some profit, I cannot say it is success. For instance, after Henry Ford introduced a commercialized car for ordinary people, many carmakers tried to follow and jump into the car industry. Nevertheless, they were just followers. They did just what Ford did. While some carmakers are still making great profits, in my opinion, they are not truly successful. They imitate what the great man did.\n\nOf course, the followers can have great success. They can reduce costs and attract a lot of consumers. They might be some kind of successful people.

I disagree with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.\n\nFacts are the things that we see that are veritable and used as the basis of ideas and concepts. You can hardly tell whether the concepts and the ideals are true or false, because everyone has his or her own observations. We now know that neither the Earth nor the Sun is the center of the universe, but most people believed in the concept that the Earth is the center of the universe.\n\nAlso, concepts and ideals always determine our own thoughts and lead us to the wrong or even opposite way, and take us far away from the truth. It is widely known that the research on brain cells had not made any progress for years since the scientists used their out-of-date concepts and ideals to analyze the brain cells. This concept that every kind of brain cell uses electricity to transfer their signals made them totally ignore the importance of the other cells.\n\nLast but not least, facts not only provide us the materials to observe but also function as the inspiration for scientists. By learning the facts, we can think in our own way and then learn to select the best way of thinking. As we know, men must suffer to be wise. If you suffer from your own thinking and figure out what the facts reflect, you will finally be able to handle the problems that you will face.

It surrounds us everywhere today: on television, of course, in the street, in the subway, on our cars... we cannot avoid it. Some may say that 'Most advertisers make products seem much better than they really are.' Do they? Is advertising that simple? Do they not take into account the risk it creates when the customer will be disappointed?\n\nFirst of all, the question seems simple; of course, they do. They surely will not make their products seem worse. They are paid to sell something to people who did not even want to buy it in the first place, who sometimes did not even need it. They must create a need in customers' minds and a will to buy precisely that product. How could they do that without making their products look good, even better than they are, to kind of sell a dream to people? It is not what they do it for, but in the end, they kind of give hope to people, like when one sees an advertisement that would make one believe that the product it defends is exactly what one has hoped to find during all these years, or that it is so much better than all its competition. That is why in all soap spots, the laundry is whiter and smoother than ever, or in all shampoo spots, the actress's hair shines more than ever.\n\nHowever, is it always like that? Do advertisers not fear people stopping buying a product because they were deceived by the difference with the ad? Actually, even if it is not to be more honest with people, some advertisers use other techniques to sell their products. They can choose to criticize their competition in order to make their product look better by comparison. What is important in the end is that the buyer chooses your product over the others. It was used by Coca-Cola in a spot in which a little girl shows her disappointment with the voice of a Godfather when she is given a Pepsi instead of the Coca-Cola she ordered. Advertising could also use reverse psychology, maybe to play with people's curiosity, like the campaign using 'do not go and see that movie, it is bad,' for instance.\n\nTo conclude, I would say that whereas other techniques exist, most advertisers make products seem better than they really are. Nowadays, even though people know all they see in advertising is not true, they fall for it anyway, and that is how the consumption society has gotten this far."}

With each passing day, our roads are becoming crammed with an increased number of cars, and our air is being infused with a higher density of vehicular pollution. Obviously, there is a limit to how much our infrastructure can support. What happens when there are so many cars on the road that there is no more place to move?\n\nThat is a rather scary vision. However, it may well be that the number of cars on the roads twenty years from now will actually be less than what it is today.\n\nIsn't that a rather exaggerated claim? After all, even if the world population stabilizes as the estimates have indicated, it will still be much larger than what it is today. And with increased economic prosperity, more and more people can be expected to own more and more cars.\n\nTrue. However, if the current trends are any clue, the number of cars should nevertheless reduce.\n\nFirst of all, many countries, especially developing nations with large populations, are rapidly developing their public transport systems to tackle the problem of urban transportation. Public transport systems are not only more cost-effective; they also ensure a better quality of living by eliminating traffic jams and exposure to vehicular pollution. Therefore, it will not really be surprising if more and more people take to public transport as the primary means of moving about.\n\nSecond, fuel prices are expected to rise heavily in the next twenty years as world oil reserves get depleted. In such a scenario, it will be much more economical for people to use public transportation systems.\n\nSuch trends are already showing in countries like India. The Delhi Metro is a success story that well illustrates the point. With high-quality service available at low prices, even the rich and affluent of Delhi prefer to keep their cars at home and use the Metro when they need to travel to the crowded areas of the city. Rapid Bus Transit Systems introduced in cities like Indore and Bhopal are becoming increasingly popular amongst citizens.\n\nThus, the day may not be far when you might be the only person driving on the road!

Having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects allows one to have a panoramic view of various situations at hand. With this knowledge, you are prepared for any situation. You will have an answer for every moment of your professional life. I think that a broad academic background enables a person to be capable of entering various professions. In contrast, specializing in one specific academic subject may limit the ability to pursue different professional roles. In conclusion, I prefer this broad selection for myself, although it may not be the same for everyone."}

Newer sources of energy are being pursued, and more efficient ways of using resources are being researched continually. The demand for transportation will always remain, and people will always like to travel in their own personal space.\n\nThe most common fuel used for running cars is petroleum, and this fuel will be in great scarcity, with its demand increasing as the years progress. People have already started switching to other sources, such as hybrid cars, which provide a combination of electricity and fuel on which the car can run. Researchers and scientists are continually trying to harness the potential of hydrogen (H), which, if successful, can be easily used to reduce any dependence on other fuels because of its abundance on Earth.\n\nGovernments of various countries are making efforts to make the use of public transport, such as public buses and trains, more common. For example, in the United Arab Emirates, a huge project is presently under construction for the metro train. Various governments are trying to relieve the dependence of commuters on cars. However, this does not mean that every single person is going to make use of the train or bus at all times.\n\nMany people need to travel short or medium distances frequently throughout the day, pertaining to their job requirements. There are also people who do not like to travel in public or need to travel in controlled atmospheres because of medical conditions. This category of people will always require that some sort of personal transportation be available, which is also comfortable. This requirement can only be fulfilled by a vehicle such as a car.\n\nTherefore, cars will always be there as a means of transportation and will definitely not decrease in number compared to what is present today. Various new sources are being developed, and some may also be discovered by scientists and researchers.

{"file_id": "1088862.txt", "output_essay": "In today's global environment, some people prefer to do routine tasks to be successful, while others prefer to create new things to be successful. Personally, I believe that successful people try new things and take some risks instead of doing routine tasks.\n\nFirstly, people who try new things and take risks are generally successful in making profits in a business environment. Nowadays, most corporations prefer innovative employees. Innovation means creating new ideas, such as new products and services. The new products that are created by corporations, especially by employees, are successful. As a result, these companies can achieve higher profits. Generating new ideas and things can provide success for an employee. For example, I had an internship experience in my country two years ago in the summer. I observed that managers in high-level positions always talk about innovation. They also suggested that I should be open to new ideas.\n\nThe second important point is the demand in the world. In today's society, people have higher demands regarding products and services. When a buyer purchases a new product, they can become bored with it in two or three months. To provide new products, the market needs people who can take risks to create new things and be successful. For example, Bill Gates, the owner of Microsoft, is the best example of this situation. When Bill Gates first developed Windows, he went to IBM to sell his product. However, IBM rejected his offer, and he set up his own company. As a result, he has become the owner of one of the most valuable companies, and his products are used in most parts of the world. He is successful because he took some risks and created new things that are beneficial to society.\n\nAnother important point is life satisfaction. People are born with the desire to survive and create new things. Everyone has skills to create new things. Thus, they use their skills.\n\nTo sum up, successful people always generate new ideas and take risks for their endeavors. In most cases, they are successful and happy. Routine tasks are boring, and people who do routine tasks often lack sufficient life satisfaction."}
{"file_id": "1100270.txt", "output_essay": "As a young person myself, I often feel guilty for spending so little time with the community. I have often noticed that the social bonds between neighbors have diminished in recent years, and people are becoming less caring than before. That's why I think we should definitely spend more time helping our communities.\n\nBut how? The main reason nowadays that young people don't spend much time with their communities is that they are crammed with homework, extracurricular activities, entertainment, etc. They are simply not spending a lot of time strolling about the neighborhood. Without any interactions with their neighbors, young people will easily neglect their role as a member of their community. Although they read about community service in their textbooks, few actually participate in it. And when you ask them why, they simply reply: 'I don't have time.'\n\nSo if we wish to solve this problem, the first thing to do is to decrease the amount of burden on young people. Schools should end earlier so that young people can spend more time in the community. Teachers should give their students less work on weekends so they could have adequate time to conduct effective community service. Parents should relieve their child of too much activity and they should not force them to go to cram schools. Without these corrections to our education system, schools would end up actually teaching young people not to spend time with the community.\n\nOf course, one might contend that young people will end up spending the extra time playing on computers and not doing community service at all. That might be the case for some kids, but in my opinion, if people felt they are involved in their community, they would try their best to make it better. This sentiment can be further enhanced by government propaganda and social education.\n\nIt is everyone's responsibility to bring young people back to community service. They should not simply put the blame on laziness manifested by the younger generation. I pray for a day when the old bonds between neighbors can be re-established."}
{"file_id": "1099400.txt", "output_essay": "I disagree with the statement that ideas and concepts are more important than facts for students. Actually, from my point of view, facts are equally important as ideas and concepts.\n\nFirst, without facts, where do the ideas and concepts come from? Ideas and concepts cannot be separated from facts. For example, when we learn the concept of force in physics, students need to conduct experiments to understand the fact that different kinds of forces exist everywhere in the world. If a teacher merely draws a symbol and points to it, saying, 'Look, this is what we call force,' they will confuse the students. By doing this, the teacher risks being fired.\n\nSecond, students should not only grasp the ideas and concepts but also know the detailed facts in order to pass exams. For instance, in a biology exam, students should remember specific examples of animals to accurately describe the process of reproduction. I cannot imagine a person being able to write down all the material the teacher requires without any facts. Although there may be some exams that allow students to bring books, remembering the exact facts benefits students greatly, as it saves time spent referring to the books.\n\nThird, students should learn facts to secure a good job in some fields. For example, I major in computer science, which involves a lot of programming. Mathematical concepts and ideas do help me understand the theories of computing. However, it was when I started job hunting that I realized facts, such as the specifications of computers, greatly aided me in finding a job as a programmer.\n\nIn conclusion, while ideas and concepts are important in learning, facts carry the same weight for students."}

Most car advertisements are really nice and appealing. However, I do not like half of these cars, such as Korean and French cars. They do not last long. When driving them, you do not have a lot of control in case anything dangerous happens. And most importantly, they are too expensive to buy. On the other hand, there are German and American cars. I love driving these types of cars. They come with a lot of nice options and involve a lot of technology. On the highways, you can go as fast as you want, and you have almost total control (I wrote 'almost' because nothing is totally one hundred percent). One thing I want to mention is that most German cars are also too expensive. So the advertisements for these cars are worth it and truthful.\n\nLet us consider some other products that advertisements make look better on TV than in real life, such as food. I like most kinds of food, from cold to hot. Whether it is spicy or not, I do not care. I will eat it. I like Italian food. I am in love with Chinese food. I do not mind Mexican food. I mentioned that because if I see a commercial on TV about any type of food or a big picture of a hamburger on the wall that says 'come and taste it,' I have to try it.

They enjoy reading books or newspapers, gardening, or engaging in that kind of relaxing and enjoyable work. Sometimes grandparents and grandchildren go on vacation together in the summertime.

It doesn't mean they aren't enjoying themselves. It's not just about what they like or dislike. On the other hand, their bodies need to relax. So they choose these ways, and when they relax, they can be happy. When young people see older people relaxing or doing nothing, they think older people are not enjoying life like them. But this is not true.\n\nThere are different examples. These days, teenagers spend most of their time on computers, the internet, or TV. They sit all day in the same room, just looking at some unreal vision on the screen.

The competition in the job market, for instance, has become very hard, and education is now considered to be of utmost importance for future prospects. This can lead to the fact that many youths do not have the time to help their communities due to the time they spend studying for school or college.\n\nAdditionally, modern young people have many options to spend their leisure time. There are so many opportunities for youths to spend their free time that they might forget to think about others. Media like television, computers, or the internet are just a few opportunities to spend free time. Due to this reason, youths might be overwhelmed with the diversity of possibilities that surround them. Another factor that can keep young people from being concerned about their community is that many of them are just too lazy to offer their help. The generation of so-called 'couch potatoes' illustrates this issue. Many young people are just hanging around either at home or anywhere else. The reason for this might be, on the one hand, that they lack the guidance of their parents, who often spend the whole day working. On the other hand, the invention and improvement of computer games and other sources can be a reason why young people spend less time outside the four walls of their room.\n\nIn addition to this point, it seems also reasonable to me that the life standard, which has considerably improved in contemporary society, has made students dull and even indifferent. Many young people just do not care if others need their help since they are satisfied with what they have and do not see any reason to think of others, especially their community.\n\nWith reference to these reasons, I would agree with the statement that young people do not spend enough time helping their community in contemporary society. The youth, in general, has many interests that have nothing to do with their community, which can be the peer group, the media, the school, and a huge amount of other issues.

It is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one particular subject.\n\nA prospective student may want to pursue his career by learning only the subjects he requires. An architect, for example, would want to study Physics and Mathematics, as subjects like these help him in his field. Though English literature and environmental sciences are not required in his field, they impart principles that could assist him throughout life's race. A look into the environment may help him select different types of materials for construction, so as to keep the environment safe. After his education, he would emerge more knowledgeable.\n\nDuring one's schooling, one is exposed to a variety of subjects like History and Geography. Have you ever come across a time when you wonder, \"Why? What use is this going to be to me in the future? Will the knowledge of what happened to my country a thousand years ago help me in the future? Twenty years later, will anyone ask me how high Mt. Everest is?\" Though this information may seem useless at that age, after progressing through life's obstacles, one realizes that the knowledge gained by studying such subjects is very precious and valuable. We now remember that Mt. Everest is 8,848 meters high and is growing taller every year. It gives us a sense of superiority and pleasure that we, after so many years, remember such tiny details.\n\nSpecializing in one specific subject may give the student more time to understand the subject and achieve perfection. Specializing may give one an edge over others. But when we emerge into society, ready to make a difference in our lives, the lives of others, or the world as a whole, we realize that a broader knowledge of subjects is better than specializing in one subject.

This statement is very true, as a person who tries to do things differently and takes a different approach towards certain things in life proves to be successful, but success cannot be guaranteed. If a person goes about doing things as he usually does and is perfect at, he will not suffer any loss but will be stable, with no growth and no loss. These are the people who like to play it safe in life and lead a life without stress and tension, whereas taking risks in life is a stressful thing, but you can increase your growth only by trying new things and innovating ideas and ways of doing things. A careful analysis is very important about the type of risk being taken and what is the appropriate method for going about the decision. Most business houses have been successful because of their ability to take risks and try innovative strategies and plans. Such people like to enjoy life to the fullest and are determined about what they want in life and work their way up to it.\n\nI believe that people should take risks in life, but they also should be careful and know the pros and cons of taking the risk. They should take risks that they can bear. Without taking risks, a person cannot achieve what he wants; he will have to be satisfied with what he has. Only people who have the thirst in them to achieve what they want take risks; some succeed and some fail. Therefore, it has to be well strategized and well planned in order to reach the objective and move ahead in life. Risk has extreme consequences; you either succeed or you fail, so people should take risks knowing what they are getting into.

If people continue to follow the same old traditional ways and ideas of the past, we will not move further in our lives. Where would our communication system be if Alexander Graham Bell had not tried new things? Where would our transportation system be if the Wright Brothers had not taken risks? It is all about thinking differently and creatively to become successful.\n\nAccording to experiments conducted, our mind is very creative. It can think about a wide variety of things in a wide variety of ways. We must not suppress our thoughts to the traditional ideas our ancestors followed and stick back to the rules and regulations. It may be necessary to follow some rules in some cases, but not in all cases. This trying out of new things must be cultivated from childhood itself. Take, for example, a math problem to be solved. A child should think of finding a new way of finding a solution rather than following the solution given by the teacher. This makes the child better understand the problem and will never forget about it. This makes the child successful, and the success is carried throughout their career.\n\nIn the initial stages, we may be criticized for our ideas, but one should not give up because of such critics. We must remember that great people are often criticized. \"Even Einstein was questioned.\" To be successful, we need to go on with our ideas and creativity, we need to try new things every time, we need to take risks, forget the old traditional ways of doing things, and not care about the criticism. We should challenge the critics.\n\nSuccess involves a large amount of risk when we are trying out new things. Nothing can be easily obtained. We should never be afraid of the amount of risk involved but should always head towards the success that comes after the risk. The success involving a risk gives us greater pleasure than success without involving risk. \"The fruit gained from a great risk is more tasty.\"\n\nIt's proved in the past and also it will be proved thereafter that trying new things, thinking differently and creatively, and taking risks brings great success.

Some people say that young people provide enough time to help their communities in that they are doing some voluntary work for communities. However, I agree with the statement that young people tend to spend more time studying and they don't have a sense of belonging to their communities.\n\nTo begin with, nowadays students do not help their communities enough. This is because they think that their grades are more important than helping communities. Therefore, they are spending more time studying for good grades than doing volunteer work. For example, my brother is a high school student. When he was asked to work for his community by his school, he got angry. That's because he thinks helping his community is a waste of time and also doesn't help improve his grade.\n\nIn addition, because young people don't have a sense of belonging to their local communities, they are not willing to help their community much. Young people think they can move to other places whenever they want to move. Therefore, they do not feel the necessity to provide aid to their local communities, sacrificing their own time. For instance, according to KBS, the Korea national broadcast station, 70% of young people do not feel they have to help their local society. When they were asked for reasons, they answered that they did not have a sense of belonging to their communities.\n\nIn conclusion, the time young people spend helping local communities does not meet the needs of communities.

First, students will not have the chance to confirm that what they know is true, which might lead to a decrease in their interest in the subject. Additionally, they will not have the ability to adjust their knowledge to perform in the actual world, which is the main reason why students learn. Therefore, it is not more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.\n\nUnderstanding ideas and concepts means receiving information from others who have already experienced them. By not being able to see how the ideas and concepts work in practice, students might not develop as much interest in the subject as they should. If students are not actively experiencing the facts on their own, they can easily doubt whether those ideas and concepts are true in the real world. The inability to see how they actually work can lead to a decrease in their interest, which negatively affects their learning habits.\n\nStudents without the skills to perform correct actions in the real world often lack the experience that comes from learning facts through their own experiences. As they grow up and prepare to play an important role in society, it is essential to have a wealth of knowledge as well as sufficient experience to know how to adjust that knowledge for each specific situation. Students with only ideas and concepts introduced by other people will lack the ability to gather specific information on their own and place them into the correct context.\n\nIt is more important for students to learn facts because it increases their willingness to learn as well as their ability to perform better in various situations in the real world."}

If someone has the formula for success, whether found or given by the environment, he or she should not change it unless wanting or pushed to do so.\n\nCarlo Ancelotti, coach of AC Milan, an Italian soccer team that has won several tournaments and awards under his guidance, declared on the day before the final of the Champions League, 'A team that wins never changes (setup).' The next day, using the same players as the previous game, AC Milan won the Champions League, the most prestigious tournament in soccer. Just like Carlo Ancelotti suggested, something successful should often remain uncorrupted to succeed again.\n\nNot everyone, though, already has this opportunity in his or her life. This is the case when a person should try new things and take risks. For instance, considering a large and profitable factory, the son of the boss will not have trouble reaching working success (considering this is the kind of success he is looking for) as his heritage includes a business already started and well-run, but one of the workers in the factory has great manual skills, yet in the factory, he does not gain much profit and does not fully use the resources he has. If he never took a risk and never tried anything new, he would always work in the same factory and hardly reach success. Instead, if he decided to start his own activity, taking the risks that such a choice brings, he would have a much larger chance to succeed.\n\nNevertheless, looking at society on a larger scale, risks might be necessary to succeed and develop. In fact, there is one important factor to consider: competition. The pushing force for many people is often other candidates, who try to reach success by doing something innovative. Unfortunately, there are times where the success of one is the failure of others. This cycle, in fact, is infinite. The positive aspect of this situation is that society will always offer newer and more innovative things.\n\nTherefore, success is not always found by doing something new and taking risks, but there are times where the situation requires it."}

For example, different cultures use kinship nomenclatures, e.g., Uncle, Father, Mother, etc., to express not just natural relationships, but also social relationships, status, power equations, economic situations, etc.\n\nOn the other hand, 'Facts' represent the 'hard examples' or 'expressions' which can be immediately placed in their context and are self-explanatory. For example, Uncle is a term used for a father's or mother's brother. But in many cultures, uncle is also a term used for any significantly older male, even if no biological relationship exists.\n\nWhat it essentially means is that it is very difficult to understand 'ideas and concepts' as separated from 'facts', and vice versa. The two are interlinked in many ways.\n\nIt's only through 'observation' of similarities between facts that ideas and concepts emerge. That is, if it is observed that in a culture all providers of food and security are termed as 'Father/Mother', it means there is more to the nomenclature than the biological relationship. It's no coincidence that Hitler was termed 'Führer', i.e., father.\n\nOn the other hand, once an idea or concept has been 'observed' and 'established' through the study of 'facts', it provides a medium for the understanding of all future factual observations. That is, whether they support or oppose the idea or concepts.\n\nHence, observation of 'facts' is both the 'initiator' and 'distiller' of concepts.\n\nIn this light, it would be foolhardy to see ideas and concepts as opposed to facts. Both of them are equally important for real learning. Students need to understand a 'concept' through the assimilation of facts. Concurrently, a concept or idea provides the medium for the assimilation of a large number of facts. Both are inseparable for complete learning."}
{"file_id": "1107813.txt", "output_essay": "Advertisements penetrate into every aspect of our lives, conveying messages that a particular product is superior to another or trying to forge a need to buy a particular item. In order to realize this goal, they represent the product as far superior to what it really is. Hence, today the image of the product exceeds its practical use in terms of importance and practical application.\n\nWhat advertisements offer is therefore a status symbol and a definition for a person's identity. The item describes its owner in the particular way that the advertisements imbue it with. For example, a Diet Coke is never just a simple drink that would quench your thirst or accompany some food. Rather, it is an item that turns its consumer into someone attractive, lean, and one who knows how to live well. Even the label that your pencil bears transmits a message about who you are, just because of the advertisements' way of representing it. You can be a hardworking and determined individual or even someone rebellious.\n\nIn this sense, I agree that advertisements render products much better than they really are. They shift their practical meaning into a sign for your personal identity and status. Thus, they sell not just the item itself but also the message it entails. In this context, you do not pay a considerable price for a basic item but for something that represents."}
{"file_id": "1105527.txt", "output_essay": "The debate over whether broadening knowledge of many academic subjects rather than specializing and focusing on one specific subject has been a matter of debate recently in many countries. In my point of view, I believe that broadening knowledge in various areas will give students the ability and the basic background to understand real life, to be able to discuss different subjects, argue on many issues, and to improve themselves. Also, being aware of many academic subjects will give students the ability to explore different fields and choose the best major they want to delve into.\n\nI believe that spreading more than one subject in the academic year, especially in the first and second years, will allow the student to be aware of what is going on in their world. A student who is going to study education, social studies, politics, arts, and maybe math will be able to understand his country's and society's problems and will have more ideas than a student who has never heard about politics or arts and only studies for his math major.\n\nMoreover, students in their first year will never be able to make the right decision for their career life and choosing the major they want to enroll in as they don't have enough knowledge and experience to choose among all these alternatives. For example, in my first year and directly after high school, I had to choose my career and my whole future based on my zero experience and approximately zero knowledge. Of course, if in my country I had been able to gain and acquire the basics of more than one area of knowledge, I would have chosen something else, or if I didn't choose something else; at least I would know that my choice was the right one for me.\n\nTo conclude, I strongly recommend and agree with having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects before focusing on a specific field of knowledge, which I believe will be the best for my future career and which will be helpful for my society."}

Specialists were able to ensure their survival by fitting into a single vacant ecological niche in which they flourished. Unspecialized organisms have to rely on their flexibility; and that is exactly their advantage. Because they are not specialized and are dependent on their flexibility, they are more capable of adapting to new situations. Organisms that don't adapt die, and eventually, their entire species will become extinct. One can easily project that image onto human fields of knowledge. Being able to build life decisions on a great base of knowledge is more profitable than being specialized in only one field, be it an academic subject or a set of ideas and values.\n\nBeing able to adapt is of the greatest necessity. It is part of everyone's everyday life; you adapt to the people you talk to, you adapt to the people you work with, and you even adapt to your own family. If you have specialized in one field, it would probably be the one of greatest interest to you. This does not mean, though, that all the people around you share your enthusiasm about the same subject, which means that one has to be able to talk about other major topics in life. Granted, being a professional specialized in something vital does serve one well in the modern world in terms of economic security, but what good does it do when you possess omnipotent knowledge of one field but are incapable of seeing the connections to another? When the company, in which someone was the specialist for that and only that specific company's computer network, goes bankrupt, he is jobless.\n\nI believe that broadening one's own horizon, be it intellectually or emotionally, more likely grants a secure and fulfilled future."}

If we want to save the world, we must reduce pollution, and one way is the reduction of cars in use. We must implement ecological alternatives.\n\nEarth is collapsing due to too much pollution. One of the most important factors of high pollution is the presence of many cars. Cars have become a mass way of transport, and in many cities, they are used in the wrong way; for example, one car is used only by one person instead of three or four. We must change that. It is not difficult.\n\nWe must improve our behavior toward ecological problems. One way, for example, is using public transport. By using public transports, there will be fewer cars in use. Fewer cars in use mean less pollution. I'm sure that is one of the reasons that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years.\n\nI see a world in the future with fewer cars, less pollution, more attention to the environment.

There are some reasons why I think young people enjoy life more than older people do.\n\nFirst, young people have a lot of energy to move their bodies. Some of them enjoy sports, traveling, and working. They can do many activities. Even though they are tired, they sometimes continue moving without enough rest. If they sleep well, they will be fine the next day.\n\nFurthermore, many of them do not have serious health problems. Many older people have some health problems, even though they lead healthy lives. Because they are older, it is a natural thing. Many young people do not have the health problems that older people have.\n\nIn addition, the lifestyles between young people and older people are different. When I visited a retirement home, an activity director said, if I could come there as much as I could, it would be helpful for them to escape from boring times. They usually stay in the home because it is hard for them to go out by themselves. Therefore, if they do not have any outside activities, they spend their time on a sofa watching TV. However, young people can go anywhere and anytime by themselves. They can choose how they act in their daily life, but for older people, they cannot have that kind of choice.\n\nThese reasons show that young people tend to enjoy their life more than older people do. Young people have some benefits that allow them to enjoy their life more than older people, so they should enjoy their life. If young people provide an enjoyable life for older people, then the older people will have a more enjoyable life than they used to have."}

According to my own experience, I think that people were happier when they were children. They just live how their minds guide them through without thinking about consequences.\n\nFirstly, I think that young people are happier than adults because they do not care about anything material. They live their lives without thinking about the consequences. Indeed, everything they want to do is possible, so they just have to realize what their hearts tell them to do. People are used to saying that mankind is led by money and interest, contrary to children who are only guided through life by happiness and pleasure. For example, a young boy does not care about what his mum is doing. But his mum must take care of her baby, and she has to keep him safe and protect him from dangers.\n\nWe can also say that young people are in good health, which enables them to live their lives without money problems, job problems, and more... They spend most of their time playing with their friends without being disturbed.\n\nAccording to my own experience, I can say that being a child is the best period of your life. You do not have to care about anything other than just playing outside. You are not stressed by your destiny and by the world around you.

Additionally, it is commonly known that education at school is one of the most important parts of life's continuous education. I completely agree with the statement that 'it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts,' for two reasons.\n\nMy first reason stems from the fact that it is impossible to impart all ideas and information at school. That is, due to limited time, you cannot teach everything to students at school. That's why students must be taught to understand ideas and concepts. For example, last year I took a mathematics class where we discussed theories of a certain subject. There were plenty of theories to study, but the class met only once per week for a semester. The professor helped us to fully understand the subject; afterwards, we could handle other theories by ourselves.\n\nMy second reason is that we are educated at school to apply some ideas to our life after school. If we understand ideas and concepts at school, we have a chance to apply them to the rest of our lives. Hence, all information and ideas can be considered valuable and worth the time spent at school. To give a specific example, I am a professional woman now, and last week I encountered a really complex problem at work. Studying at university with my mathematics project was surprisingly helpful. Because at that time, I truly understood the idea in the project. I also felt that I did not regret the time that I spent at university.\n\nTo sum up, it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts, as this understanding aids them in their future. Ultimately, this must be the main point of education at school."}

The reason I used 'tend' above is that it represents a possibility, not an absolute solution for successful people. Otherwise, the answer should depend on how we define 'successful people' and how successful people achieve success. If success means money, and someone is called successful comparatively but is not a real money magnate like Bill Gates, there is no absolute answer for success. However, even in that case, the possibility for success is consistently changing according to the definition of success or how successful they are.\n\nApparently, the possibility for success is given to people who are willing to try something new because in fields that are well-known benefit-makers, many people have already reaped those benefits, leaving not much for others to gain, which could be described as a monopoly. It's like fossil fuel depletion. A small part of the world is still making a significant profit from fossil fuels; there is no chance to enter that industry because those fields are already saturated with prior ownership.\n\nIn a given situation, like their DNA, such as their appearance or intelligence, or how much money they inherit from their parents, the possible way to improve their chances for success is to venture into the unexplored world. Even though they are engaging in risky business because it's new, the people who only do what they already know how to do well cannot easily catch up with those who try to do something new and achieve extraordinary success rather than just success or greatness.\n\nI am aiming for extraordinary success, as I wrote above. What I require to achieve this goal is to improve my creativity, to be creative enough to discover something new and explore it.

I interrupted her, asking what her entertainment in life was, and she answered me that her enjoyment of life is all about watching me and my mother's day go by safely, and our fulfillment of laughter is instantly her pleasant laughter. And the next thing she said to me is that she is enjoying so much of her life that she would not regret living, even if she dies the next day.\n\nIn conclusion, I do not know how their own enjoyment of life works, but all the tearful sayings that my grandmother had made for me touched my heart, and therefore, I believe that older people enjoy their life more than us younger kids who only know how to play computer games."}

Of course, in our modern society, the high number of people who want to succeed makes success more difficult to achieve. As a result, you have to take some risks. Nevertheless, you have to be careful because, in society, you have to take risks, but if you miss your objective, even by a small margin, society won't forget it. And you won't be considered a successful person (for a long time, at least).\n\nOn the contrary, if you don't take risks, you won't be successful. Society is always moving forward, and if you want to follow and succeed, you cannot remain static and wait without changing. So, if you are changing something, you are taking a risk, even if it's a very small one. If you don't adapt your business, your life, or your job could deteriorate.\n\nIn my opinion, a successful person has taken some risks; it's compulsory. There are too many people and businesses on Earth, so if you want to succeed, you have to take risks. But the line between success and failure, or even something worse, is very thin. So you have to take risks, but you have to be very careful. It means the more risks you take, the more chances you have to succeed, but the higher the fall will be if you don't.\n\nIn conclusion, I think in our society, the only way to succeed is to take some risks but to be very careful. Because I believe that a very good way to lose everything is to take too many risks. It means if you want to be successful, you have to stay within the boundary between not enough risks and too many.

Cars might be technologically advanced in twenty years, but I hardly think there will be fewer cars in use. In Saudi Arabia, people tend to use more and more cars, as every single family has, on average, 2 cars.\n\nActually, cars need maintenance, energy, fuel.

{"file_id": "1106076.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with the statement that \"The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide\" because generally, people want to visit different places to relax and learn more about them. Without a tour guide, they may take much time to understand the place. At the same time, if a person travels alone, he may not find it interesting to observe the places and cannot express his ideas or thoughts about what he sees. However, if he travels with a group and a tour guide, it makes the tour successful and enjoyable because the guide can explain the places briefly and engagingly, providing a knowledgeable experience.\n\nIf the person travels with a group, he can have the advantage of expressing his views and gaining others' perspectives on the place they see. Tours often include long journeys, day and night. During this time, the tour guide knows where to stop the vehicle for emergencies. If anything happens to anyone, others can help solve the problem they face. By traveling in a group with a tour guide, they can support each other and make their tour more successful.\n\nDuring the journey, they may face many problems like food, shelter, and changing clothes. If people travel as a group, they can help provide shelter, food, and solve other small and big problems. If the vehicle breaks down and it takes a few hours to repair, they can have a nice time with their mates, passing the time happily and creating unforgettable memories.\n\nIt all depends on the individual, but traveling with a group allows one to see things happily and have a great opportunity to gain good knowledge about the place they visit. Take, for example, an industrial tour for engineering students, like visiting Tata Motors in India. There, I definitely prefer to go with a group because they have to recall their subject when they see the industry. At the same time, your professor acts as a tour guide. No one can recall the information at that moment that they studied, but if you go with a group, they can share their knowledge with others, making the visit more interesting and informative.\n\nSimilarly, if office staff want to improve their industry, they need to visit more advanced industries and make notes on what to improve in their own. This is possible only when they go with teammates and a guide. They can point out very good things if they discuss them with their mates. At the same time, they do not need to spend much time learning the unknown, as a guide is provided for them.\n\nThus, I can strongly agree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide."}

I met a few people, old and young, and I often had time to talk with them for a while. Everyone had their own life story, and many of them really liked to tell me about their attitudes toward life and their experiences.

{"file_id": "1105022.txt", "output_essay": "I strongly believe that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. Whether the advertisement one sees is through television or a magazine, this particular individual is bound to receive some sort of effect upon immediate exposure. This exposure can be explained in two interesting ways. One is explained via visual effect and the other is through the means of incorporating one's psychological effect.\n\nAs we all know, in order to advertise a certain product, excessive visual luring is to be expected from the viewers. The makers of these advertisements will try in every conceivable way to present their products at their finest. This is where the visual effect comes in. There will be many trials and errors, and thorough, various steps will also be required in order to complete one final advertisement before they are presented to the buyers' eyes. When that item is then advertised, the viewers will inevitably be tricked and allured to see beyond the actual practicality and state of that particular item.\n\nThe second effect, the psychological one, derives from the audience's point of view. Sometimes the products being advertised in the media just look nice, glamorous, and even useful simply because they are unattainable. At times, that particular item may be too costly, that it is out of one's budget. This explains our natural human instinct to need and want what we cannot have. Therefore, the hope to be able to possess a certain product—perhaps in the near future or never at all—will push your desire to purchase that product even more. Hence, when a buyer does not conveniently have the item at hand while seeing the advertisement, it is only natural to make that particular item seem much better than it really is.\n\nTo conclude, the reasons, whether they are external or internal, bring the same result to the viewers of these advertisements. They are not necessarily good or bad, but the need to control one's perception is important in deciding if that reason is valid. The viewers, the buyers, must therefore reason and fight for what is real and what is not. Sometimes it is simply our mind that tricks us into buying. This is when you realize you've made the wrong decision."}
{"file_id": "1109886.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with this idea for four reasons: color, sizes, words, and people's feelings. The first reason is the impression of color. In fact, I am easily swayed by this strategy. For example, most advertisements have their specific characteristics, but my brain always focuses on color. My mental composition prioritizes color first, then personality. Even if the product's quality is poor, I often purchase it due to its color appeal.\n\nThe second reason is sizes. On bills, we cannot determine the actual size of products. This issue sometimes arises when purchasing large items, such as refrigerators or cars. Although online shopping is generally cheaper than traditional shopping, the shock of receiving an item with unexpected dimensions can easily occur.\n\nThe third reason is words. Words can dramatically change our hearts. Consider this example: a vintage shop has 100 pieces of clothing left. They sell one or two items per day. The owner is perplexed. One day, he creates a poster that reads: 'Only 50 clothes left!!' This creates a significant effect, and the products sell out in just one day. Instances like this show how words are incredibly important in advertising.\n\nThe last reason is the feelings of people, or personality. On TV commercials, various celebrities endorse many products. In fact, the success of these commercials can vary greatly depending on the celebrity involved."}

Although it may be argued that the young population is not as interested in social and political affairs as it was in the 1960s, I believe that young people have the willingness to help the communities in which they live.\n\nIt is a well-known fact that the young population is aware of the communal issues as they are part of a family that belongs to the community. In other words, the more they live in a family, the more they give enough time to their communities. For instance, in a village or in a minority group, the young population does not hesitate to participate in charity programs such as visiting hospitals, helping the oldest members of the community. They even become members of NGOs in order to demand or to help with the communal interests.\n\nOn the other hand, we may acknowledge that there are some current problems that keep the youth detached from their community as well as from their families. The process of globalization engenders a global village where individuals gain universal attributes and goals rather than engaging with their communities. Therefore, it becomes difficult to maintain the interest of the internet-based youth in alignment with that of the communities. However, this situation cannot extinguish the young willingness to help their communities.\n\nConsequently, we may consider that young people prefer engaging in private and global objectives rather than communal or social ones. Yet, we should not ignore that they are also active in helping their communities and they find time to help even if they feel themselves busy and overloaded by educational or professional life. Briefly, young people nowadays give time to helping their communities despite the difficulties in their globalized and internet-based lives."}

This is a dilemma I encounter as a student almost every day. On one hand, it is necessary to grasp the theory underlying all facts and new information to solidify one's knowledge of how things work. On the other hand, it is also essential to learn new words or relationships. Without this foundational knowledge, communication with others becomes impossible because they won't understand what you are discussing.\n\nI believe there is no clear-cut answer as to whether a student should memorize everything new or just understand the facts. There must be a middle ground that combines both approaches.\n\nIf repetition is the goal, then memorizing facts may suffice. However, when it is necessary to draw new conclusions and establish connections between different cases, understanding the basics of the new information is crucial.\n\nNowadays, knowledge is accessible to everyone through various databases, such as books, or the ultimate information source provided by the technology of the internet. It is simply a matter of how to locate information and the time it takes to access it. With the availability of data on pages like Wikipedia online, it is becoming less important to remember every fact by heart. With such resources, accessing the correct topic and obtaining any information, which is so vast that no one could retain it all, takes only a few seconds.\n\nIn conclusion, I hope that in many more fields than today, students will learn the 'why' behind the facts instead of just the pure facts and knowledge they will never need in that particular case in the future."}

On the other hand, young people do not have work and often enjoy their free time with friends or pursuing their interests.\n\nAlso, the physical makeup of the young and the older people makes a difference in the enjoyment of life. Many young people enjoy their time playing active sports and/or games. However, older people are not physically able to enjoy these active sports or games. The human body is constructed to become weaker and feebler as it ages. For example, there was a young man who loved football and became a star high school football player, but thirty years later, he cannot play his favorite sport anymore because of his physical fitness. Even if the old man kept his physical fitness and played football, he would not fully enjoy the sport as much as he did when he was in high school, since he does not have his old friends to play with.\n\nAnother reason is that young people have school where they can find many friends to enjoy their time with. On the other hand, older people have fewer chances to meet new friends that can give them enjoyment."}

The way we choose to travel is highly dependent on the place we choose to go. From my personal experiences, I think that traveling in a group led by a tour guide is the best way if we would like to go to a new place or city.\n\nThere are several reasons for this. First, and perhaps the most important one, is that we might choose a country or a city where the local language is not our mother tongue. In this case, the tour guide would be a helpful resource. He or she would assist us with procedures such as booking a hotel, knowing the restaurants, etc., upon entering the place.\n\nAlso, as we are new to the city and do not know much about its social culture, having a tour guide with us allows us to be easily informed about the habits and culture of the people in that specific country. This way, we can be well prepared for the trip.\n\nThe second reason, in my opinion, is that we would surely like to visit many new places on our trip and, of course, get a lot of new information about the history, art, social life, music, etc., of the place. How can we obtain such information if we travel without a group led by a professional tour guide who has lots of interesting information about the city?\n\nI think it might be possible to do all of these things if we travel individually, but really, we will waste a lot of time on it. Third, and lastly, traveling in a group is much safer than other ways, since there might be some possible dangers during our trip. The tour members can be helpful in these cases.\n\nAll in all, if I choose a new place to go, I prefer to travel in a group led by a skillful tour guide to have a great time and enjoy my trip."}

I think it is very important to have knowledge about the things around you. Studying or specializing in just one subject is not enough in today's world. For example, to become a doctor, a student must not only take science classes like biology, chemistry, physics, and math, but they also have to take some elective classes as well (politics, economics, humanities), in order to understand how things work around them.\n\nI'm an engineering major student. I've completed most of my science classes, but I've also taken classes like history, art, sociology, which helped me to understand the importance of other subjects. These classes developed my understanding of other topics like politics, history, sociology, and world religion. I was very surprised to know how important these other subjects are in order to understand the nature of our society. After taking all these classes, my way of looking at/thinking about the people around me, or in other words, the society we are living in, has changed a lot in a positive way.\n\nSomeone who doesn't get a chance to learn about other subjects finds it hard to get a job because their knowledge is just on specific subjects. In the modern world, companies are looking for people who have knowledge of all sorts of fields, rather than having knowledge in just one field. For example, there are more chances for a computer programmer who also has some kind of background in the field of electronics than for another programmer who just knows about his own programming field.\n\nIn my opinion, it is really very important for all of us to have knowledge of all aspects of life. If you go to universities, it is very common for a student to have a double major; that means to have degrees in two fields. Because they know what companies are looking for once they graduate. That's a kind of having another tool when another doesn't work. We should definitely have knowledge of other fields as well."}

There are two major issues involved while traveling: one is traveling along with other people initiated by a tour guide—in other words, he is the person led by a traveling agency. Another issue deals with people taking their own way to travel to a particular place. According to my view, I strongly believe in going along with a tour guide because he knows about the cultures and traditions prevailing in that place; he also knows about the history behind each and every monument present in that place.\n\nAs far as the place is concerned, there may be dangerous places where there is a prohibition for tourists, and without being initiated by a proper guide, we may fall into problems by entering into that place.\n\nThe main reason for going along with a tour guide is that we can know about the place in depth, i.e., what are the cultures and traditions of the people living in that place, and we can really enjoy our journey.\n\nWe can learn about the cultures, rituals, symbols of religions, and so on. So, I think it is better to go along with a tour guide.\n\nAnother reason I want to mention is about the monuments present in the place. When we are moving along with our tour guide, we could learn about the monument. For example, when we want to visit 'The Statue of Liberty at Manhattan,' we have to know the basic purpose or the history behind the Statue of Liberty. However, without a proper guide, we can visit the place, but we cannot appreciate the beauty of the place as we are missing the essence of the place.\n\nIn conclusion, the main reason for us going to a particular place is completely fulfilled if we are accompanied by a tour guide. Moreover, by visiting these places, we can improve our knowledge about the culture and traditions. As a result, we can increase 'international cooperation among the people,' and this will lead to a world of peace and gratitude."}

Although it may not be evident in the present scenario with car sales going up each year, many factors like pollution, space crunch, and increased public awareness will see more and more people relying on public transportation as their sole means for traveling.\n\nWith the price of gasoline skyrocketing beyond the general public's purchasing capability, people are slowly realizing that their cars are becoming more of a liability to them. It is highly unlikely that the fuel prices will ever decrease given the limited resources of fossil fuels.\n\nCars based on unconventional sources of energy like fuel cells, solar power, etc., are yet to establish their financial viability. All these factors suggest that people will look up to public transportation as a permanent solution to their woes. Besides being lighter on the purse, statistics suggest that it is a much safer mode of transportation than cars.\n\nAlso, the exploding population in metropolitan cities is leading to a major space crunch on roads and parking lots. People are fed up with wasting hours in traffic jams and parking queues. They are realizing that if most of them use public transportation, it would benefit all in terms of driving space and time. Non-polluting vehicles like cycles are once again gaining popularity among the masses for various reasons, health being a prominent one. In fact, many people in China go to their offices daily on bicycles.\n\nTherefore, it seems that the idea of the 'Ford', the famous car manufacturer, to ensure a car for all may not come true. With the government strongly promoting the benefits of public transportation and increasing awareness among the public regarding the disadvantages of owning and driving a car, we will see a sad but necessary demise of the era of cars."}

However, advertisements often hide the lack of quality of their products and try to portray their product as better than competitors' to earn more money from customers. As a result, products seem much better in the advertisement than they may actually be.\n\nFor me, advertisements make products look better than they are by using famous people such as players, singers, and artists, but that doesn't make the product good or useful. Therefore, my opinion on determining if a product is good or not is to ask people who use it. If a famous player wears certain shoes or a singer eats in a restaurant for an advertisement, they don't do that because it's good or great; they do it because they earn money from it. You can't make a decision until you try it or ask about it.\n\nBut if the advertisement shows some facts about the product or records some observations, that could be more helpful."}

It was such a special experience for me because I could stay in contact with people who really needed me, and it was a pleasure to be able to help them. I did not do a great job; I just gave them attention, spent time talking with them, and even if it can seem little, for them it was a lot.\n\nFurthermore, I usually like spending time with my next-door neighbor, who is a very old woman and is often alone. So sometimes, my boyfriend and I spend some time with her. For instance, it can happen that she needs something, and we usually go to the shop for her.

In my opinion, our educational system focuses too much on success rather than on values.\n\nThere are many different subjects and classes in which students participate, and in each class, they write exams. However, often there is not enough time to study for an exam, so students learn only the most important facts by heart to pass. Unfortunately, these memorized facts are quickly forgotten, and after a few months, nothing remains. Students retain only a minimal amount of what they have learned at school. This is not an effective preparation for life, as school often teaches only how to reproduce facts about a topic within a few days.\n\nBy engaging with ideas in enjoyable ways, such as through group work or role-plays, students retain the essence and the main content of a concept. This approach alleviates the pressure to quickly memorize facts, allowing students to enjoy learning. When learning is enjoyable, students are more likely to retain the essence of what they learn.\n\nTeaching concepts and ideas can convey ideal behaviors that cannot be taught with facts alone. Students can learn about values and strategies that are important for their future lives. If they understand the background or the concept of what they are learning, they will always be able to apply these strategies in daily situations. This, in my opinion, is the true task of education.\n\nSchools should prepare students for their future. It is the responsibility of schools to teach values and virtues, especially since parents often fail to do so. It is certain that values cannot be taught by reciting facts or learning things by heart. Values can only be taught through practice, and therefore I concur with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts."}

It makes you a self-confident person.\n\nSelf-confident people can keep up with rapid social and technological changes. According to the research conducted by some scientists, published in an education journal two months ago, about 65% of people are content with their lives. This consequence indicates to us that self-confident people are more successful and happy in their lives.\n\nMost students may forget their knowledge over time, but if you understand the texture of the information, you can produce some new ideas and compare them with others.\n\nThroughout my life, I was very lucky to have a good relationship with my teachers and coworkers because, as mentioned above, I have always been an investigative person.

The older people around me are complaining about the same problem. However, I do not share their view. In my opinion, young people try to give time to help charities, but they haven't got enough time because of the rush of the twentieth century. Young people have a lot of work to do but not enough time to spend in this century. However, they spend a lot of time in their communities. For instance, they are visiting their family at every celebration. If they have it, they give it to the poor people. For example, last night on a television show, a lot of people gave money to a charity to plant trees, and most of the people who gave money to the charity were young. Actually, there weren't any old people there. This is a remarkable point. A lot of people say young people are guilty about this topic, but maybe old people are guilty. There is an adage that comes from the Hittites. In a Hittite paper, an old person was complaining about young people. It shows that complaints about young people have never changed. The people living in the twenty-second century may complain about young people too. However, it doesn't mean young people are not giving enough time. In conclusion, the young people living in the twentieth century give enough time to their community, even though they have got a lot of jobs to do. We can see this from television shows, or if we look at history, we will see the same complaints. This is a typical thing, so the older people have to get rid of their complaints."}
{"file_id": "1107506.txt", "output_essay": "When it comes to traveling in a group, some people may say that the best way to do so is led by a tour guide; I personally disagree with that opinion. It's true that having a tour guide has its advantages, such as being taken to all the typical local tourist attractions, and you will be almost certain that you won't be missing out on any must-see places. Yet, on the other hand, having a tour guide limits your free time. When traveling in a group, you want to spend time with your friends, and spending it as you wish; not having to be tied to a schedule as it is when using a tour guide. It could also be said that when traveling in big groups, people always want to see different things, and arguments may occur. Although having a tour guide could prevent these disagreements by simply following the itinerary set for that day, there's a better way to solve the problem. The group could simply separate, each person goes to where they want, and at the end of the day meet again. The advantage of this solution is that when a big number of people are together for a period of time, usually arguments happen; by sending each person on their different way, it gives them time to refresh from the environment of the group. Most important of all, why it is better to travel without a tour guide, is that having a tour guide babysitting you around the city takes away a great part of the social and cultural interaction. The experience that you earn when you explore an unknown city on your own is something that cannot be shown by a tour guide. In conclusion, for all the reasons named above, my suggestion when it comes to traveling in a group is to not hire a tour guide and explore the city on your own along with your friends."}
{"file_id": "1111928.txt", "output_essay": "As the competition increases among companies in almost every market, advertising has become a very important way to improve sales numbers. Companies use a variety of different advertising techniques. This generally causes them to make their products seem much better than they actually are.\n\nFor example, when you watch a girl eating candy or chocolate, you probably want to eat that product as soon as possible. When you go and buy one, then you understand that it is not as delicious as you desired, but unfortunately, you have already bought the product, and this has increased the company's sales once more.\n\nOn the other hand, some companies are aware that this will happen only one time. When you use the product and see it's not as good as it seemed in the advertisement, then you lose your trust in that company and never buy its products again. So, they try to show the true qualities of the product to avoid making the customers disappointed. When they aren't disappointed, they always prefer to buy their products.\n\nIn conclusion, some advertisements may show the products better than what they actually are to improve sales. However, some firms think differently about that and plan a long-term process for their activities. I think the better way is always telling the truth. In that way, people can trust your company, buy your products, and in the future, due to the high sales, your company will most probably become a permanent fixture."}

Once we subscribe to their services, they start levying all the hidden costs which don't appear at the time of advertising. This is really a sort of cheating the people.\n\nSecondly, there are a number of products in the market, their advertisements showing the best appearance, which makes us feel like they are the real thing. When we start using them, they don't meet the expected levels, even though the cost is high. For example, soaps, shampoos, and a variety of cosmetics available in the market. Here, the appearance of the object and the way they are presented easily attract us and make us buy them.\n\nThirdly, most of the advertisements use celebrities for endorsements which make a lot of impact on the products. People just buy them only because their favorite star has advertised for it.\n\nIn India, most drinks like Coke and Pepsi are advertised by famous local film stars, and people started using them, even though they are proved to contain harmful residues of pesticides. After a concern raised by the media, they reduced their usage.\n\nIn some contexts, they make us feel they are modified products, even though in reality they are not. The world has completely paced itself to the world of advertisement; a product or commodity can be made successful only by advertising.\n\nTo sum up, advertising is one of the biggest tools or 'magic' for manufacturers to sell their products or commodities in the market, at the expense of people's faith in their products."}

It is expected that they be enthusiastic about giving back to the community that raised them.\n\nBut what actions constitute 'helping' our community? Voluntary work at non-profit organizations seems to be the easiest answer. Small acts of kindness, like helping a senior citizen cross the road, are often cited as ways for young people to serve the community. I believe that any work, paid or unpaid, done with the right intentions should count as helping our community.\n\nHaving said that, I think that the amount of time young people nowadays devote to their communities is regrettably lacking. I personally know a few young people who have never done an hour of voluntary work in their lives. Not only are they uninterested in the welfare of their fellow citizens, but they also see no point in serving their own family members or friends. Since they fail to see beyond themselves, there is no hope that they will give any time to help the community at large.\n\nMost educated young people have a vague sense of responsibility involving their communities, but there are so many distractions that prevent them from devoting time to it. Peer pressure, new technology, the mass media, and pop culture simply teach them all to concentrate on themselves and try to live a happy, materialistic life. It is a pity, since so many young people are led away from exercising their civic responsibility. No matter how much they are told by parents to help their community, it is impractical if there are so many distractions in their lives.\n\nMany young people do a small part in helping the community by doing community service. However, performance isn't satisfactory either. Even if they are doing voluntary work for no monetary pay, many young people are inevitably waiting for payment in some other form - points for an academic scheme, an impressive mention in their resume, or an award for 'outstanding service'. If they are intent on these superficial rewards, what follows is that the extent of their help will not be proportionate. Moreover, what little heart they have for service will diminish quickly, and of course, this is definitely not 'enough'.\n\nIn some situations, it is certainly understandable that young people choose other activities over service. Students should put their studies at high priorities, and young people in general seek excitement and new experiences, so they are entitled to some level of self-centeredness. In fact, pursuing wild, creative ways of doing things will probably be a help to the community if these young people choose to lend their talents and innovations accordingly. This requires a much deeper understanding than exists in the young people of today, but it also goes to show that the measure of contribution is hardly as simple as time - it involves an awareness and some heart in all of us.\n"}

I agree with this statement because older people were once part of the younger generation; hence, it is possible to agree with the statement. Firstly, young people enjoy life more than older people because from the early age of a newborn, the baby does not know about life. After some years, the child will go to school, which is an institution, and from there, he learns some things. When he reaches a certain position, he will enjoy time with his friends. They will be close to each other, help each other, and this is important for every person. It is essential because when he faces problems, friends will often help; sometimes parents will not be able to at that time, and this happens when there is true friendship. When there are occasions, all the friends will meet, they will enjoy parties, celebrate together, and enjoy life. That is the age to enjoy life and do whatever one wants because the past never returns, and in such a way, everyone should enjoy. Whenever there is a holiday, people will go to the cinema for full entertainment, as well as play games like cricket if they have holidays. It is a nice and interesting game, and going to the movies with friends is enjoyable. Everyone will be happy at that moment, and they will dance in theaters, which is a delightful experience. Hence, in every festival, all the friends will meet and spend their day at that place. While in college, there will be competitions, sports, entertainment, and we can participate and enjoy. We can go on tours with the college or on our own for a week; therefore, we can enjoy the climate while also studying. As the exam date approaches, we should prepare for exams and study well. If we don't know something, our friends can be helpful so that we can write exams successfully. Whereas older people cannot do this, which means when they reach an older age, they should not eat every item and they must take medicine daily, which is a problem. They will also face tensions and be in a hurry in each field.

Today's world is one of competition, and to compete, you have to try new things to achieve success.\n\nIn order to be successful, sometimes you try to find new ways. By exploring these paths, you think you can achieve success, and you often take risks in your life. I feel if people only do those things which they know how to do well, they can achieve success up to a certain level but cannot reach the heights of success.\n\nIn my opinion, everyone has their own definition of success, and it depends on the person how much risk they are willing to take in their life. For some, success means peace of mind or a happy life. But for others, success means reaching the heights of the world, to conquer the world, so that person tends to take more risks compared to the person who is happy in their own world, or to the person who has a different meaning for success.\n\nFor example, in cricket, if a batsman wants to score quick runs, he has to play risky shots in order to score quickly, so he has to take risks. Sometimes he succeeds, and sometimes he fails. So, it just depends on the person: is he ready to take the risk in terms of getting success? But I don't think you can achieve success without taking risks.\n\nSometimes I wonder if \"success has its negative side.\" This question always bothers me a lot.

I hold this opinion because young people are less weak, less afraid, and less fragile than older people tend to be.\n\nFirst of all, the majority of young people have a lot of energy they can disperse without becoming tired easily. While most aged people get tired after just one activity, young people, like students, can do many activities in just one day. Even after long hours of work in school, they can easily take part in an afterschool activity, and then come home to do homework and chores. On the other hand, older people get tired quickly even after one activity, such as cleaning the house. Being able to do many activities in one day promotes a sense of accomplishment and happiness, and thus young people who have more energy enjoy life more than older people.\n\nIn addition, young people tend to be more brave than older people and take more risks. Risks, because no outcome can be predicted, add excitement to the lives of young people. However, most older people prefer being stable and assured, and do not take risks. For example, a lot of young people will travel to distant countries and gain more experience. However, older people prefer remaining where they are. Thus, in the lives of older people, things are monotonous and predictable, whereas in the lives of young people, nothing can be predicted and everything is exciting.\n\nFurthermore, young people are also more mentally capable than older people. As people grow old, they lose their ability to concentrate for long periods of time or to learn new things. In contrast, young people are full of potential and can learn new things, like another language or a new recipe. Learning new things is very enjoyable, and younger people who have the advantage of better mental capabilities enjoy life more than older people.\n\nOlder people are restrained by various factors, such as fragility and the inability to continue activities for long periods of time. However, because young people are stronger physically, mentally, and also have less fear, their lives are filled with excitement and fun, enabling them to enjoy life more than older people do."}

Since they are still young and adaptable, they can learn from others' ideas and beliefs and find out which ideas they prefer and try to adopt those ideas in their own daily experience. For example, a student can try to examine whether the idea that cooperating with others is always better than working on one's own is true or not, while he or she uses different techniques working on a project. If this student finds out that working together is more efficient, he or she might want to try this method again in the future.\n\nSecondly, I think that there are a lot of different angles from which we can look at one thing or even an object, which means that there are many aspects for us to examine a fact when using different ideas and concepts. When students learn a fact, they can try to use their previously learned ideas and concepts to look at it. After examining things from numerous aspects, through different ideas and concepts, students will start to understand the diversity of every single fact, and eventually, learn to think critically and flexibly. For example, a student might find out that working with others is sometimes more efficient, but there are also many risks he or she might encounter.\n\nFinally, it is always important for every one of us to have our own set of ideas and concepts towards this great universe; we need to try to come up with our own thinking system and develop our unique ways to examine different facts. We learn from others' ideas and concepts; we examine these through our daily experience; we match them with facts to see if they are correct; and finally, we develop our own way of thinking.

The fact that schools and colleges have taken a positive step by according importance to social work in admissions processes is an added impetus. It encourages youngsters to contribute. Even if done out of personal interest, it exposes one to the joy of 'reaching out' and encourages them to do more.\n\nOne can cite numerous examples of engineers and doctors who have graduated from Ivy League colleges and could easily earn big bucks.

For example, when learning about science, if we don't know the basic idea behind the fact, we never get the connection between the related facts.\n\nBesides, if we don't teach our students the concepts behind the facts, we would just develop a bunch of encyclopedias for the future, not an efficient and smart generation. They have to know reasons, factors, consequences, and developments about the facts. Only knowing the fact doesn't stand for much. There is something before the fact and there is something after the fact. If they know both parts, it makes sense and draws a picture in their minds. It will fly and never stabilize in mind without it.\n\nAlso, it is really necessary for students to know the concepts behind the facts to make it easier for them to understand. Think about it. When they are learning about gravity, if you don't explain the factors, reasons, and just tell them the ground is pulling us, what would they understand? Probably nothing.\n\nIn conclusion, humans always look for reasons, results, and factors. They want to know why. So for students, it's important to know ideas and concepts."}
{"file_id": "1091471.txt", "output_essay": "Well, I opine in consensus with the given statement. Yes, I actually prefer to be assisted by a tour guide when I am traveling as a group. The reasons that support my argument are disclosed as follows.\n\nFirstly, it would be of great advantage to be accompanied by a guide because it proves to be beneficial to be directed in a place with which a group is not well acquainted. It is better to be guided in a place that is new to us because it prevents the group of tourists from being split up in case of any mishappening. Therefore, the group is led in unison, preventing the chaos of losing some members. Hence, it saves a lot of time to concentrate on the purpose of travel.\n\nSecondly, employing a guide provides us with details of all the important places to be visited. Therefore, it provides us with a good review of all the important places without missing any. This again saves us time in searching out for places to visit.\n\nThe third point of advantage of employing a guide is that of the awareness of the places visited. A guide really provides us with very valuable information as to how, why, when, and other related questions of the places visited. Therefore, it is of great advantage as the knowledge regarding the places is complete.\n\nAnother advantage is that of communication with the people of that habitat. This is really very important because the right way of communication with the local people might be really very difficult in most cases. This might mislead a group in knowing certain things, for example, the whereabouts or a route to a monument for that matter. Therefore, if a guide is accompanying us, we need not really face the communication problems as he translates the dialect of the local people and speaks in a way that is really understood by us.\n\nAnother important advantage is that a guide might really help us to sort out our accommodation at an economical place in case we are paying more for the stay than we are actually meant to pay. This again proves an economic advantage of employing a guide.\n\nTherefore, from the reasons which I have disclosed, I really favor employing a guide, although it is a bit expensive."}

In my opinion, it is not enough to have vast knowledge in one subject. People tend to be narrow-minded if they do not know about any subject other than their specific one. A mathematician, for example, can create a theoretical statistic about the spread of a disease, but he will have to account for certain irregularities to accurately represent the real process.\n\nFurthermore, a certain amount of basic knowledge is important for everyone to participate in daily discussions or to develop a political attitude, for instance. And every employer expects basic knowledge from his potential employees, for example, about the current political and economic situations.\n\nTherefore, it is definitely important to be familiar with more than one single topic. Nevertheless, it is obvious that students have to concentrate on one academic topic if they want to compete with others for a job. They have to know as much as possible about this one specific subject and they have to stay informed about the newest changes and innovations in this field.\n\nAnd apart from competitiveness, in some situations, it could also be very dangerous if someone has only broad knowledge of a subject. A doctor with broad knowledge of medicine, for example, is the worst imaginable danger.\n\nApart from that, the whole service sector is based on the fact that people are knowledgeable about one single topic in detail while others are experts in another. Nobody can learn enough about every subject, for then professionals would be superfluous.\n\nTo draw a conclusion, students should specialize in one specific subject and, apart from that, they should learn as much as possible about other subjects. Everybody should use his talent to the greatest extent."}

I don't think that this is a valid deal because I don't believe that I will be able to enjoy more in my older days than when I am young. At an older age, you would like to settle down in a calm village and enjoy the peaceful and pleasant climate rather than living in a crowded city, with a lot of things happening around you that interest you.\n\nAt a young age, you will have the energy to go around different places and view some of the beautiful creations in the world. But when you become old, maybe your health will not allow you to do adventures. At a young age, you have many things to enjoy because of fewer responsibilities and more energy. At a young age, you can also have great enjoyment with your romantic life too. Enjoying life to the fullest at a young age and also working hard to get settled in the future is my motto of life.\n\nNormally, people think that they will enjoy their life after they are old and they only work. But this can be harmful if they don't get a chance to enjoy their older stage after so many years of hard work.\n\nNormally, youngsters do enjoy a lot by arranging disco parties and trips to different locations with friends. They get in touch with the latest technologies and gadgets like iPods, mobile phones, games, and many more. They do spend a luxurious life. Youngsters also enjoy sports and have the ability to take part in it.\n\nSo finally, I can say that young people enjoy more than older people with respect to health, responsibilities, technology, and much more.

Because if every person specialized themselves in only one academic subject, it would be difficult for us to discuss together on general subjects.\n\nIn our society, there are continuing changes; we need specialized people who can understand topics in their favorite academic subjects well. Nobody can understand all problems in all subjects and find solutions for those problems; we need experts for that. For example, we are not able to explain how the financial policy of a multinational can affect the company's profits. But the people who are able to explain that may not be able to explain how education can reduce violence in poor countries.\n\nThese experts are, I think, the more able to teach their knowledge. It's important that this knowledge doesn't become a sort of extremism. Even if we are specialized in a subject, it's important to understand other people's points of view. The fact that our society is in permanent change puts another problem on the table. What happens to people specialized in a topic that becomes old-fashioned? Do these people lose all their skills? What can they do now?\n\nThe key is that people should be able to work, learn, and think about other subjects. For example, there is some technology that will become inefficient in the next five years. It's important for those people who are still working on this technology to have the possibility to switch to another one.\n\nTo conclude, we can say that it's important to have some experts on specific topics."}

One can tell that today, an average high school student, with an average level of education, knows better physics than Newton. With so much information accumulated, the urge for scientists to specialize in one area to contribute to that area becomes more and more significant. There are two major points related to this issue.\n\nFirst of all, as mentioned above, the accumulation of knowledge in a single area has increased so much that it is impossible to make a discovery on top of it without having a grasp of all prior information. For instance, while most people still have difficulty understanding Einstein and his Theory of Relativity, scientists are introducing theories that even extend it, having devoted a lifetime of study to that subject only. Specialization in a specific topic seems to be the only way of studying science professionally.\n\nSecondly, one can say that it is necessary to have a broad knowledge of many fields to be able to work on a specific topic since scientific fields are highly interconnected and interdependent. This is, of course, true to some extent. There are many general topics to cover until one has the capacity to advance to a specialized topic, but that does not stand against the fact that academic subjects are now so complex that one cannot afford to distribute his effort among various subjects. In fact, the current education system in most countries of the world is as follows: an introductory undergraduate program covering all the required subjects as a baseline, and then graduate studies specializing in a specific subject with the purpose of academic research.\n\nIn conclusion, whether to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects or to specialize in one specific subject is an important question. While each has advantages over the other, it seems that specialization is nearly an obligation of modern science given its depth and complexity. Specialization is inevitable and must be pursued by every academician, but also not ignoring the background knowledge of prerequisite subjects."}

There are two paths a student who wants to pursue graduate studies after finishing his bachelor's degree in any major might face. The first one is to continue what he has started and in the same major, like what they are saying, 'It's good to know a thing about everything, and to know everything about one thing.' Alternatively, the other path is to change his major and explore a different subject.\n\nSome graduate programs are designed for those who want to blend their knowledge and try to open new doors in their lives. For example, some people with an engineering background go to business school to combine their basic knowledge in problem-solving with the way of applying this knowledge in business.\n\nThere are a lot of amazing stories about people who found that it's a good way to explore the world of knowledge in several ways and to see that world through more than one point of view."}

First of all, these concepts and ideas might be wrong, so it is ridiculous to make students hold them. In contrast, we can let them develop their own under our observation. Also, some of these concepts are harmful; for example, until recently in my cultural background, people inherited and believed the stories about how certain tribe members are able to come back after their death.\nThe third reason opposing this concept is that students are the future. By the time they will be in charge, they will need their own ideas and concepts to deal with it because with every new day the world changes.\n\nIn conclusion, I disagree with the statement because of the variation in the reliability of the ideas and concepts' content, the possibility of their harm, and to allow them to develop their own."}

First, you can share and exchange your opinions and feelings about the sites you visit with your groupmates. It is often very enjoyable and refreshing to listen to other people's feedback.\n\nSecond, the tour guide takes you only to locations that matter the most or that are the most representative of the country visited. Therefore, you avoid wasting time deciding where to go and whether the designated location is worth the visit. The guide is often a great source of important information about the visited site. He can make the visit very interactive, something you couldn't get from a book.\n\nFinally, the tour and the guide make the travel much more enjoyable as everything is already planned. There is no need then to bother with organizational details and unexpected events. Everything is handled by the guide and the tour company.\n\nHowever, traveling in a group with a tour guide may also have some disadvantages. In my eyes, being in a group means that you no longer master your time. Unless being selfish and imposing your ideas on others, you cannot do what you want. You have to stay within the bounds and respect other people's wishes. And listening to someone whining the whole day because the schedule does not please them is indeed extremely annoying.\n\nBesides this, a tour means everything is already planned. There is, therefore, no room for sudden changes of schedule or unexpected locations to visit. The excitement might be undermined. If the tour company provides poor services or the guide lacks knowledge about the location, then your experience may turn out to be very disappointing and frustrating. Another very bad habit of touring companies and guides is the fact that they often take you to locations, restaurants, museums with which they have a partnership, a deal, so you are invited to purchase items in those locations and not others. Personally, I dislike these practices very much as I have the feeling of being a kind of toy in their hands.\n\nMy best advice is to choose the tour company carefully. To rely on other people's feedback, friends, in order to determine which tour company suits our wishes and needs the best. About the group, my suggestion is to welcome things as they come and to always focus on what pleases you the most and to sweep away any little annoying detail."}

Unfortunately, there is growing opposition among other students, who maintain that learning facts is the most important factor in their studies. However, in the final analysis, I conclude that the former opinion does make sense. In the following discussion, I would like to present some points to support my statement.\n\nIn the first place, the key point for my view is that understanding ideas and concepts, undoubtedly, allows students to cultivate their ability for self-study and plays the most significant role in their studies. Actually, the ultimate aim of students studying at the university is to promote their sense of independent thinking. For example, in their beginning studies, they need a teacher to guide them. But in their future studies, they must deal with problems by themselves. Of course, they need to practice their capability to solve problems when they understand ideas and concepts in class.\n\nIn addition, students can understand ideas and concepts by themselves to check out what they have learned in class. It is beneficial for them to build up their self-confidence.\n\nFurthermore, it is the best way to supervise the students. If they can't understand ideas and concepts, they would fail the exam eventually.\n\nGiven the reasons above, which sometimes intertwine to form an organic whole and thus become more persuasive, we can arrive at the conclusion that inspiring students to master the ability to understand ideas and concepts in class must be undertaken by the teachers. Only by this way can we implement quality education; only by this way can we enhance the self-confidence of the students, and only by this way can we supervise students' study in an efficient way."}

I have three reasons to support my answer.\n\nFirstly, taking risks is a way of finding new opportunities. I think the bigger the risk, the greater the chance you have. And to make that chance your own, you will need hard work, and that will make you a stronger person.\n\nSecondly, taking a risk and trying new things can give you a new perspective and can increase your knowledge, which can help you become more successful. For example, starting cheerleading in my high school was a big risk for me. Because I used to be a very shy person and did not like to do things in front of everyone else, but starting cheer gave me the courage to express myself in front of the crowd. The practices are very hard, and that made me a stronger person than I was before.\n\nThirdly, trying new things gives us an opportunity to meet different people and learn their thoughts, and gives us a new perspective.\n\nThese are the reasons I agree with this statement."}

I would like to argue that this is not the case, that there are many benefits to young people doing community work, and thus that young people ought to invest more of their time in these activities.\n\nObviously, there are many direct benefits for the communities. If many young people are engaged in helping the elderly, giving free tuition to younger school kids, clearing public places of rubbish, the community can save on these activities and put the money to some other beneficial use.\n\nMoreover, the communities gain indirectly from stronger youth participation. Accomplishing meaningful tasks together with their peers will keep many young people from doing things that would do damage to their communities. Think about petty crimes and vandalism.\n\nFinally, it is not only the community as a whole that benefits, but there is also something in it for the young people who engage in community work. I may not have appreciated it from the very beginning, but after a while of doing community service, I realized how talking to and helping elderly and disabled people made me see the world with different eyes.

In my opinion, successful people are indeed those who venture into new territories, but this approach has both its advantages and disadvantages.\n\nI believe that successful people are those who try new things because they work hard, conduct research, and do their best to discover new methods while making processes better and more efficient. Therefore, I suppose these individuals deserve more recognition than those who merely sit in one place, repeating the same procedures year after year.\n\nSuccessful people, in my view, never cease to work hard, never stop researching, and never slow down in their quest for improvement. As this modern world continues to evolve and improve day by day, one must keep pace and never halt the effort to innovate.\n\nA person who slows down or stops their momentum in research and hard work will inevitably be ousted from the competition.\n\nThere are a few disadvantages to trying new things. For instance, by venturing into the unknown, you may risk failure, and if the new endeavor does not work or benefit, it can lead to significant losses for an individual or even a company.\n\nHowever, in my opinion, sometimes the potential rewards of trying new things outweigh the risks, as the likelihood of success is often greater than that of failure.\n\nThere are some advantages to sticking with what you know, such as avoiding risk and staying in a 'safe zone.' People who dislike competition, confrontation, or lack resilience may prefer to continue doing what they are proficient at.\n\nIn conclusion, successful people are always in search of innovation, while those who prefer stability and resist change continue with familiar tasks.

In my opinion, young people do not devote as much time to their communities as they did in the past. In our time, there are many distractions that can consume a youngster's time.\n\nFirstly, most young people waste time on computers. Computers were initially created for people's benefit, but they have become toys or gaming machines, and no one has tried to stop this because games are a significant economic resource for those working in this sector. For example, young people could use computers and the internet to search for information about their country's standing in the world and future predictions. Furthermore, this interest could make young people more invested in their communities.\n\nSecondly, I think that young people do not take the lessons at their schools seriously enough. Important subjects taught in school, such as history and geography, are crucial for understanding one's community. In my opinion, everyone connected to a community should know their country's history. Geography is also vital for anyone wanting to assist their community. These subjects are just two ways education can help individuals contribute to their communities. Moreover, school instills a love for one's country, second only to family. These values are well-known, but people still do not take them seriously and often treat schools as playgrounds.\n\nYoung people are like diamonds. They need to be shaped; otherwise, we cannot expect anything from them. They must be molded if they are to become the saviors of the community. Therefore, if a youngster doesn't spend enough time helping their community, it is also their family's responsibility."}

He or she cannot combine two different problems to solve.

There are countless examples of men in history who risked their own wealth or even their lives to try out a 'new thing' in which they believed and put their faith.\n\nIt is inherent to human nature to strive for new knowledge and wisdom. But new knowledge can only be gained by daring to step aside from the enlightened path and search in the darkness. Risk has to be accepted as a part of this search.\n\nTo become successful, you need to distinguish yourself from the crowd, and this also means accepting some risk. One possibility to do so is by exploring new ways and, thereby, inventing something new or developing new skills. Successful entrepreneurs, for example, are usually recognized as risk-taking people. Innovation is the result of their effort to become better and make things better. With their success, they shape our economy and our society. It is people like Bill Gates who changed the world we live in today; and he started in a small garage, working on something people at that time might have called 'crazy' and 'useless'. He definitely tried a 'new thing,' and that is what made him very successful.\n\nAnother proof that success and risk-taking go together can be provided by the financial markets. It is taking the risk that pays off. But that does not necessarily mean that risk is uncontrollable. Information can be gained and used through personal effort to assess the quality of the risk. So, to become successful, it is also necessary to get informed, implying that one cannot only do what he knows how to do well already but has to try 'new things'.\n\nAcknowledging this, I have to agree with the given statement."}

One needs to have some sort of experience in an area to be successful; for example, a previous mistake or a wrong decision that has been made.\n\nTo begin with, I would like to give an example of my personal experience. In the summer of the year 2007, I dislocated my knee during a physical education class at school. We were playing kickball, and it was my turn to kick the ball and run. Due to the slippery floor of the court, I slipped and almost broke my left leg. It took me a considerable amount of time to start walking, running, and even sitting again, and the doctor had forbidden me from playing any sort of sport again, as there was a significant risk that the same accident would happen again. However, I did not listen to the words of the doctor and started playing basketball, my favorite sport, as soon as I was able to run again. I even joined the Varsity Girls Basketball Team at my school. Now the season is over, and I am glad that I took the risk. However, if I hurt myself again, I would never regret what I did, because I would take a lesson out of it: not to disobey my parents and my doctor again.\n\nAnother example of taking risks and trying new things would be joining the chess club at my school. I had never played chess in my entire life, but as soon as I joined the club, my knowledge of logical thinking flourished. I enjoy playing the game, even outside of the club, and I am proud that I took the risk and joined the club, even though I was nervous and shy at the beginning.\n\nSome people tend to hate seafood, while others cannot live without it. I believe this is a matter of choice and sometimes a matter of experience. Disregarding people who have allergies, an ordinary human being would enjoy eating something if they were raised eating it. I am a seafood fanatic and therefore adore eating Japanese food. Sushi, the most common type, is something I eat every week. Some of my friends, however, highly dislike sushi. My best friend at school had never tried eating sushi in her life, but she told me about her hunger for seafood several times. Therefore, I took her to a Japanese restaurant once, trying to convince her to eat sushi. She did not want to eat it at first; however, when she tried it, she absolutely loved it. Now, every week, she and I go to our favorite destination, the Japanese restaurant.\n\nExperience is something that happens once in a lifetime and can be used numerous times for different things.

Sometimes, this concept might go further to demonstrate a status of cheating when mentioning false information about products or giving unreliable guarantees. Companies and goods sellers should talk about and describe the actual advantages, features, and services they offer. Presenting these items to the customers in an attractive way should not be considered as a manner of cheating or telling lies. A proper and honest way of presenting goods and advertising them is by mentioning the components and items utilized to manufacture these goods. Companies utilizing materials of quality might point out how good the materials used in manufacturing are. Another way of fair advertising activities is highlighting the efforts required to produce some goods and pointing out the professional and continuous planning to achieve this perfection. Marketing trends in some cultures attract consumers by utilizing cultural concepts (e.g., cultural and traditional sayings as a logo). Another example of fair advertising is studying the trends and behaviors of consumers (e.g., packing children's toys in bright-colored boxes), and we shall not consider this a manner of manipulation as no false information is mentioned about the product. By observing international markets, manufacturers and goods sellers all over the world are now trying to give glorious and attractive names to their products, which isn't a sort of decision-makers manipulating. Focusing also on the customers' needs and making brochures pointing out the positive side and promise of fulfilling their requirements can be considered a way of fair promoting some goods.

It can be shown as a TV ad featuring a reputable person, such as a sports figure, film actor, or model.

The advertisement should be shown globally to people. \n\nGiving an advertisement for a product gives a complete picture or use of the product, which should be seen by people. The product should have import and export value based on their demand. The product should gain demand by showing proper advertisements. People should have a proper idea of the product; they should believe it by seeing a proper advertisement. This means the advertisement should impress the demanders. Advertisements should be shown globally, where we can find the demand. \n\nAdvertisements should have a proper theme which impresses consumers, and they should be attracted by seeing that.

For example, although you may learn something in school, if you do not apply the information, it becomes useless. People have a natural desire to learn new things and build upon previous knowledge. If they do not try new things, their life experiences would be limited.\n\nTherefore, I believe it is worthwhile to engage in activities that challenge us to try new things and not worry about faults."}
{"file_id": "1112538.txt", "output_essay": "According to many people, there will be fewer cars in use in the future than there are today. Environmental problems are linked with the huge number of cars in the world. Pollution has become a central problem in our societies. In order to respond to this problem, governments focus on many possible solutions, such as the limitation of cars in cities. As an example, the mayor of London has introduced a congestion charge in the center of London to limit the number of cars. As far as I am concerned, I think that this solution is very convincing, as it has been proven that the number of cars has been reduced in the city.\n\nMoreover, public transport is supported by many governments. The cost of the underground is very cheap in some countries, such as France. I would rather take the bus or the tube instead of driving my car. On the other hand, the cost of driving licenses has considerably increased during the last years. As a result, people are more likely to take the bus or to use the underground than before.\n\nHowever, emerging countries such as India or China are not ready to reduce their production of cars. Most of the economy is based on this production. Therefore, environmental issues are not the priority of governments. Although these countries are aware of car pollution, they don't take preventive measures to solve this problem.\n\nBut many measures have been taken to face this problem. The Kyoto Protocol illustrates the capacity to deal with the huge problem of pollution in the world. The problem is that many industrial countries didn't sign this protocol.\n\nTo conclude, I think that we can hope that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today because governments make us aware that cars represent a huge scourge for our societies. As a consequence, many measures have been taken and will be taken to reduce car activity. However, even though many things have been done, the number of cars will increase because many poor countries need this economy in order to survive."}
{"file_id": "1114626.txt", "output_essay": "The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide, a statement I can totally agree with, and my opinion is based on several factors. First off, the main reason for traveling is usually to explore the place visited and see the beautiful attractions within it. That's why it is necessary to find a professional and experienced local to guide you to the places because he knows his job, and he knows what he's doing, so he would, without a doubt, take you to places often admired by tourists, like beautiful scenes and natural beauties. For example, I remember when I went with my family to Egypt. We met this young woman who was appointed to meet us as our tour guide. I can't find words to describe how excellent her choices were and how greatly we were satisfied with the places we have seen and the activities we've taken part in since we saw most of the breathtaking attractions in Giza, like the Pyramids, Sphinx, and the national museums in that area where we had this short lesson about hieroglyphs. Also, getting a tour guide who's also local can make a splendid combination because you can't find someone who'd try harder to show you places in his town to make you love the place like a local. Second of all, by getting a touring guide, you can avoid a great deal of trouble you may face if you were alone. Touring guides are often accompanied by security guards who are common and familiar with situations that can cause some tourists a kind of unhappiness, or make them uncomfortable, or in worst cases, be in danger, such as getting caught in the overwhelming traffic, being lost, getting a good deal of disturbance by beggars, or even in worst cases, being endangered by tourist-targeting criminals. So that's why I do think that tour guides are a must, instead of going solo, getting unsatisfied with what you see, and giving the place you visit a bad name as a result of that choice you've taken."}

In addition, we can visit famous places efficiently. It means that we can visit many places without wasting time. At the same time, we will be able to gain a lot of knowledge about the places we visit from a tour guide. If we travel with a tour guide, we will enjoy ourselves and be safe.\n\nHowever, if we travel with a tour guide in a group, we have to be mindful of time at all times. If we have free time, we must return at the time the tour guide specifies. If we want to explore more, we cannot do that if we travel with a tour guide. If there is a place we want to visit, we cannot go there if it is not included in the tour, even if it is very near our route. If we travel by ourselves, we don't need to be mindful of time. We can stay at a place as long as we want. Furthermore, we can plan the trip as we wish. Therefore, we don't need to visit places we are not interested in and can go only to the places that interest us.\n\nIn my opinion, planning the trip is one of the joys of traveling. If we make a plan from start to finish, we may encounter some problems. However, once the trip is finished, we can experience a great deal of happiness. Therefore, I disagree."}
{"file_id": "1105047.txt", "output_essay": "Different approaches in education discuss whether it is more important for students to learn about facts or to understand ideas. If one has to choose between both of them, I would say it is more important to learn to understand ideas. I will first present some arguments to support this point, emphasizing the intellectual importance of ideas. Then, I will try to explain how these points are complementary and why they are necessary for any good student.\n\nAs a student myself, I feel very concerned by this topic, especially because I am a young researcher and the relationship between concepts and facts is critical. However, mainly because facts can be learned outside of school, I would agree to state it is more important to understand concepts. For instance, in my own research about the gentrification of Harlem, I am less interested in the facts and the details than in understanding the whole process and the trends that drive it. It is true that it is very important to understand the concepts of class, place, and territory (their role, symbols, etc.). I think it is the role of the school to teach students to think for themselves, and it succeeds by giving them the intellectual and conceptual keys and tools to understand a problem and solve it.\n\nHowever, saying the concept is more important than the fact (as implied in the question), I face a big ethical problem. In effect, how can you understand a concept or an idea if you don't know some facts to contextualize it, for example? Even if facts can be learned differently than in an academic way, they are required. For example, if I don't know how many people are displaced by gentrification or to what extent the rents have risen due to gentrification, how can I expect to understand the nature of the transformations occurring in the neighborhood? I think concepts and facts are linked, and the reciprocity of their relationship is the secret to a good understanding of concepts and ideas.\n\nTo conclude, I would say that theoretically understanding concepts is more important, but it can only work with very abstract objects of study. The reality is more complex, and to understand an idea efficiently, you need to know the context and the facts."}
{"file_id": "1120880.txt", "output_essay": "I disagree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide. Frankly speaking, what people with a guide can understand is only the surface of the country. I think feeling and knowing the different ways or values is the most interesting thing in traveling. And it can be achieved only by voluntary actions. In that sense, not all, but many travels with tour guides miss the chance to enjoy the travel.\n\nFirst, generally, the trip with a tour guide is easier to get information or knowledge of the country you go to. You don't have to buy a guidebook nor collect the information from the internet before you leave. Even though you haven't done those things, the tour guide will tell you all you want to know, such as good restaurants, exciting amusement parks, or beautiful sites. Without a tour guide, you have to do all of these things by yourself, so you can get a better understanding through this action.\n\nSecond, feeling and knowing different ways can be achieved by knowing the native people. But there is less chance to get along with them on a tour trip. There is less free time on a tour because the guide schedules most of the time. Moreover, with a lot of people who are of the same nationality, there is less chance"}
{"file_id": "1114595.txt", "output_essay": "I fully agree with that statement for the following reasons. First, an already successful person will accept a higher risk because he has greater security if he fails. When the new venture results in a loss, he still retains the gains from the successful actions he undertook previously. Thus, he faces a lower risk than a person who could lose everything by experimenting with new things.\n\nSecondly, the hunger for success grows with the success one has. A successful person knows there must be more beyond what has already been achieved. The known old patterns will only yield the same old level of success. However, to increase it, one must discover new, unknown, and perhaps also unfamiliar methods, which generally carry a higher risk but also a higher potential reward than conventional ones. If someone possesses a risk-taking character, they will not stop at the first success but will seek more throughout their life.\n\nThe third, and I think most important, argument deals with experience and the fear of the future. If a person has been successful at least once in their life by taking a risk, they have made an important step. By crossing the border in one's own mind once, the next time it will be easier because you gain a kind of imagination of what is waiting for you on the other side. Of course, there is no way to calculate all risks; there will always be some that one did not anticipate. Despite that, the person knows how to handle unforeseen developments, so he or she has no, or at least less, fear of them.\n\nThese arguments show why success at a high level is not possible without taking significant risks, and therefore I agree with the given statement."}
{"file_id": "1102427.txt", "output_essay": "Nowadays, travel agencies are providing tourists with various kinds of traveling programs with a tour guide, which are designed by the agencies beforehand. These programs are quite convenient because we do not have to make efforts to schedule on our own, and we are led by a tour guide with a reserved tour bus. However, I do not agree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide for the following reasons.\n\nTo begin with, we cannot have the great fun and excitement that are felt while we make plans for a trip ourselves if we use a traveling program with a guide. I realized the importance and fun of planning my trip by myself when I prepared for a trip to Europe last summer. I had the trip with two of my friends, so we met frequently to decide which places we were going to visit, what we would eat, what to buy as souvenirs, etc. I think that we had an equally or even more interesting and exciting time while we made our schedule and imagined our trip compared to the actual traveling. A group traveling led by a tour guide is already planned by travel agencies, so we cannot make our unique and special choices and plans.\n\nAdditionally, we will probably be restricted by the group's decisions and behaviors even if we have different ideas. For example, we can have some chances to choose what to eat even though we travel in a group. However, in this case, we should follow a certain choice that many people selected. It is really sad that we cannot eat exotic foods that we really want while traveling in foreign countries. Furthermore, we cannot take public transportation because of the reserved tour bus. I found it very interesting and impressive to take other countries' subways, trains, buses, and trams during my trip. I must have missed that precious experience if I had traveled in a group led by a tour guide.\n\nIn conclusion, I am convinced that traveling in a group with a guide is not the best way to travel. We can have really interesting and exciting moments while we make our original and free plan for our trip. We also can behave freely if we are not included in a group. We can eat whatever we want, go wherever we want, and even decide to take risks or adventures when we travel by ourselves. Besides, we can experience minor things which are done by residents of a foreign country such as riding public transportation and walking along rivers and streets. These are great advantages of traveling by ourselves individually."}

It has a lot of advantages, like you don't need to panic in a foreign country; the tour guide will direct you to all the worthwhile sightseeing places and provide you with background information about them.\n\nThe comfort and security offered while traveling with a group are better than traveling on your own. You build new friendships and see different facets of life. Moreover, the cost of the trips is relatively less since most of the guides/operators have tie-ups with different resorts, transportation companies, etc. It gives a better deal for the consumers.\n\nYour trip is organized, and any problems arising can be dealt with by the guide since he is seasoned and experienced in the trip.\n\nHowever, there are a few disadvantages as well. We may or may not get individual attention during the trip from the guide, especially if he has many tourists under his care. Sometimes a consumer may also feel that they are not getting a good deal and it's expensive because the tour operator's margin (commission) will be added to the package costs.\n\nRegardless of the disadvantages, I feel that the best way to travel is in a group led by a guide since you tend to enjoy more, and any hassles relating to foreign exchange, visas, etc., are dealt with effectively.\n\nAnyway, as the saying goes, 'The more the merrier.'"}
{"file_id": "1092270.txt", "output_essay": "To be afraid to do something new is inherent to all humans. Failing is a very unpleasant thing, and the best way to avoid failing is not to do anything. But if history has taught us something, it is that the only way to improve and be successful is to try new things and take risks, no matter how hard or painful this might be.\n\nThe Western world as we know it came hand in hand with industrialization. This period of history is known to be a time where steam and dreams enabled massive productions, better goods, and an increase in the quality of life. Without people taking risks and failing hundreds of times before finding solutions, none of these could have happened.\n\nAnother good example of the results of risk-taking actions is the development of airplanes. Probably all of us have seen some old movies of the first plane prototypes. Crazy machines that looked more like toys than real planes. But after years of trial and error, someone got it right. And thanks to that, it is possible to travel in hours to places that otherwise would be impossible to reach.\n\nI have a personal example, as a Brand Manager of a wine company. No one believed that we could develop a wine to be as fun as beer. 'It is simply not in wine's essence to be fun,' an important manager once said. But my team and I strongly believed that it was possible to do it. So after a lot of mistakes, we finally developed 'FRESSCO,' a new brand that combines wine with fresh fruit in a completely innovative packaging. The results? FRESSCO is now one of the top 3 wines sold in Chile, and it has become a real competitor to beers.\n\nSo, in conclusion, even if being afraid to do something new is always a challenge for any person, it is fundamental to know that innovation is the only way to progress. It is true, mistakes can really be painful, but the reward of doing something new compensates for all."}

I think that the correct statement would be the exact opposite. I'm going to defend my point of view first by proving that to succeed, people need to study, then that success needs to be built step by step, and finally, that success comes from others' trust.\n\nFirst of all, I personally think that to succeed, studying is necessary. Going to college is not a risk but the opposite, an assurance in life. It's an investment in life for a better and more secure future. Of course, going to college can be seen as something new at the beginning, but it's not exactly like that. It's more like a continuation of a quest for knowledge. By having a degree, people learn how to do something well.\n\nThe second reason why I disagree with this statement is that I think success is something that needs to be built. It doesn't come easily and quickly. It's a long, daily work and to increase the chance of achieving it, stability is required. Running and rushing from one plan to another won't lead anywhere.\n\nFinally, I think that to succeed in life, trust from others is a must-have. Without trust, there is no possible real success. And taking risks is the worst way to gain that trust from people around. Again, trust is something to build day after day. And to earn it, knowledge in the activity is also required; nobody is going to trust somebody new in a field who doesn't know what he is talking about.\n\nOf course, success can come to someone who takes risks, but it's like the lottery; it happens to one in a million. I think that knowledge, stability, and trust are the keys to success."}
{"file_id": "1111103.txt", "output_essay": "I totally agree with the statement which states, \"It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.\" In my opinion, understanding ideas and concepts is more important for a student than learning facts. Firstly, to understand a topic, for example, any topic related to physical science like light, we should know the basic concepts to deal with it and basic ideas, like thinking for ourselves from where it actually comes. I think that's enough to understand the topic. Concepts should be clearer, like the various laws of reflection and refraction, to use them for further study, not about the facts from where it originated, etc. After considering the student's perspective, we should be clear with the concepts first and the basic ideas, like taking the 'brain where it's never been before' about the topic. These generated thoughts are called ideas. Generating ideas is really a brainstorming technique which helps to increase the morale of a student. Similarly, if a student goes in search of a fact, there are 9 out of 10 times he will fail. This failure can lead to a decrease in the morale of a student, through which feelings of negativity can come into his/her mind. This can lead to the buildup of a negative attitude which can hamper his/her future as well. Facts are those which we go and try to find after completing our bachelor's or even after masters. Therefore, at a student's age, we should only learn the concepts involved. One more thing I would like to add to make my assumption stronger is that when we appear in any subjective class at school/college level, what is our teacher's main aim, or where do they place more stress? They stress more on a concept-building system than on the search for a fact. I agree that facts are also required and we should know them, but the major focusing point should be on concepts and developing students to think beyond the limit. In conclusion, in a nutshell, I would like to say that concepts are the ones which make students clearer about the topic and able to judge it properly. These concepts are the major supporting elements in a student's life which help him/her to think more, to create/generate ideas, and to get things done in a more fruitful way, which are basically needed academically and in professional life too."}
{"file_id": "1097498.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with this idea. There are four reasons. First, it is more appropriate for young people to play sports such as soccer, basketball, and baseball, as these can be difficult for older individuals to engage in. In fact, professional leagues in these sports typically feature only young star players. Additionally, the number of sports older people can participate in is limited, not to mention the increased risk of injury they face when playing. The possibility of getting injured is higher in the case of older people. Secondly, young people can travel more easily than older people, especially to foreign countries. When we travel somewhere, we sometimes encounter cultural differences with the locals and should have a flexible mindset to accept such differences in order to maintain good relationships with them. Moreover, it is sometimes necessary to communicate in the local language, which requires learning a new language. Young people tend to learn more easily due to their flexible and fresh way of thinking. Thirdly, young people have enough time to pursue their aspirations. Older individuals often have more social responsibilities, especially if they have sons or daughters, making it quite difficult to find time in their tight schedules. Fourthly, there are many opportunities for young people to change their situation according to their preferences. For example, it is easier for young people to find new jobs compared to older individuals because they have the potential to learn more about the job. The main reason is that they can work longer hours due to labor laws. Currently, it is difficult for those over 60 to find employment. Some people who wish to work cannot find jobs for these reasons. In the case of young people, their employment status depends entirely on themselves."}

And by the 2020s, people might get rid of their cars and go and buy bicycles. Science, after 20 years from now, will have progressed rapidly and increasingly.

I was always making A's in Korean classes. I loved to study Korean literature, and I was successful in writing creative stories and poems.\n\nOne day, my dad suggested that I study in America. He thought I could experience a new culture and learn a new language. I was really concerned when I heard about my father's suggestion. I thought I was only capable of learning Korean.

{"file_id": "1105857.txt", "output_essay": "People pursue education because knowledge serves as the foundation for young adults, which means that those complex math questions or the dates of historical events are not directly applied in society. Thus, if I have to choose between understanding ideas and concepts in a certain subject or learning facts, I would choose to understand ideas and concepts. There are two reasons for agreeing with this statement.\n\nThe first reason is that if you focus on understanding ideas and concepts, you can obtain knowledge much more easily and quickly. This is because when you try to make ideas and concepts your own, it is easier to concentrate as the process of learning them is fun and interesting. For example, when I receive report cards from school, I could divide them into two groups. The subjects with high grades were the ones where I understood the concepts and ideas very well. The other group consists of low grades in subjects I found boring and just waited for the class to end. As you can see from my experience, the quality of the outcome differs depending on whether you understand ideas or just try to learn facts. This shows why understanding is more important than learning facts.\n\nThe next reason is that the ideas and concepts you understand remain for a longer time. This reason is understandable among people. In my case, I still remember the math formulas I understood in my high school days. This is because if you make the ideas or concepts your own, they can be applied to other areas, thereby allowing the formulas or other facts to be used and remembered continuously, even as you grow older.\n\nTo sum up, the two reasons presented above show why understanding ideas is more crucial than just learning facts. Understanding allows your knowledge to be instilled in your brain in a shorter amount of time with a positive attitude towards it and can be applied to other spheres as well. Having experienced a variety of cases related to this statement during my high school life, I strongly agree with the statement."}

In my opinion, most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.\n\nIndeed, the aim of an advertisement is to sell a product. That is why advertisers are ready to say anything that can convince you to buy it. People who create advertisements are not obligated to tell the truth; their goal is purely commercial, not educational. So, how can we trust advertising? To illustrate this point, let's take the example of McDonald's. If we look at an advertisement for this restaurant, we might believe that the meals are very dietetic, not bad for health, and the pictures of the meals are really enticing. However, according to the experiment conducted on McDonald's food in 'Supersize Me,' we can see that this food is not good for health.\n\nTo give another example, consider makeup advertisements. The women who appear in these advertisements are models, and if we use this makeup, we will not look like the model. Moreover, the mascara seems to be very effective on her, but on us, it does not have the same effect! So the product works better on TV or in advertisements than in real life. It is usually the same for washing products that claim to wash our clothes 'whiter than white.'\n\nWe have to keep in mind that the advertising world is an imaginary world where everything is perfect. It is not supposed to reflect reality. It sells us dreams, and that is what we buy when we purchase a product after seeing its advertisement. Indeed, everything is fake in an advertisement; people are retouched, they always seem happy, and everything is portrayed as delicious or amazing.\n\nTo conclude, we can say that, yes, advertisements usually make products appear better than they really are because their main stake is to sell something, not to be truthful."}

Some people travel for pleasure, but the main reason for traveling is to see new places and meet new people. We cannot meet new people unless we travel in a group, and as far as seeing new places is concerned, we cannot know the history of the places without someone telling it to us. A person who has all the knowledge about the past, present, and future of a monument, city, or country can enrich our experience. This knowledge is best imparted to a traveler by a tour guide.\n\nTraveling alone does not serve the purpose of traveling itself. We go to new places and want to explore them, but we are unable to because we are new to the place and do not know where to go and what to do. A tour guide leads us to the right places and tells us things we would never know if it weren't told to us, especially regarding historical monuments. There is a reason behind every historical structure ever made, and visiting the structure without knowing when, why, and by whom it was made is like looking at the pictures in a book and claiming we have read it. Only a tour guide has the knowledge and the communication skills to make people more familiar with a new place.\n\nWe have heard the saying 'the more the merrier,' and this is the right way to describe a trip taken in a group.

The problem will be finding more cars on the road without having sufficient space for pedestrians. To reduce pollution, there will be a limited number of cars. In my opinion, the number of cars will decrease instead of increasing. This could be offset by larger buses and other forms of transportation, such as trains, which offer easier, cheaper, and faster transportation for workers and the government. Consequently, travel will be organized in a specific manner, requiring the purchase of tickets to use the train that moves from one place to another.

When I went to Todai-ji Temple on my school trip, I couldn't check the explanation of the temple or the statues of gods carefully because I didn't have enough time. Furthermore, when you walk around the place or the town, you may notice good things that you couldn't find in a group tour, for example, the kindness of the people there or delicious foods.

There are two main reasons: their attitude and lack of time.\n\nFirst of all, young people nowadays do not have the attitude or motivation to help out their community because they believe it has no benefit for them. These young people think they do not need to help out their community as they assume others will do it instead, or they simply consider it a waste of time. I believe they do not understand the value of assisting a community in need. Furthermore, young people nowadays are a lot lazier than in the past, and so they lack the motivation as they consider helping the community to be 'work', and as we all know, young people tend to dislike work as it is not enjoyable. This lack of motivation is probably influenced by schoolwork, which is more of a requirement rather than a choice.\n\nSecondly, the fact that the world is becoming more competitive and also a lot more interesting means youngsters are becoming more involved in other activities and their studies rather than contributing to their communities. These young people may have objectives such as attending the best universities or simply enjoying life by relaxing, and in my personal experience, I have never come across a young individual who actually wants to give their time to help their communities. As a result, as young people prefer to spend their time differently, very few feel they should help out their communities.\n\nIn conclusion, as young people are not inclined to help the community because it is not enjoyable and the fact they have better, perhaps more important, things that must be done, young people nowadays do not give enough time nor effort to helping their communities."}
{"file_id": "1105098.txt", "output_essay": "Most people have lost their interest in their communities day by day. People also don't want to involve themselves in helping their communities. So it seems to me that these people that I am accusing of not helping their communities are especially youngsters. However, I can't accuse them directly since the sense of helping people around us should be taught in their early education, such as in elementary schools. Moreover, families should take care of this issue.\n\nThe first point that I would like to make is that if you are willing to help your community, you shouldn't wait to earn money. As a result, young people think that helping other people or participating in some charity organization is a waste of time. However, thinking like that is not their fault; yet their families don't talk with their children about the importance of helping people. Moreover, teachers or school departments don't encourage youngsters to help their communities. For instance, when I was in high school, our teacher encouraged us to go to the house for the elderly. Furthermore, they were bringing us to the forest in order to plant a tree every month. But the school stopped doing these activities because of its cost. In addition, I am convinced that young people can't understand the benefits of helping their communities.\n\nLet us look at another reason why youngsters don't help their communities. I believe that their curriculum in school is so busy. They have to study, and they have to pass their classes. It is apparent that those responsibilities are stressing them out. However, they can help their communities in their spare time. I am convinced that most youngsters spend their time playing video games, chatting on the internet, or showing interest in celebrities' lives. They could take action in some helping organization instead of doing these activities.\n\nTo sum up, I agree that young people don't help their communities as much as they should. But, most importantly, it is not their fault. Someone should teach them the importance of participating in helping their communities, such as their parents and their teachers."}
{"file_id": "1120829.txt", "output_essay": "Teaching, learning, studying: it's all a method! During our school and college years, we have all had the chance to experience many teaching methods through our professors. While some teachers believe that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts, others believe that what matters is learning the facts.\n\nDuring lectures, professors try to pass along a certain idea or concept to their students. Undoubtedly, lectures are too theoretical and not too exciting, but they remain essential. What will the student remember on the day of his exam from his lectures? What is he supposed to remember? I believe that part of making studying an enjoyable experience is understanding the material we are studying. Once we have understood the material, it is imprinted logically in our heads.\n\nUnderstanding a lesson begins with understanding the ideas and concepts, as they form the essence of the material. But to understand the ideas and concepts, especially when it comes to complex ideas and concepts, it seems useful to start by learning the facts.\n\nLearning the facts makes you understand the ideas and concepts more easily.\n\nFor example, if a student wants to understand Einstein's concept of relativity, a revolutionary concept in physics, it would be better to start with the facts. Once the student has understood the facts about the relativity concept, he could be more capable of understanding the concept as a whole.\n\nTherefore, I believe that it is as important to understand ideas and concepts as it is to learn facts: the two being linked to one another, leading to a better understanding of the material."}
{"file_id": "1122810.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.\n\nFor one example, when you think about business, a company has to make new products or explore new techniques to differentiate from other companies. If the company can do this, it can appeal to customers with the uniqueness of their products or services from others and can profit itself monopolistically.\n\nFor another example, when you think about a baseball team, every player should try new things, because we don't need the same type of player so much. It makes no sense to have nine powerful hitters. It makes no sense to have only fast runners. To constitute a strong team, the important point is the balance that can yield the best outcome. So, every player has to acquire skills that are different from others and new.\n\nFor the last example, if you are an investor, it makes no sense to invest like others. If you want to have an advantage, you have to invest differently. Of course, I have to admit it is a risky action. You may incur a loss sometimes. So, you have to recognize that there is a risk in investing differently from others.\n\nFrom these reasons, I conclude that as long as one recognizes the risk of an action, we have to try new things and take risks."}
{"file_id": "1119781.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with the statement that successful people tend to do things that are not familiar to them and take risks. I have several reasons for this.\n\nFirst, challenging new things makes people well-rounded. To take a personal example, when I was a junior high school student, I hated to study liberal subjects like history, art, and music. I had never been to museums or concert halls. However, when I was a university student, I changed my mind and tried to study liberal subjects. Thanks to the change, I became a well-rounded person who can talk to anyone. As the above example illustrates, trying new things makes people well-rounded.\n\nSecond, people can find their best ways when they try new things. For instance, four years ago, I applied for a new project in my company which I did not know how to do well. Although I had been a salesperson for five years, I tried the production field of a computer company. I did well because I knew what the clients wanted from our products. If I had not tried a new field, I would not have succeeded in the job.\n\nTherefore, I definitely agree with the statement that trying new things and taking risks, rather than doing what people know well, makes people successful."}

In the old days in Korea, young people were very helpful. They helped to build houses and fix things, which were dangerous and hard. These tasks were for young people, and they did them without hesitation. However, these days, young people do not care about their communities. Young people nowadays have different attitudes.\n\nAnother reason that I think is that young people are not connected with their communities. In Korea, young people, who are assumed to be students, are very busy studying. They go to school at 7 in the morning and come back at midnight. They have no time to participate in their communities. Whereas, in the old days in Korea, there were more people who were not students, and also schoolwork was not as hard.\n\nLast but not least, some young people want to help their communities. For example, by helping and taking care of elderly people or children. However, I am not sure about other countries, but in Korea, parents usually do not want their children, who are students, to help their communities. The reason is obvious: they want their children to study for their future university rather than caring about their communities.\n\nTaking into account all factors, people are becoming more egoistic, not only young people but also their parents and adults. Anyhow, we may reach the conclusion that the statement is correct."}
{"file_id": "1116877.txt", "output_essay": "I believe most advertisements make products seem better than they really are. This is because the kinds of things shown in advertisements do not take into account real-life conditions. Also, to differentiate products from their competitors, they are hyped for their goodness.\n\nFirstly, advertisements make products seem better than they really are because when an advertisement is made, it does not account for real-life conditions. For example, when an advertisement for a bike is shown, the advertisers do not take into account braking, stopping, or idling of the bike when they show the mileage of the bike, which most of the time never turns out to be actually achievable at all. With the hyped mileage quoted in the advertisement, the product, in this case, the bike, seems to be better than it really is, as it cannot deliver the quoted mileage of the advertisement.\n\nSecondly, companies intentionally make better advertisements for their products than they really are to differentiate their product from the other products available from other companies. By doing this, they try to create branding and a niche for their product, which is very much similar to the other product. Take, for example, laptop companies like Acer and HP, which show the ease of work, graphics display which would not cause eye strain. But in actuality, it does, and is very similar to the other products.\n\nUltimately, advertisements make products seem much better than they really are."}

For example, if all we have to do in our entire business life is just one thing, it is effective to focus on that one thing and learn how to do it well, without trying new things and taking risks.\n\nHowever, in order to succeed, I find more advantages in trying new things and taking risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. By doing so, I can expand my experiences and diversify my skills. Moreover, if I only do what I already know how to do well, my expertise will be too focused and limited.\n\nFirst of all, I hope to expand my experience and diversify my skills by trying new things and taking risks. I am a businessman working at an investment bank and am required to have various skills from my customers in different sectors. Thus, I need many kinds of experience, skills, as well as knowledge to meet the various requirements. I believe that I can enhance my value as an investment banker by obtaining a wide range of experience and skills.\n\nSecond of all, if I only do what I already know how to do well, my expertise will be too focused and limited.

{"file_id": "1120039.txt", "output_essay": "In my opinion, I agree that traveling with a group of people led by a tour guide is the best way to travel. There are several good reasons why I agree with having a tour guide during travel. First of all, when you decide to go to a foreign country that you have never visited, you will face some difficulties and a little bit of fear. All of these troubles that you will face are because of the worry and anxiety for this trip, maybe because you don't have enough required information about that country. So, you need someone to help you with the places, shopping malls, good restaurants, locations of some hotels, and so on. According to these challenges, the best way to avoid these troubles is to travel in a group led by a tour guide who has more information about the country than you do. The second reason why I personally prefer that is because I think it is safer for you and your family. I remember when my family and I traveled to Italy, we encountered some criminals and drug people who we didn't know how to deal with. However, although my father solved this problem, I think if we had a guide with us, it would have been easier for us. The third and last reason is we choose to travel to relax and have a rest away from our work, duties, and responsibilities. Actually, if you want to do that, you should be away from all these troubles that, of course, you will face, such as asking some local people for information about, as I said in the beginning, 'Where can I find this hotel?', 'Where are the recreation centers?', 'What is the best restaurant you have here?' and lots of these dumb questions. You may also not know how to speak their language since you are not a native speaker. In short, personally, I prefer to travel with a tour guide to avoid all of these headaches."}
{"file_id": "1116768.txt", "output_essay": "I agree that most advertisements make products appear much better than they really are, as I buy only the products that I have seen in TV ads.\n\nWhen a product is new to the market, it has to be advertised. If the product is launched without ads, no one knows what it is, and they don't buy it either. Advertisements are given for products and released into the market so at least people recognize it. It may be bought by some people, and if it is good, they will use it regularly.\n\nAll the popular brands in the world invest one quarter of their money in ads. This shows how important it is for a product to be launched. Advertisements are not a new idea; they have been practiced since ancient times. In ancient times, ads were in the form of carvings in stone.\n\nTo know whether the product is a good one or not, one can only say after using it. Even though a lot of campaigns are done for products, if it is not worthy, the result will be that no one can afford to buy it. The product itself must have substance; otherwise, no ads can promote its sale. For example, my father bought a Daewoo Motors Matiz car after seeing the ads, but later it had a lot of faults. Then my father told his colleagues not to buy that one. The feedback for that company was not good. As a result, it flopped in India.\n\nNowadays, advertising is one of the biggest markets in the world. All products hire celebrities to be their brand ambassadors. Kids are influenced by it; if their favorite star advertises for it, they will want to buy it. Every field requires ads to promote its product. For example, movie stars campaign before the premiere to promote their movies, similarly, models are launched for popular brands of cars, inaugurations of malls, etc. These create hype for their product, to the extent that some people talk about their product. Thus, it shows that their product reaches the people.\n\nWhether the product is a good one or not can only be said after using it. All the above reasons show that one can buy only when they know about the product, and this can be done through advertisements."}
{"file_id": "1117740.txt", "output_essay": "Someone might say that young people enjoy life more than older people do. I personally agree with this statement. I know that there are many examples that seem to prove the contrary, but I think that they are absolutely not the norm. A young person is far more athletic and healthy than an older one. And, a thing not to undervalue, they have fewer responsibilities. When you get rid of all the things you have to worry about, life becomes instantaneously more enjoyable. So, fewer responsibilities, fewer things to worry about. Another reason is obviously the athletic state of the body. At a certain age, there are just a lot of movements you have difficulties doing, so even a simple action like, for example, riding a bike or running becomes hard to do.\n\nAnd when you cannot do such basic movements, you cannot accomplish more complicated tasks. Health is another important factor. Who enjoys going to the pharmacy or, worse, to the hospital? Older people have to take care of their body continuously, maybe taking pills or other medical treatments of some sort. And when you are not at that point, you know that sooner or later you will.\n\nBut the body is nothing without the mind. It's scientifically proven that at a certain age, the mental abilities of an individual start to decrease dramatically. This has consequences on the whole body's activity, but let's just concentrate on the mind aspect. Even those activities which don't involve physical activity are precluded.\n\nA chess match, crosswords, and any other kind of that stuff. These problems listed here are all problems that a normal person wouldn't have if he or she is young. So the conclusions are that when you are in the middle of your youth (and don't have any serious problems of other sorts), you have all the doors open, and these doors keep closing as the years pass by."}

Even though people all over the world are now considering the environment, and oil is depleting, I remain skeptical.\n\nI am aware that there have been some agreements regarding the emissions produced by cars. Cars are very detrimental to the environment because they run on gas, which pollutes the Earth's air. Many countries have promised to reduce the emissions from cars in recent days. My country, Japan, has also made this commitment, and we are trying to implement this plan. However, I have never seen this be successful, and people who use cars do not seem to care about it at all.\n\nI have also heard that we are not going to extract oil indefinitely. Currently, most cars in the world run on oil. Indeed, there are electric cars, but they are impractical to use because it takes time to charge them, so we still use cars that run on oil. I believe that there will still be some oil available in twenty years.\n\nCars are absolutely useful. We can go anywhere at any time by car. People living in metropolises might not need cars, but those in rural areas must use cars to live. They reside far from grocery stores, malls, and their places of work. Needless to say, we need individual cars. We cannot rely on public transportation systems such as buses and trains because they may not be faster than using our own vehicles. In addition, most of us will continue to use individual cars.\n\nI think that there are no viable alternatives to reduce car usage because we do not care about the environment; we care only about ourselves. Electric cars are not practical, and I do not think they will become practical soon. In reality, people really need cars."}

I don't think so. I think successful people are the ones who are the top in their field. If he or she can do one thing best, he or she will be a successful person. From this point of view, successful people do not always have to try new things and take risks.\n\nWe see someone who does something new and succeeds, so we say successful people \"always\" try new things and take risks. I think it's too abrupt. We say that because we only see the successful ones. We have little chance to see the failed ones. Trying new things and taking risks also means a high possibility of failure. Therefore, many people prefer to spend their time on what is already known and they work hard so that they can outperform their rivals.\n\nAlso, only the \"try\" is not enough. We have to spend more time and energy to improve the innovation. And the improvement part is more annoying and complicated. If he or she is one who is only willing to spend their time to find or invent something new, but too lazy to improve it, he or she will not succeed. On the other hand, if there is one who is willing to work hard to find ways to improve, one is more likely to succeed than the original inventor or finder.\n\nTake Japan for example. The Americans invented cars, but they didn't spend time to improve cars. And the Japanese spent a lot of time and money to improve cars. Now, Japan has become the biggest country producing cars.\n\nTherefore, I think the key point of success is not trying new things, but being willing to work hard or not."}

The product is always displayed in a way where it seems appealing to the viewer. Sometimes the company advertising the product tends to exaggerate in advertising. They make the product seem too good to be real. Each advertisement is there to target a certain age group. For example, when advertising a toy on the television, certain sound effects and bright colors are used to attract young children, making them desire the product. Therefore, the parents take action and buy the toy for their child. Advertising is the best way to manipulate young children's minds.\n\nAdvertisements do not include the disadvantages of the product advertised. The product is always praised and made to appear flawless. The company advertising a certain good's main aim is profit. Quality and customer service are the last things considered. It is rare that you find an advertised product that is trustworthy and is exactly like it was described in the advertisement.\n\nIn conclusion, I would like to say that the problem we are facing nowadays is that we are letting those false advertisements affect us, but there is nothing we can do about it as they are everywhere.

It is also the art of convincing consumers to buy the product. Consumers who are not wise enough or who are too influenceable buy products because of the advertisements.\n\nFirst of all, I would say advertisement companies tend to have a lot of money, so they can make beautiful, attractive advertisements. They have many means to attract the consumer. TV advertisements are the easiest way to convince a consumer to buy your product, whereas written advertisements in newspapers, for example, are less convincing because they are not interactive. On TV ads, you can see people use, eat the product the company is selling. They reach the consumer more easily.\n\nSecond of all, advertisements are made to make products seem better than they are in real life. It is an art. For example, when you see an advertisement for a frozen pizza, the pizza always looks hot, savory. Usually, you can see the cheese melt, whereas when you buy it and heat it up, it is nothing compared to that advertisement; it is a normal frozen pizza, not a homemade one.\n\nThird of all, advertisement is a lure for consumers. People do not buy a product for its consistency but for the way it looks in the ad. Sometimes ads tend to lie about the qualities of the product, for example, toothpaste that makes your teeth white as snow, or a soap which eliminates all the imperfections of teenage skin.\n\nTo conclude, I would say advertisements make products seem much better than they really are because it is one of the goals of advertisement, the first one being to sell a product. But to sell a product in huge quantities, you have to make it special, better than the others, attractive, or even emphasize the results of this product."}

There are a lot of ways for traveling, and I believe that the best way is to travel with a group led by a tour guide because when you go to a new country, you will need someone to guide you around.

The guide will have a plan to show you everything in the city, so you won't miss a thing, and also, if you needed help, he can assist you. Or if you don't speak the language of that country, he can help you with that too. For example, if you were in Paris and you don't speak French, what could you do if you were alone? At that time, a guide would help you a lot, and to be with a group is so much more fun than being alone. That's where you can meet new people, make new friends, and enjoy your time, and it's also much cheaper to travel with a group rather than traveling alone, so it would save you a lot of money too.

When I was in college, I saw a man who had met with an accident lying on the road with blood flowing; none of them showed any concern to take him to the hospital... as they were busy tied up with their own works and that they could not spend a little time for that old man, because of which we all had to see him dead on the road. I think such things should not be repeated. Every person should be involved in the community, helping the community in one way or another as much as he can. This shows his concern for the people and helping nature.\n\nRight from the start, they should be taught about morals and about society, patriotic people. One who learns morals never tries to neglect his society. And every person should take their time in helping the communities.\n\nI have seen many older people who do a lot for the community. In the place where I live, we don't have medical services for us, for which our area people, who were all 55 years old, grouped together and made a request to the area head that we are in need of a hospital which can help us in odd times for children and people living in this area.

Such issues are becoming a serious concern to our world. Yet every problem must have a solution, and Earth has a trait that when a human creates a problem, eventually he will find a solution. Yet that solution would cause another problem.\n\nI personally agree with the statement since certain protocols are already being implemented in order to deal with such a problem. Mass transit has been extremely subsidized, and an incentive to carpool is being stressed upon. Subway rails, trains, and monorails are being created in order to draw away all the individuals found on the roads. In twenty years there will definitely be fewer cars than what is present today, since individuals would no longer depend on a biased form of transport. Certain cities in our world today can prove how mass transit is an effective way of reducing the number of cars.\n\nLondon, England is a perfect example to be used as a city that uses all its transportation methods and incentives to the max. A person who lives in London does not necessarily need to be stuck in rush hour when he is tired from work and just wants to go home. Such an individual can just enter the tube station and ride the subway to the nearest station to his residence. This type of transportation, when people began to adapt to it, greatly affected the roads of London, as year by year the streets began to clear up. Countries will probably follow the footsteps of London in the near future.\n\nTokyo, Japan is another example of a country that enforces mass transit; however, it is poorly executed. Underground stations are present within the city, yet the transit system does not support such a massive amount of individuals. Such a situation might solve the problem of fewer cars on the road, but it causes the problem of more people crowded at underground stations.\n\nThe examples presented support the theory behind this argument, which is yes, there will be fewer cars in twenty years than there are today; however, that does not solve the main problem. Cars on their own do not cause a crowding effect; people driving the cars cause the crowding effect. When mass transits are used efficiently, then that certain amount of individuals will be evenly distributed among different routes of transport. Yet if mass transit is provoked, then that mass of individuals would just yield to another route, transferring the same problem from point A to point B. Fewer cars will be present in twenty years, but it's up to each individual country to distribute the main problem."}

Facts have a tendency, but all ideas and concepts differ from each other, created by the people who conceived them. Second, learning is easy, but understanding is difficult. Students should study hard and not take the easy route. Finally, if students understand ideas and concepts, they can apply their knowledge to their life in the future. Merely learning facts is not useful. Therefore, I think that students should make a significant effort to understand ideas and concepts, not just to learn facts."}
{"file_id": "1122260.txt", "output_essay": "I think that it is a common opinion that young people enjoy life more than older people do. In my opinion, this is not so far from the real situation, but it can depend on what you mean by 'enjoy.' There are many different aspects to this statement, so I think that it is difficult to give a unique and clear opinion.\n\nFor instance, if you like to play football, you will probably not enjoy yourself if you are an old man. A young boy is more powerful and he can play for a long period of time, while an old man will probably lose his energy in a few minutes, not so much time for a good and amusing match.\n\nOn the contrary, if you like to play your guitar, your age will not be a real problem. Whether you are ten years old or seventy years old, you can enjoy yourself as you want.\n\nMaybe we can say that a young boy may have less problematic thoughts than an older person, so his innocence can allow him the possibility of enjoying his life much more.\n\nFor example, an adult man has many more things to do than his son. He may have no free time, so the young child can do anything he wants to enjoy himself, while his father has a life full of problems, so he cannot enjoy life as his child does.\n\nThere is another aspect in this discussion that is of relevant importance. Older people are often wealthier than young people. So they can do anything they want because they have much more money. For example, if you are a twenty-year-old boy and you like yachting, you may have some problems buying a yacht. Maybe you will buy it in your adulthood.\n\nIn the end, I think that the fundamental aspect of the topic is the possibility of being sick when you become an old man. This is a big problem and makes me think that if you are a young person, you will enjoy your life much more."}
{"file_id": "1120555.txt", "output_essay": "In today's world, nearly every product offered to consumers is being marketed with advertisements. These advertisements introduce the product to its buyers and demand that they buy it. Although this advertising is good in terms of marketing and introducing new products, it is also clear that these advertisements could result in wrong, overrated assumptions about the product in question because of three major reasons: the fact that the advertisement is a marketing technique, the varying expectations of people, and the influence of professional techniques on our emotions.\n\nFirstly, the definition of today's advertising is 'making people want something'; the introducing part of the advertising is being ignored. For instance, advertisements are prepared by marketing departments to sell more and more to make profits, not just to declare that the product is made. The increasing number of advertisement offices and the money in this job also indicate that everything about advertisement is about making more money. Because of these factors, the happiness of the consumer is usually being ignored.\n\nSecondly, people often expect different things from a product; one may want durability while another may want a more reasonable price, but an advertisement should be prepared for every potential buyer. Plus, a negative feature which people may want to know would not be emphasized because of this thinking. This, again, would result in the disappointment of the buyer.\n\nThe third thing that would make buyers uncomfortable is the fact that advertising has been used for a long time and there have been clear ways to make you buy things. For example, when I see a person who drinks or eats something, I immediately feel a bit thirsty or hungry because my mind thinks of an opportunity to eat something. This fact will affect me to buy the stuff which is being advertised, but probably I would be disappointed because I would have bought the thing without thinking.\n\nAdvertising has become a great part of the production and marketing of new goods; every company is using it for nearly every good it produces. It is clear that this makes people buy things; otherwise, profit-centered companies wouldn't use them. But making people buy something directly increases the expectations and therefore, as people expect more from the thing which they buy, they become more disappointed."}

I believe people who do good work should be recognized for it and achieve success in their career, even if they don't do anything new. I know a small shop where the man repairs shoes and bags. The man does very good work at a very reasonable price. It is nothing special, but the quality of his work is known in the town, and he always has clients. However, the man is neither very rich nor very famous. If this is the kind of success one targets, then I think the person must absolutely try new things and take risks to distinguish themselves from other people. Among the people we remember the most are the inventors and discoverers. They often try a lot of things before making the invention that made them famous."}
{"file_id": "1118709.txt", "output_essay": "In these days, colleges offer many programs for students. Each student has a different opinion about having broad knowledge of many academic subjects rather than specializing in one specific subject. Personally, I think specializing in one specific subject can lead to much achievement for the goal.\n\nFirstly, if you learn about many academic subjects, you cannot learn deeply. For instance, when I was a high school student, I learned a lot of things during the three years. I could not concentrate on one subject because there were too many topics, so I could not find how each subject was related. Therefore, it does not help me to learn many subjects, so I prefer to learn just one subject. It can be more concentrated for me.\n\nSecondly, in these days, we have specialized persons for each division part. When you know broad things and do not know specifics about your subject, you cannot do anything in our society. Many people do their best in their own subject and they become special persons who know really well about their own department. If you concentrate on just one subject and learn lots of things, you can help people who want to need you. However, if you learned lots of subjects, you did not get specific lessons from those subjects.\n\nLastly, we do not have lots of time to learn everything during life. We have lots of subjects around us and if you choose one subject you should concentrate on that because we do not have much time to learn even one subject too. For example, I am a nursing student, so I always think about patient care and learn lots of things for patients. I do not have much time to learn lots of subjects because I am not perfect in learning an entire subject. One subject has lots of things, so I decided to learn only one thing. When I am all in nursing, I can improve my care skills. Therefore, I will be a better nurse when I graduate. I think concentrating on one subject can make one more specialized in their own position.\n\nTo conclude, there are many subjects in our life. Everyone wants to learn everything, but we cannot learn everything because each subject has lots of material. In my opinion, learning to specialize in one specific subject is better than having broad knowledge of many academic subjects because if you concentrate on just one subject, you can learn lots of things deeply."}

Young people generally have great verve and energy, whereas older people cannot enjoy life with such an attitude. Young people normally enjoy their lives while doing their mundane jobs, but older people tend to create unwanted stress around them. Health is wealth. If you are fit and fine, then only can you live your life in the most hilarious manner. However, old people are often surrounded by ailments pertinent to age, which restrict their enjoyment.\n\nI have great respect for my grand aunt, who is an inhabitant of our street. I have been watching her since I was in 5th grade. She was very active and alert at that time. She had a little problem because of diabetes, but she had overcome any kind of stress and problems at that time. Now, the conditions have changed. Most of the time, she is not even able to walk properly. She is suffering from ailments that are very painful. Whenever I see her, I can easily understand the value of young life. Young people readily overcome most ailments because of the proper physiological function of their bodies.\n\nAnother factor that makes old people lethargic towards life is pessimism. Old people often prefer not to work after the age of 55 or 60, which causes them to become sluggish and prone to various dreadful diseases. Young people are always ambitious about their careers and goals, which motivates them to enjoy life rather than to take it as a burden.\n\nYoung people prefer to socialize and make friends with whom they can go to dance bars, hotels, etc. Old people like loneliness. My grand aunt previously was fond of parties and get-togethers. But now, she disdains such crowds and prefers to live in disgruntled conditions. Young people emancipate themselves from all kinds of bondages and live life with a vivacious attitude. In short, the normal functioning of the body and the optimistic attitude of young people enable them to enjoy their lives."}
{"file_id": "1121638.txt", "output_essay": "During almost 18 years, I have studied many courses and I know the best way to learn. So what I am sure about is this: the idea is more important to understand than the facts. I will explain this in two general parts: the first part will be about the idea that a fact is one example of the idea, and the second one will deal with the fact that we can understand an idea more easily than a fact.\n\nFirst, it is obvious that the idea is the most important thing to understand because the facts are just some cases of the main idea. Usually, during classes, teachers try to explain an example which permits us to understand the idea. For example, to better understand the idea that people are calm when they listen to music, it's useful to give the example that in many medical rooms, we can hear some classical or jazz music. But this is not the main point expected to be learned. Thus, this is something we can use to better understand something else.\n\nWhen we try to make our own opinion, we use the ideas memorized to think. In this important case, we can see why it is so much more important to learn the ideas than the facts. If we continue with our previous example, what do we think about the importance of music in the world? To answer, we could select the idea that music calms people and we could use it to conclude that without music, there might be more wars in the world, and so, most of the population of the Earth would be sad. It is in this way that I see the importance of ideas.\n\nAs I proved in this response, to better learn, we have to concentrate more on the ideas than on the facts. But the facts are needed to understand the ideas. So, in the perfect case, we would care about ideas as well as facts."}

They are always running towards their goal. Successful people are different from other people. Maybe their environment is not as good as that of others, and the situation is not favorable. They have to spend time to achieve their goal. They have to read and read books and acquire lots of knowledge. They can learn from other people's experiences. Other people's experiences encourage them to try new things despite the risks. Also, other people's experiences provide new opportunities to try new things.

{"file_id": "1126329.txt", "output_essay": "I agree because advertisements often exaggerate the efficiency or quality of a product, sounding like a salesman in a shop. The marketing of many brands is so aggressive because they want to compete with others and show how their brand is better. An example of this is the Walt Disney Company. Over the years, we have seen many commercial announcements on television, the internet, movies, and in mailing letters. They bombard us with these promotions repeatedly, selling a 'dream that may come true.' However, this is not true when you decide to start a vacation at Walt Disney; they don't tell you about the long lines in the sun waiting for attractions or waiting to eat in restaurants. This is a huge mistake when advertisements capture our attention and become more attractive than reality. This is an example of how people are enchanted by some advertisements, only to find a different reality when they arrive at 'Walt Disney.' Other advertisements, like those for food or diets, show specific people achieving their goals when entering a plan, but the reality is different. They never tell you the cost when you become interested in that program. The reality is they manipulate statistics, sell dreams, and steal money from customers who fail to achieve those goals. In my opinion, people need to be wiser when they are attracted and impressed by an advertisement, just because it wants your money, not the satisfaction or fulfillment of your needs. That's why it's called marketing."}
{"file_id": "1077659.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. I believe that a lack of altruistic and selfless acts is directly spurred by economic and social reasons.\n\nIn today's world, many youths do not see a valid social reason to immerse themselves in community service. Although the majority of the world's population lives in abject poverty, those who are capable of giving to their communities are often segregated from those who are in need. Hence, the lack of awareness prevents today's youth from helping out.\n\nSpeaking from personal experience, I find that there is a gradual decline in my own community of youths who refuse to give or help out their communities in any manner. As the president of Key Club, an international community service organization at my high school, I find it increasingly difficult every year to recruit new members to replace the ones that have departed. I remember when there were about 40 members in the group - now, I find that it is even difficult to gather 20 members for the meetings. The only sense of giving that can be felt in my school's atmosphere is purely caused by the need to 'look good' on transcripts for college. Of course, I'm sure not all of them feel this way, but I truly think it's safe to say that the majority feels this way.\n\nEvery year, monetary donations rise in Key Club as the number of members declines. This is an economic reason why I believe that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. Inevitably, most of us in the world have been brought up to be capitalists - when we give, we expect something back in return. However, when youths help out with their communities, they do not receive something tangible as rewards. Hence, today's youth neglects to help their communities. Due to this fact, those who can help and give find it extremely annoying to invest their time in helping others. Thus, their only token of help is through monetary means, which they believe is compensation for not giving time to their communities. Nonetheless, society's greed can even prevent the giving of money.\n\nIt's truly a shame to look around and see that today's youth, or tomorrow's leaders, refuse to invest their time when they are perfectly capable of doing so. It is time that society creates more awareness in young people to be willing to invest their time for others. Once youths overcome their laziness, fear of helping out, and learn that the greatest reward (as clichéd as it may sound) is the fuzzy feeling they get from giving time and helping others, it will be a massive stepping stone in getting the world's youth more involved."}
{"file_id": "1127909.txt", "output_essay": "I agree that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are for several reasons.\nFirst, and most importantly, advertisements are designed to sell products, so they only highlight the advantages of the products. They never mention the disadvantages or the side effects, leading people to see only the positive aspects of the product and, consequently, to purchase it.\nSecond, when products are developed by more than one company, competition arises. Of course, since advertisements play a significant role in the sales process, these companies try to make their products look better than their competitors'. They may start to claim minor advantages that don't actually exist in order to win the competition. Although reputable companies wouldn't typically do this, as it could affect their reputation, it sometimes happens.\nThird, companies will not invest in advertising their products unless they are confident that it will yield more profits. If the advertisement doesn't align the product with the customers' needs, the companies won't advertise it.\nThe last point is that the art of advertising is based on the concept of making a product look much better than it actually is. Take, for example, film and game trailers. They are always crafted in such a way that people are enticed to watch the film or play the game after seeing the trailer. However, when they actually watch the film or buy the game, they often find it does not meet their expectations."}

I believe it is more preferable to first have vast knowledge.\n\nFirst, knowledge is good for my children. If I have more knowledge, I will be able to educate my children better. My father used to teach me things that I did not learn at school. For example, my school did not teach why water is formed around a glass of cold water. I was always curious about it, and it was my father who told me the answer. As my father taught me, I want to do the same for my children.\n\nIn addition, the chances of getting a job increase. Let's say that I took geometry, biology, and psychology in college. Although I did not specialize in one subject, I still have a lot of information in each subject. I can be a math teacher, a worker in a biological museum, or a guidance counselor at a middle school. What will happen if I specialized only in geometry? Once I cannot be a geometry teacher, I will have nothing to do but just wait.\n\nFinally, I can pick a subject and specialize in it later. I will experience and evaluate the subjects while I learn many subjects. After the education, I will have a pretty good idea of which subjects fit my interests. Using the same example as before, let's assume that I became very interested in biology. People say there is no end to learning; I will not hesitate to take biology again and go deeper into it.\n\nIn conclusion, I think learning a variety of subjects is important because it allows me to teach my children, get a job, and specialize in a subject that is suitable for me."}
{"file_id": "1105165.txt", "output_essay": "In modern capitalist society, advertisements are a natural part of life. In this situation, I believe that it is all but inevitable that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.\n\nThe fundamental reason is that modern consumerism has made it necessary for companies to advertise their products simply because there are more goods than are necessary. Before the advent of mass production and mass consumption, the situation was vice versa: there were probably fewer goods than necessary. Naturally, therefore, producers did not need to advertise at all. But in today's society, because of the tremendous advance of technology, it is possible to churn out unnecessary commodities produced mainly, or perhaps only, to gain profits by selling them. As a result, producers are forced to make their products look much better than they really are so that they will be able to sell them.\n\nAnother significant reason why advertisers exaggerate the value of their products is people's expectation to have newer and 'better' things. In order to keep up with these consumers' demand, companies are compelled not only to make new, slightly upgraded products all the time but also to make the small improvement seem impressive. The case in point is the computer industry. PC makers change their models three or four times a year even though the improvement is minor. Because people expect this and because all the other competitors do so, a PC maker cannot afford to continue to sell a PC first put on the market a year ago. As a result, it is necessary for PC makers to make their products look significantly better than their previous models by, for example, changing their looks although the content is not much different.\n\nIn conclusion, I agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are for two reasons. Modern consumerism has made it necessary, and as a result, people are accustomed to having 'better' products, which forces producers to exaggerate minor improvements. It would be impossible to change this situation, and, therefore, consumers need to be wise enough not to be deceived by advertisements."}
{"file_id": "1110971.txt", "output_essay": "For my part, I disagree with the idea that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. This goes back to a variety of reasons. Primarily, cars today are indispensable for a lot of people to go to work. Secondly, cars are more than that; their use is comfortable. What also matters a lot is the lack of an alternative. And there are no factors foreseen, which could change the need for cars during the next twenty years.\n\nFirst of all, cars are necessary for many people to reach their place of work. Both of my parents can only get to work by car since the routes are too individual and partly too wide to make use of public transportation.\n\nIf you consider big cities, you cannot always make use of public transportation. Especially in smaller cities, where public transportation may only exist on a small scale or does not exist at all, and taking a bike is not possible either, you really need a car.\n\nFurthermore, I cannot see any reason why this state of being should change during the next twenty years.\n\nThere will be no doubt. Having a car to get from one place to another is - with few exceptions - the fastest and therefore most comfortable way. Since people desire to gain all amenities possible, they will not give them up voluntarily.\n\nEveryone who has once had the comfort of owning a car appreciates it. So I can see no reason in the future why this would change, either.\n\nLastly, we lack an alternative. There is no more convenient way to travel, and there are so many jobs in the car business. A decrease in consumption would help to kill many thousand jobs. Worldwide, car-producing industries hold so many jobs. Their falling apart would be fatal. Furthermore, the world has a very strong lobby concerning the oil business, which will be interested in a further need and consumption of their oil.\n\nHere, another job-giving area exists that many people depend on. I cannot see that the influence of politicians might change that.\n\nStill, a lot of cars are sold and, in my opinion, will be sold. World population does decrease in the industrial states slightly, but it will not have the effect that fewer cars will be in use in twenty years.\n\nConsidering the facts, it may be a good thing if there were fewer cars, for this would help our environment get healthier again. Even so, the need and lack of alternatives will not change the amount of cars during the next twenty years."}

I mean that we are all capable of inventing something that will make us wealthy. So, I do agree with this statement because being successful is only the last thing you get when you try new things.\n\nWhen you try new things, you do it because you think that what you are doing is worth the energy you are spending on it. You are ready to do whatever it takes to accomplish what you began. You are over-motivated, and that's why you succeed in your attempt. This motivation shows your ambition, and that's how you are going to make it. For example, the film 'Beatrix Potter' shows why she became famous; it's because she knew her idea was good and she had enough motivation to face refusals and to be disapproved by her father.\n\nAnd once you have succeeded, you always want to have this feeling again. The feeling that nothing can stop you, like Leonardo DiCaprio in 'Titanic', you think you are the king of the world. If you try something new or to invent something, it is because you don't like to always do the same thing, even if you can do it very well. It is a lot more exciting to invent something, to think day and night about how you can develop an idea and make it real.\n\nFinally, you try new things because it makes you successful. You don't like to be like everyone else; you want to be apart from the others. And even if you are doing something very well, you have to try new things or a new way to do it because it will show that you don't rely solely on your knowledge. It will show that you really want to improve yourself. Mozart is considered a genius not only because he knew how to play an instrument at a very young age but also because he created symphonies when he was very young.\n\nIn conclusion, I would say that everyone should try new things; it is not interesting to rely on what someone else created for us. We have to try something new as well."}
{"file_id": "1121216.txt", "output_essay": "I agree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. I believe in this because I think the idea and the concept of anything is more important than the fact, especially in some subjects like technology, philosophy, mathematics, because here you have to analyze the fact using the ideas and the concepts. So, the ideas and the concepts are important to understand and analyze the fact itself.\n\nFirst, most of the subjects that we are studying in school are based on facts, but our understanding of these subjects will not be complete if we don't know the concepts and the ideas about these facts. For instance, if we are studying a course about the structure of the airplane, here we are studying the fact of the airplane, but if we also study the idea of why we are using this material or putting this thing in this place, this will give us a wider view about the mechanism of how we could make the airplane fly in the most perfect and efficient way. For example, we use aluminum instead of iron to make the skeleton of the airplane because it is lighter. This is an important concept we should know about the structure of an airplane.\n\nSecond, the idea and the concept are more important than the fact in analyzing mathematical problems. If we want to solve any problem, we have to know the idea and the concept of this problem. If we only know the fact, we will never reach the solution because in mathematics we depend on the facts as well as on the ideas and the concepts to analyze these facts.\n\nFinally, concepts and ideas are important in our life philosophy. The philosophy of life is dependent on facts, but we need to understand the concept of these facts. For example, there is a fact in our life that everyone should get married, but we have to understand the concepts and the ideas of marriage. Here the concept is more important because we should get married not just because it is a natural desire but because the human being is a social animal and must live with a partner and have children in order to be happy."}

But whether to follow a group led by a tour guide remains a controversial question for travelers at the planning stage of the tour. In my opinion, the best way to travel has little to do with following a large group.\n\nPeople tend to rely on a group and stick to it for security, consensus, or whatever they need, but when it comes to traveling, things might fall on the opposite side. The assertion of unity means the denial of freedom, especially true when, with the guidance of a tour guide, one cannot indulge himself in the freedom of choosing which travel sites to visit or what time to start, and there is a greater chance that the true meaning of traveling, relaxation being my definition, might be marred by arguments and complaints.\n\nSome people would contradict my point by saying that a tour guide offers valuable and well-informed suggestions that would make for a better trip. But isn't there enough news of tourists being cheated or exploited for the sake of tour guides' benefits? By saying this, I am not suggesting that tourists are more skilled at avoiding tricks when traveling by themselves, nor am I judging the moral standards of all tour guides; it's just that isn't it even sadder to be fooled when certain investment and trust have already been placed on the tour guide?\n\nIn addition, traveling fulfills different purposes for different people. Some want to escape the hustle and bustle of the city, some wish to explore the unknown world, some aspire to adventure through exciting places, and none of these seem attainable by following the lead of a tour guide whose job is to keep everyone in sight and under control.\n\nGood or bad, there is no absolute truth; however, we always have the right to chase what we want when traveling."}
{"file_id": "1123424.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with the fact that most advertisements (ads) make products seem much better than they actually are. In my opinion, many times ads fail to meet the expectations created when you finally get or check what was advertised. Ads often have very little to do with reality for several reasons, which I will discuss from my point of view.\n\nFirst of all, the current tough competition for almost every product in the economy compels companies to exaggerate the benefits or characteristics of their products. Every company presents their products in ads as the best and far superior to those made by competitors. When I was a child, I often got disappointed with most of the toys I received as gifts for birthdays; those toys seemed to be much larger on TV than in my hands.\n\nAnother point has to do with quality. Many times, the quality you receive is much worse than what is offered or suggested in ads. For example, the sports shoes never last as long as I expect from the ads I see and the price I pay for them.\n\nMoreover, another issue is the customer service or service given to a customer once he or she has bought something. In ads, most companies focus on their quality and responsibility. Unfortunately, most of the time, you cannot easily get a satisfactory response to a question or complaint raised. I have had bad experiences with the call centers of telecom companies, wasting a lot of time and money on useless complaints.\n\nAnother trick used by ads is the way those ads are shown. Normally on TV, you can see gorgeous people or aggressive music, so you rather pay attention to the person or music announcing the item than the announced item itself. This is linked to when famous people such as actors, actresses, filmmakers, sportsmen, or sportswomen are used in ads.\n\nTo sum up, I do not believe what is shown in ads since they make the products more attractive than they really are.

Some people might recommend traveling alone at least once in order to have time alone to sort out their thoughts and relieve stress by having peace away from their heavy load of tasks. However, I firmly believe that going on a trip alone is not the best way to travel because there are many dangerous vacation spots and it is time-consuming.\n\nFirst of all, traveling in a group of people with a tour guide is much safer. It is the tour guide who is well-informed about the vacation spots based on their previous experience and living in the place for a long time. We not only obtain accurate information about places we should not go but also are protected as members of a group by moving with many people. Therefore, traveling with a group of people led by a tour guide allows people not to face unexpected situations including losing their money to robberies, meeting gangsters, and losing their way. For example, when I traveled to Hong Kong alone two years ago, I went in the opposite direction to the park that I had planned to go to. I could not speak Chinese, so I could not ask anything of the people around me. I felt scared and cried all day long.\n\nIn addition, traveling with a tour guide in a group is much more time-saving. This is because people do not have to make a schedule by researching information about famous places, combing through all the books, and calling all the hotels to reserve. People just follow the guided directions without worrying about checking the transportation schedule or whether the hotel reservation is available. Without worrying about those things, people can spend more enjoyable time with a group of people by talking about their feelings and sharing impressions with each other. To demonstrate, according to research conducted by the Labor Department of Korea in 2007, 75% of people felt their trip was more memorable and enjoyable when they traveled with a group of people and a tour guide. In addition, they answered that the reason why they felt happy with the trip is that they did not have to worry about gathering information for the trip.\n\nFor these reasons, traveling with a group of people is more advantageous to make their trip more fun because of the time saved and the feeling of safety. I believe that people should take these things into account before they go on a trip alone."}
{"file_id": "1122215.txt", "output_essay": "Our topic is about the best way to travel, which I believe is in a group led by a tour guide. I strongly agree with this notion, as it has advantages over traveling without a guide. First, let's discuss traveling without a guide.\n\nAs everyone is interested in going to new places according to their knowledge, they want to know each and every thing present there. Before going, everyone will do research about that place, but the information we get is very little compared to what we encounter. Sometimes it misses out on good places surrounding it. No one is ready to explain the history or the culture of that place, nor how it came to be important. All this information is known to the people who live there or those who visit often.\n\nNow, let's consider travel with a guide, as they have the best information. I will give my personal experience to highlight the advantages of traveling with a guide. During my college days, we went to the northern part of India, which included a few places. When we went to the Taj Mahal, we found the most beautiful monument ever built. The guide explained when it was built, who started it, the cultures followed at that time, and some important things he told us. After listening to his lecture about the Taj Mahal, we realized we had very little information about it. We were very excited about the information; it really felt like we were viewing the construction and art.\n\nWe thought the Taj Mahal was the only place to visit, but the guide showed us another beautiful monument just away from the Taj Mahal. We didn't know about that before; it was also a good piece. After that, we faced some problems regarding our trip, like the lack of enough time. In that time, our guide was so helpful; he planned our timings accordingly so that we didn't miss a single location. As the guide was a local guy, he provided good food too.\n\nThroughout the journey we made with the guide, it was very interesting and very helpful. After the tour, we heard and learned good things like historical information about the places, etc.\n\nFinally, my conclusion is that it's not possible to know the things that really happened at historical places just by reading or listening about those places. So, taking a guide is really helpful and informative. That way, we can get more information than when we travel without a guide."}

However, in my opinion, older people enjoy life more than young ones for several reasons, so I disagree with this statement.\n\nFirst, older people have a wealth of experience in life, so they know exactly how to enjoy it. In contrast, young people don't have enough experience.\n\nFor example, a young person might try to enjoy something which is harmful without knowing it, and after some time, they could injure themselves. An older individual, however, may have had experience with that thing and will not try it again.\n\nSecond, even though young people have a lot of choices for enjoyment, at the same time, they have several things to worry about. For example, their jobs, their businesses, their families, their health, and other aspects of life now require attention and concern.\n\nOn the other hand, older people don't have anything to worry about except their health.\n\nFor instance, a young person might go to the gym to enjoy themselves, and while exercising, they remember something that makes them leave the gym and lose that time of enjoyment. But an older person will not care about anything other than their enjoyment and health.\n\nFinally, everyone has their own way of enjoying life."}

Usually, these ideas and concepts are derived from the experiments of scientists before being converted into facts. Most of the theoretical and practical sciences are based upon ideas and concepts. The origin of most innovations in the world was concepts or ideas. I also agree that students must learn facts, which are generally true, in contrast to ideas and concepts, which may be true or false.

{"file_id": "1127395.txt", "output_essay": "Humans have created this sense of going out of home called traveling. Traveling is a very fun option for you to take. However, it is not always the way you want it to be. On the one hand, you have the opportunity to travel in a group with a tour guide or in a group but without a tour guide. With this in mind, I personally prefer to travel in a group with a tour guide because you have the opportunity to learn more and also because your schedule is done.\n\nThe first reason I prefer to travel in a group led by a tour guide is that I can learn better about the other culture. You have a guide giving you and telling you lots of information about the new place you are visiting. For instance, if you decide to travel to South Africa, you would not only understand even a word but also would not learn anything about this new country, completely different from yours.\n\nThe other reason I prefer traveling with a tour guide is that the schedule is already programmed by my tour guide. I would not have any minute to waste time. I would take advantage of it at every single opportunity. In fact, if you traveled without a tour guide, you might not be able to wake up at seven in the morning. A few years ago, I went to Cuzco in Peru and I did not contact a tour guide. I did not learn anything about that incredible monument; you cannot imagine how much I regret it now. It was a waste of time traveling there without a tour guide.\n\nTherefore, whether you choose to travel in a group or by yourself, try to be led by a tour guide and always try to prepare your trip very carefully in order for you to enjoy it."}
{"file_id": "1114229.txt", "output_essay": "Yes, I am totally in agreement with the notion that it is better to travel in a group instead of traveling alone, led by a guide. Actually, in today's materialistic world, there is more concern for safety than ever before. So, it is a wise decision to travel in a group.\n\nFor example, if a person travels to a new town or country and does not know anything about the place, then it is better for him to travel in a group because it lessens his chances of being confused in an unknown place. A person could face a lot of difficulties in a new place, like where to stay, where to have food, and sometimes he may encounter language problems. So, traveling in a group with a guide will be a helpful option.\n\nTraveling in a group led by a guide is a very good choice because the guide is familiar with the local language and culture, which helps a lot. Actually, traveling with a guide enhances the joy of the trip because he can tell you a lot about the places you are touring. Further, it is also more economical to travel with many people because in a group, everybody contributes to the overall cost, which is mostly less than the cost of traveling alone.\n\nExploring an exotic place alone is not a good option because sometimes there are minor problems related to security which may be encountered by a single traveler. For instance, if a person is going to catch a train at a railway station and someone steals his purse, then he will find himself in a critical dilemma. Actually, there are thieves who target lone and new travelers. But if you are traveling in a group, they cannot dare to steal your things, or you can complain to your group members.\n\nBasically, traveling alone in a new and unknown place is always a risky task; one should be very careful about himself as well as his luggage. On the other hand, traveling in a group secures a person from these minor problems.\n\nIn conclusion, it is a good and intelligent idea to travel in a group with a guide. It makes you safer and allows you to enjoy the journey."}
{"file_id": "1114472.txt", "output_essay": "Traveling in a group and being led by a tour guide has both advantages and disadvantages, and the consideration of whether it is the best way of traveling depends on many factors.\n\nSuppose you are a busy working person and you want to spend your vacation or annual leave. You have a week or two and you plan to go somewhere. First of all, most people want comfort in such cases, and they would want to go to the major sightseeing spots. In such cases, an organized tour led by a guide is the best option: the tourist company will arrange everything for you—all you have to do is enjoy. The guide will tell you what most travelers would like to know, and you don't have to refer to a book to find out about the sightseeing spot you're at. You are free of all the uncertainties and risks involved in traveling alone and being responsible for yourself.\n\nHowever, traveling in a group led by a tour guide has several restrictions, and they can be frustrating if you are seeking adventures or totally personal experiences. I felt this personally when I went to a Turkic tombstone in rural Mongolia with a group of tourists. The tombstone was awesome, at least for me, for I was interested in Turkic history. It had an inscription on it, and I was eager to try to read it on my own (I once spent some time trying to learn the old letters). But the group had only two hours to spend there, and I had to leave the tombstone with them too because other members of the group did not share the same interest, and the schedule said that we should be at the tourist camp by 4 o'clock. I felt so frustrated that I decided then that I would go there alone sometime afterward. So, this example of mine illustrates the downside of guided travel—you're not free to decide where to go or how long to stay. You can't actually, if I may put it this way, 'taste' the activity and the place because the experience is not entirely yours; it rather turns out to be a group experience and it does not give you that feeling when you discover something, think something out, or experience something on your own without being distracted.\n\nPersonally, therefore, I prefer to travel alone if I have enough time, but at the same time, I agree that organized travel can be a useful and enjoyable experience if you do not have enough time or if you are not really into the destination of your travel."}
{"file_id": "1113573.txt", "output_essay": "My instant reaction upon reading the statement was to get defensive and write about how there are several shining examples of youngsters helping their communities. However, I was forced to change my mind as the more I pondered over the statement, the more I realized that it is sad, but true.\n\nYoung people are often so caught up in their own lives that it has become increasingly difficult to pull them away from their own agendas and try to get them interested in activities which they do not consider 'fun' or 'cool'.\n\nThis can be clearly seen even by the amount of time that young people spend with their own families. We find ourselves resorting to using fast but impersonal modes of communication like email and instant messaging even with our parents and siblings. The amount of human interaction has surely decreased. So where's the question of helping out one's community?\n\nHowever, I think that the main problem is that most young people do not really know how to help their communities. They might also be hesitant as they feel they have nothing special which they can contribute to the community. Once this myth is dispelled, I think that more youngsters might find joy and pride in being part of something bigger than themselves, their community.\n\nYoung people, with their natural energy and enthusiasm, can come up with bright and innovative ways of helping their community. This can be done in simple but useful ways, such as tutoring some of the younger kids in the neighborhood, or making a little old lady's day by visiting her in the old-age home, or even going all out and organizing an event for the whole community to take part in.\n\nTherefore, while I do agree with the statement, I also have faith in younger people that they can and they will put their iPods down for a while, and devote enough time to help their communities. Since no amount of compelling or nagging young people to help out will work, it would be more effective to teach by doing. I feel this can be achieved by getting the whole community involved in a project which everyone finds interesting and can take pride in."}

So for us, becoming old means adapting to the rules that civil society, good manners, and behavior require. This passage has always been seen as the increasing awareness of what surrounds us, with all the problems and responsibilities.\nProbably for that reason, old people are considered more serious, understanding, but also sad compared to the brave and spontaneous behavior of young people.\n\nAnyway, my personal opinion is that times have changed and today our world offers a lot of opportunities and means to old people in order to maintain a reactive body and mind. There are many cases of no longer young people that are considered examples of our society, and I think that this shows the change now explained.\nI know many people older than me that enjoy and love life as much as I do, because they love their work or they have started some interesting activities that enable them to be active and positive.\n\nIn conclusion, I can summarize my essay by saying that in the past, I probably would agree with the statement, but today both young and old people know how to enjoy their lives, even if the"}
{"file_id": "1122978.txt", "output_essay": "The knowledge of various academic subjects is beneficial for everyone because it allows us to become familiar with all subjects and share our ideas with people from different backgrounds. However, specialization is also valuable because it enables us to delve into the deeper levels of a subject. After careful consideration, I prefer specialization in one specific area.\n\nFirst, specialization allows us to explore the foundational levels of a subject, which means we have the opportunity to discover new things from the essential information. This can only happen if we reach the foundational levels as well. When I was in BTech, I discovered a new program related to colors in Java. I studied the entire subject over the summer, and that's how I found the new program. My college staff appreciated me a lot.\n\nSecond, through specialization, we can identify the drawbacks of a subject, which enables us to find solutions to prevent them. We can also work to reduce these drawbacks if possible. For example, scientists are trying to reduce the harm to the 'ozone' layer. They are specialists in related fields and are working to mitigate the damage to the 'ozone' because they understand the merits and drawbacks of the subject.\n\nThird, only a specialist has comprehensive knowledge of a subject. In this regard, I have a bitter experience to share. A few months back, I had an accident that injured my leg. At that time, I went to a hospital where the doctor was not a specialist in bone injuries. He said that there was no injury to my leg, but I knew something was wrong."}
{"file_id": "1126001.txt", "output_essay": "Currently, the issue 'Young people enjoy life more than older people do' is debated by numerous educationalists and scientists. In my personal point of view, I believe young people enjoy life more than older people do. In this essay, I will explain personal points based on previous examples as well as specific reasons.\n\nFirstly, young people spend much more time than old people in the entertainment aspect, such as TV, computer games, and sports. On one hand, young people are the major consumers of the world entertainment industry. Old people tend to stay in their world, doing their personal hobbies which do not prefer to communicate with each other. On the other hand, old people don't have enough energy for enjoying life due to their age. However, the situation of young people is totally different; they have enough energy for playing outside and enjoying their lives. They tend to play with each other and communicate.\n\nSecondly, young people are much easier to accept fashionable things than old people, which are the basis of enjoying life. For example, young people like playing outdoors with skateboards, which are the newest fashion in sports in the world. Old people cannot accept this kind of sport due to security concerns. Therefore, old people would not access this area of sport for enjoying their lives. The attitudes towards new things are the major problems. So, old people tend to take simple and easy traditional games in their lives.\n\nIn addition, most old people prefer staying at home rather than playing outdoors. However, young people choose outdoor activities as their favorite. In current times, outdoor activities are the main form of entertainment in the world. Thus, numerous old people who tend to stay at home without outdoor activities will lose their chances for enjoying their lives significantly.\n\nIn conclusion, young people like different types of entertainment and also accept more fashionable things than old people. As a result of these situations, young people enjoy more life than old people."}
{"file_id": "1127304.txt", "output_essay": "I think that this statement can summarize an important problem of contemporary society. In my opinion, we live in a society of appearances, where exterior aspects are sometimes considered more important than the substance of things! I believe it is evident in a myriad of situations. Let's consider, for instance, our markets, which are full of colorful boxes and bottles. I am sure that each of us, at least once in our lives, has bought a type of food or beverage just because of how appealing it was presented on the box that contained it!\n\nWe can also think about the commercials on TV that introduce us daily to so many kinds of what I call 'useful' things. These items seem to be the new and perfect solutions to many of our problems (and most of the time, they solve just one 'problem': how to spend our money!)\n\nAnother example comes from the fashion world. It is a bit different from the previous ones, but I think that in a different way, it reflects the same issue. How many times have we seen perfectly slim models who appeared to be healthy and, of course, satisfied with their bodies? And how many times have we heard (sometime later) that they had severe problems with anorexia, their everyday lunch was a carrot, and their lives were unhappy?\n\nIt has happened many times, I guess... Now, the point is that society presents to us some patterns that are almost never real, or rather, it shows us, thanks to some advertisements or something else, what it wants to show us, but not the whole truth!\n\nI think that it is not easy today to not be impressed by the external side of the things that surround us, but I also believe that to avoid many delusions in our life, we should start to look beyond the appearance of the things that are presented to us to understand what they really are!"}

It seems to be more important to know how to use the internet than which was the last book that they read.\n\nSecondly, in these communities, they should try to attract teenagers by offering them different kinds of activities which could make them interested in going to these communities and participating. For example, organizing concerts (all types of music: classical, pop, rock...), football games or other kinds of sports, creating a library which would include: internet, books, CDs, DVDs; also trying to perform some plays or go to the theatre. They should also know much more about the place that they live and the environment in general, not just the group or the city that they live in.\n\nLastly, when young people can enjoy this environment, they will be very excited and very determined to collaborate in any kind of activity or help that the community can create or organize.\n\nMy conclusion is that if the community presents a good range of attractive and new activities, any young people will be so happy to collaborate in the well-being of the community."}

They, including myself, think that there are people who are already concerned with societal issues and will find some solution.\n\nYoung people who have a good life are the least worried because their parents help them and will solve their problems. They don't consider that when they become adults, their parents won't be there to assist them.\n\nI know that this attitude is problematic, but it is what our parents have taught us. Some examples include when we drop paper on the ground and are not willing to pick it up and put it in the trash. Or when someone sprays paint on doors. These people don't think when they do that; they simply do what they like.\n\nI wish that the youth were more considerate and that they would think before doing anything.

{"file_id": "1116071.txt", "output_essay": "Personally, I agree with the statement 'Young people enjoy life more than older people do.' Many people may disagree with this, but there are three major reasons to convince. Those three are health, knowledge, and transportation.\n\nThe first reason I think this way is because younger people have better health than older people. I was playing on the beach with my relatives. My cousins and I were running, splashing, swimming, and surfing. It was a lot of fun for us, as everyone agreed. Suddenly, my aunt called us to come out. It was a big surprise for us. She called us because my grandfather had fainted. As a result, old people have worse health and cannot enjoy their life as much.\n\nThe second reason is that younger people have different knowledge than that of older people. Most people my age (14) know a lot of entertaining places and fun places. Eventually, older people can't go out broadly because they don't know many places to go. This was my friend's grandparents' story. It was a hot sunny day, and they were retired from their work, so they had a lot of time to go out. However, they wanted to go somewhere but couldn't. They phoned my friend and asked her where to go. I was a little bit surprised at first, but I understood that they had a different lifestyle than us back when they were young like us.\n\nThe last reason that I agree with the statement is that we have better transportation. Although grandparents have lots of time, some of them cannot drive because they had totally different lives compared to us. Nowadays, most university students can drive because it's widely used, but older people didn't have the chance to learn driving. Also, younger ones can ride buses, subways, and skytrains. Unfortunately, older people can't go by standing; they have to sit down somewhere, but sometimes public transportation doesn't have enough spots for them to sit down.\n\nIn conclusion, young people can enjoy life better than older people. It doesn't mean that every elder is like these, but a large proportion of them are. I think it's better to enjoy life when we are young and for elders to enjoy a quieter and more relaxing life."}

They go to parties, spend much time with friends, and have not many responsibilities.\n\nOlder people often have problems with their health. Some older people need permanent medical care and are not able to leave their homes. Furthermore, they know that most of their life is over. I think this is not an amusing thought. So one can say many older people do not have the possibilities to enjoy life, but there are also older people who do not want to enjoy life. I know some older people who are healthy and well-off, but nevertheless, they do not go out, but sit in their houses and are sad.\n\nOn the other hand, young people are just at the beginning of their lives and therefore they have to fight for their place in society. This struggle is not only fun, too. In school, they have to work hard because they want to raise their job opportunities, and in university, this situation is continued. When young people have leisure time, many of them waste their time in order to play video games on the computer. Other young people are dissatisfied with society and lead life as outcasts. In contrast to that, there are many healthy older people who earn a comfortable income or are even retired. They often afford luxurious trips and they do not have so much pressure to be successful. Instead of stress in school, in university, or at the beginning of a career, older people can play with their grandchildren or can go for a walk with other older persons. I think this is a great perspective.\n\nOlder people can look back and see what they have achieved over the years. That can also be a great pleasure. Summing up all these reasons, I think both young and older people can enjoy life, but I am convinced that older people more often do so."}

So after all this, they do not have much time left to do something else.\n\nSecond, people now are no longer as attached to one another as they used to be; it's just like if they use the means of friendship and communication only when directly necessary. As a result, if they do not communicate well, they will not be able to help their communities as a group.\n\nFinally, before in a neighborhood, everybody knew everybody because there were not as many people, but now it's getting crowded and they may not know who their second neighbor is. So how would they meet and try to help their communities if they do not even know each other?\n\nTo sum up, I think that people should organize their schedules well and find some time to help their communities because, after all, that is where they live."}

I see lots of advertisements on television or in newspapers which describe the product as the perfect solution to customers' problems, but in reality, it is not. I believe that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.\n\nIn all sectors, we can see these types of advertisements. Automotive, Information Technology, or Consumer sectors, no matter which sector it is, all use advertising methods to convince consumers to buy the product by emphasizing certain points generally but not giving details about some unknown aspects which can influence the final decision to buy it. To illustrate, an MP3 player is usually advertised in a newspaper as a product that is 1 GB and has a radio. However, many people do not know that their radio does not work well everywhere and they do not even know how many songs can be saved to that wonderful device. Without thinking, some of them buy it while others learn the reality when they go to buy it by asking questions to the sales representative.\n\nAnother example is that some advertising tricks are implemented in prices. Prices are shown excluding taxes, and when you are very happy since you have found your favorite product and you go to buy it, usually, it is too late to change your view and thus, you buy it.\n\nIn this sense, it is certain that most advertisements make products seem much better than they are.

Specific knowledge is very much desired in both professional and academic fields.\n\nSpecialized knowledge of the subject is many times indispensable. One good example would be from the field of medicine, where general physicians are valued, but specialists like cardiologists or neurologists are indispensable and are the final option for particular kinds of treatments.\n\nToo much generalized knowledge may become very superficial and will not be of much help in solving complex problems in specific subjects. For instance, if we look at the field of science, say biology, a generalized understanding of all its branches is required, but a taxonomist and a biophysicist have very little to do with each other and cannot help each other in solving their specific problems.\n\nHowever, all this discussion is not meant to diminish the value of general knowledge, as the application of knowledge from one subject into another requires an understanding of both. For example, if principles of mathematics are to be applied to biology, then general knowledge of both subjects is required. However, it will be done more appropriately if two specialists, i.e., a biologist and a mathematician, interact with each other.\n\nAlso, I believe that human memory has its limitations and one should use it judiciously. We should confine and focus our brains towards solving problems related to a specific subject. Too much unnecessary knowledge will occupy space in one's memory and will not be put to use very often.\n\nTherefore, having general knowledge in moderation is good, but having only general knowledge is of no use.

Whereas older people like traveling, researching events, reading, observing events, and listening to romantic music.\n\nIn conclusion, being young is a very entertaining thing. Young people bring chance and movement to our lives. Without them, our life would be unhappy. The world is very active and peaceful with them."}

Understanding the idea is more important for every student in the classroom. Grasping the idea and concepts provides an overall picture of that particular lecture.\n\nFor example, during my college days, I concentrated more on understanding the lessons, and at that time, I knew the central idea of the topic. These types of skills will improve the ability to study and the ability to remember. They also reduce study time. Students can learn more information quickly.\n\nLearning facts is good, but we don't always want to study. We don't want to spend too much time learning facts. At such times, these skills are very helpful. It is a very time-consuming process. Understanding ideas and concepts will be helpful at any time. For instance, when I want to go to an exam, first I will go through the topic, then understand the main idea and concept of that one. I regularly follow this rule of studying. In this way, I get more information within the time, and I also save time. By studying in this way, I got good marks in my exams.\n\nFor example, when we approach a reading passage, first of all, we skim the passage to get the main idea. At this time, reading becomes easy; otherwise, it would be tough. This method of grasping ideas gives students a lot of exposure, and their thinking ability will also increase. In this way, learning facts without the idea of the topic is difficult to remember. So, I strongly believe in this statement; it will be very helpful in education and future aspects."}

It is essential to know about each and every subject as we implement all the subjects in our lives, and we should have some basic knowledge about them.\n\nAfter reaching a certain level of learning in all the subjects with our own interest, we can emphasize learning one particular subject. This will build self-confidence in us and improve our skills as we try to learn things through self-preparation.\n\nWe can take the theories provided by people who worked in the subject in which we are interested and study them to give solutions to the problems which were not solved by them. This will make us learn new things related to the subject and improve our skills in a better manner.\n\nWorking in a single field is often referred to as research work. This requires dedication towards the work and patience in doing the work. It takes much time to present a thesis on a particular topic, even a few years.

Due to a bad environment, many people suffer from diseases such as cancer and, especially, lung disease, which stem from insufficient exercise and air pollution. These days, an increasing number of individuals are concerned about their health issues and understand that cars exacerbate their conditions. Additionally, people are beginning to care about protecting nature, including the ozone hole and air pollution resulting from car emissions.\n\nCars are expensive to maintain; people have to fill them with gasoline, and the price of gasoline is rising. They must renew their car insurance every few years and maintain their own parking spaces. Owning a car means incurring costs every day. To save money, it is easier to use trains, buses, or bicycles instead of cars. Using alternative transportation is much more convenient than driving. Trains, in particular, are faster and cheaper.\n\nAbout 30 years ago, owning a car was a status symbol. However, now, being eco-friendly is a trend and is considered cool. Moreover, having a car can lead to a sedentary lifestyle. America is a prime example, where most people commute to the office or school by car, contributing to increasing obesity rates. I believe the best way to solve these problems is to walk on our own two legs. We should not rely so heavily on cars."}

When I finally understood the process of the French Revolution, I never forgot it, because I didn't learn it merely as a fact.\n\nSecond, it is really great when you grasp the concepts of different things and you can start to make some interesting connections between them and with the experiences of your own life. I think it is nice when you can ask questions about what you learned and draw some conclusions about it. I also find it enjoyable when I meet with friends and start a conversation with them, talking and exchanging ideas about all those things that at one time I learned and understood.\n\nFurthermore, I consider that facts are too weak; you learn these facts for the test and then you forget them. It is like a foreign learning; from one moment to another, it flies away from your mind. Instead, when you really understand the ideas or concepts, you can be sure that this knowledge will never be forgotten, nevermore.\n\nFinally, I can say that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts."}

Consequently, it is unlikely that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years than there are today. Another reason for this prediction is the frequency with which new car models are released—often every month or annually. Additionally, some people tend to buy a new car soon after acquiring their first one, attracted by the improved design and appearance of the latest models. Therefore, it is reasonable to anticipate that in twenty years, not only will there be more cars in use than today, but also a continuous influx of new vehicles will be observed."}
{"file_id": "1130868.txt", "output_essay": "Nowadays, we are living in a world of individualism. In our parents' period, it was really different; everyone helped everybody. Today, this period has evolved. In my opinion, young people do not give enough time to helping their communities. With several examples, it will be easier to explain the reason for this phenomenon.\n\nFirst, young people study longer than before. On average, a student stays at the university for around four or five years, which is huge compared to the 60s or 70s. Young people always claim they have no time to help anybody. Even at 20 years old, we, young people, always have the feeling of being over-busy. We have personal work, group project work, sports, etc., but in our planning, there is no time for anything else. Well, I say that, but we can find time to go to the cinema or meet friends. For example, we will prefer going on a 3-week holiday rather than staying one week to help a charitable cause. There should be another reason for young people's carelessness.\n\nSecondly, as I said previously, we are living in an individualistic and egotistic society. Everyone thinks about themselves. Young people believe less in God than before, which could also be a good reason. There are not a lot of religious events. But religion is an efficient way to gather people around a good cause in order to help another community. And all of it is just the consequence of the environment of a society or a lack of values and education.\n\nNowadays, parents do not teach their children to share.\n\nIn brief, I think it is not fair, but it is a reality; young people do not give enough time to helping their communities, but I am sure."}
{"file_id": "1122932.txt", "output_essay": "Youngsters and Community Aid\n\nI believe the involvement of young people in helping their community will vary from one country to another. In my home country, Spain, I must say that I generally agree with the statement proposed.\n\nThe decline in social concern that Western countries like Spain are experiencing is due, in my opinion, to two main factors: the improvement in the quality of life of middle-class families and the reduction in the size of families.\n\nSpain has changed a lot in the past thirty-five years. While some decades ago we still had a considerable proportion of our population living in conditions of poverty, that is not the case anymore. The middle class has expanded in Spain, and nowadays it is one of the countries with the most dispersed distribution of wealth. In this new situation, there are fewer class differences, and therefore the need for helping the community is not so evident to young people.\n\nAnother important social change in Spain has been the dramatic reduction in average family size. Thirty years ago, one-child families in Spain were very rare. Today, this is the most common family situation. One-child families usually tend to overprotect the only child, and these children become less concerned about the social aspects of life. Therefore, they do not recognize the need to help the community when they grow up and become youngsters.\n\nThese two reasons merely express my opinion and must be taken in general terms. I am sure there are many other reasons why young people do not devote time to helping the community, but I consider these two to be the most important ones. It is also important to note that there are exceptions; I know young people who devote a lot of time to help their communities and even some who work full-time in fields related to community aid, but I just feel this is not the general behavior of this generation."}

First, we know that young people know how to have fun. They always go out with friends, they always laugh (most of the time for nothing)... Older people don't know it. They used to know, but now they are adults and adults have a lot of responsibilities; adults always think about their work, adults always worry about everything, and when they are older, they worry about death and always talk about when they were young, when they knew how to enjoy life!\n\nWe also could say that young people enjoy life because they don't think about the future, they seize the day. That's true, but older people, if they like to plan everything, can seize the day too. Don't we say that the best time of your life is when you don't work anymore?\n\nWhat about these grandfathers and these grandmothers who travel a lot and begin to live the life they want? That's why I think middle-aged people are the ones who enjoy life the least. They have too many things not to forget, too many things to do, too many things to care about. Young people enjoy life because they have nothing to think about! They go to school, go out with their friends, have complicated relationships with their boyfriends and girlfriends and that's all. OK, they have to do some homework, but that's not a horrible life. They enjoy life because their life is perfect!\n\nTo finish, I would say that although they have a perfect life, most young people don't really enjoy life. Adolescents are always in a bad mood, they complain every time, they always disagree with you, but what they do best is 'to not care'. But older people, even if they have a quite more difficult life, know the value of life."}

People who have succeeded in their work try to create new things and take risks, as success gives them a boost to excel in their field.\n\nOnce a person is successful in achieving his target, he will try out new things and would like to explore more in the same field and apply his knowledge in various other fields. Consider the example of Sir Isaac Newton. If Sir Isaac Newton had just stopped at his theory of gravity after its discovery, many things would have remained undiscovered until now. He applied his theory in the fields of mathematics, physics, and science, to name a few. Just think if Sir Isaac Newton had stopped taking risks and searching for new principles and theories, then advancement would not have been possible. The laws of science would have been at a standstill.\n\nAnother great scientist to mention is Einstein. He proposed the theory E=mc^2, the theory of relativity. He started using the concepts in his surroundings, which stunned the entire world. These great men did not stop after achieving their targets but used their success as a tool to discover various new things.\n\nIf a person who is successful does not wish to explore the field of his interest, then the success will not be of much importance. Doing what is known can be done by others too, but implementing it can only be done by a few, who see their success as the strength to discover what is not known. Being wise is good by applying your theory in a different manner, but to achieve success, you need to implement your theory in various fields.\n\nSuccessful people will always make an attempt to create new things and take risks. They will never consider their success as the endpoint of research or work. Success is not the end. Continuing to try and take risks will surely benefit you, even though you might not achieve success at every step you choose to take."}

For example, teachers teach children how to add numbers by explaining how addition works, not by telling them that 2 + 2 = 4, that 2 + 3 = 5, and so on. When a child has understood the idea and the concept of addition, he'll be able to make all sorts of additions.\n\nWhat I really mean to say is that the understanding of a concept will lead you to the full comprehension of several facts of the same kind.\n\nOn the other hand, I cannot avoid noticing that we face a big risk in focusing too much on ideas and concepts: the risk of leaving out reality. Reality is very important because it's the point we tend to: all ideas and concepts are studied to give reasons for things we've seen in our experience. If we do not refer to reality, we would be just speaking about nothing; our talking would be only speculation, which is not useful to us.\n\nI would say that we need a balance between the two things because they are both important to students. I think that a good method of making them understand a theory or a concept would be giving them examples because talking about experience is effective in making them realize what concept we are dealing with.\n\nOn the other hand, I think that when a teacher talks about a specific fact, he should always say what is the idea that underlies that fact so that he would obtain two important results: firstly, the student would fully understand the fact in its implications, causes, consequences (for example, why a war was declared, what consequences it had, etc.), and secondly, the students would be able to understand many facts of the same kind because they may recognize the same ideas behind other facts."}

In detail, in the case of paper advertisements or internet advertisements, the products can seem much better in terms of color, size, shape, etc. For example, a week ago, I ordered clothes on an internet site because they were a beautiful pink that I like. I was so excited and expectant. Yesterday, the clothes were finally delivered, but when I saw them, I was quite disappointed because they were an ugly, dense pink that I loathe. So, following this example, the visual aspect of advertisements can make products seem much better than they really are.\n\nSecond, in the case of home shopping, the host introduces the product. To illustrate, my aunt called my mother a few days ago, and my mother told me the story. A few days ago, my aunt watched a TV home shopping channel featuring kimchi. The host ate the kimchi so deliciously and said that it was very yummy. Furthermore, all the guests ate the kimchi so deliciously, and in my aunt's opinion, it looked so delicious because of the spiced color of the kimchi and the eaters' attitudes.

Nobody remembers or notices a person whose life has been carried out in an anonymous pattern. We notice what stands out from daily life, something exceptional, new. The key to success is risk. Oscar Wilde used to say that an idea which is not risky cannot be considered an idea. To give evidence to this statement, we are going to outline some main points and then summarize with conclusions and caveats.\n\nFirst of all, nowadays we consider successful people who occupy certain social positions due to their efforts in seeking their place. This successful social position varies depending on cultures. Nevertheless, this position is regarded as successful when the position itself is exceptional. Nobody would consider someone successful who works in a normal or standard position. This means that success depends on extraordinary situations carried out in particular conditions: it is finding a new solution, a new idea to obtain something.\n\nSecondly, people will recognize success only when it is visible. If nothing could lead us to distinguish something from normality, we would not be able to determine the difference between the two. We will not be thus capable of recognizing the new in the normal. Hence, this will not be differentiable. Success is also difference, uniqueness. In other words, new things.\n\nThird, having stated that success is based on difference and new ideas, it is also to be said that new ideas find their root in risk. Elaborating something new, it is not possible to understand whether it will be regarded as something really new and meet the taste of others or will just fail to communicate its difference. This uncertainty has to deal with risk. To be noticed as different, one idea has to be new, thus risky.\n\nTo conclude, we demonstrated that success comes from difference from normality; exceptionality and risk. The last factor is perhaps the essential key to success, as Oscar Wilde said."}

There are two specific examples of tricks used to present products as much better: changing the look of the product by altering the color of its cover and renaming it to appear high quality.\n\nFirst of all, advertisements change the color of the product's cover to attract customers. Generally, faded colors make the customer think the product is made with old technology, whereas bright colors deceive the consumer into believing it is made with high technology. For example, in Turkey, brighter pencils are generally preferred over faded-colored pencils. That's why many advertisers pressure manufacturers to produce brightly colored pencils to increase sales.\n\nSecondly, advertisers compel manufacturers to change the names of specific products to boost sales. In Turkey, this is often done by giving a foreign name to the product instead of a Turkish one to trick the consumer. In this way, consumers may think the product is of high quality because some goods manufactured by the Turkish industry lack quality. There is a real case for this in Turkey. A spaghetti-producing company changed its product name a couple of years ago and gave it an Italian name to deceive consumers into thinking it was an Italian product. Consequently, they have increased their sales. This is how they present their products as much better, although the quality remains the same as before.\n\nTo sum up, most advertisers make products seem much better using the techniques listed above.

For example, consider an experiment from a chemistry lab. Without knowing the idea and concept of the experiment, what would one do in the lab? If someone were to do the experiment without understanding the ideas and concepts, there would definitely be some accidents in the lab because chemical experiments must be conducted carefully. Without care, if we conduct an experiment in the lab, it will definitely go wrong. For example, H2SO4 is a highly acidic substance. I remember in my college studies, a student without knowing the experiment details and concepts wanted to conduct the lab experiment. He added some water to the H2SO4, and a big explosion occurred. Then my teacher scolded that boy, but that is another matter. Without knowledge and understanding, conducting an experiment can lead to dangerous outcomes.\n\nConsider another example: nuclear experiments conducted in some countries. If something goes wrong, whether knowingly or unknowingly, there could be a massive explosion. In such places, we definitely need to know the ideas and concepts; without this knowledge, we cannot do anything because nuclear weapons release more energy than anything else. Even the Sun's energy is based on nuclear reactions.\n\nFurthermore, understanding the concepts and ideas provides safety and detailed information about what the student wants to learn. If a student learns about concepts and ideas, he understands the entire point of what he wants to learn from the facts. This ensures that there is no harm to anything or anyone in the vicinity where the application of knowledge occurs.\n\nMoreover, knowing some facts without understanding the underlying ideas and concepts is a different matter. In my opinion, we must know the ideas and concepts before attempting to learn the facts."}
{"file_id": "1128202.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with the idea that most advertisements are better than the products themselves. For example, when I read fashion magazines, I find many attractive pages which feature various products such as cosmetics, dresses, watches, and perfumes. Whenever I look at these kinds of pages, I actually feel like buying them immediately.\n\nOne reason why people are interested in advertisements when viewing them is that they usually use female models whose style is good and who always seem to enjoy using the products. It attracts people and urges them to buy and wear them. Sometimes, people tend to forget that they don't have the same face, style, and atmosphere as the model. It's a mistake. After obtaining the products, people often feel they are not as good as expected because they didn't really need them.\n\nAnother reason why most advertisements are appealing to people is their quality. To compete with other companies and capture a larger market share, companies make efforts in various ways, particularly with advertisements. Recent research shows that 90 percent of companies in the fashion field consider it necessary to spend money and time to produce an advertisement. For example, hiring a famous designer can cost 10 times more than the monthly salary of one employee.\n\nConsequently, the quality of advertisements sometimes surpasses the actual product itself. For these reasons, I support the position that most advertisements seem much better than the products themselves."}

I feel that successful people do different things and enjoy doing them. These people generally don't depend on the result of the work which was done by them, but they concentrate on the effort they put into it. This is the best and most fascinating thing about them. When they do not try new things and work, sticking to one kind of work which they are habituated to do without any risks and problems, the man would certainly not be called a successful person.\n\nFor example, take a biologist researcher; he starts research in one particular field and conducts experiments, draws hypotheses, and he continues the process until he succeeds. He goes on expeditions and also does many adventures to study the nature of a particular species and draws conclusions by observing the behavior of different animals in that species. His journey would certainly be tough, and it also takes a long time to make a conclusion; if his conclusion is right and matched, he is successful in his research, but he does not stop until he will research another species, and his life goes on. If he is confined to one particular research in his lifetime, that would not be that effective as things go on changing and the species can adapt to different environments, so he has to succeed further.\n\nThe same is the case with a business manager or an owner of a business. A businessman is successful in the corporate world with his product and earns a lot of profit with this product, but he will not be restricted to making that particular product only; he would certainly do experiments and launch new products. If the product clicks, he is successful, but if the product doesn't click, still he would be successful and would try to make implications on that.\n\nAnother thing is success does not lie in doing a routine job; everyone should experiment and do different things as there is a lot in the world to still learn, and we can come through them. If we are not successful in any of the experiments we did, it doesn't matter because through the experiments we get to understand the subject, and we can then finally have a pool of knowledge on different fields."}

While some people argue that advertisements do not reflect the true quality of a product, others believe that they are well-informed about their purchases. Thus, advertisements cannot influence their choice.\n\nBoth perspectives are important, but overall, I disagree with the statement that advertising influences my choice.\n\nMy point of view is significant because we generally know the different products we use for ourselves. For example, when you want to buy a car, you seek specific information about the type of car you desire and do not necessarily follow the advertising provided by any car company.\n\nSecondly, advertisements are not primarily directed to influence the choice of customers. They are widely used by companies to establish their leadership (best selling). This can be illustrated by the fact that when someone wants a specific car, they have the choice between sometimes more than one company.\n\nSome might object that young boys are mostly influenced by advertising. This objection can be countered by the fact that they are not responsible for their purchases. When they want something, they ask their parents to buy it for them. And generally, parents do not follow the desires of their children because they know what is important for them or not.\n\nWhile the issue of product quality must be considered carefully, the fact that we know what we want, compounded with the objective of the company to establish a leadership position, provides convincing reasons why I disagree with the following statement: 'Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.'"}
{"file_id": "1126528.txt", "output_essay": "Traveling is very interesting for me, but there is controversy over how to travel: going alone or in a group. I disagree with this theme and I raise four reasons for this.\n\nFirst of all, I'd like to go wherever I can. It is very useful to go with a tour guide, especially to places that I've never been to, because I have little knowledge of dangerous places to visit. However, in guided tours, there are some things that I don't want to see. Also, planning for the places that I want to visit is also precious time. Time to travel is limited, and from planning to traveling, it is a starting point!\n\nSecondly, traveling expands our horizons. I have traveled to Brazil a lot and was capable of meeting foreign people. To know what they do, think, and like was a very interesting opportunity. I like foreigners, including Brazilians, and also want to communicate with foreign people. Traveling is about knowing and expanding friendships, but this will happen only when going abroad alone, and I would have never had such an experience by traveling by myself.\n\nLastly, traveling is a chance to reflect on who I am and what I am going to be. In the place where we live, I can't be stimulated and it isn't good for my health, but in a new place, I can be fresh in my mind, and I want to know about this.\n\nI know that traveling with a group, for example with friends or family, is not as interesting largely because I can't see or think alone. It is a chance to go, think, and enjoy by myself, not for others.\n\nI want to go traveling alone every year wherever I want, and expand my abilities."}

I would like to agree with the statement that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.\n\nConsider, for example, the advertisements for washing powders, regardless of the brand name. These advertisements claim that they can remove various kinds of stains, make clothes shiny, and maintain the color of the fabric for a long time. Most of these statements are exaggerated. Take another example of bathing soaps which, according to advertisements, help to make people beautiful. Some soaps even claim that they can make people healthy. As far as my knowledge goes, I have never heard of such things happening in real life.\n\nSimilarly, as with washing powder and bathing soap, the advertisements for clothing, motor vehicles, food items, etc., all claim things that are a bit exaggerated. Manufacturers of motor vehicles assert that they have the latest technology, which the consumer has never heard of before, and food products claim that they contain all the vitamins and proteins necessary for human beings.\n\nIn short, the statement makes it clear that advertisements claim things that are not exaggerated to a great extent. Hence, it seems reasonable for me to agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they are."}
{"file_id": "1127387.txt", "output_essay": "Yes, I totally agree with the term of traveling in a group led by a tour guide. It is mainly because, as tourists, we don't know much about the places in a particular area. We will visit only those places which are known to us. But if you travel in a group led by a tour guide, you will be able to see more new places that you have never imagined seeing in that particular place.\n\nThe tour guide plays a very important role in making our tour very interesting and adventurous. He tells us about the stories of the different places of that area and makes us feel more and more excited to visit that place.\n\nI visited Agra, India. I was traveling with my friends, and we all planned to hire a tour that is led by a guide so that we could visit more places and come to know about the history of those places. As I know, Agra is a city of history. It has lots of history in it, and I wanted to know the proper history of that place. I was sure that only a group tour guide could tell us about it, and I was not wrong at all. He told the whole group about the history of all those historical places in that town. As we know, one of the Seven Wonders, the Taj Mahal, is also located in that city. I was touched by listening to the history of that wonder. Not only me, but the whole group was touched by what he told us about it.\n\nI think if I were not in that group with that guide, I would have never enjoyed my trip to Agra as much. I would not have come to know all that he told to the whole group about the history of the great Taj Mahal.\n\nSince then, I love to travel in a group which is led by a tour guide. Actually, I think one should definitely visit new places in a group led by a tour guide. I'm saying so mainly because you come to know about the places of that town and everything about that town. If you like it, then you can come again on your own without a tourist guide. But if you are visiting a new place for the first time, then you have to travel in a group which is led by a tour guide. If you have a tour guide, then you need not have to take any tension for accommodation, traveling from one place to another. All these tasks are done by the tour guide only. We don't even have to buy tickets again and again. In all, when we are traveling in a group led by a tour guide, we are in a full mood of enjoyment. No work tension, nothing. Only enjoyment and enjoyment.\n\nSo, I think the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide."}
{"file_id": "1134057.txt", "output_essay": "I absolutely agree with the statement. Moreover, I think that good advertisements should enhance the appearance of efficiency to maximize their influence on the consumer.\n\nAdvertisements for skincare products are especially good at twisting reality. They usually employ models who have immaculate skin regardless of the product. Then they follow the usual recipe by showing the model using the product and telling the audience about the significant change it made for her. It doesn't take long for the audience to react to this display of cause and effect. The problem is that the product probably didn't have any impact on the model whatsoever: she had perfect skin beforehand. And that's not even mentioning the computer enhancements...\n\nHowever, I think one thing must be realized: the advertisement that I described previously did its job. It planted a seed in the consumer's mind, and sales will happen. That's exactly the purpose of marketing: generating sales. I think it's largely the consumer's responsibility to train themselves to mostly ignore advertisements. We know that they are fake, so why do we believe them anyway?\n\nDon't get me wrong: advertising is a regulated business and, as such, should limit itself to what has been ruled acceptable by society. Laws exist that forbid lying or deceiving the customer in an advertisement. Building on my previous example, if the skincare product has real potential for reasonably improving the appearance of skin, then it is the consumer's task to discern what is real and what is embellishment. As long as the advertisement doesn't guarantee the exact same results for everyone, the marketing firm is on pretty safe ground.\n\nI'll conclude by attacking the other point of view: how could anyone disagree with the original statement that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are? That's the way it is. To anyone who believes advertisements display the whole truth unmodified, I have a bridge I'd like to sell to you..."}
{"file_id": "1132072.txt", "output_essay": "I agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do. My first point, which is most important, is that they are young. Since they are young, they have lots of energy to enjoy life in the ways they want. For example, if someone thinks he enjoys his life by playing some outdoor games when he has plenty of time. Now, if the thinker is a young person, he can just grab his stuff to play and go on. But suppose this comes to the mind of an old person; that's not easily possible because he has to quickly remember what kind of restrictions his doctor has placed on him. Another point is the lack of energy. He may not be able to perform that task even if he would enjoy outdoor games. He has to compromise with things like just watching TV or having family dinner parties, an easy way of enjoyment all older people prefer.\n\nAlso, the second thing that supports my agreement is traveling or trips, which lots of people like and are a good way of enjoyment. When all the friends come together and make a plan for a long trip, it is easy for youngsters because they are able to face all kinds of problems, starting from weather changes to walking miles away by foot when their car is out of fuel. But in the case of older people, they need support in such situations. They cannot face challenges as youngsters can. They need their medicines ready when weather changes occur, and even though they are prepared, they are not sure that their bodies can respond well.\n\nSo, basically, young people can enjoy their lives more than older people as they have enough energy to enjoy life in the way they want. But older people also have so many ways to enjoy the rest of their lives. As, at one time when they were young, they also had fun."}
{"file_id": "1135100.txt", "output_essay": "I agree in part with the statement that 'Young people enjoy life more than older people do.' The statement made by the author seems to be correct in some situations and proves to be wrong in others, making this statement debatable. I will give some examples to prove my point in this essay.\n\nThe author's statement mentions 'enjoyment of life.' This term is very relative with respect to people. Every person tries to live his life colorfully in his own way. If enjoyment means partying, then it may be possible that young people do it more frequently than older people, but when it comes to celebrating, older people do not step back from the younger generation.\n\nI do agree sometimes because younger generations have better and more suitable conditions for enjoying their time. Young people are enthusiastic, active, and have the energy to enjoy sports events by playing and cheering; they are very eager to explore new places. Young people with an interest in movies go for it whenever they get time. They go for picnics to have a change, and one thing that many young people generally enjoy is dancing continuously for hours. They enjoy various foods of different tastes many times. This can be termed as enjoyment.\n\nIf we accept the author's statement, then it would imply that older people are not enjoying life but merely carrying their life forward. The things which the younger generation does were done by the older generation earlier, and thus they have lost the charm in those things, and they do not have enough strength to do the same things continuously. However, they enjoy life in a different manner, such as sitting in a chair taking a sunbath, reading the newspaper, and giving advice to the younger generation. They are not able to taste various foods because of their physical conditions, but even then, they take pleasure in that food by hiding from other people. They are the leaders of the house; they have certain responsibilities to take care of. This can also be termed as enjoyment, but of a different kind.\n\nIn sum, we can say this point is quite debatable and requires sampling of people and other techniques to reach some conclusion."}
{"file_id": "1133423.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with the statement, but I have to point out several issues.\n\nI believe times have changed; therefore, we cannot expect young people to behave in the same way as young people from the past did. They might not give enough time to helping their communities, but this could be due to a lack of time and different priorities.\n\nNowadays, young people are individualistic because we live in a society that focuses on individuals rather than on communities. By the same token, young people focus on themselves and prefer to invest their time in personal activities instead of community service.\n\nI consider myself a young person, and from my experience, I can say that I am not interested in communities at all. Furthermore, I have lived in several countries, and what really strikes me is the fact that young people behave completely differently depending on the country they live in. For instance, in Sweden, guys are extremely independent, whereas in Spain, they are much less so; likewise, Spanish guys might care more about communities than Swedish guys do. So, in order to understand the question, it is necessary to place it in a specific context.\n\nThe responsibility for such a situation lies with society because society is constructed around individuals; rules are made according to what is best for individuals, thus they become the most important thing. Nonetheless, it is possible to notice strong nationalistic movements in Europe that emphasize communities. If European communities become strong, it would change young people's attitudes; hence, they would give enough time to helping their communities.\n\nTo conclude, I agree with the statement, but some aspects need to be considered before discussing young people and their attitudes. Young people behave completely differently depending on the country they live in and their culture; however, all in all, it can be said that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities."}
{"file_id": "1134015.txt", "output_essay": "I do agree with the statement, \"It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.\" Understanding ideas and concepts is not very easy, but once you understand them, knowing the facts becomes an easy job, I think.\n\nBased on my experience, when I was studying, I used to learn facts first and then try to understand the ideas. That was a huge mistake for me; I thought I understood what I learned, but I did not. I had understood in a totally different way, so I had to study again, which took much more time. Also, during group work, I was the one who always gave wrong suggestions, and it was very embarrassing in front of my friends.\n\nSo, from that point, I decided to change my approach to understand ideas first and then learn facts. It was a little hard for me at first, but as time went by, it became much easier for me to learn facts after understanding the ideas. Not only that, after I understood the ideas and concepts, I had a lot of questions to ask and opinions to suggest. Also, the time that I spent on understanding became much shorter, so I could study other things as well.\n\nIn class, I was the one who never asked questions or suggested my opinions, but that changed. How? I became the one who was most talkative in class because, to understand what I learned, I had so many things to ask and wanted to know more. So I knew from that time, because I didn't understand the concept, I had no questions to ask and no interest in thinking about that topic.\n\nFrom my experience, I do strongly agree with the statement.\n\nTo do easy work or better work, understanding the ideas and concepts is the first thing to do; then learning facts will be the faster way to learn, in my opinion."}

That is not an easy question to answer, but I think it is also the only question to ask in order to understand why advertisements have this particular effect.\n\nI believe that the main strategy used by market analysts is simply to influence people by touching their weaknesses. Every one of us, for example, or at least most of us, wants to be accepted by society (our group of friends or our colleagues). It is an unconscious process, but it is like that, and we can do nothing against it. As a consequence of this process, we tend to buy products that we feel could change the conception that others have of us; any object that could improve our social image is certainly to be bought.\n\nI will try to make an example. If I know that David Beckham shaves with a particular aftershave, I might think that by using that specific product, I will achieve the same social approval he has.\n\nThat is why most advertisements use famous people to sponsor a product: because we unconsciously want to be like them. Anyway, the question is whether there is a solution to this kind of problem. It is, in fact, a problem we are talking about because it is linked to a weakness of modern social communities.\n\nI simply think that, considering we cannot change the entire customs of our society, the starting point is being aware of this fact. This way of reasoning will make us more critical of advertisements, whose products will no longer seem as attractive as we thought they were before."}

I have recently come across a travel arrangement company that has their own dedicated staff as guides to help travelers have a memorable experience.\n\nThe guides, being local to the place, have good knowledge of the local places of visit and would help us get a good feel of the local culture by showing us the places that show the true local culture. There are even places of eating where we can taste the real flavor of the place. These can only be visited if we have a person guiding us to these places. Often, a guide is like a local friend helping us in staying at the best hotels at an economical price, eating the best food, visiting the best places.\n\nI would like to end the topic by stating that the guide is the best person who can make our visit exciting and help us out in planning the trip with only a little monetary cost."}

{"file_id": "1124099.txt", "output_essay": "It is often believed that young people enjoy life more than old people due to several reasons, which, in my opinion, are related to the availability of time and other physical and mental resources, such as enthusiasm. I believe that this view is, in some way, incomplete, although not entirely wrong.\n\nThe incompleteness of the view is given by the fact that old people are people with experience. This means that they can assign values to certain actions on the basis of their past experience. They know what to do in order to enjoy certain positive feelings, as well as what to avoid. This means that people, once they become old, have all the necessary resources to exploit their knowledge on themselves, and hence collect the fruits of their lives as young people. In addition, although some people believe that money does not make happiness, old people are more likely to have money to spend for themselves, making them enjoy life in more ways. This would imply that you start to enjoy life only at a certain age.\n\nHowever, there is the opposite point of view, which is the one of the statement. Young people, or at least most of them, do not have many things to worry about. It is up to their parents to control and administer the so-called 'dirty work,' while they are free to grow up. This shows that people, during the early stages of life, have plenty of time to dedicate to themselves, to the discovery of new things. If it is true that old people know what things they like and what they don't, with the advantage of not having to experiment anymore, it is also true that youngsters have the possibility of going through the process of discovering, which is probably the most interesting and fulfilling of all, as it gives you the opportunity of knowing new things and experiencing new feelings, which were previously unknown. For example, people usually remember their first kiss, rather than their last.\n\nIn conclusion, I would say that life can be enjoyed at every stage, when you are young and when you are old, although in different ways. The first period of life should be dedicated to discovering what you like and enjoy, while the last should be dedicated to the exploitation of such discoveries."}

If not, we will not feel concerned about very important subjects that are part of our lives. That is the reason why we need to accumulate a lot of knowledge while we are still in college.\n\nAfter being part of this learning process, and only after that, will you be able to choose one specific subject that truly corresponds to your personality, your skills, and your motivation. Then, you might delve further into the subject you have chosen to express yourself in the best way. If you were previously not interested in other general subjects, I am afraid that it would be difficult to envision things in a very mature and complete way.\n\nTo conclude, you should have a look around you to be open-minded, whatever your specialty may be, in order to be able to use a wide range of skills."}

On the other hand, some people are defenders of tour packages and rely on tour guides. I personally think that taking a trip, especially to strange and unknown places, requires a great deal of information about such regions.\n\nFirst of all, there are many unpredictable conditions which at first may seem so interesting while practically it could turn into an unwanted disaster. For instance, consider you want to go to a place which you have heard a lot about for its breathtaking and spectacular views. You are tempted to take a trip and visit that region. While trekking, you feel that you are stuck to the earth and cannot move. Suddenly, you realize that you are in marshland. In such a situation, there is no remedy, whereas you could visit there with a group.\n\nFurthermore, in a group, most people could take more responsibility, and all work is done more organized in comparison with individual actions. By sharing different responsibilities and tasks, no person will feel exhausted, and consequently, the journey will be more enjoyable for all. For instance, in climbing, one could prepare the food, or another could carry the stuff.\n\nMoreover, generally speaking, group collaborative actions increase an individual's sense of responsibility, and consequently, from a social aspect, these people could become good team players and in other social actions, they could act effectively.\n\nTo sum up, there are many virtues in group travels. Firstly, it decreases the possibility of occurring some dangerous and unpredictable events. In addition, sharing responsibilities among group members will make travelers relaxed. Finally, being in groups stimulates people's sense of responsibility for other social actions in the future."}
{"file_id": "1123304.txt", "output_essay": "In the past years, we have seen a growing conflict between older and younger people. In many countries, the gap between generations is growing due to demographic as well as sociological developments.\n\nUnemployment of young people is a huge problem in many European countries. In many cases, young people are not able to get a good education because of their immigration background or their social environment. Also, many young people are not able to find proper jobs although they have a good education because after massive job cuts in many multinational companies, no youngsters are hired at the moment due to slow economic growth and the consequences of globalization, which often causes outsourcing and transferring of jobs from expensive first-world countries to areas where production is cheaper.\n\nOn the other hand, older people are also affected by these job cuts. At the same time, European welfare states have to raise the retirement age in order to keep their social systems functioning and financeable.\n\nOf course, this development sometimes causes frustration on both sides. When older people who either have the will to work but don't find a job or who have worked for decades and are now retired see young people in the streets, hanging out, doing nothing (except skateboarding, listening to music, playing computer games, and shopping), they might get the impression that young people enjoy life more than they do or than they did when they were their age. And that impression, in my opinion, is probably correct. When today's old generations were young, in the forties and fifties, there was not a lot of fun stuff to do in Europe. They experienced the cruelty of World War II and the hard work that was necessary to rebuild the countries afterward.\n\nYoung people in Europe are lucky to grow up in a safe and often wealthy environment. They have the chance to do things older people were not able to: they can travel, they can communicate with strangers and friends around the world, they can get to know the world in a totally different way than their parents, grandparents, and great-grandparents were able to. They have the time and possibility to do sports and other fun activities and to enjoy their life - maybe more, or at least in a different way, than many older people do.\n\nMaybe this way of lifestyle many young people have, containing traveling, extreme sports, and other ways to test their personal limits, is a way to cope with their 'Zukunftsangst', with the scary feeling many youngsters have, that they have to be flexible all the time, they often don't know what tomorrow brings them and they are not sure if and how long they will have a job (and if they are lucky to have a job, they have to pay for the older people's retirement, probably without ever being able to profit from this system themselves).\n\nI think young people have all rights to enjoy their lives as long as they can - sooner or later it will get tough anyway. Older people shouldn't complain about this but rather try to understand the situation teenagers and twentysomethings are in. And sometimes they should even talk to their grandchildren and tell them: 'It's alright, enjoy your life. Go and have some fun!'"}

I can provide several reasons and numerous examples to support my view.\n\nNowadays in Italy, many individuals engage in civil service. This is a public, non-profit organization that offers a variety of free services to the community, and the people who work there are often young men and women. Additionally, there are many private organizations that do not receive financial aid from the state, where people work voluntarily without any wages. These organizations also have a significant number of young participants.\n\nI can assert this because I have friends, and my girlfriend too, who are involved in such activities, and I greatly admire them for their choice. For instance, my girlfriend volunteers with a first aid organization, and I know that it provides numerous services, such as healthcare to the elderly and first aid during accidents where injured individuals must be assisted.\n\nFurthermore, it is quite common to see young people volunteering with these organizations at sports or music events. In fact, whenever there is a football match in my city, young volunteers from first aid organizations are often present to provide assistance.\n\nAlthough I admire this choice and would like to participate, I cannot do so because my university studies are quite demanding, leaving me with little time to start such an activity.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the many examples I have provided in this essay, I can affirm that I disagree with the statement posed by the question.

It speaks to me about one of the good ways to succeed in our major, which is using our imagination for new things and taking risks. Also, I agree with this opinion and want to talk about it in more detail.\n\nFirst, I want to talk about new things. When I was growing up, I heard many successful people's stories, such as those of Edison and Nobel. These people accomplished their dreams by using their imagination to try new things. In addition, it is based on our civilization's development because people always want to have good, interesting, and convenient things. So, from the invention of new things, they will buy those and be satisfied. In other words, the invention of new things can bring in more money, and sometimes we can gain fame. As a result, it is a good way to become successful.\n\nThe second reason is based on taking risks. Risks are dangerous in our lives. For example, if we fail to make some good new things, we will lose everything, such as our house, family, and other things. However, if we prepare before risks start, we can reduce them. In addition, if there are no risks associated with new things, we cannot create new things because new things are always related to some risks, which are dangerous in our lives. Although, sometimes we can figure out risks for our success, we try to make new things. Moreover, we have to take care of ourselves and always prepare for bad situations. By preparing for bad situations, we can reduce the damage when some risks occur.\n\nIn our lives, we always demand new things more than before. Even if it can take risks for the person who tries new things, it is a shortcut to becoming a successful person. Sometimes, by overcoming bad situations, we can become important people. For these reasons, I would like to say that trying new things and taking risks help us to become successful. Moreover, these behaviors make us positive and considerable people."}
{"file_id": "1141936.txt", "output_essay": "I disagree with the notion that understanding ideas and concepts is more important for students than learning facts. There are two reasons: steps of study and the correctness of ideas. The first reason is that it is necessary to learn basic knowledge to understand ideas and concepts. If students lack basic knowledge, they cannot grasp the entirety of it. For example, students in Japanese universities primarily learn basic facts. Then, they begin to study their applications. This approach is derived from the evidence during the long educational history in Japan. Therefore, it is an important step of study for students.\n\nThe second reason is that learning facts is essential for forming correct ideas. It is doubtful that students truly understand ideas and concepts without learning facts. For instance, in nutritional studies, if students do not know about nutrients, they cannot understand the metabolism of their body, and cannot discover new ideas and pathways of the body system.\n\nFor these reasons, I disagree with the assertion that understanding ideas and concepts is more important for students than learning facts."}
{"file_id": "1135299.txt", "output_essay": "I completely agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do. Enjoyment is symbolic of freshness. Age is certainly a big factor in determining the freshness of heart needed to enjoy life to the fullest.\n\nThe most important factor supporting this idea is that young people are free from responsibilities and day-to-day life woes. They are either dependent on their parents or have some support for themselves. This kind of independence enthuses them to feel free, thereby adding to the fun in their lives. Older people, being experienced, have families to look after. Their domain starts and finishes with their families. So, their enjoyment is limited to family, colleagues, and close ones. Moreover, with the passage of time, the feeling of being satisfied with life increases. The needs shrink to the bare minimum, and emotional support dominates over feelings of enjoyment. Especially those who enjoyed a lot at a younger age tend to move away from enjoyment in older age. Take, for instance, countries like India and Sri Lanka, where older people find pleasure in spiritual activities and become more inclined towards leading an ascetic life, refraining from enjoyment altogether.\n\nAnother factor that helps young people to enjoy life more is the state of their health, which is certainly better than that of older people. As age advances, the body does not allow all activities that could be done during youth. For example, young people can have no limits on eating, say, chocolates, but older people can't do so.\n\nYoung people, being adventurous at heart, tend to take challenges, make new friends, and thus expand their social circle and broaden their horizons. On the other hand, older ones do not mix up so easily and rely on already established relationships. Another argument favoring the statement is that since older people have already enjoyed at some point in their lives, they feel fulfilled and complete in themselves and are left with practically no desire to enjoy. Thus, it is quite convincing to believe that young people enjoy life more than older ones."}

They say that they just really like to see the audience laughing.\n\nI know of a group called 'Guardian Angels.' The group consists of about 50 young people. The members patrol downtown, and if they find someone who needs help, they assist or advise him or her. For example, when they find girls who are under 18 or younger after midnight on the street, they convince them to go home earlier.\n\nAnother example is a young woman who helps her community develop their sightseeing industry. She works at a travel agency in her small town. Because she wanted to make her town well-known, she decided to promote it. She planned a festival and carried it out. People in the town cooperated with her and brought a lot of food, crafts, and souvenirs to the festival. As a result, many people came to visit her town, and the town has improved its sightseeing industry.\n\nThus, many young people are associated with their communities and contribute to them.

With a tour guide, we see our decision being influenced by the guide, and we get to see places the guide wants us to see rather than what we want to see.\n\nIt was on my school trip that my classmates and myself had a pretty bad experience with the guide appointed to us.

In today's advanced world, we get to have information about a place at our fingertips through the internet. We also have amazing travel guide books that come in various languages and help us in getting a feel of the local culture.\n\nI would like to end the topic on the point that I took this decision based on my personal experience and the other travel experiences that were great just because of the fact that we didn't take a guide along."}

Young people have ambition, the look to the future, the ability to get new information about technology as life is widely opened for them to gain experience and learn new cultural, scientific, and social themes. They have the health and capability to enjoy different programs for entertainment, have the chance of getting new friends and relationships, and keeping them. But do they have enough support or backup to help them achieve what they like to do? For example, a young couple may like to take a long vacation from work to travel to a new country to enjoy their love and life, but they may not have enough money as they are at the beginning of their employment life. Moreover, vacations may affect their promotions. On the other hand, they are responsible for other people, for example, they have to take care of their parents or kids. A lot of young people have a shortage of entertainment facilities for financial reasons, or they have to obey other persons who are sponsoring them. The young are under tension and pressure of life and have not had enough experience to take over problems. On the other hand, older people have a lot of relationships with friends, colleagues, family members such as sons or grandsons who support them and take care of them, in addition to gaining properties through life and financial independence. But some of them might get health problems, which most of them are controllable now. An older couple, for example, can enjoy themselves with no worry about somebody else. A lot of them believe that what is going to happen will happen, or they let go and do not care much about the future. An old man once said that life is composed of three sections: the first thirty years of life a man has health and enjoys his job as he has something to do in life but not too many responsibilities, and he has enough time to spend on leisure and entertainment, but he does not have money to achieve his wishes. The second thirty years a man has health, money, but he has to work hard to carry on his success, but he does not have enough time. The later life, there are time and money, but no health. But in summary, I thought I have enjoyed my life when I was young by a lot of things, mainly friendship, passion, and love, all with the experience of establishing a family of our own and how happy we were.

Young people may wish to experience emotions that they have never tried before because of their age. They might like to start a family, and so they try all they can to find a good partner, enjoying any occasion they have in order to reach that aim. Moreover, they would like to experience work. They would like to enjoy the jobs that they eventually find and they will try to appreciate all aspects of them, as they represent their first experience in the labor market.\n\nYoung people might enjoy life more than the elderly because, as they are young, they have more energy to embrace life itself. Unlike old people, young people enjoy sports, such as football or basketball, which are an essential part of life and which require a lot of energy that older people generally do not have.

Instead of improving existing tools, he decided to design and invent a new instrument, the personal computer, which caused a revolution in work and entertainment activities. He risked wasting many years of work on something uncertain that could have been a failure. It is now clear that he spent his time in a very fruitful manner and that he will be remembered as a genius.\n\nOn the other hand, some people have succeeded in exporting good ideas to other countries with different cultural backgrounds.

But if you persevere and overcome these difficulties, you will earn a valuable degree from an excellent university that will allow you to access better job and income opportunities.\n\nIn conclusion, I think it is always worthwhile to try new things and take risks.

I would like to support this statement for the following reasons.\n\nFirst, by understanding the ideas and concepts, we get a clear image of the aspect. For example, if we are studying a particular subject, it is important for us to identify the main idea of the topic and the concept involved in that particular topic. By simply learning the subject without understanding the concepts, that subject will remain a mystery to us, even if we spend a lot of time on it.\n\nSecond, by understanding the ideas and concepts, we are able to know how to live in society. That means we are capable of dealing with problems and our colleagues. For example, if we want to ride a car, we must first understand the ideas and concepts, which means how to start the car, how to accelerate, and how to move the gears. By understanding all these, and then practicing, it will be easy for us to ride the car; not only does learning help us.\n\nThird, when we encounter new software or subjects, it will be better for us if we understand the main idea and what the improvements over the previous one are; then these software will be useful for us.\n\nConsequently, the conclusion is that we must learn facts, and we must also understand the ideas and concepts of what we learn; then only will it be useful for us.

At the same time, the question arises whether it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects or to specialize in one specific subject. What do you think of the issue? As far as I am concerned, I agree with the idea that it is better to specialize in one specific subject than to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects. In the following paragraphs, I will add some examples and details to support my point of view.\n\nIn the first place, specializing in one specific subject has advantages in various ways, the most significant of which is that it saves our time and energy. We have to point out the essential fact that we do not have enough time to finish every task well, which means that we cannot perform well in many academic subjects. If we focus on one subject, we are able to spend enough time on that subject. Therefore, we will have more chances to be successful in the subject we concentrate on. For instance, if a student whose major is computer science studies art to broaden his eyesight, he will not have much time to study his major, which will influence his grades and credits. As a result, there will be negative effects on his studies. Consequently, we will make good use of our limited time to study if we concentrate on one subject.\n\nIn the second place, what is also worth noticing is that specializing in one specific subject will bring benefits to our future job. As we all know, in the future we will find a job that we are interested in. In that case, we should focus on one subject that attracts us a lot. Then we will find a good job after graduation because of our professional knowledge. For instance, if we study biology, we are able to learn more about the subject, which means that we can gain knowledge related to biology. Therefore, when we have the interview, we will have a lot of academic knowledge to discuss, which will leave a good impression on the manager. We will get the job we want easily.\n\nAdmittedly, if we have broad knowledge of many academic subjects, we will become knowledgeable. However, if we have knowledge in a variety of aspects and we do not know much about each subject, it will have negative influences on our future life, which is not good. Therefore, I tend to hold the opinion that it is better to specialize in one subject in which we have a lot of interest and from which we will benefit.\n\nTo sum up, taking into account what has been discussed above, I can draw the conclusion that specializing in one specific subject is better than having broad knowledge of many academic subjects. I hope that an increasing number of people can benefit from the one subject they specialize in."}

Take history, for instance; if we learn only about the extensive damage of various countries during the Second World War, these are historical facts, but they are too specific and can lead to confusion about whether we are learning about the damage to each country or about the Second World War as a whole. In this situation, to avoid confusion, we must first learn about the facts.\n\nIn my opinion, we must prioritize learning facts over ideas and concepts to understand what is important and grasp the main idea. This involves studying the main topics of a major and understanding the features. However, the most crucial aspect is to comprehend the features and use them to understand the main idea."}
{"file_id": "1131319.txt", "output_essay": "Nowadays, young people are more involved in many activities than in the past. For this reason, some may assert that young people don't dedicate much time to helping their communities. As a young person, I can express my opinion and support my disagreement with some examples. The first example I support is that young people do not have much time to help their communities because they don't want to, not because they lack the time. In fact, I can help my friends if they ask for a hand, even if I have to study for myself. If I am devoted to a friend, I help him in every way. However, this means I have to forgo some time playing on the computer, taking a break, going to the shopping center, or running, for example. I suppose that the people who made this statement only know selfish individuals who think only of their lives. But at university, for example, students spend a lot of time together: they attend the same classes, talk during breaks, have lunch together, and become like a family. In a family, if one member has a problem, the others help him. This is also true at university. In fact, helping each other can make passing exams easier and university life less daunting. Also, in the family, young people often help quite well (and more than just sometimes or seldom): as a young person matures, their responsibility increases, and they recognize the importance of helping parents. They can do this in various ways: working in their spare time to earn some money for their personal expenses, so they don't have to ask their parents for money, or by cleaning the house or their own room. Naturally, there are many young people who don't help their families in any of these ways, but I can't generalize. Just as the person who made that statement should not generalize."}
{"file_id": "1140603.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with the statement because I perceive more people engaging through individual efforts or formal non-governmental organizations in helping communities that are in much poorer conditions than their own communities.\n\nOne might think that competition to succeed in today's world would keep young people very busy and therefore overlook the need to help. However, young people are helping, but not necessarily in their neighborhood.\n\nAs communities achieve a better living standard, less is required to do if you are part of these communities, and efforts to help are redirected to people in real need, either because of natural disasters or structural poverty.\n\nThere is a growing number of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that raise funds to help poor people in less-developed countries. Entities such as the Red Cross, Oxfam, among others, are present with projects in those regions to help provide access to water, health, education, and food.\n\nMost of the volunteers working for these NGOs are young people who prefer to give a hand wherever it is most required. The reason for having this outside-focused help is the improvement of communication and information systems. Today, people are aware of what is happening worldwide and where the need is more pressing.\n\nEverybody is aware of the need to help others, regardless of the economic-oriented situation of companies. One example of this is that companies are more concerned about how others perceive their role in society. Corporate social responsibility has become a very important element in the decisions of companies that want to have a good reputation. They increase it by donating funds to NGOs so they can send people to help out there, not necessarily in their own community."}

One of the reasons is that they do not have time to spend on those things. They must spend most of their time studying in order to get good grades and go to a well-known university.\n\nAlso, young people nowadays are not good at communicating with others and hesitate to meet new people. This occurs because people no longer talk with neighbors as much as we did before. There is one example in my community. There was an opportunity to visit a house, which was for elderly people to live in, within the community. It was an opportunity only for children, but there were only two people who attended. The reason why the rest didn't come was that they were afraid to meet and talk with new people.\n\nAnother reason is that young people nowadays are not interested in helping communities. Schools do not teach how important it is to help the communities and join the activities; they only teach things that the students need for exams. Adults should encourage young people to spend more time helping communities."}
{"file_id": "1140280.txt", "output_essay": "Students encounter many kinds of information in their courses or lectures. This can be regarded as an information overload for students. The lectures usually include ideas, concepts, and facts which students should learn and use. I assert that students should try to understand ideas and concepts instead of facts in their lessons in order to be successful. Understanding ideas and concepts rather than facts offers knowledge that is more lasting and provides students with a deep and total understanding of topics.\n\nFirst of all, a student has two choices when studying a lesson: memorizing the facts included in the subject or understanding the main concepts and ideas covered in the subject. If he or she prefers memorizing to understanding, his or her knowledge will be lost after some days. For this reason, focusing on ideas and concepts is more useful and helpful than learning the facts.\n\nAnother important advantage of understanding ideas and concepts is the deep and total understanding of the subject. Ideas and concepts have more meaning than facts. In other words, they are more valuable in terms of meaning. On the other hand, facts may be just a case or a specific situation. They are narrow and generally have meaning only within themselves. It seems that students should take more interest in ideas and concepts than in facts.\n\nTo conclude, it is up to the students whether they pay more attention to ideas and concepts in the subject or not. The other choice is memorizing facts in the subjects. Understanding ideas and concepts is more lasting and provides students with a deep and total understanding. After considering the two advantages of ideas and concepts mentioned before, they are enough to prove their importance."}

The only information from school that never left a person's mind is the data that he understood clearly. About 14 years after I graduated from university, it is interesting and curious to see how I can explain most of my knowledge to my son. Most of that information was very well understood, not just memorized.\n\nAfter a couple of years, even if a person has a good memory, he won't keep in mind the concepts and knowledge that he never understood. I learned a lot of verses from the Bible when I was a child because my child's school taught me those verses. But now, because I do not repeat them all the time, I have forgotten many of them. I didn't care to understand them; I just learned them to get a good grade. But now, all I can remember are the verses that were explained to me and those which have importance in my life.\n\nI think education today should focus more on explaining things instead of just letting students learn them.

In fact, as a student, I find it essential to first try to understand the ideas and concepts that underlie the facts I must learn. \n\nIf a person does not understand the why behind the facts, I think it is not useful to learn about them. In my experience, I always try to understand the reason behind an event. Because I think that if I understand the basic concept, it will be easier to learn the fact and not forget it. \n\nI study criminology, and for my work, it is fundamental to understand why a certain event happens, what the principal cause is that leads to a certain type of event. For example, it is not important for me to learn the fact because I must understand the reason behind a certain type of behavior, not just the outcome of it. \n\nFor my field of study, it is not important to learn the fact but the reason. But I think this is not only useful for my field of study but for all fields. For example, in the scientific field, it is also very important. It would be very important to understand the reason why a certain natural event is happening, for example, and not just learn the events alone. \n\nIn conclusion, I think that if a person wants to understand facts very well and not just learn them because of school or because someone says they must, they must question themselves about the basic ideas and concepts linked to those events. Even if, for example, the event they must learn is not a positive one, they should try to approach it in a different way."}
{"file_id": "1138108.txt", "output_essay": "Advertising was created to make people buy things. Nowadays, competition is very significant between brands, and each brand must struggle to convince people to buy their products. Marketing departments handle this.\n\nAs for me, I do agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.\n\nBecause of globalization, we can now find almost whatever we want in each country, and more particularly in developed countries. This implies that competition is very fierce since there are so many products available for customers. The choice is huge, and how can we decide which product to buy when we do not know them?\n\nAs a consequence, brands launch many advertising campaigns. They do their best to create the best campaign. Thanks to advertising techniques, they enhance their products as much as they can because they need to have the product that will most catch people's attention.\n\nUsually, when someone looks at a billboard or watches a commercial on TV about a new food product, it is so well promoted that we are most of the time very interested in the product and very excited to go and test it. But we are unfortunately often disappointed. Indeed, if I take the example of a new burger launched by McDonald's, the burger will seem very good in the picture. However, when I go and try it, the bread will be too dry, the cheese will not have the same appearance, and so on. And once again, I will wonder why things are almost never the same as in the advertising.\n\nAdvertising agencies usually deal with significant budgets, and they use amazing techniques sometimes to enhance the product.\n\nNot only are the aspects not the same, but also the features are not what they claim to be. Actually, some products promise to do this or that, and when you try them, the result is not what you were expecting.\n\nFinally, I would like to add that this does not only occur with products but also with famous people. Most of the stars you see in magazines are gorgeous, but in real life, they are not the same; you can be very surprised. All this is due to marketing that makes everything or everyone seem perfect."}

In contrast, older people may have difficulties having their wishes and desires fulfilled.

Minimal interest in trying new things is obvious in an elderly person. Contrary to young people, who have the energy and stamina to perform tasks, ambition and the lure of the exotic take over their minds. They try everything and taste life in all of its colors, discovering, learning, feeling, and performing more missions every day, every moment.\n\nEmotions do have a big effect on a human being. Old people understand that they have aged; they know for a fact that their mission in life is almost over. Some are sensitive about death and don't want to lose their families and friends. But younger people view life as a long journey, a horizon of opportunities they should grasp to succeed. They have their whole lives to look forward to.\n\nThe mental condition is a huge barrier for older people. They gradually start to lose their ability to think clearly and remember information, which is a big hassle for them. They know that their organic computer (brain) is starting to disintegrate and diminish, but they can't do anything about it.

{"file_id": "1131377.txt", "output_essay": "I definitely think that it is very good and essential for an individual to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects. By knowing about many subjects, one is more comfortable in interacting with all kinds of people because it will not be difficult to have a healthy conversation as we will not be totally unaware of what the other person is talking to us about.\n\nAnother important reason why we should have knowledge about different subjects is that we never know what bad phase in life we might go through. To be able to stay put in all situations and to be able to work our way through all difficult times, we should have at least the bare minimum knowledge required in every field. This broadens our horizon to work and not be stranded in various situations in life.\n\nIf we have only specific knowledge about one field, it is not always necessary that we may have enough luck in our fate to make it big in that field. To keep that door of opportunity open for us at all times, we should have knowledge about a variety of things in life. Let's take the example of a simple clerk who has been used to entering data into a register manually all his life. With the development of science and technology, there will come a time in his professional life where his company might install computers to manage the data. The clerk would now be required to work on this new marvelous invention. If the clerk had always been satisfied throughout his life with his manual labor and had not updated himself with this new technology, he would have been blank as to the knowledge of computers, and this would in turn lead to him losing his job, where someone who is computer savvy might get the job; but having been updated with happenings in different fields, the clerk would find it simple to navigate through the system, in turn making his work easier for himself.\n\nThis was a very small but very effective example as to why we should be in touch with things that are going on around us. As they say, 'little knowledge may be dangerous.' Keeping this in mind, I firmly believe and state that it would be in our best interest if we knew more things about other fields as well, rather than just knowing everything about one."}

{"file_id": "1126144.txt", "output_essay": "The business meaning of advertisement is to show what you are not. So, I completely agree with the fact that advertisements make 'bad' products seem 'good.' Mostly, advertisements talk about the bad products.\n\nToday, advertisements are everywhere. Turn on your television, and it will show you advertisements, mainly with certain gaps which are called programs. You turn on your PC, cross a busy road, or do whatever; you cannot get rid of an ad. Now comes the business aspect. Why is there a need for so many advertisements? Two words have the answer: 'purchase' and 'profit.' All advertisements are the brainchild of some unsuccessful products which the creators want to make successful.\n\nSo, why does one need to advertise his product? To make it famous? Yes, maybe, but the most dominant reason is to sell and to make a profit. Why do you need an ad if your product is so good? I witnessed the same situation when I was young. I loved one chocolate of a particular brand. I never saw its advertisement on TV or in any journal. Now, suddenly one day, I saw its ad which told me that it has changed. Joyfully, I went to a shop, bought one, only to discover that the price had increased and the packaging had become more glossy. That's the magic of an ad; when the product is right, you don't need to advertise it.\n\nAdvertisements are very lucrative because of their 'free' offers. I have seen thousands gather in front of malls to get a free offer with a particular product. So, what is the motive of the free offer? Nothing comes for free. 'Free' is the word that is seen by all; we need to see some invisible information, such as a decrease in quality in place of 'free.' Once, my mom bought vegetable oil after seeing a wonderful new ad for the reduced price product. Later, she discovered that the expiry date was already over.\n\nIn some cases, what an ad tells is a complete lie. Our favorite actors and actresses don't bathe with that particular soap which they advertise. These are just to promote sales.\n\nI mostly got the worst products whenever I was prompted by an advertisement, so my suggestion is: 'don't be fooled by any advertisement.'"}

On the other hand, there are people who do what they already know well.\n\nSuch two different types of handling risk will reach final success. People have different opinions about their own ability to take risks. When I think about such differences, I talk about two friends of mine. One boy is about 35 years old. He achieved one of the best school examinations with a grade of 1.2 during his school period. He began studying law and finished university in less than the regular study time of 4 years with very good grades. His first contact with the economy, or in general with business, took place at 26 years old in a big company as an assistant for law-specific questions for consulting contracts. He was very resistant to risk, perhaps because of his first contact with the business world. He had been in such an office and position for almost 9 years without a lot of experiences, but also without trying any higher risk than leaving home 10 minutes before the regular business closing time.\n\nMy second example is a boy who is 28 years old. He finished school with a grade around 2.5, which had been the average in his final examination year. He started his own business idea after his examination. His business was about offering IT solutions for small and medium-sized companies. In the time of the new market economy, many companies used the consulting work of his company. He had a lot of fixed customers who needed his help regularly. During such a period, he had the idea to export the concept to other countries, which he started in 1999 with Austria.\n\nBanks helped him to fulfill such a target by offering a lot of money. After two years, he had four offices outside Germany and a sum of 4,500,000 Euros as a negative balance at the bank.\n\nThe concept failed due to the crash of the new market, and he lost all his standard of living almost in 2 months and will not be able to pay the whole balance to the bank in his lifetime.\n\nAs a conclusion from my two examples, the level of risk cannot be argued by the level of school education, meaning the final examination grade, and the university status.\n\nMoreover, people with the ability to take risks will have faster success and will stay there if they control themselves regularly. The risk of falling down due to uncontrolled mistakes is more realistic compared to risk-averse people.\n\nHowever, every human being has to decide for themselves which goals and objectives they want to reach and how fast to get there. In addition, such factors will determine the level of risk-taking ability and success."}

It is necessary for people to notice their products and find them impressive.

By showing a specific advertisement many times, people can become accustomed to the product. For example, the iPod, which I bought after seeing many advertisements and my favorite entertainer with an iPod, is a good example. The iPod is a very popular item. Many Hollywood stars have this item. Many people have bought it. We can see iPod advertisements everywhere. We can also see the goods in movies or dramas. It seems to us many times, not only through direct advertisement but also indirectly, such as endorsements. One of my friends has this iPod. She told me she bought the product because it just looks good and she was attracted to the iPod's advertisement. She also saw many of her favorite Hollywood stars with this item, so she found the item more attractive. I also purchased an iPod because I saw its advertisement more often than other products, and I saw my favorite actor, Jung Il-woo, with the product.

I believe students should have enough time to help their communities.

Sometimes, life experiences bring really important insights that people need for their lives. Communities are just as important as life experience. When talking or chatting with others and friends, they will learn many things they want to know. For example, if we study with others, we can obtain much information that is very useful compared to studying by ourselves. Nowadays, our lives are changing, and people can no longer find time for themselves.

This trend can be attributed to different factors, such as the world's population growth or the lower cost of vehicles that leads to higher affordability for the demand.\n\nThe population keeps growing, as I mentioned, and for this reason, more people are willing to buy cars. Also, as also mentioned above, the low cost of production, given by modern technologies and new materials, allows more people to buy a car.\n\nAnother reason that makes more people willing to get a car is the improvement of the transportation system pretty much all over the world. We see big highways and roads being built every day so that more places in the world become better connected to each other.\n\nThere are many countries, such as Italy, for example, where the public transport system is not fully developed; for this reason, a growing number of people prefer to have their own car rather than to rely on a way to travel that is not as efficient.\n\nA psychological reason also explains why more cars will be seen in twenty years from now than today; society tends to be very individualistic and less social than it used to be. For this reason, more people prefer to be independent when they get around, and the car becomes their own shell.\n\nCars cannot be replaced simply because people need them to go to work, to travel, to see places in complete freedom; sometimes people just want to get the pleasure of driving them and feel a sort of freedom.\n\nBecause of all the above reasons, I believe more cars will be produced and sold in the future; therefore, in twenty years from now, we will see more cars than today, not fewer."}

{"file_id": "1127832.txt", "output_essay": "Although the basic concept of advertising is to promote a product or a service, I do agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they actually are.\n\nAdvertising for products is essentially the process used to convince potential buyers that the product in question is fit, suitable, and the best in the market. However, most advertisements blow this definition completely out of proportion by marketing a product which ends up being radically different when finally used. The degree of exaggeration used in advertisements to convince the buyer is at times ridiculous.\n\nAdvertisements in the fast-moving consumer goods domain, especially, strictly adhere to the policy of displaying a completely wrong image of the products, which makes them seem much better than they actually are. An example that comes to mind is a commercial for a leading shampoo product which claims to not only put hair back on the heads of its balding users but also rejuvenate them to the extent that they will be able to compete with the best drivers in the world on a Formula One car racing track.\n\nAdvertisements in various other sectors also mislead users into believing that the product will offer qualities that it was never designed to provide in the first place. Although one of the selling points of a good advertisement is, in some cases, to provide a tinge of humor to go with the product, certain advertisements and brands use this to the extent that they make their products seem too good to be true. Various mail-order catalogs for exercise systems are also another clear example of how the end product differs vastly from the advertised one.\n\nEspecially in today's world, where common opinion has it that media overpowers print, people look to advertisements, especially on television, to help them make informed choices about which product suits their needs better. This dependency may not be large when it comes to everyday products, but in cases of products which are highly expensive and involve large investments, some advertisements can often mislead people's decisions. An example to illustrate this is the advertisements for real estate projects or finance and tax-saving instruments, and more recently, even in job searching portals. Some of the advertisements have caused people to make incorrect decisions due to their assured but unrealistic claims.\n\nAll in all, my belief is that advertisements should help people make informed choices and should make people aware of the product. A certain degree of humor and make-believe is alright, but the core functionality of the product itself should not be made a fantasy, as is the case with many of the advertisements in today's world. I therefore ardently agree with the fact that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are."}

Second, electric energy is a good source of energy, but the problem is that nowadays electric energy is generated by conductors which work on petrol, so that brings us back to the first problem.\n\nThere are no definite solutions to the problem of petrol depletion; the only thing people can do is try to decrease the use of petrol now to try and stall this crisis from happening. So, in my opinion, in twenty years there will definitely be fewer cars in use than there are today."}

Commercials on TV, huge billboards, and other kinds of advertisements influence and manipulate people to make them buy products. Are these advertisements really truthful, though? Or do they promise things that don't even exist?\n\nI personally think that most advertisements make products seem a lot better than they really are. We just have to look at TV commercials to realize that they often promise more than the products actually offer.\n\nLet's look at the pharmaceutical industry, for example. Every day we hear about new cosmetic products for beautiful skin or pills that help to lose weight. I tried many of these products and I was never pleased with them.\n\nAnother example of false advertising is food commercials. Specific products we see on TV often seem to be a lot larger than they actually are. With the help of computer programs, people are able to make their products look better on TV or on paper. They use specific technical methods to convince their customers of their items.\n\nA third example of the lack of truth in advertisements is the methods politicians use to get more votes. They often promise great achievements and advertise with big headlines on billboards that they are going to improve the country's situation. I have gained the experience that they usually don't keep their promises.\n\nI come to the conclusion that we should be really careful about believing what advertisements promise us. Many of them don't tell the truth about their products. I personally think that these false promises are even the essential element of advertisements. We know that their only purpose is to convince people. Therefore, advertisements always only show the positive aspects of their products. Besides, our economy puts a great amount of pressure on firms trying to sell products. There is huge competition between companies, and everyone has to sell as many products as possible in order to survive. This forces people to create advertisements that are convincing and persuasive, even if that means they have to hide the truth and be unrealistic."}

I agree with the above statement that young people do not give enough time to help their communities. There are many reasons to support this.\n\nFirstly, in this competitive world, young people are much concerned with their career, goals, and their aims, so they are more involved in their studies. As a purpose, they go to college regularly and study their day-to-day lessons regularly. The subject matter has become so vast that they have to refer to many books, and it takes much time for them. So, they do not have much time for other activities, such as helping their communities.\n\nSecondly, people nowadays show much interest in enjoying themselves with their friends. They either go to movies, restaurants, pubs, or playgrounds with their friends. They are always in a mood to enjoy themselves. They do not help the communities because they do not spare their time to work on good things and help their communities.\n\nThirdly, people these days have become very selfish and they do their own work, which is helpful to that particular individual. They do not want to help their communities, which would be beneficial to all. That is why they concentrate mainly on their work rather than helping the community.\n\nFinally, nowadays people are more attracted to media such as television, newspapers, magazines, weeklies, etc. People are more focused on these, learning about the world through newspapers and news on television and other means. There is also a rapid growth in the importance of computers and the internet, and it draws the attention of young people towards it. Young people are much attracted to finding new things, and they browse the internet, spending most of their time finding out information that is useful to them.\n\nDue to these above-stated reasons, nowadays people, mainly youngsters, do not spend enough time helping their communities."}
{"file_id": "1146161.txt", "output_essay": "Over time, marketing and advertising strategies have changed and improved in order to attract more and more attention from the public. One way to do this is by creating advertisements that make products seem much better than they really are, which I truly believe for several reasons.\n\nFirst of all, I had a personal experience where I bought a lotion that promised to make a person lose a certain amount of inches in the waistline. The actual advertisement showed the typical before-and-after picture. After using the product for a while, and even finishing it all, nothing happened. I didn't lose any inches, in fact.\n\nSecond, some companies make the product look better by simply omitting some information or by having it appear on the advertisement in small letters. This information is, in some cases, crucial, such as side effects, contraindications, among others.\n\nOn the other hand, if companies' advertising strategies do not maximize the benefits of the products, they won't be able to compete successfully with other products in the market and therefore won't be able to maintain a position in the economy.\n\nIn conclusion, most companies nowadays have to make their products look really efficient; otherwise, people won't buy what they don't believe will work properly or won't meet their needs."}
{"file_id": "1141177.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with the fact that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts. Ideas and concepts are two essential factors for learning. Ideas are the ways by which one can learn about something through past knowledge, experience, or imagination. Concepts provide the fundamentals of learning things.\n\nTake, for example, a car and an aircraft. Both are different objects for transportation. The idea behind developing them was to create different means of transportation fulfilling the different needs of humans. The basic concepts involved in their development include the laws of motion and pure sciences. The fact is that a car is used for transport on land, whereas an aircraft is used as a means of transport in the air. It is important for a student to understand the ideas and concepts rather than learning the facts first. The facts can be learned once you are proficient with the ideas and concepts. If students only know the facts and not the concepts, their learning would be limited. If they continue to learn things this way (by knowing facts), they would not be able to apply the knowledge of their learning.\n\nEmphasizing further, it would be important for students to learn the ideas and concepts first, which, when combined, would give rise to facts. Thus, a student who has learned the basic idea and concept of the laws of motion could automatically understand the facts involved with that.\n\nIdeas and concepts, as well as facts, are different ways of learning things. But ideas and concepts are the foundation pillars of your knowledge. The strength of your building (knowledge) lies in your foundation, not in your aesthetic view (in this case, fact learning), which just gives a shallow understanding of the strength of your building foundation."}
{"file_id": "1141674.txt", "output_essay": "Considering the population of the world today and the distribution of income rates among countries, it is hard to give an immediate answer to the question about the number of cars in use in twenty years' time. Let me briefly state why I have chosen to emphasize ambiguity instead of an exact answer.\n\nFirst of all, the population of the world is growing rapidly, which might create the impression that there would be more cars in use as there would be more people living on Earth. This is true for the case of Turkey, for example. I have observed that automobile galleries in Turkey are the best profit-makers and also that the number of cars sold increases dramatically each year. But, taken from another aspect, it could quite be the opposite. The rapid growth of population is observed more in underdeveloped or developing countries whose gross national product or income per capita is very low. Then it would be more likely for the citizens of such countries to tend to use buses or trains, which would be a much cheaper way of transportation. In India, for instance, one can easily notice this situation.\n\nSecondly, the increase in the number of people living in a city might push its dwellers to make use of public transportation. Not because these people cannot afford to buy cars, but because they don't want to lose their valuable time on roads, stuck in the middle of a never-ending traffic jam. Let's take the example of New York City. Even the mayor of this city is said to be using the subway in order to evade the traffic and promote the use of subways. Yet, there is also the case of California where we can see anyone at any age own and drive a car. Because of its geographical characteristics, it is almost impossible to live one's life without a car in Los Angeles. Not that the city is as overcrowded as New York, but because there are miles between any two destinations.\n\nAs to my personal observations, there are a body of reasons both to agree and disagree with the statement. In the end, whatever the signs and predilections are, we live in a world of unpredictability and surprises. Who knows whether a genius scientist will come up with a more time and energy-saving invention than a car, or not?"}
{"file_id": "1143795.txt", "output_essay": "Technology is constantly evolving day by day. In the next twenty years, people might not use as many cars as they do today. Although cars are currently the primary mode of transportation, advancing technology could introduce a new vehicle that may replace today's cars. Additionally, the scarcity of resources may compel us to reduce the number of cars.\n\nNowadays, many people use cars all over the world. The greater the number of cars in use, the higher the demand for resources to fuel them. In the next few years, the fuel we currently use for cars may become scarce. Consequently, the world may have to abandon the use of cars as they run out of fuel. Therefore, people will likely seek alternative fuel vehicles, potentially decreasing the number of cars used in the next twenty years.\n\nThere has always been a cycle of new technology replacing the old in this world. People are always eager to discover new technologies. Since cars are a fast and comfortable means of transportation within cities, they are used in large numbers. If a new car with advanced technology and better speed is introduced to the market, people will rush to buy it. To meet people's needs, there might be a new vehicle, possibly a small aircraft, that enters the market and captures their interest. Then, people will naturally put their cars aside. Thus, the era of cars may shift with the introduction of a new mode of transportation, relegating them to the background.\n\nThe advancements in technology, the changing needs of the people, and the evolving environment may, someday—probably in the next twenty years—reduce the number of cars we use now."}
{"file_id": "1143274.txt", "output_essay": "\"Mom, I do not want to study these theories again and over again,\" said my little child. So many questions about this crossed my mind, like: What is really more important for a student to know, understanding ideas and clear perceptions, or taking facts as they are printed in their textbooks?\n\nThis issue, which describes the types of learning, is really a controversial issue for plenty of reasons. As far as learning is concerned, I wish to see changes in the ways of learning at many levels and angles. I personally strongly believe that a person, in general, should be given the opportunity to understand the ideas and concepts first, because that is what shapes a person's personality. Let us take young children as an example; most of these children have their personalities shaped by the time they turn ten years old, because all the abundant perceptions, knowledge, ideas, and even things which they like and dislike have already been configured. A soldier is another example; this fighter learned the concept of loving his country when he was a kid, didn't he?\n\nAnother thing I would really do, if I had the chance to change something in how our young students should be taught, is that I would build a whole city of learning. I would make it unique in its given courses. It would be built based on the concepts of loyalty, love, teamwork, and encouraging individual talents. Moreover, no normal tests would be given, because they would be taught that the concept of examination is not always the right concept. Also, they would have weekly debates about larger concepts like enthusiasm, ethics, aesthetics, and racism to have these young generations prepared to involve themselves in real life.\n\nIn conclusion, learning concepts is the best way for someone to have a balanced family, community, and even country, because it is a circle of wise ideas, which never fails. In my opinion, no wars, no violence would exist if evaluating our concepts and respecting other concepts were everybody's dream to fulfill."}
{"file_id": "1145791.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with this statement. In my opinion, being successful requires you to be uncommon. You need to have some unique qualities in order to be recognized and acknowledged by the public. Repeating the same things in which you have acquired perfection might earn you attractive results initially, but in the long run, they aren't much fruitful. The competition in all fields of life is very tough these days. So, to overtake others, you need to possess some distinguishing characteristics. Working on the same project again and again is not going to solve your purpose because gradually other people also acquire mastery over them and may even surpass you. Though trying to do new things, say, for example, starting a new business, may ultimately turn out to be a disaster, and in that context, the other view appears to be more appropriate, but as we all know, 'failures are the stepping stones to success.' History is full of instances that support the idea of endeavoring new things. One common example is of scientists. It's well-known that only those who have tried to innovate have been able to register their names in the books and are remembered even after hundreds of years. What if Einstein had accepted the already running theories? The concept of relativity would have never arisen, and of course, Einstein couldn't have been able to get the Nobel Prize. There are numerous other examples of various leaders, businessmen, researchers who became successful only because they tried to introduce new concepts. To name a few, Mahatma Gandhi, who pioneered the Indian freedom movement, businessmen like Bill Gates who introduced Windows and revolutionized the computer industry, and now he stands as the richest man on earth. So, based on the above-mentioned examples and facts, I am of the opinion that only those succeed who do new things and take risks."}
{"file_id": "1140045.txt", "output_essay": "It is a hot topic that successful people love to try new things and take risks rather than continuing to do what they already know how to do well. Many different people hold different opinions from their respective angles. On this topic, I must say I agree that success belongs to those who like new things and are not afraid of risk. There are two reasons to support my idea.\n\nFirst, I think the most important quality is discovery. People who like to explore new ways can always find a solution when they encounter problems. In contrast, if you just rely on the traditional way to solve a problem, you are limiting your options and may not overcome it. In other words, if you are not afraid of the problem and face it, you can easily find that it is not a problem for you. For example, when I was a child, I needed to wait for my mom to pick me up and take me back home after school. One day, my mom couldn't pick me up because my grandmother was sick, and she needed to go to the hospital. At that time, there were no mobile phones for contact. My mom was very nervous that she could not find me. Meanwhile, I tried to find something to do and went to the library. There, I met my brother who was studying, and he took me back home finally.\n\nSecond, another quality is bravery. People will succeed because they are not afraid to try any means to accomplish their goal. Generally, many methods mean many chances. That also means you are increasing your chances when you are trying something new.\n\nIn conclusion, because of the above reasons, I strongly believe that people who like new things and adventures will find success more easily."}
{"file_id": "1145300.txt", "output_essay": "Advertising is the art of convincing customers to buy specific products. It is obvious that advertisements do not provide complete information to the customers. That is not their original purpose, even if they sometimes provide useful information, and other ways exist for customers to get information about the products they want to buy. For example, many independent websites compare all the models of the same product available on the market.\n\nBut even if advertisements are not supposed to provide complete information, they often describe some features of the product. In doing so, they cannot lie about objective characteristics because it is illegal, and the advertisement would be prohibited by the competent authority.\n\nThen, how can advertisements lie to customers? The way to describe a product can be very subjective, and this is obviously the case for advertisements. For example, if you present a car with a very beautiful girl or boy driving it, you don't lie, but you give the illusion that the car is better than it would be with a normal driver. That is seduction. Advertising is seduction. When you are interested in someone and you have a date, you do not wear everyday clothes. You take more time to appear \"much better than [you] really are.\" That is seduction too, and nobody seems to be against this kind of \"subjective lies.\"\n\nIn my opinion, the statement \"most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are\" is true, but that is not a problem because everybody knows that advertisements are subjective. There is a game of seduction between companies and customers. We have to know the rules and take part in the game. I think that life would be less interesting without this kind of subjective communication, beyond technical descriptions."}

However, if we consider the perspective of the elderly, they might not have as much strength in their bodies or minds to enjoy life by visiting other places, friends, relatives, and various entertainment venues to spend their time. \n\nA youngster can enjoy life with friends, going out, attending schools, colleges, and jobs, but the elderly may not have this opportunity. Older people may lack patience and interest in certain activities, so many prefer spending their lives at home or in guest houses, playing with their grandchildren. Although attending schools and colleges might not be interesting to some youngsters, in my point of view, it is still an interesting part of our life that, if missed, can never be regained. \n\nStudying new things is very interesting, rather than sitting at home chatting with the neighbor and watching TV. And I guess most elderly people spend their time chatting with another old person and watching TV. They might not enjoy new technologies and inventions that the youth might be enjoying. I guess that even elderly people in those days might not have had as good an education as this generation and might have missed many facts and details that this generation knows. \n\nI hope that the advantages I have listed above are also a part of enjoyment in everyone's life. I believe that the youth in today's generation are in better working conditions than people in the past. That too is a form of enjoyment that the elderly miss out on because people in those days must have worked hard and toiled a lot, but now we have machines for everything, which makes our jobs much easier.

These people have very few chances to be successful.\n\nI think it is very important to have the courage to take risks in life. But at the same time, a person should also be intelligent enough to analyze his plan of action. For example, if a person wishes to start a company, he should plan and work on a lot of things. Firstly, he should analyze the market and see what effect his product has on the market. Then he should take care of the finances. Starting a company or business or any enterprise requires a lot of courage because it might work and it might not.\n\nSo one should have the confidence and courage to go out in this competitive world and give your best shot. If you fail once, it does not mean that you will fail every time. One should keep trying till he or she succeeds. But it is also important to learn from your mistakes and try not to repeat them.

{"file_id": "1129532.txt", "output_essay": "Most people think that enjoyment comes from experience, but in my opinion, when we first experience something, we enjoy it more. There is a saying that a thing is attractive until you get it; in other words, when you wish for something and do not get it easily, you are more keen to get it. After getting that thing, you lose your interest in it. This is human nature. So the meaning is that younger people enjoy their life more than older people because they experience things for the very first time. I also agree with this opinion that young persons enjoy life more than older people.\n\nTo support my opinion, firstly, I would like to discuss the tendency or the nature of youngsters. First of all, they are very curious about new things. They want to explore everything regardless of the danger associated with it.\n\nFor example, when I was a kid, I was always curious about parachutes, and one day what happened, I just jumped from my rooftop with an umbrella. At that time, I did not know what fear was. So the meaning is that you cannot expect this kind of absurd behavior from an older person. Even if an old person does not know the harm associated with the task, he/she might not take the risk.\n\nSecondly, youth do not care for moral values, whereas old people do follow them strictly. From their experience of life, senior people know the value of ethics and would like to follow them always. On the other hand, teenagers are unlikely to follow the moral values, or they follow them reluctantly.\n\nThirdly, in my opinion, you can enjoy life if you don't have restrictions on your activities. Old people have responsibilities towards society, as well as towards their own family. While youngsters are free to do whatever they want. For instance, I like to dance publicly, and I do whenever I get the chance to do it. But I know some older people cannot do it because first they think about others' opinions, such as what would society think, or what would be the impact on children.\n\nLast but not least, young people are always open to new ideas or cultures, while older people have narrow minds. It is easy for a youngster to adapt to a new culture in order to learn it. On the other hand, senior persons are rigid to their own culture in order to preserve it.\n\nThe conclusion is that although it is true that older people enjoy life based on their own lifetime experiences, I strongly hold the view that youngsters enjoy life more than them. The main reasons are the will to explore new things, no responsibility, less regard for values or ethics, and more energy to enjoy life."}

I do not prefer to travel alone as I believe that when you travel with friends, you can take utmost pleasure and gain more information from the travel, as there will be many questions for the tour guide due to the presence of many brains, not just one. I just want to emphasize this by using an example from my travels with my friends.\n\nI am a history student by profession. In the last year of my college, I had to submit a thesis on a great monument, the Taj Mahal. It was a tour where a group of four, including me, went to New Delhi, India, where the Taj Mahal is located. It is one of the ancient cities in India with a great history and also the capital of the country. There, we hired a tour guide, who is believed to be the best in the place. While looking at the monument and listening to the information from the guide, we were astonished by the history, beauty, and the efforts required for its construction. There were many areas in the monument whose names we had not even heard before; that is, none of the books contained these details, which are very important for our observations and thesis. There were many questions that were asked by our group to the guide. I think my share of questions would be only one-tenth of the total. Then, I realized the importance of traveling together. I felt that if I had come to the place alone, then I would have learned only one-tenth of the information for the thesis, which would have reduced my scores. After coming back from New Delhi to our place, we checked our share of expenditures for the travel, and it was only 40% compared to the expenditures if one travels alone.\n\nWith the above-mentioned example, I believe that traveling in a group with a tour guide not only helps in getting more information about the place you visit but also helps in reducing your expenditure for the travel. It reinforces your relationship with your friends. You will remember and recollect your experiences and incidents from the travel throughout your life."}

In my culture, they believe certain things that they call \"facts,\" but I do not believe most of the \"facts\" that they believe in.\n\nI was born in the United States, but my parents sent me back and forth from Egypt to America, so I have lived here and there. One of the \"facts\" that they believe in is that a young woman should not move out of her parents' apartment if she is not married. They also believe this concept that they call a \"fact,\" even though it applies if she is going to live on campus so she can continue her education. This idea is not a fact, even though some people, including my parents, believe that it is. When I tried talking to them about it, they tell me how it's a fact and how it is not an idea or a concept because it has been going on for years.\n\nAnother thing that I believe is an idea, and my Egyptian culture calls it a \"fact,\" is that an Egyptian cannot marry a non-Egyptian; they have to marry an Egyptian. When I ask why, they respond with an answer like, \"That's how it is.\" When they respond with an answer like that, why should I believe it is a fact and not a concept? When I lived in Egypt, they used to tell me a man can marry a non-Egyptian, but a woman cannot. And when I asked why, they told me it's because when you have kids, they become what their father is.

Young people most of the time are not interested in helping and developing the community in which they live. Just a small part of them is really interested in the topic. Often, this new generation is selfish and is worried about satisfying their needs instead of opening their minds to the community. I can say that many things have changed during these years; in the past, people's commitment was much more developed and felt compared to these days. My parents, my grandparents, really believed in the possibility of creating a better place to live; moreover, they tried with a lot of effort to improve activities that could make the community a better place. There was the trust that something could change if you are really interested in what is around you.\n\nNowadays, I think that the responsibility to take care of the community has disappeared altogether - young people think that it is not their problem, being worried about community enhancement, thus the common belief is that just the government has to promote and support it. Furthermore, young people are not interested in this aim because there is not for them a clear return in terms of money or materialistic benefits. This generation has lost the beauty in believing in the power of ideas. They do not fight anymore for an idea but just for themselves.\n\nAn example of the difference between the past and the current days could be provided by a short story told to me by my grandfather. In the 1940s, my grandfather was very interested in the problems of our town. He was a person who tried to improve the economic condition of our city and to develop the spirit of the community. In that period, in my small city, there was no cinema. The citizens of that time complained most of the time about this kind of lack, even because in that period the cinema was something new and it appealed to most of the people.

They have a vigorous body and therefore a vigorous mind. Mix these with a good moral education and a spirit for adventure, and the result can be a young adult that truly and deeply enjoys his life.\n\nOn the other hand, older people tend to be limited by their deteriorating bodies and have to deal with a limited diet and activity plan. They can have the moral base and the unbreakable spirit of a young person, but their bodies will not keep up with these for a long time. It is obvious that the range of physical activities available to young people in life is much greater than that available to old people. Skydiving, snowboarding, rock climbing are some examples of activities off-limits to older persons.\n\nThe second advantage young people possess is their fresh outlook on life. This view of their lives has not been tarnished by mistakes, torn relationships, or failed attempts. Their emotions are strong, and every new detail life brings to them is embraced with passion.\n\nOlder people tend to carry around old memories of lost loved ones, of failed attempts, torn relationships, mixed feelings, which in turn drain spiritual energy that would otherwise be used in more effective ways to enjoy life.

There are so many examples in which we can observe this difficult part of life. One of these situations is when people decide to marry. Nobody knows exactly if the person he/she is dating will be the best or the right one to share the rest of his/her life with; therefore, when you decide to make this kind of decision, there is always a great risk involved. Unless you don't want to risk anything and remain single for the rest of your life, but if the person decides to do this just because the fear of marriage is more powerful than the decision to take risks, then some problems might arise, and this person could spend the rest of his/her life in loneliness.\n\nTalking about another field, profession to be exact, this is an important part of every individual's life, and it is very important to decide what kind of job you want to do in the future. You may feel attracted to a career but feel inside that you are not smart enough to accomplish all the responsibilities that this kind of profession implies. Therefore, you decide to stay where you are or choose another field which looks much easier for you, or probably you will be doing something that you already have an idea of what to do, even though you feel that you really would like to try something different. When this happens, it is not a good idea to close your mind to the world of possibilities and give the 'highly complicated' career a try. After trying, then it becomes acceptable to fail, but I absolutely disagree with giving up on situations that can change your status in life. Before adopting a negative attitude of pessimism or self-consciousness, it is better to get up, look up, and try to move on to the world of opportunities where there is no room for anybody who does not take risks."}
{"file_id": "1145645.txt", "output_essay": "Introduction:\nNew things create success and help individuals reach their goals, leading to invention. I agree with the statement that successful people try new things. This is because only by trying new things can they achieve success in life; otherwise, their life remains stationary.\nFor example, Bill Gates is a model for everyone in the computer world. He succeeded by reaching his goals because he tried so many things differently. In my opinion, trying new things is the mother of invention. Many scientists, by trying differently and facing numerous problems, have created a wonderful life for us.\nFor example, Thomas Edison invented the fluorescent light bulb, which changed our lives a lot. After that, several changes occurred due to the trying of new things. If we want success and growth in our life or job, we definitely need to try new things. Only then will we be able to surpass our competitors and succeed in life.\nTherefore, I strongly agree with the statement that all people succeed by trying new things."}

Therefore, I definitely agree with this statement: brain exercises are more useful and important than memory exercises.\n\nThe first step in the education of any human brain is to learn how to study and understand a new idea. Learning by memorizing new facts is only a mechanical exercise that cannot increase our intelligence. Therefore, if we can understand a concept, we will be able to remember it, and it will be part of our knowledge forever.\n\nSometimes students try to learn facts because they think that it is an easier way to learn; but this idea is completely wrong. Only by understanding the real and essential meaning of a new concept will the student be confident and able to use it in their future.\n\nIn addition, it's important to underline that the role of teachers is to encourage students to analyze and study new ideas. For example, I remember in my high school the support of my favorite teacher who was trying to teach me how important it is to study subjects in depth instead of learning facts.\n\nIn conclusion, I want to emphasize again the importance of understanding ideas and concepts because it is the best way to increase our knowledge and our intelligence: that is the real exercise for the human brain."}

Keeping this in view, I would like to agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. This may include many aspects like inventing things, understanding the other side of the coin, or finding alternative solutions to problems.\n\nFirstly, take the point of inventing new things. The inventors who discover something new couldn't either know what the result is going to be; it's a sort of risk that is taken by them. But what if they succeeded in inventing that? Then there will be some more glory added to them instead of just sitting quietly simply because they have already done well and fearing the risk they have to take.\n\nAfter all, 'failures are stepping stones to success.' They may learn something new by failure, which will definitely be useful again. Secondly, take the point of finding another solution to an existing problem. If the Indian president A.P.J. Abdul Kalam had not risked the launch of a rocket into space, people could not know the information about what actually happens on other planets or the interesting points about space that we know now. Though it was a failure the first time, he did not stop there and followed the saying 'try and try until you succeed,' which brought him great fame.\n\nThirdly, consider the case of the invention of many metals by scientists, which was invented through experiments that risked their lives. But those people are more successful in life because they had fame and importance even after their period.\n\nThese people did not do what they already know how to do well. In fact, they risked their lives for the discoveries they have made. Finally, I conclude by saying that each and every individual should always take risks in doing new things, which will definitely yield better results."}
{"file_id": "1127050.txt", "output_essay": "Choosing between a broad knowledge of many academic subjects or a good specialization in only one specific subject is not easy, as both possibilities have advantages and disadvantages. However, I agree with the idea that it's better to have a broad knowledge of several different subjects, and that for several reasons.\n\nFirst of all, a person with a variety of interests and knowledge in different fields is probably a person with an open mind who shows strong intellectual curiosity. Famous intellectuals of the past, like Leonardo da Vinci, just to name one of the most well-known, had an incredible variety of knowledge and curiosities. Then, having a broad knowledge of the world in general might help people in their career and professional life. Also, having a good knowledge in a variety of subjects doesn't necessarily mean that a person can't have a special field of interest in which he or she is more competent.\n\nAn open mind and a broad culture can be a great advantage in a fast-changing world like the one we live in today. In fact, we must be ready and able to adapt to different situations and conditions.\n\nOn the contrary, if we are too rigid, if we are overspecialized in a very particular field, we might be unable to get the whole picture, so to speak, and we might be less flexible, less able to cope with any change we may have to deal with in our lives. Of course, there's nothing wrong with being very good in a particular subject we like more. I think that only overspecialization is wrong. If someone is competent and interested only in a very special field, he or she might be very good at his or her job, but might not be able to adapt or to react to situations that require a more general approach.\n\nSometimes you read in papers about terrible mistakes doctors make in their work, such as not understanding exactly a patient's disease or simply confusing symptoms described by patients. That can be due to the fact that some doctors are extremely well-prepared in their field, but are sometimes unable to analyze the whole situation, and they might miss the fact that they are dealing with people and not just with sick kidneys or livers, to give an example.\n\nFor all the said reasons, I do believe that having a broad knowledge of many subjects and keeping the curiosity and passion for learning all our life is definitely better than limiting our knowledge only to a specific field of study."}

If you stay in your comfort zone, you will never improve and grow to become a successful person.\n\nWe are all born with no knowledge; we don't even know how to walk, which is one of the first challenges we face in life—to learn a new thing. If we were to start life staying safe and not exploring, we would not even know how to walk.\n\nLater in life, we have to push ourselves to go to school and become part of a class, and keep trying new things like reading, writing, improving, and getting smarter.\n\nBy the time we take that first job, we have already done a lot of things out of our comfort zone, new things, and there are people who at that point in their life are comfortable with where they are.\n\nIn my opinion, you have to keep going. Trying to innovate, change, and grow, learning new skills that can make you successful in what you really want to do. Becoming successful means something different for everybody. To me, a successful person is one that knows what they are looking to get from life and is not afraid to try new things in order to do what makes them happy.\n\nI think everybody should take the risk of doing new things in order to become successful and happy people.\n\nThe last time I took risks doing something I did not know how to do well was learning to surf. Now it is one of the things I like best in my life, and I cannot picture myself living in California not surfing. Taking risks pays off."}
{"file_id": "1142846.txt", "output_essay": "Some people like trying new things and taking risks. By contrast, other people always do what they already know well. There are some advantages and disadvantages to both approaches. However, I believe in the saying: 'No pain, no gain.' Trying new things and taking risks are worth doing.\n\nFirst of all, success comes from innovation and risk. History shows that only brave and creative people have made an impact on human life. For instance, Thomas Edison invented light bulbs. During his work, he tried thousands of kinds of materials. He did not succeed until he found the last one. In fact, he was not sure if he would find the right material all the way through. He took more risks than others could bear. As a result, his courage and perseverance have changed our lives.\n\nSecondly, the reason people are scared to try is that they are afraid to fail. Nevertheless, failure is the mother of success. Even though they may fail after all the hard work, the experience they acquire is invaluable. The newly gained precious experience will, in turn, lead them toward their destiny. This is a common process for success. Without trying, this process will never happen.\n\nThirdly, staying where one is will eventually make him fall behind. In the 21st century, everyone is trying to overcome any adversity to achieve their goals. If someone stops progressing and does what he already knows how to do, he will be left behind. Therefore, taking risks and breaking the mold is the only way to survive in this competitive society.\n\nOverall, in one's quest for success and victory, trying new things and taking risks are two vital factors. As people strive to advance, those who stay the same are destined to be the last in the race of life. Only improvement brings eternal success to a person."}
{"file_id": "1146557.txt", "output_essay": "In a rapidly changing world, it is clear that those who do not understand ideas and concepts are unlikely to succeed. Some argue that it is ideal to learn facts. However, I agree that it is unrealistic to learn facts because doing so prevents them from developing their knowledge and finding more rational facts.\n\nFirst, learning facts does not increase their knowledge. This is because if people learn facts, they become weary of the facts, which makes it difficult to develop their creative knowledge. For example, a recent study shows that students who learn facts produce knowledge 30 percent less than students who understand ideas and concepts. This is because students become fed up with simply facts; it makes them dull. As a result, learning facts prevents students from developing their knowledge.\n\nSecond, understanding ideas and concepts helps students find more rational facts. This is because they can find more rational facts from experience to understand. For instance, my son has learned from learning facts to understanding ideas. I was disappointed whenever he did not understand the principle of something. However, after he changed the method of learning to understanding ideas, he found more rational facts. If he had chosen to learn facts, he would not have been able to find more rational facts.\n\nIn short, it is impractical for students to learn facts since it leads to lower knowledge. Furthermore, experience in understanding ideas and concepts helps them find rational facts. Although it's easy to learn facts, it prevents them from growing in their professional lives."}
{"file_id": "1136669.txt", "output_essay": "Yes, I do agree that most of the advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. Advertisements, in fact, in today's world, do not only display the product's essential features and its looks. Instead, they are supposed to be a glorified display of the product with the fake promise that it is and will prove to be a very valuable product, which will indeed provide enough customer satisfaction. In some cases, the promise may turn out to be true as it totally depends on the company and the 'product,' the real one.\n\nAdvertisements are supposed to be, in some cases, only heart winners! I say 'only' because the products of that same field, competitive products, are all but equal in terms of the quality or quantity they provide. It's only upon the marketing and advertising faculties of the organization if it can make it look 'much better than it really is.' And only when it makes a place in the customers' hearts would it be sold and the profits for the company flourish.\n\nIn a world of competition, the manufacturer is compelled to make the product perceived as the best it can be. And indeed, as supported by the studies of the current markets, the products that are well advertised are the most sought after by the particular segment of customers. Indeed, if you add a bit of sheen to your product or make it look bigger, better, 'tasty,' or tempting to the public on the TV, magazines, or any other means of the media, chances are that the customers in and except your clientele would be at least somewhat lured by the product. And though they might buy it only after careful examination of the product and considerable reviews from their friends, they are at least ushered to go to the markets and check out how and what it really is. Now, the actual sales of a product would obviously depend partially on how well it really resembles the advertisement 'glorification' and partially on the competition it faces.\n\nSo, in my opinion, the advertisement in today's world is a necessary part of the marketing process. As real as it can be kept, it should be. But I would consider it compulsory to give a bit of weight to the product and its features."}
{"file_id": "1148789.txt", "output_essay": "It seems that young people nowadays don't give enough time to help their communities; I agree with this statement. However, it only seems that way. I am twenty years old, so I'm young, and thus I'm part of the youth. From my point of view, I believe two things about this fact. Firstly, I want to focus on the fact that young people do help; they want to help. They want society to ask for their help, feeling the necessity of knowing that they are part of something useful and that society needs many parts. Society and their communities need every young person to run a better society and to feel needed. Young people want society to ask for them! And that is where I want to arrive; nowadays, society portrays an image of young people as if they are lazy, as if they only want to have fun and be with their friends. And at least, as if society doesn't expect any positive reaction from them. A lot of young people travel abroad to underdeveloped countries to help as volunteers. The fact is, they can be volunteers in their own countries; they can take care of people around them; they can help in charity projects in their countries... But what happens? Most of the time, their own communities don't ask for their help; they don't know they can help in their own communities and build a better society. In conclusion, I can state that society doesn't encourage young people to help, and that is why young people act in these two ways: They become complacent because they believe society doesn't expect anything from them; or they travel abroad to underdeveloped countries where they believe their help is truly needed. From my point of view, and apart from what I have said, there are people who are responsible for their communities and feel the necessity and the aim to help in their own community. Moreover, they see their community's needs and want to help and satisfy them as much as they can."}

Additionally, participating in parties and celebrating festivals for nature and the anniversary of the city they live in are useful contributions to society.\n\nOn the other hand, many young people do indeed help their society in very obvious ways. Numerous students enjoy visiting children or elderly people in hospitals to offer assistance. This is a truly wonderful act on the part of the students.\n\nAs a student, I can observe that this statement is not universally true and cannot be generalized to all students. There are some who are lazy and do not help, but there are also those who are eager to assist and possess a helpful and friendly demeanor."}

It is very hard to imagine our lives without cars. Thus, with the increase in the world population and the idea that everybody needs a car, I do not see that there will be a drop in the number of cars in the next twenty years.\n\nCarpooling is a subject being discussed everywhere in the world.

{"file_id": "1150906.txt", "output_essay": "Although some people, perhaps marketing majors, may argue that a product consists of both its physical form and the good advertisements that present it, even if they are not entirely correct, I do not agree at all with this view. In my opinion, a product must be judged as good and, of course, bought according to its quality, and advertisements should be based on the quality of the product and should not make the product seem better than it really is.\n\nThe main concern with this marketing habit is that low-quality products are actually invading the market, and consumers cannot distinguish between a good item and an item that is only well-presented. Furthermore, despite its low quality, a product of the latter kind is often much more expensive.\n\nAs an example, we can take Timberland shoes. In my country, I see a lot of people buying them only because they have been influenced by the advertisements. Moreover, the shoes of that brand cost nearly three times the price of a high-quality pair of shoes you can usually find in a shop; the difference between the two is the misleading advertisements. However, I do not mean that Timberland shoes are a low-quality product, but of course, the sole difference between these and the ones that are not presented in the same way is the price.\n\nI could also have brought up more meaningful examples, but the problem would remain the same: we should care more about quality and the quality-price ratio."}

I have always believed that you have to understand everything that you are taught. This is a very controversial topic, but I believe I have a clear panorama of my thoughts.\n\nThe first reason I incline toward this decision is that learning facts doesn't give you an internal satisfaction with a certain topic. There is a famous quote by Ignatius of Loyola S.J. which states: 'The knowing doesn't satisfy the soul, but the interpretation and likeness of the things internally does.' This is a very reflective quote because when you learn a fact, you don't acquire its concept completely; you have like an empty space. For example, in philosophy, you can know the point of view of every philosopher, but if you don't understand them, you could never know what they really meant.\n\nThe second reason is that the human brain tends to forget easily things learned but not interpreted. For example, the things that you learned in 9th grade, sometimes you forget them when you are in 10th or 11th, because you don't really grasp the concept completely. On the other hand, if you learn something and understand it well, you will remember it forever, or if you forget it, with a little thinking you will remember it and could use it correctly for other aspects in your daily life.\n\nFinally, I would like to say that people who always memorize facts and don't understand them completely usually have fewer resources for achieving success in life because of their lack of understanding and interpretation in essential matters. However, people who truly understand all the things that they are taught usually develop an ability to solve problems faster or be more original in their thinking."}
{"file_id": "1143676.txt", "output_essay": "The issue of whether one should have broad knowledge of many subjects or should specialize in one specific subject has aroused heated debates in the modern era. Advocates for the broad knowledge concept argue that this approach helps widen a person's outlook. Contrary to this approach, some argue that in a world of specialization, it is crucial to master one subject to be successful in life. I personally feel that there should be a balance between the two approaches. I will present the pros and cons of each approach and then illustrate why I emphasize a balanced approach.\n\nIn today's dynamic world, it is imperative for a person to have broad knowledge of various academic subjects. This not only helps to acquire a broader perspective but also increases efficiency in decision-making. For example, a marketing manager of a Fast Moving Consumer Goods company decides to launch a promotional campaign for a product. Knowledge about the financial issues related to the campaign can be really helpful in decision-making. If he lacks knowledge about finance, he might make an expensive plan that could be rejected due to the company's financial constraints. Knowledge of other subjects such as finance, strategy, and human behavior can help the manager make better-informed decisions. This example clearly shows the importance of having broad knowledge of many academic subjects.\n\nOn the other hand, there is no denying that this is a highly competitive world. The most prominent successful people today are specialists in their respective fields. An obvious example is successful doctors. Not only do these doctors have to specialize in fields such as dentistry, pathology, etc., but they also have to acquire higher postgraduate degrees in their specialist fields. Very few people today would prefer going to a general doctor for their medical problems.\n\nI support a balanced approach as I feel this can make a person a balanced individual who has enough broad perspective to make effective decisions and is a specialist in his own field. If the marketing manager in the above example is a person with broad knowledge about many academic subjects, he might find it difficult to devise a marketing strategy, which requires core and in-depth study of marketing-related policies. Similarly, if he is just a typical marketing specialist, he may overlook vital information related to different subjects and end up providing a poor solution. If he takes a balanced approach, where he is a specialist in his area but also knowledgeable about other subjects, he will make better decisions and succeed in life."}

However, what they do not account for is society and its demands. With time, our society has been evolving; it has become more demanding, more particular, and much younger.

Pushing one's own company to success is not just related to hard work but also to the ability to take risks. Exploring new paths has many advantages. For instance, the company may face less competition. Additionally, customers are usually open to new ideas and products. Thus, venturing into new territory, combined with hard work, could lead to the desired goal.\n\nMoreover, imagine an entrepreneur who is determined to achieve success in a business solely through hard work and an old idea.

However, since promotion is not the most important thing in an employee's life, I disagree with the above-mentioned statement.\n\nIn addition, people who want to gain power, even in a multinational company, would do better if they learn the structure of the company well, instead of trying to recreate it anew.\n\nIn summary, success means different things to different people.

It goes without saying that during their educational journey, students should grasp the ideas and concepts embedded in the information they receive from their professors.\n\nFirst of all, students who learn from a renowned professor should assimilate information from him, which can enhance their research and experiments. Subsequently, they understand what he has accomplished in his experimental career, including his ideas and expectations for their work.

Moreover, those who aspire to conduct an experiment must be prepared to wait patiently for extended periods. When students decide to participate in research, they must familiarize themselves with the system they will use; thereafter, they can become experienced researchers through these kinds of studies.\n\nTaking everything into account, in light of the aforementioned reasons, the understanding of the ideas and concepts of information is very significant for students. Once they grasp these ideas and concepts, they can reap numerous benefits that can be applied to their own lives."}
{"file_id": "1147187.txt", "output_essay": "I partly agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities because of a lack of time and a lack of awareness. It also depends on the individual attitudes of the people.\n\nMost young people have busy schedules, and they don't find time to help their communities. Again, it depends on their individual attitudes. I have seen many people who willingly neglect.\n\nThey willingly neglect and think helping communities is a waste of time, even though they have ample time.\n\nYoung people always try to find fun and act reluctantly when they are asked to help. It is because they are not aware of the benefits and the happiness they get out of it. Studies alone don't count; you should also have a helping nature.\n\nOn the other side, there are many youth organizations that specifically aim at helping their communities and people in need. We have many blood banks where young people come and register every day. They collect blood and send it to hospitals when needed for free. They organize events and give prizes to those who donate blood to inspire young people. We also have organizations that go around and collect money and send it to people affected by environmental disasters. When the tsunami catastrophe left many people homeless, these youth organizations collected huge amounts of money and handed it over to them, winning their hearts.\n\nSo, it is not that young people don't help; it is that they don't spend time due to a lack of awareness. It is only possible by young people because they are energetic and dynamic in whatever they do; all we need to do is motivate them and tell them about the importance of helping. Elders should teach young people about helping others and spending some of their time on those activities.\n\nSo, I conclude that young people don't give enough time to helping, but they are not so cruel that they don't extend a helping hand when needed."}

{"file_id": "1147675.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with the statement that \"Most advertisement products seem much better than they really are\". For two main reasons, first, the main goal of advertisement is to sell, and the seller would try to show their product in the best way they can. On the other hand, advertisement campaigns can make the consumer think that owning the product can make them feel or be a certain way.\n\nAs said in the introduction, the main goal of advertisement is to sell and make the product likable and attractive to the consumer. This may result in distorting the real product. For example, with food products, to be able to transmit a flavor, which is a sensation, through visual images, the advertiser needs to overly emphasize all the visual characteristics of the product. This may result in a distortion of the real sizes and appearance of a food product.\n\nAs a second argument, the advertisement can make consumers believe that by acquiring the product, they can feel or be a certain way. For example, women's shampoo campaigns always show a prototype of a woman's hair. The consumer may assume that the type of hair that the person in the advertisement has would be the same as what she would acquire if she uses the product. That does not necessarily mean that the product seems much better than it is, just that the consumer is making assumptions about the product, but this is a direct consequence of the advertisement.\n\nThe desire of the producers to sell their product to the consumer may end up distorting the product by making it seem much better than it is, basically because of assumptions that the consumer is drawn to by the visual images of the advertisement."}
{"file_id": "1148681.txt", "output_essay": "Some people think it is not necessary to learn many academic subjects and obtain broad knowledge from them. However, I think it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects because we can apply our broad knowledge to our real lives.\n\nFirstly, some people believe it is not necessary to have broad knowledge because they think it is a waste of time and unnecessary. Moreover, it is really hard to learn a variety of subjects. For example, in Korea, Korean middle schools force students to learn about 12 subjects. But this has become a serious problem because the education program does not consider students' abilities or interests. Recent research showed that more than 50% of Korean middle school students are dissatisfied with their academic program and consider it a waste of time. On average, 30 students are going to study abroad each day.\n\nHowever, I think the broad knowledge that we have learned is very valuable in that we can use it someday. For example, I learned Home Economics and Technology in school. At first, I was skeptical about why I had to learn about things that I was not interested in and did not find valuable. But one day, I had to cook food by myself because my parents were not at home. I couldn't think of anything to make. Then, I remembered that I had learned how to make a Korean traditional food called 'Bulgogi.' So, I could realize the importance of broad knowledge.\n\nOverall, I think it is better to learn various academic subjects and obtain broad knowledge as it will be helpful for our lives, even if it is not related to one's personal interest. In my opinion, even though people don't feel the necessity of learning various subjects, it doesn't mean that they have wasted time. It has its meaning that they have tried."}

The purpose of advertisements is to convince people to buy the products in a short time. In the modern world, there are so many messages trying to catch the attention of people that reaching this goal is not easy. The advertisement has to be really effective in order to be read and to drive the purchasing behavior. Overstating the functionalities of the product can be a means to reach this goal.\n\nIf we think about some advertisements and the related products, it's easy to find the differences between the picture and the description of the product and the product itself. That means that we are aware of the 'overstating technique' used by the advertisers and that we don't fully believe in the messages that they convey. I never expect the kitchen's cleaning soaps to clean my kitchen as they do in the advertisements! And I never expect the breakfast biscuits to have the perfect shape they are showing on every paper page and during every commercial! We are all used to adopting a certain 'discount ratio' while evaluating the advertisement's messages.\nThe difficult thing for advertisers is to balance the reality with the overstatement in their advertisements because if the messages are too distant from reality, the risk is losing the client after the first try of the product."}
{"file_id": "1152681.txt", "output_essay": "I completely agree with the idea that successful people are those who are more curious than others to do and learn new things. People who are static and do not feel the need to keep improving their abilities, and are not ready to change and adapt to different situations and environments, will hardly become important. For instance, people who think that they can keep living in today's world without adapting will likely fall behind.\n\nSuccessful people in everyday life are those who are innovative, take risks, and as soon as they have learned something, they are already oriented towards another thing.\n\nCapable managers in the field of industry consider research and development as a priority activity and a tremendous key factor in order to make a business successful. Let's consider a very typical Italian example, a person who reached a lot of success in his life: Silvio Berlusconi. He started his career in real estate, constructing and selling residential buildings. Even though this market was successful, he invested his first earnings in buying a small television network. Year after year, this business grew, and he managed to buy other networks in Italy and in other countries as well. It was still not enough. With the money he gained from this business, he bought a football team that was completely unknown, AC Milan. He became president and in 15 years of presidency, he made it one of the most popular teams in the world. But he did not stop even at this point! He started getting interested in politics and in 1994, he became the Italian Prime Minister.\n\nI think that this is one of the best examples to understand how curiosity, capabilities, and an inclination to try new things can make someone very successful."}

People such as old persons or young persons work together to make great nations and provide a good life.\n\nIn my opinion, I don't agree with the following statement: 'Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.' Because the most important role in creating any powerful nation is its young people. Because they have the power and young minds to keep developing it. A nation that gives a hand and support to its young people, we find it proud of its achievements.\n\nYoung people participate in different aspects of the community. They work in teaching, engineering, medicine, and handicrafts to provide a good environment for raising new generations of young people. These new generations will continue carrying the future of the nation and its development.\n\nAs we see today, in Lebanon, where the war is killing people and destroying buildings, young people stand there to help their nation in hospitals and in places where war has arrived. And to share in their pain and fear. While other young people are standing to defend their lands from this war and its consequences. Young people give their lives for the community, and the nation should be the example and the leader for all young people around the world.\n\nFinally, nations and communities are measured by their young people and their achievements. More powerful young people, more powerful nation; it is an easy equation with just two variables.

So, whenever I did not understand, I asked my teacher and I successfully got a good grade.\n\nMany times, students are too shy and they are afraid to ask somebody to help them in a different subject, or even the teacher doesn't like to help students. So, we as students need to have a positive mindset and fight for what we want, doing our best at school and being obedient by following directions.\n\nAnother example I have is that I am really proud of my sister; she is really smart. In her tests, she always got good grades, and I asked her if she could give me some tips. The answer I received from her is that I have to understand what I am reading or studying.

Also, I understand that although there is some regulation about this topic, the means to make it work are not as stringent as they should be.\n\nIt is true that marketing uses strategies like giving misinformation about a product or trying to convince us that their product is what we need to solve our problems or just to make us happy. But this could be a real problem, like in a medical example, some vitamin supplements are advertised to be all we need if we feel tired or weak, but the people who make the publicity do not care or inform consumers about the risk of not going to a medical check when these symptoms are present. Also, there are documented cases of people who stop taking their medication or cut their medical treatments because of using a new product seen on TV.\n\nAnother example could be the resistance of a ladder or a new kind of tool, because the client could be expecting that this tool or appliance has a certain durability, when the real thing is that it is going to break, even putting their life in danger.\n\nAs a final conclusion or a personal piece of advice, I think that even though companies have the necessity to increase their profits, they also should have a social conscience. That is to say, be more concerned about the responsibility of lying or misinforming about the features of a product. And this does not mean that the client should leave everything in the hands of the enterprises, but be more concerned about the possibility of buying something which is not what they are expecting."}
{"file_id": "1155387.txt", "output_essay": "In our studies, we often have the choice between learning many academic subjects and specializing in one in particular. It can be quite a dilemma. In my opinion, specializing, at least at the end of our studies, is more interesting. I will explain the advantages and disadvantages of each solution and express my feelings.\n\nBroad knowledge of academic subjects is appealing at first. You don't have to make the choice between the themes you like, and learning from one can improve our understanding of another. For instance, learning about the living species in biology class can help in ecology class. Switching between subjects often also helps in not getting bored. On the contrary, you don't have enough time for each class, and that can be really frustrating to learn only the basics in the one you enjoy the most.\n\nThe other choice that is offered to us is specializing. The great thing about it is learning more and more information about a subject you like (or at least you should like) and getting more and more confident about it. Furthermore, you make fewer mistakes. The major drawback is when you need knowledge (even basic) on other academic subjects you don't have them, and probably don't have the time to learn them, and need to ask for help. This will result in a huge loss of time. Another negative aspect of specializing is that sometimes you are so concentrated on your subject you can't see by yourself the mistakes you are making.\n\nFinally, I prefer to specialize in a topic rather than have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects. The main reason is that you can be good at a topic only if you practice often, and I don't mind asking for help if I need knowledge about another subject in order to fulfill my work. Moreover, in order to begin in professional life, you need to be good at least at one thing."}

Then we will give the excuse to the young that they are not doing like the parents used to do for their communities, and I agree that they do not.\n\nFirst, society has changed as there is no longer plenty of time as the older generation had. For example, the traffic and communication nowadays require more time and effort to go from place to place, more than in the past with the parents. So the young man does not have the time to finish his own needs and does not have the time to care for others. Also, if we are talking about the same point of communication, it has become more expensive to travel from one place to another, and the young do not have enough money to go to help in other places.\n\nSecond, young people have a lot of kinds of entertainment in life, more than the last generation had. For example, young people have a lot of movies they can go to watch, and there are a lot of places he can go with his friends. So in his free time, he will prefer to go for dinner or movies instead of going to help the communities in the common fields like the parents did.\n\nThird, I think that the education system is also responsible for this case, as they did not teach the youth in the schools the meaning and love of helping others in the community and how to be a member. So when they grow and graduate, they do not try to help as they did not learn how to do so.\n\nAnd to sum up, with all the statements suggested above, I think that we are all responsible for this case of the youth. The parents in the house did not teach them how to love their community and how to help it, and also the school, the media; we are all responsible. And if we do not care for this problem, we will not gain the good results we all aim for from these young people."}

When the teacher explains a psychological problem in class, if he states the fact like: 'People still have psychological problems,' every student will wonder why. When he explains that many people who have emotional hunger (their mother didn't really offer much, let's say, love to their kids) and didn't teach her kids the difference between right and wrong. These people steal not because they need to, but sometimes to satisfy their emotional needs.\n\nIn a business class, when the professor says, 'The customer is always right.' When he continues explaining his idea, we understand what he means: the business without customers doesn't work. It doesn't matter what the company thinks, but the customers who consume the product do.\n\nFor example, when the customer is treated well, he will be your door to other customers (friends, neighbors, cousins, family...).

{"file_id": "1150823.txt", "output_essay": "I completely agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. There are mainly three reasons for my opinion. First, advertising agencies over-publicize a product. This is particularly done in the case of the launch of a new product in the market. Since no one has ever consumed the product, the companies have an added advantage of referring to their product as the best in the market, without the need for any facts to prove it. It is only after the product launch that consumers read reviews about the new product and realize its exact worth.\n\nAnother reason is that most advertisements include creative ideas, which entice various fantasies in consumers. The consumers start to believe that these fantasies might come true if they start consuming that product. Sheer curiosity of the consumer for that product forces him to buy and consume it. It is shortly thereafter that the consumer realizes that he is not in any supernatural state, which he thought to be in while consuming that product. This results in a loss of trust of consumers in the brand.\n\nThird, nowadays there is an increasing participation of renowned personalities in advertisements for various products. For example, a new range of Nike sports shoes is being endorsed by a leading soccer player, or a complete range of clothes being supported by a famous celebrity. As these famous personalities have a very large fan base around the world, it leads to the incorporation of blind trust in these brands by their followers, who want to be like their on-screen idols in their lives. People do not even search for reviews on these products or at least consider the use of these products in their lives.\n\nAdvertisements should display appropriate content in them, so that the consumer is not misguided by their curiosity. Products should consider this so that it may not result in losing their brand name."}

I actually agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are, and that is because of two reasons.\n\nThe first reason is that they present all the advertising about something in a wonderful way that shows you it is the best thing for you and that you can't live without it. Then, you discover all these advertisements are for nothing really worth it. For example, once I watched an advertisement on TV about a hair straightener that promised to make hair straight, so they made it appear that all the people would think it's really cool and you will have healthy hair. Next, I bought it and guess what? It was really bad; it destroyed and burned my hair. Another example: my boyfriend was walking in the street and he saw posters about a rain party. You could see from the posters that everything would be included in the ticket, but when he got there, everything in the poster was a lie.\n\nThe second reason is that there is no censor for the advertisements, especially on the internet, which allows many companies and shops to do whatever they want and laugh at people. Once, I met a friend who was really angry, so I asked her what was going on. She told me that she booked a dress through the internet and she paid for it, but when she went there to take it, they told her that she had to pay more because she didn't come on the same day.\n\nIn short, we must be cautious of these kinds of advertisements and also be sure of who we are dealing with.

That is a normal way of thinking, but as a person with a mind to think about it, you should find the right balance between starting new things or using a usual method. Really, it is difficult, or let me say it depends on the situation. If I am trying new things that do not affect health, and there is no danger in doing it, why not? Especially if it can help me in discovering new things and using my mind to think about the best way. One of the most important points is, if everyone does the same thing that has already been done in any field, how can we discover new methods or ways in work or life practice? So, successful people always take risks, which may help in discovering or improving their lives.\n\nLife is like school; you should learn from it. And how do you learn? It is by trying by yourself, and you should always keep in mind that there is no limit to knowledge, and the way to learn is by making mistakes.

In conclusion, I believe that trying new things could help in making you a creative person, and it can be the best way to learn in your life.\n\nWithout trying new things, I think we destroy the future and control knowledge; it will be the major reason for the stopping of our future life."}

Why am I led to talk about people? For the simple reason that travel is mentioned and basically has a lot to do with people.\n\nFor instance, if I have to talk more about the security aspect of the matter. When we see today, in the most technologically advanced century or age, the way people want to be secured; be it political leaders or countries, they are guided or secured.

Furthermore, according to these ads, every product doesn't have any drawbacks and is definitely perfect. However, this is not real, and that's why many advertisements are problematic. The biggest problem is that many people who see the advertisements believe them. It makes people spend their money to buy these products.

Nevertheless, in some cases, the product is not shown as better than it is. In particular, when it is an advertisement not for goods but for services. For example, the advertisements raising awareness about safety on the road, or the ads concerning lending money in a bank or concerning insurances. In those cases, the advertisement is more serious and there are fewer lies. All things considered, I agree that very often they are exaggerated, but it is not the least surprising, and most people are aware of it. The goal is to create a need and to increase sales. In a nutshell, I would say that advertisement is trying to make products seem much better than they are in reality, but it is often true for goods and less so for services."}

For example, one of my classmates, Anna Bron, is very successful in my Advanced Placement Art 12 class by trying new things.\n\nAnna Bron is well known to be a good painter in my school. She said she felt most comfortable with painting and liked to challenge herself by doing hard things. She has been successful by challenging herself. However, what brought her to the most successful stage was challenging herself by doing easy things.\n\nThere is a project called \"Concentration\" that all AP Art 12 students have to do. Anna chose to use teabags to symbolize the memory of our lives. She believed that used teabags have a memory to each person depending on why that person drank that tea, when they drank it, where they drank it. Her first idea was to make a canvas out of those teabags and paint on it. As I mentioned before, she feels most comfortable with painting.\n\nHer subject matter was very interesting, but her idea of painting on it bothered my art teacher. My teacher suggested she not paint on it but find a way to make it interesting by using the teabag itself. Anna said, \"But... that is going to be too easy.\" She thought making some art project in an easy way would result in low-quality work. No drawing or painting was a big challenge for Anna. However, she decided to take my teacher's advice.\n\nAnna tried new things by making it simple and by using the teabag itself. Once she told me that it is so hard to do something so simple and she is not used to it. Later, she found her way to make those teabags seem interesting. She laid out those teabags and made a mobile; quilted with different kinds of teabags; and other different experiments. Anna is now making a dress out of her teabags that she collected from people, and she is achieving a very high stage as an artist. She is not only receiving a high mark in the AP Art 12 class but also having the opportunity to try new things. She is successful by experimenting with new things."}

However, I think understanding ideas and concepts is more essential. There are two major reasons: to be confident and to be logical.\n\nTo begin with, students could gain confidence through understanding ideas and concepts. You might say that learning many things can make people more confident. However, you may not deny that without understanding them, nobody can use them confidently. Moreover, facts are usually so common. By contrast, although ideas and concepts are not perfect, people can gain deeper knowledge by following the idea and concept. As society is getting more complex, the competition is getting fiercer. Therefore, the meaning of expertise has changed. It was to know many facts; now, it is to understand whole ideas and concepts.\n\nMoreover, as far as thinking logically is concerned, understanding ideas and concepts is more important. I took a history class when I was a freshman. I learned many important facts in the class and I got a great score on it. However, I forgot most of them immediately after the final exam. In comparison, when I took a physics class, although it was challenging for me to understand the idea and concept, through that process I could learn the way of thinking logically. This logical approach helped me to get better grades in other courses, too.\n\nIn summary, understanding ideas and concepts is necessary for students to become confident and to develop a way of logical thinking."}
{"file_id": "1152153.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with the statement, \"Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do.\" \n\nThe reason I agree is because I think you cannot achieve success if you only do what you already know how to do. If you know how to do it, then other people probably know as well. Trying new things gives us impact; perhaps this is the way to be successful.\n\nHowever, I do not think you can succeed by randomly generating new ideas. You do need to research them; you need reason and proof to come up with the idea. Also, you may need some help from other people who have been through it and experienced it.\n\nFor example, take the president of the clothing shop called UNIQLO. I think it is one of the most famous clothing shops in Japan nowadays. He initiated so many new projects and actually tried them. But he failed many times too. He introduced us to mass production. Initially, they started by making simple designed clothes and sold them at very cheap prices. Before UNIQLO adopted this method of selling clothes, everyone would have thought it was not a very good idea to produce so many identical, cheap, simple clothes because they thought that customers wanted to buy something more individual and of good quality.\n\nHowever, UNIQLO succeeded by selling products this way. But I have also seen them failing quite badly, such as when they started selling vegetables and fruit at the shop. It was a very big impact on us, just like the last time. What kind of clothes shop sells vegetables at the shop? But it did not lead to a successful outcome. They stopped selling them after a few months. It resulted in a loss for the company. But the president of UNIQLO still does not stop producing new ideas and projects. That is why the company is still growing and making a lot of money.\n\nI have come to the conclusion that even if other people think you will not succeed with it and try to stop you, they can be wrong sometimes. You might fail many times before you actually become a successful person. But that is the path to success, so you should not be afraid; you need to take risks and try."}

The public needs to know which products exist and what their characteristics and quality are. For this reason, advertisements are playing an important role, giving us, the consumers, the possibility to know about what we are going to buy. However, advertisements need to offer a good product for sale, and then they can give people a false valuation of them.\n\nAdvertisements always express a partial opinion about the product: the owner's consideration. First, he needs to create the idea that you need it. Later, he will convince the public that what he is offering is the best. In all cases, he will try to give you the best opinion. Even without seeing the thing or tasting it first, a person can think that this product is wonderful and buy it. In addition, a product may not be very important to you, but if you see it in the commercials, you might think to buy it and create a reason for this purchase. In many cases, this product will remain in the garage or in some place in the house you cannot remember later.\n\nAdvertisements will always express acceptance and a good opinion about the product because they aim to catch the consumer's attention and make it enter the market in a competitive way. When a new thing arrives on the market, it must show sufficient quality and presence to compete with other products of the same kind that already exist and win customers. For this reason, many products only have a good presence and are not as good as they must be, according to the commercials.\n\nI agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are and they lie to the public for business purposes. Customers must be careful with their purchases and try to guarantee them too."}

One of the answers that can be given is because he did, at a certain moment, something no one had done before, and because no one had done that before, it was risky. Is that the key to success in general? Maybe not, but it can certainly explain the success of several businessmen within an economic context. Taking risks and trying new things are two factors favoring one's success in business because of having the advantages of being the first and consequently the best.\n\nTrying new things, first, means that the actor taking the action is the only one in the area. For instance, if I draw a new picture, it means that no one did it before me, and I am the first to act in this manner. Being the first can give several advantages. If, for instance, you create a new product that you protect by copyright and that everyone wants to have, you will have a monopoly on it that will benefit your company. However, a new idea, product, or drawing is not always good and does not always work. That is why successful people are also considered as people taking risks.\n\nSecondly, taking calculated risks in a specialized area makes you the only one to benefit from it.

Although not all young people have become indifferent to helping their communities, I certainly believe that, on the whole, young people nowadays do not give enough time to community service.\n\nThere are several reasons for my agreement with this statement, which I would like to state in the following paragraphs.\n\nThe main reason I feel this way is because today's youngsters have become too narcissistic. They are all self-centered and concerned about their personal progress. This is due to the ever-increasing competitiveness. In this competitive world, to keep up with the pace, each youngster is busy polishing themselves for the contest. And in this pursuit, they neglect the community. They are too worried about their own progress and achievements to look into community matters. Each of them wants to be the best, and they don't want to waste time on others.\n\nAnother reason which makes me agree with the statement is the prevalence of corruption, violence, robbery, murder, etc., and a whole lot of crimes taking place. If the youngsters devoted enough time to the well-being of the community, wouldn't the scenario be different? All those murderers, robbers, rapists—aren't the majority of them the youth of the community? Instead of being helpful, they are becoming the cause of all sorts of suffering and trauma to the community, I must say.\n\nFurthermore, I feel that youngsters are not contributing to helping the community because they are moving away from the moral values and disciplines of society. Today's youngsters want to be more independent and do not want to be taught the lessons of helping others. What they learn from today's growing technological world is how to modernize themselves and how to keep up with the rest of the competition. Amidst this, they do not care for the community. For example, today most young people spend half of their time on the internet. Now, by exploiting the internet, what are the possibilities of them using it for others' sake or to help someone compared to the possibilities of chatting, browsing, looking for job opportunities, searching for institutes for further education, etc.? Certainly, the probabilities of utilizing it for personal benefits are quite higher.\n\nAll these reasons and examples lead me to agree with the statement that nowadays, youngsters are not very interested and hence are not devoting much time to help the community. This can be attributed to their ignorance about the well-being of others and their zeal for personal holistic development."}

I know a person who became a rich man. Actually, he is my grandfather, who died in peace. When he was young, he was a good student. He never thought about making money. He just liked to study everything he wanted to know. His teacher thought that he could be a math teacher because he never got a math test wrong. So, his teacher told him to spend more time on math, but he didn't want to. He wanted to have broad knowledge because he didn't want to study just one specific subject. So, he studied and studied, but he could not go to a university because he was so poor. After he graduated from high school, he wanted to get a job. Many companies didn't want to hire him because he didn't graduate from a university. The companies wanted well-educated people at that time. So, he worked as a daily worker. He was not a formal worker, but he worked hard. While he worked, he still studied everything he could. Eight years later, he made some money. He wanted to own a company, so he opened a small market. He already knew how to do it because he studied all the time he could. He applied all his knowledge to his market. The market was getting bigger and bigger. He married a pretty woman and he opened another market. He opened four markets until he died.\n\nIn conclusion, I think it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific area."}

By experimenting with new things based on common knowledge and beliefs, one can find new ways to reach or meet demands beyond common practice.\n\nSuccessful people are also not afraid of taking risks.

{"file_id": "1154048.txt", "output_essay": "I don't really agree with the statement that 'most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.' It always happens the other way around; they will not be much better than they really are or seem to be. Here comes the difference: they will advertise the product by showing its good qualities and how it works, but they will not show its defects; they will not count on those. Perhaps they seem much better when they advertise them, and they will convince us to buy it. It's after that all happens that we come to know about the actual performance of it, which is often worse.\n\nBut sometimes it happens that the products seem much better than they really are, but note it, only sometimes; it's just very rare. I will give you a live example that I have experienced in the past. Once, I bought a video-CD player, convinced by the product's advertisement, which showed all its good qualities and claimed it performed better than the others in the market. So, I bought it thinking that it would be a better option to buy the product of that company. But I was completely wrong in my choice, because it was always subject to repairs and did not work properly. I went wrong in selecting by seeing the advertisement.\n\nAnother example is an experience of my friend with a cosmetic product that promised to make her skin glow. She bought it after seeing the advertisement and thinking it would make her skin glow, but instead, it caused itching and skin allergy. So, I strongly stick to my opinion that they are not as much better as they seem to be. I conclude by saying that I disagree with the statement."}

Since good education is becoming more accessible, universities and companies now require an even higher level of education. In my opinion, that is why some people now work harder than before.\n\nOn the other hand, the invention of computers, video games, and all the other different accessories has made the young people of today much busier.\n\nThese reasons are why I agree with this statement in most cases.

I also think that these young people are not to blame; modern society is.\n\nIf I talk about my personal experience, I can say that I do not give enough time to helping my community. One of the reasons why I don't is because nobody encourages me to do it. People around me are becoming less and less aware of the problems in their communities and are becoming more selfish.\n\nI think it is also important to say that it is not 100% true that all young people do not give enough time to helping their communities.

One of these inventions is the automobile, which we use almost every day. Some people believe that car usage might decrease gradually, and I agree with this idea. These days, many people, including myself, are concerned that the population might reduce in the future, which could also lead to a decrease in car usage. Additionally, thanks to developing technology, public transportation has become much more convenient, which could be one of the reasons people might use cars less in the future.\n\nNowadays, there is concern that the population might decrease in the future. According to research, the population rate is concentrated in the older demographic. One reason for this is advanced medical technology. Moreover, as more women enter the workforce, they often choose not to have children because they do not want to leave their jobs. As a result, there might be a smaller global population in the future, which could also lead to reduced car usage.\n\nAs technology advances, public transportation has become much more convenient than when it first started. In Korea, there were almost no facilities, such as elevators, to assist people with disabilities, unlike in Japan. However, when I visited this year, I noticed many elevators to support these individuals. Currently, there are still many cars on the streets, but people might use public transportation more in the future because it is quite affordable despite its convenience.\n\nAs I mentioned, in the future, fewer people will use cars. Of course, many people still use their own cars because they are convenient as well. However, a smaller population could lead to reduced car usage, and more people will likely use public transportation, which has become more convenient."}

Because ideas and concepts are of fundamental value. They must know these values so that they can apply them in various settings. The values help students to extend their knowledge and skills too.\n\nI am a nursing major. When I was a practitioner, I focused on learning facts. In this situation, the word 'facts' means some daily routine activities, such as ways to clean wounds or skills for checking blood samples, etc. But since medical technology is improving and most of the things are done easily with some equipment, I don't use those techniques these days. However, we still use our knowledge to analyze the data. Ideas and concepts last long.\n\nThen, if I have an understanding of the concept, I can apply the idea to different situations. If I understand the theory that cultural background affects people's behavior, I can understand how to care for a foreign patient. If students have enough knowledge about the fundamentals of their area, they can apply it to other situations. It will help them to solve problems they might face.\n\nMoreover, fundamental knowledge helps students to extend their studies. If a student wishes to study in a postgraduate course, the basic knowledge of the related theories is required. If I learned only daily routines in one ward of one hospital and neglected to study the concepts or ideas, I couldn't continue my study for the master's degree.\n\nTherefore, I support the opinion that students should give higher priority to understanding ideas and concepts than to learning facts. They are basic values which last long, can be applied to different scenes, and can be used for brushing up the level of study for students."}

However, the real question is: Is the car truly the best solution, the best urban solution to reach a place? Or might the car one day become a real problem in our everyday lives instead?\n\nI believe that in a few years, the car will become the worst mode of transportation due to the increasing number of drivers on the streets and, most importantly, because of the looming problem of pollution!\n\nIn my opinion, in the end, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today as a natural consequence of the improvement of our lives. I also think that my opinion is supported by all the experiments that scientists and engineers are conducting to convert our way of moving in a city to alternative modes of transportation and perhaps to less harmful fuels.\n\nFor example, I believe that in the future, our cities will support much more transportation by train than by car in order to move more people at a time, eliminating problems associated with traffic and pollution."}

However, as far as I am concerned, traveling in a group led by a tour guide is not the best choice. I prefer traveling alone.\n\nFirst and foremost, traveling by oneself means you can do whatever you want.

The next step is to find some time, pack your bag, take some food, and go directly to the place you want. You do not need to visit places you are not interested in or have already been to.\n\nEqually important is that the timing for traveling alone is flexible. You can travel at any time and in any season. If you appreciate some places of interest, just stay a little longer and explore more. It does not matter to others. While in a group, you have to respect the opinions of others.\n\nIn the end, another point that we should not forget is that some tour guides will take travelers to places they do not want to go. Guides may take travelers to local markets where the prices are very high and the goods are inferior.\n\nAll in all, I disagree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.

To support my opinion, I will give three reasons in favor of the latter.\n\nFirstly, I surely agree with the opinion that students have to learn some facts. It is obviously important to know certain things, but it cannot be the main objective. As I have experienced, the things you remember in the end are not the ones hardly learned and memorized, but the ideas and concepts transmitted by a book or a professor. To be capable of memorizing, you need to connect the facts and transform them into bigger pieces, into concepts.\n\nSecondly, it is not just important to know things, but to understand them. By memorizing numbers and numbers of facts, you don't automatically also understand them, and you are not necessarily able to see them in relation to other factors. You may not be able to see the overall meaning of all the factors learned.\n\nThirdly, when actually using the knowledge learned, you need concepts and ideas rather than pure facts. For example, if you are a doctor, it does not help you to just know where the knee is but also to be aware of all the different parts of the body that can influence and affect the knee. Experiencing pain in the knee is not necessarily caused by the knee itself. It can also originate in another part of the body.\n\nIn summary, I think there should be both: the learning of facts—serving as a basis of knowledge—and the understanding of concepts and ideas, to be able to grasp the meaning of the knowledge learned and memorized. What counts in the end is the ability to use the knowledge, and this is only possible when having a profound understanding of the facts learned."}

Simply seeing the place is a waste if you don't understand its significance; a guide can explain if there are historical sites present. If you are completely familiar with the places you're visiting, you don't need a guide.\n\nIn some cases, if you want to visit a new place, you need to know the language of that place. Sometimes the food at the visiting place is not good. Taking a guide who is familiar with the area can be helpful to us. A guide knows the language, so there is no communication problem. Additionally, in some places, the food is not good, but a guide will know where fresh food is available.\n\nAnother advantage is that the guide is familiar with all the visiting places in the area.

{"file_id": "1150330.txt", "output_essay": "While there may be some people who disagree, I totally agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.\nThe reasons why I take this position are elaborated on in the following paragraphs.\n\nFirstly, for example, when I was looking for a used car about 6 years ago, what I did first was to read thoroughly through car magazines. These were full of advertisements. There was so much car information in the magazine that it was next to impossible to select 3 or 4 candidates. One day, after I managed to do so, I went to the car dealer in person to see one of the cars itself. At the sight of the car itself, I was a little confused because the car didn't look as good as in the magazine.\n\nSecondly, when I made uniforms for the baseball team at my company, I again checked the catalogue in depth. In the catalogue, almost every uniform design looked cool, but when we ordered one type from the catalogue and finally saw the real uniforms, we were a little disappointed to see the difference between the ones in the catalogue and the real ones.\n\nFurthermore, I have made a company recruiting website for college/university students. This was like an advertisement for our company, our workplaces. We tried hard so that our company would seem excellent. Of course, we didn't make false statements or images using pictures and CGs. But what we tried to do was to collect the best pictures of our company and workplaces. So, in this sense, our company's website should have been the very best image of our company.\n\nIn conclusion, for the reasons stated above, I totally agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. On the other hand, I seem to have to learn that products in advertisements are not as good as they appear when I do the shopping."}
{"file_id": "1158123.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. It depends on how one defines success, so I interpret success as becoming famous and changing the world for the better.\n\nOne example of a successful company is McDonald's, the famous fast-food chain in the United States. I recently read a book about McDonald's. The founders of McDonald's were the McDonald brothers in the southern United States. They were selling hamburgers at a store with a drive-through, where customers could buy food without leaving their cars. This was a major innovation in restaurants at that time. But they didn't stop there; they changed the entire process of making hamburgers. They implemented an assembly line where each person did only one job, like just baking the meat. Before this, one person would perform every step in making a hamburger. This idea made it possible to serve food faster. Because of their efforts, McDonald's became the largest hamburger company in the world.\n\nTrying new things is always accompanied by some risks. It would be great if the new endeavors brought success. However, if the new ventures failed, it could be a nightmare. I think challenging new things is a kind of lottery. We cannot know if something will be successful.\n\nAnother good example of successful people is the person who invented the iPod. This product is one of the most successful products of Apple, which used to produce only computers. The idea of making the iPod the lightest device with a large music capacity was an innovative idea. Apple was the first company to create products like the iPod. The attitude of challenging new things has helped Apple achieve great success.\n\nBecause of these reasons, I agree with the idea that successful people try new things and take risks rather than doing what they already know how to do well."}
{"file_id": "1156687.txt", "output_essay": "I do agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. The people who develop an advertisement usually try to communicate a certain message which is supposed to make the product attractive to the customer. Everything that does not comply with this message is simply left out. Most of the time, the producers don't care about being truthful in that matter. Let's take cigarettes as an example. If the producers want to make cigarettes attractive to the customer, they will not talk about all the negative side effects, but instead, they will focus on the advantages. They simply keep important information to themselves even though it might hurt the person who is going to buy the cigarettes. This way, the customer will be blinded by the positive attitude of the advertisement and will be led to believe that it would be good if he bought cigarettes.\n\nThis kind of commercial strategy is actually widely used in the promotion of food. Many companies want to make their products look healthy because nowadays many people try to stay slim. The advertisement producers respond to that need by developing commercials in a way that will make the product seem healthy and good for fitness-oriented customers. Usually, they exaggerate certain ingredients which actually only make up a minor part of the product. Some commercials, for example, promote chocolate bars which include 'a great deal of milk' even though there are merely traces of milk found in the product.\n\nAnother way to make customers buy a product is to appeal to certain images they have of themselves. Commercials for beer, for example, usually try to convey a sense of manliness to the watcher. Men often feel that this kind of beer will make them seem more rugged and therefore more attractive to women, even though the brand is not special in any way and does not differ much from other beer brands.\n\nAll these means are used by the companies in order to make more profit, regardless of the effects it might have on the customers."}

For example, suppose you planned to go to France. The language the people speak there is French. You may not understand French. Here you need a guide.\n\nMy second reason is, if you planned to tour a historic place without a guide, you would finally end up just looking at the rocky structures you saw there. As each historic place has a history behind it, the main purpose of visiting is to know its history. As we are not familiar with the place and its history, a guide is the right person to explain it. For example, take an instance of visiting Mahabalipuram, a famous historic site in India. It's all filled with temples made of rock, carvings on stone, etc. We need a guide to explain what these rocky structures are.\n\nAnd lastly, the important thing is fulfilling the purpose for which we have spent the money. Let's suppose you have planned a European tour. But if you did not have a proper person with you to explain things, the purpose of visiting is not fulfilled if you don't know anything."}

Whereas old people enjoyed at that age, they do not now.\n\nHowever, nowadays young people enjoy more than old people did in the past. The reasons are that young people are in good health and they are very flexible to any kind of environment. As they are younger, they are naturally in a position to do anything like playing, dancing, and drinking, whereas it is not possible for old people to do all these things.\n\nYoung people will enjoy spending time with friends, chatting, roaming here and there, and enjoying holidays in other countries with friends and parties. On the other hand, old people cannot move anywhere because, as they become older, their health will not support moving to other places or the environment may not suit their health. They cannot enjoy at this age as they once did.\n\nYoung people can adjust anywhere and can do anything as long as their body permits. They will enjoy a lot compared to old people because there are many more changes in the present days compared to previous days. Keeping the present days in view, we can say that young people will enjoy many things.\n\nYoung people will enjoy attending parties, coming home late at night, going for long rides, going with friends for picnics, and enjoying weekend parties with friends or official parties, etc. They enjoy exploring all the tastes and entering into each and every corner to learn about the place or to know about it. If they find a new place, they will reach there and enjoy it as they learn about that place.\n\nHence, I conclude that young people will enjoy more than old people for the reasons and examples stated above."}
{"file_id": "1149373.txt", "output_essay": "The car has become an integral part of modern life. It is essential today to accomplish tasks in a timely manner. I disagree with the statement that 'in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.'\n\nIn the olden days, people traveled from one place to another by walking. The invention of the wheel changed the course of evolution significantly. After the wheel's invention, man introduced many new vehicles for transportation. He initially used bullock carts and tongas, which were pulled by animals. Later, he introduced the bicycle, which served him well for travel. Subsequently, he introduced the motorcycle in order to reach destinations quickly with less effort. In this process, man sought a more luxurious way of traveling and began to introduce vehicles powered by fuel. He designed some of them for the transportation of goods and some for humans, such as trucks and buses, respectively.\n\nLater, he considered luxury and privacy and then introduced cars. Cars were once a luxurious means of transportation. However, they have now become a necessity. This change has occurred because of globalization and necessities. In the initial stages, there were very few cars, and people regarded them with great interest. But nowadays, in developed countries, many people own more than one car.\n\nThe main problem with cars is that they create a lot of traffic congestion and pollution. For this reason, many governments are trying to decrease the number of cars by demanding higher taxes and parking fees.\n\nBut people are willing to pay these because they are very much addicted to them. The question is whether there will be fewer cars within 20 years, but I think this will not happen. People who own cars will not simply discard them.\n\nThere will be many technologies that come along which will reduce pollution; already some are using cars run by solar power. Another reason is that the population is increasing day by day.\n\nAnd I conclude from the above reasons that after twenty years, the number of cars will not decrease but will continue to increase."}
{"file_id": "1138119.txt", "output_essay": "Yeah, I totally agree with this statement because what allows the car to turn on is the gas, and the gas is getting more and more expensive due to the decrease of worldwide gas resources caused by overexploitation.\n\nEverybody is now thinking about how we are going to substitute gas. Some solutions are there, but they are too expensive. However, when we find an appropriate and non-polluting fuel, it will come out with new automotive technologies, and it will be a revolution.\n\nNowadays, cars emit too much carbon into the atmosphere, and it's very bad for our planet. Cars pollute too much, and we can't keep on polluting as if nothing will happen. People will realize how bad their cars are for the atmosphere, and everybody will prefer to have a bike or a non-polluting automotive vehicle.\n\nThe technology allows us to build these kinds of cars, but the reason why car builders aren't generalizing this kind of car is that now the governments and people don't really see how fast carbon is damaging our planet. But if we keep on polluting with our cars as if there are no consequences, in something like 10 years, the effects will be more violent and will happen more frequently, and that will make everybody want to stop polluting before it's too late.\n\nCars are being banned everywhere in the world. For example, in Paris, the mayor closed many of the city roads to cars and opened them to buses in order to force people to take public transportation and leave their cars at home. In Mexico City, it's worse because there you can use your car only once a week. The government did that to decrease air pollution because Mexico is one of the most polluted cities in the whole world.\n\nCars are too polluting, and it's going to get more and more expensive just to put gas in them, so in the next few years, I'm sure you will see new kinds of automotive technologies."}
{"file_id": "1162480.txt", "output_essay": "Nowadays, advertising is very important. When we look around, we can easily see that the type of advertising has developed because technology has developed very quickly. When I turn on the TV, I can see many different and interesting advertisements. If one person wants to be successful, they must create a good advertisement. On the other hand, they must spend a lot of money. Therefore, we should prepare an advertisement to make a good product.\n\nThe first reason is curiosity. Generally, everybody watches television every night. Advertisements provide many opinions about products, and on television, we can make many changeable points such as shape, color, or size. For example, when I watch an advertisement, I want to use the product because on TV the shape and the color are very attractive.\n\nThe second reason is that in the advertisement, we can see famous people. I believe that this is very important because many people like to watch famous people. This type of advertising is expensive, but I believe that it is not important because in the future, we will gain much money. For example, last week my sister wanted to buy Coca-Cola because she saw famous people in the advertisement. So, emotional intelligence is very important in advertising. Advertisers should find many different types of advertising when they prepare the project.\n\nAs a result, there are many reasons for making a good advertisement. When we read the examples in the passage, we can easily see that advertising is very important for a product. If we give much importance to advertising, I believe that the product will become popular."}

There are a lot of techniques that make a product irresistible to consumers. But is it always true that all advertised products are as good as they seem to be? I think not: they seem much better than they really are. Last week, I bought an apple pie that I saw in a television spot. In the images shown on TV, it seemed really tasty and healthy, but when I ate it, it was not so good, and I got sick. I couldn't sleep all night long.\n\nIn my opinion, it would be better for food or clothing companies to spend their budget on improving the quality of their products or decreasing the prices instead of investing it in advertising.\n\nThe problem is that business rules are different from what is better for the people. But something has to be done. I think that certifications of quality are a very good investment for companies to show the real value of their products and at the same time, a good way for consumers to verify the quality of what they are buying and to make better choices between different brands."}
{"file_id": "1149918.txt", "output_essay": "Advertisement is the product of highly sophisticated marketing techniques combined with knowledge of human psychology. Knowing how to advertise under these circumstances makes it easy for companies to sell products that look very appealing but, in actual fact, are not worth their money. Throughout the history of industries, stores, and products, there have been unthinkable numbers of faulty and bad products that have flooded the markets and their customers in a raid.\n\nFor the famous company Apple, which has produced and advertised an array of incredible products, there have been some along the way that were purely insignificant in contrast to their price. The first release of their iPod was one of these products. When the iPod was initially released, the sales numbers hit a continuous high that has not ended to this day, but these 'first year' iPods were full of technical errors. The iPod batteries (that were concealed inside the iPod) broke after two weeks and lasted for an hour when they were fully charged. Since the iPod is one of the highest produced gadgets in the world, this problem occurred with every iPod within a few weeks of its purchase. Second, the iPod headphones that came with it blew out after listening to music at maximum volume on your own iPod. This was a big issue since it showed that the headphones were not designed accordingly.\n\nAlthough all of these faults were known, the iPod sales did not decrease because it was the most prestigious gadget to own at the time. The design and marketing strategies led by Steve Jobs (Apple's CEO) have influenced such immense groups of customers, from all ages to all places, that the sales did not decrease. The fantastic and sleek design contributed to this. The iPod was three to four hundred dollars at the time and, compared to other MP3 players that were less expensive, it was not of higher standards and therefore not worth the money.\n\nThe marketing strategies that revolve around the advertisements of new products exceed the basic knowledge we have about a product and make it look of higher standards than it is. The products, therefore, are sold at prices that they are not worthy of and thus corrupt the average customer's payments. It is unfair but at the same time the customer's fault for not researching the products enough before they purchase them."}
{"file_id": "1162642.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with the statement that advertisements make products seem much better. It is because of my thoughts, surveys, polls, and experiments.\n\nFirst, famous people usually make most advertisements. They appeal to people sufficiently. Most people want to be like actors, singers, and actresses. Maybe the product that is advertised by a superstar is more attractive to people.\n\nSecondly, the survey, conducted by Chosun Daily, one of the best papers in Korea, shows that three-fourths of the overall candidates of the survey feel advertised products are more qualified. Also, the poll, conducted by the same company, shows that people think that advertised products are safer.\n\nThirdly, when I was a high school student, my friend bought a product that was not advertised. It was an expensive tape player. It was disordered the next day. My friend wanted to get a guarantee service. He did not get it. So he had to buy again, and he bought an advertised product, SONY, because of the services.\n\nLastly, when I was young, I had two toys. I did not have discrimination between the two toys. However, I was perfectly changed in my mind after the advertisement of Superman, my hero in the past. Although the toy was much cheaper than another, I always took Superman's toy because I was proud of myself.\n\nIn conclusion, given several reasons, I think that most advertisements make the products seem much better than they really are. It seems that advertisements make us attracted to the product."}

Some of these tourists travel independently, while others are led by tour guides.\n\nIn my opinion, the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide because this way I can be sure that I will visit the most interesting places in the country to which I have traveled. I remember, for instance, my first trip to Egypt and how the tour guide ensured that me and the other group members saw the most fascinating archaeological sites there. Moreover, I believe that being led by a tour guide is more secure than exploring a foreign country alone. However, being led by a tour guide would not be a happy experience for a tourist who wants to wander around the real cities and discover the other lively sides of a country.\n\nFurthermore, there are other methods that can provide the same capability as a tour guide. For example, books that include useful information about places that can be enjoyable for tourists to visit, maps, and illustrated books.\n\nAnother important reason that makes me prefer traveling with a group is that being with a group from one's own country or culture would make them feel more secure and safe rather than knowing no one.\n\nIn conclusion, I would prefer to be guided by a local person who knows more than me about his/her country."}
{"file_id": "1142214.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with the statement that \"most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.\" My opinion about this topic is based on personal experiences as well as personal opinions.\n\nWho has not seen an advertisement that appealed to his or her own needs and wants? Furthermore, I will go a step further and say that I am sure that almost everyone has bought a product because he or she remembered an advertisement about it. Advertisements are tempting and play with the customer's emotions. In addition, the way they are put together, they appeal to the viewers' eyes; it makes them want to have whatever is displayed on the advertisement.\n\nIn the center of advertisements is usually a woman with a perfect body, few clothes, and a big smile. Moreover, this kind of advertisement makes women want to be her and men want to have her. At this point, the product being sold is not as important as the emotion involved in the advertisement. For example, an advertisement for a cigarette company sells a cancerous stick to people by presenting a tan, attractive, and good-looking woman with a glowing cigarette in her hand on a huge billboard. Do people really want to start smoking, or rather be as good-looking as the woman? Now, this supports the fact that the advertisement makes the product seem much better than it really is.\n\nAnother point to be made in this commentary about the statement is that even if people do not try to be influenced by the products sold in advertisements, they are still influenced by them. As soon as people leave their house, they are surrounded by advertisements on huge billboards, on trucks driving by, on school blackboards, or in magazines and newspapers. These advertisements are stored subconsciously. If people then go to the grocery store to make their weekly purchases, they will remember what they saw on the billboards. They might buy those products and recognize that what they bought was not as good as they thought it would be. They are surprised by the fact that the advertisements sold them this product and, more importantly, made it look better than it actually was.\n\nIn conclusion, it seems that in today's world we are surrounded and enclosed by advertisements and people who try to sell things. This is the reason why it is hard to distinguish whether the product being sold is actually worth buying or if it is just trying to trick our eye. It is important for people to recognize that not everything advertised will have exactly the same effect on everybody or will taste the same way to everyone. But also, I had to make the experience first before I recognized that \"advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.\""}

In fact, they tend to think young people do the opposite. This assumption is not entirely a fabrication. There are countless children who are willing to give up their time to help the community. These occurrences can be observed anywhere, especially in schools. Several schools offer a myriad of student activities that help their communities, which students volunteer for generously.\n\nThe most popular program among the students is orphanage or retirement home visits. Students voluntarily sacrifice their time after school to take the hike to an orphanage or retirement home nearby. During these visits, students play with the children, exchange conversations with the elderly, help clean up trash around the area, all in all, promoting warmth and happiness to the community. Undoubtedly, these generous acts promote a better environment.\n\nAnother program includes Amnesty International, which takes helping communities to an international level. Students organize themselves into groups and become aware of social and political injustice around the world. With knowledge, they promote social awareness and facilitate active political participation among fellow students by writing letters to governments. Being future leaders of the world, not only are they bringing issues to the attention of governments for the community, they are influencing others to become equally aware of the world around them.\n\nUndeniably, sometimes young people do become lazy and not help the community. They would rather enjoy luxurious times in front of the television or playing video games. Sometimes young people just need their relaxation time and enjoy themselves as kids. A childhood must also be dominantly characterized by exuberance. Furthermore, there will always be other more responsible kids doing more helpful work for the community to counterbalance the laziness of others.\n\nBenevolence and sacrifice are indications of maturity. Countless young people already help the community voluntarily, as seen in the various successful school activities. However, young people are still growing and adapting. If they aren't, we shouldn't hinder the process and let them enjoy their childhood."}
{"file_id": "1157923.txt", "output_essay": "Different ways of learning can be taught by a professor or lecturer in order to make it easier for their students to memorize certain study materials. Some believe that helping students to understand ideas and concepts is more important than just learning facts.\n\nTo begin with, encouraging students to develop their own ideas and concepts about a certain topic and ultimately to draw a conclusion is very likely to have a positive impact on the student's memory. For example, if a student in a history class has the task of thinking about how the German people must have felt at the end of the Second World War, and he or she works out their feelings of desperation and hopelessness, he or she has learned through experience.\n\nMoreover, by having understood certain ideas and concepts, a student can transfer them to current situations and to another subject or theme. For instance, having learned the concept of social behavior through a specific example and having understood the idea of it, the student will be able to easily observe social behavior, its causes and consequences, in his or her own environment and compare them to other social behaviors and the way it differs in every country and continent.\n\nLearning facts surely has its disadvantages in specific exam situations. For example, if a student is being asked about when certain historical events took place. Especially in the subject of history, learning dates by heart is rather important, mostly in order to avoid getting mixed up with situations that happened before another event and to receive a basic overview of certain periods of time.\n\nAll things considered, there are more benefits for students, not only in school but for their entire lives, to being able to use learned ideas and concepts in a variety of fields than to learn facts that can be easily forgotten just after the exam has finished."}

To be unique in a diverse market environment, it is literally inevitable to entice the buyer.\n\nAdvertisements must have a short and strong message. Due to this briefness, it is impossible to present the product in an appropriate and honest way. Consumers who bought a product advertised as reliable or easy to use often are unsatisfied with what they finally hold in their hands. But who is to blame?\nOf course, companies present their products in the best possible way; that's what I would do too. On the other hand, we, the customers, don't want to hear lengthy advertisements in which products are explained in detail.\n\nThe phenomenon of wrongly advertised products is not a new one. In my opinion, people should be clever enough to know that companies say whatever it takes to sell a product.\n\nFor example, when a cellphone is advertised, the commercial could say: 'The best cellphone ever built.' This statement, of course, cannot be proved by anyone. Therefore, we have an exaggeration and probably even a false statement.\n\nAnother example is food and drinks. How can a commercial seriously say: 'The most delicious burger ever'? A customer who buys and tries it ultimately has the expectation of a great burger. But what if he doesn't like it? This means the advertisement industry is neither able to shape our taste nor to advertise products in a proper way.\n\nSo far, I have been describing the black sheep among the advertising companies. Nonetheless, there are companies that present their products honestly without exaggerations or even lies. Especially when comparisons are made, the customer can be sure to watch a good advertisement.\n\nIn the end, it's all up to the prospective customer whether a commercial is believed or not."}

Because today, at every school, every student only learns facts. They do not even understand what the teacher is talking about. I think this is not good for young students. If teachers read and teach what is in the book, students would all think about the same thing. In addition, it would suppress children's free imagination. The decline in student scores is one of the big problems in the world. Especially in Japan, I heard on television that there are students who seldom read books, do not like to learn new things, and they do not understand why studying is so important. I think all teachers must teach children to get interested in new ideas, not only facts. Children should think about their own ideas. It will make them more intelligent and interested individuals. Another big problem is that most Japanese cannot speak English. I saw a graph on the news; they said Japan was the worst. In high school, students learn English from teachers who are not native speakers. They study things such as grammar and how to talk. I think this is not very useful for students. They have to learn listening, writing, and need chances to talk to people who speak English. It will also make it easier for students to understand and be interested in class. I do not think learning only facts is bad, but I guess if students learn that, they would lose their individual ideas and sense of imagination. That's why I think understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning mere facts."}

It will be difficult to live without cars, especially here in Italy, where most of the trade and traveling is made by cars. I believe that we will all benefit from the lack of cars, but we need to get used to other means of transport. First of all, people should start using public transport. In this way, companies will improve their services, and they will be ready to sustain the changed habit in twenty years.\n\nSecondly, we should invest more in research and development for alternative means of transport and to lower the prices of transportation, such as those of airplanes, trains, and ferries. The government should also improve infrastructures for these means of transport, as often airports, railway stations, and harbors are not efficient enough.\n\nAs nowadays cars are the biggest source of pollution, it will be positive for the environment and for all of us. Scientists are already working to find alternative sources to power our cars, as in twenty years' time, we might run out of petroleum, and this will probably be the main cause for fewer cars. Despite this, we will need to discover alternative sources to power our cars. New cars are already on the market which work with hydrogen, electricity, or solar panels.

First, advertisements tend to overexaggerate the effects of the product. For example, many cosmetics claim in their advertisements that they have special elements that make your skin white within just two weeks or make your face look better. When you see the advertisement, you will be attracted by the slogans or marvel at its magical effect, and you will buy it. There's no solid evidence or medical reports that prove the product is that useful, but the advertisements often use beautiful models and exaggerated speech to convince you to buy the product.\n\nSecond, the advertisement is a work being thoroughly and specially designed. Through the lighting and computer adjustments, the product can be seen as perfect in the advertisements. Take the shampoo advertisement as an example; the model's hair always looks so shiny and smooth in the ads after they use the shampoo. However, the hair is very artificial. There is no way people's hair can be that perfect, but the company that produces the shampoo spends a huge amount of money on the filming to make you believe that their shampoo is really that good.\n\nFinally, the advertisement is often selling a concept of lifestyle, not the product itself. It is not the product that is appealing, but the ideal lifestyle beneath it that attracts you. The product can be bad, but as long as you want to have the lifestyle that the advertisement promotes, you will buy the product. For instance, in house ads that emphasize the idea that a single woman can live alone happily, the house itself is not that important. It is the wish to live as a happy single noble that makes you want to buy the house.\n\nTo conclude, the advertisement is a carefully designed work that promotes a concept and often exaggerates the product. Thus, it makes the products seem much better than they really are."}

My main reasoning is that it depends on the path one wants to follow whether an academic specialization makes sense or not. My aim is to explain this argument in the following sentences by looking at the broad academic field of business.\n\nIn Switzerland, a master's student can choose whether he wants to specialize in one specific subject—such as finance—or to keep his focus on a broad approach which includes subjects such as marketing, human resources, finance, strategic management, risk management, and leadership.\n\nTo illustrate my hypothesis mentioned above, I will now have a look at two different jobs within a company.\n\nA general manager and his management team need not be specialized in one specific subject as they have to address problems of many different fields—such as leadership issues, marketing decisions, and financial topics. An important aspect of the job of a manager is the need to quickly decide on many different issues. Thus, a broad education is actually an advantage.\n\nAn employee in the financial sector, such as in a bank, does not need to have such a broad knowledge. Rather, it is essential that he possesses in-depth knowledge of the transactions within the sector and of the sector itself. The job requirement is much more focused. Rather than just knowing a little about everything, it is advisable to have a solid knowledge of this special topic—and finance, for example, is actually still a rather broad subject.\n\nBut of course, it is needless to say that knowledge is always an added asset. However, one has to decide first which path will be chosen in order to be able to make a sound decision on whether an academic specialization makes sense."}

I'm not saying that having a lot of knowledge is a bad idea, but specializing in a particular area is the step toward leaving your name in a history book. The depth to which a particular area of knowledge is explored is far more beneficial than having a broad knowledge of every academic subject. Therefore, I strongly disagree with the statement, as it only guides you more toward being a 'normal person.'\n\nFrom not only historical evidence but also personal experiences, specializing in a certain area of knowledge will surely make you special from all the rest. Moreover, it is the best way of leading to success in future life.\n\nTo begin with, a famous English plant scientist has made the most remarkable achievement in the area of biology. But what sets him apart from the rest of the biologists? It is because of his consistency and specialized work in the observation of pea plants; he studied the same plants for over 20 years and thus finally won a Nobel Prize for his achievements. Not only will he be remembered, but his investment in and contribution to the field of genetic coding will also bring great benefits to the rest of society.\n\nFurthermore, a famous French writer named 'Silvia Plath' is known for the poems she wrote, the sadness and emotions conveyed through her work. By reading her poems, emotions and a sense of sadness soon arise. She is not any different from other poets, but one aspect that makes her so famous is her use of metaphor and the precise descriptions of surroundings, which create a sense of a shady cloud when reading her work. This has made her work still popular, and many modern poets are looking to achieve and trying to emulate her style.\n\nLastly, not only people in the academic area are famous, but also one of the most well-known individuals, 'Michael Jordan,' is known for his basketball skills. However, many do not know that even though he may have seemed to be the best basketball player at the time, it was once said by his college professor and coach that 'It seems like basketball and Michael have a strong bond; he seems to only know how to play good basketball.' And surely, the world has proven him right; he has won himself billions of dollars and fame simply by playing good basketball.\n\nIn conclusion, from these examples, we can clearly see that specializing in a specific area not only makes one famous but also ensures that one's name will be left in the history books. By this, I strongly disagree with the previous statement."}
{"file_id": "1149926.txt", "output_essay": "I agree that people nowadays do not devote enough time to helping their communities. Communities can prosper only when everyone gets along and makes the community better in many ways. This may be due to various reasons.\n\nOne reason is that today, people have become so busy that they hardly have time to spend with their communities. They are so preoccupied with other matters that they don't give much preference to what's going on in the community. They hardly are able to make enough time to spend with the community, let alone help it.\n\nBecause of their complex lifestyles, people generally prefer to spend time on other interesting things than going to the community and helping others. Even though it is important to help communities, one can't be forced into taking up the cause. People cannot be forced into doing community services without their willingness. Those who do not do community service do not know what it is all about; they imagine it as one of the boring things in life.\n\nAnother thing that takes people away from helping communities is their hectic schedule. People usually work on weekdays and want to relax during the weekends. They consider helping service as a job, which makes them think whether they should get involved or relax and get ready for the next week.\n\nDue to their poor knowledge regarding what is meant by 'helping their community,' this is also a big factor that forces people away from participating in community service. People should be made aware of the effects that helping can have on society; it is for their betterment that these types of services are being conducted. People are more concerned about themselves and do not give much attention to the happenings in society. For example, due to a lack of awareness, people don't even know what's going on in their surroundings.\n\nTo conclude, people are moving away from their duties. They tend to forget their responsibilities towards the community, which indeed is a larger family. Helping the community will only give satisfaction that he or she has contributed to society in one way or another. Thus, people should try and make some time for helping others in the community, which can only make the community better to live in."}

On the one hand, if you take risks, there is always the danger of failure. Depending on how great the risk is, you may lose nearly everything you possess. Admittedly, this is an even harder decision if you are responsible for a family. I remember a time in my childhood when my father thought of expanding his local drugstore. Certainly, it had been a great chance, but after several sleepless nights, he decided not to take the risk due to his care for his family. In addition, trying something new always comes with a lot of hard work. Why should you do it if you can maintain your status with work you know how to do well?\n\nIn my opinion, you do it because you will get rewarded if you try something new. I find trying out new things fun and interesting. In other words, when I try something new, I have the wonderful chance to broaden my horizons. If you never give it a try, you will never know if there is something you might like better. I, for example, invested all my money during my studies to open a small copy shop for co-eds. What I received back from this little business was not only the money to finance my studies but also the invaluable experience of applying my theoretical knowledge from university to the real business world. This helped me a lot to succeed.\n\nIn a nutshell, I agree that it is more comfortable to do only the things you know well. However, risking something improves our experience and provokes innovation, the latter being one of the key factors that drive our economy."}

But is this true? I don't think so. There are hundreds of young people working for their communities. But why do adults say that? Maybe because they have not seen it.\n\nHow can young people show adults what they are doing for their communities? Do they have to come in front of them and show what they have done? No. Young people nowadays are working and helping their communities in their original styles. For example, the club DJ.

Many older people think and say that young people have freedom and they can do whatever they want. However, that is not true for young people because there are many things to do for young people before they become adults.\n\nAs a young person, I feel like I have a very limited life. Teens go to school every day, they have to do their homework and projects, and they also have to prepare to go to college. Preparing for college gives a lot of stress to young people because most students want to go to good colleges. In order to go to a good college, they need to work hard in school and also they need to do many extracurricular activities. Even though they have something that they want to do, either there is no free time for them or there are things that are not allowed for young people. Also, in order to achieve their goals in the future, it seems it is necessary to go to college and study in the field they want to study. Without that education, it is hard to get a job in a high position or to earn a lot of money.\n\nNot only that, but they also need to listen to their parents because they are not adults yet. If the parents don't agree with something that you want to achieve, you need to either give up or change your mind. There is actually no freedom for teens at school or at home. Older people are more able to do whatever they want because they have freedom and they don't have financial problems because most of them work. Basically, they can buy anything they want without asking for or getting permission from their parents, and they can also do whatever they want without being pressured by parents.\n\nWe don't exactly know when a young person becomes an older person, but what we do know is that when a person becomes old enough, they can enjoy their life doing whatever they want and they have more freedom than young people."}

In addition, as time passes, these people become tired and are always bored, and they don't want to work, etc. However, I think working is good, but it should not be all the time.

Personally, I think that students need to understand ideas and concepts rather than just learn facts. This is because understanding ideas and concepts widens people's intellectual horizons, and they can use these ideas in more practical ways.\n\nFirst of all, students can broaden their intellectual horizons by understanding ideas and concepts. In the case of learning facts, it is obvious that this helps people recognize some physical things. However, these factual and physical things only allow students to learn those facts. This would limit people's imagination as they cannot understand things above such as using them in other fields. For example, one of the most famous scientists in Korea, Ho Jin Moon, once said that when he was young, he was taught by teachers who just conveyed factual information to students. His parents thought that these methods would restrict their son's understanding, so they moved to America. There, he could take a more idea-based education, and when he grew up, he returned to his mother nation and was eager to dispute ideas and concept-based educations. He argues that by taking this education, students can understand more in-depth knowledge.\n\nOn top of that, people can use their knowledge in practical ways. In today's society, people are bound by and driven by hectic schedules; this hectic atmosphere makes people only focus on the facts so that they cannot use their knowledge in only a few fields. However, the basic ideas and concepts in education are linked to each other. Especially in science, if they understand these basic concepts, learning scientific concepts is easier. To demonstrate, according to a study released by the Korean National Research Center, more than two-thirds of surveyed scientists responded that understanding ideas and concepts is more important because by doing this, students can link their knowledge not only to their major fields but also to other similar scientific fields. They said that electronic science can be useful in manufacturing engineering so that students who are majoring in engineering need to understand electronic science fundamentally.\n\nIn conclusion, I strongly believe that students should focus on understanding ideas and concepts because they can widen their intellectual horizons and"}

Obviously, I think that the production companies couldn't sell a very different product from what we see on television or in newspapers, because people would not buy a bad product again.\n\nI think that advertisers are concerned with showing a thing in its best light, trying to emphasize some qualities and trying to hide the weak points of a product.

{"file_id": "1155868.txt", "output_essay": "Successful people employ various strategies to stand out and achieve success. The main approaches to success involve either taking risks or implementing and applying what they already know or have planned. These two types of individuals may consider different factors in their living environment that will guide them to the most effective path to success.\n\nPeople who are inclined to take risks do so because their surrounding environment compels or encourages them. Their environment might be characterized by poverty, toughness, or numerous deficiencies, which necessitates the search for new and creative ways to meet their needs. These methods are often risky because they have not been tried before. An example of this is the case of inventors. Inventors take the risk of trying risky or unfamiliar procedures to create a unique, new, usable invention that transforms their lives into successful ones. Another example is a company owner who makes a risky decision to address unwanted or sudden market conditions.\n\nPeople who prefer to follow through with their plans usually have a stable life and environment. They follow a conventional path like anyone else but exert more effort and plan wisely to achieve their predetermined goals. Most individuals of this type do not like to take risks without conducting an intensive analysis of all the potential outcomes. As a result, they tend to stick to their plans. An example of this includes individuals who are reluctant to change their careers or those who follow in their parents' footsteps, such as becoming a doctor or a college professor like their parents.\n\nIn my opinion, I prefer to stick to my plans without taking risks. It is safer for my career and social position, and I lack the strong ability to find alternative solutions in the event of failure from any risky action. Moreover, it is more convenient for me to live with a consistent pattern throughout my life, with reasonable improvements similar to the average person. I also place great importance on my stable life, which does not compel me to take risks."}
{"file_id": "1165600.txt", "output_essay": "I agree that in twenty years, advancements in the convenience of public transport and/or concerns for the environment will decrease the number of cars in use compared to today. Public transportation will prove to be more efficient than owning a private car. Not only does it save money, but it also saves time. Using public transportation will save money in two ways. Firstly, the expenses on fuel would be cut to zero. Secondly, one no longer has to spend money on car maintenance. Adding to that, using public transportation will also save time because there will be less traffic. This is especially true for subways. Because of the increased benefits of using public transportation as technology advances, the population who would prefer owning a car would dwindle.\n\nAnother reason that the number of cars is going to decrease is that there are growing concerns for the environment. Environmentalists have been active in promoting the conservation of nature through media. They have successfully managed to alert the world about the seriousness of global warming and have also educated society on ways to prevent a serious disaster. These same environmentalists have convinced many that preservation of nature is highly urgent. Also, they have stated that the earth will run dry on fuel in a few years. Thus, increasing numbers of people who abide by such beliefs will result in the decrease of car usage.\n\nIn conclusion, because of the effectiveness of public transportation and concerns for preserving nature, fewer and fewer people would be willing to own cars. When public transportation saves money and time compared to owning a personal car and when the earth can be subject to serious catastrophe because of the use of cars, could you possibly justify purchasing a car?"}

Some people think that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. I agree with this statement.\n\nThe reason why advertisements were invented is to increase the level of sales. Therefore, advertisements promote products and must convince the buyer that he needs the promoted products. To this aim, the products are presented as the best product ever invented even though it is often false. Advertisements are created to attract customers, to make them buy the proposed products.\n\nFor instance, it is common to see on television advertisements which explain that the presented product has been tested by a certain number of customers who expressed their satisfaction when they used the product. However, there is no proof of such a study and those results cannot be ascertained.\n\nThe promoted product must appeal to the customer and therefore, lots of technological means are used in order to improve the image of products. Indeed, nowadays, lots of software are invented in order to fix pictures, to erase some elements of the pictures. To some extent, advertisements are often broadcast on television; the best way to attract customers is to show a beautiful product, with nice colors and a nice shape.\n\nFor example, advertisements often concern food products. When a cake is promoted, the nice color of the cake will obviously attract the customer. In the same vein, the nice shape of the cake will also appeal to the customer. Therefore, the customer will buy the product, thinking that he will get the same article as the one exposed in the advertisement and he will be disappointed because the cake cannot have, in reality, the same color as the one obtained thanks to computer software used for pictures.\n\nIn conclusion, advertisements are always using false information and it is difficult to put boundaries between well-conducted advertisements and false information."}

As far as I am concerned, I generally agree with the assertion that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.\n\nFirst of all, one of the central reasons that can be presented for my position is that the things that have been done by successful people take a long time and experiences to make better. Examples can easily be found to support my view. The most famous inventor, Edison, invented the light bulb in a very early period. However, he didn't spend time on how to improve his invention. After a long time of life experiences, others improved the light bulb better, such as the color and the usage time. Under the circumstances, successful people trying new things and taking risks is much better. In addition, another equally crucial aspect is that a new thing's come out can increase the possibility of other related new products' inventions. This example can tell it right. The light bulb came out soon after the discovery of electricity, because these two inventions have something in common or a relation. As a result, successful people always succeeded in making lists of new things after they made one. This can demonstrate beyond any doubt that successful people should keep on going, not stay behind.\n\nHowever, I don't want to overstate the advantages of my agreement, since it also still suffers from some comparative merits in some specific cases. Firstly, when people try to invent new things, it takes a long time to reach the achievement. Secondly, to sum up, according to the above-mentioned reasons and examples, the idea that successful people should try new things and take risks becomes more convincing to me, although it has some negative aspects which we cannot deny."}
{"file_id": "1164382.txt", "output_essay": "The statement 'It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject' is an important point, which plays a big role in society, especially in education.\n\nOn the one hand, you can agree with this statement because it is very important to have a basic background of education. You should know the basic facts in different academic subjects. This way of thinking can be found in schools. At school, pupils are expected to be good in every subject. They should be good at maths, languages, biology, chemistry, and sports. So a pupil has to concentrate on every subject to achieve good results after school.\n\nOn the other hand, critical people would ask: 'Why should a pupil, who is good and very interested in maths, also be good and interested in sports?' This would be the other way of thinking. Some parents, for example, think that it is enough when pupils are talented in certain subjects because after school they go to a university, where they also concentrate just on a special subject, which they choose to study.\n\nI am of the opinion that a mix of the two ways is the best solution. I think people, and especially children, should have a basic education in every subject. It makes no sense to send a child very early to a school that is based on a special subject, like a science school for example, or a sports school. Pupils should learn the basic information in politics or in geography and other important subjects. I think it is a good way to send children firstly to a normal school and after graduating, pupils have to decide on their own where they want to go and which university mostly agrees with their own interests. So the pupils would have a basic knowledge which you need in society and after this, they can concentrate on a special subject."}

While an understanding of ideas and concepts can provide us with basic knowledge of the nature and society that surround us, on the other hand, learning facts gives us the opportunity to feel and experience things that might happen in our lives. Both ideas are important, but for students, it is more important to learn facts rather than understand the ideas and concepts of a subject.\n\nFirstly, learning facts is more accurate and reliable in many fields and different posts. Take crime scene investigation, for example; we don't know the exact cause of the death of a victim until we open the body and examine it thoroughly. A single substance in the artery may have a vital influence on a human, but we can't find this in textbooks. The same theory applies to the teaching of students in school, especially in biology; only through a real experiment can they understand the concepts more clearly and correctly.\n\nSecondly, through learning from the facts, students can remember things more efficiently. The vivid image of the process of how organs work and respond to each other may leave a strong impression on students, which is easier for them to remember than the boring contents of concepts or the textbook. As a high school student myself, my classmates and I both prefer classes in labs rather than classrooms; they are both exciting and impressive.\n\nThirdly, from the viewpoint of emotional development, learning facts can make one's life more colorful by experiencing and thinking about the connections and consequences of how things are organized. Because in the early years of our lives, we learn things through facts and experiences. The knowledge we attain at this period is original and pure; it is just the fact, which is more realistic. The more experiences we have, the more calm and objective attitude we can have when faced with an emergency.\n\nIn conclusion, despite the fact that we can get a shortcut by learning the concepts that are already proven and given to us, we should still try to find the answers by ourselves."}

{"file_id": "1165738.txt", "output_essay": "Since World War II ended, the younger generation has enjoyed their life more than their elders. They, the would-be Baby Boom generation, were adept at various forms of entertainment and were exposed to splendid media such as Hollywood movies and Broadway musical shows. There are a few reasons why young people are better at having a great time than older people.\n\nFirst, young people know well how to play whenever they want eagerly. They know where the best bar is, what trend is going on, or who the most famous actor is these days. Of course, older people have no time to have fun in order to earn enough money for their family, like a daughter who is interested in an expensive jewelry brand. However, young people don't need too much money because they have no one to provide for. They just maintain their living costs, which includes money to go to the best club in Soho.\n\nSecond, young people are healthier than older people because they have young and strong bodies that older people don't have. Older people have to pay for their medical care and medicines in order to maintain their health. In contrast, young people do not need to make any medical payments at all.\n\nFinally, young people tend to be curious about all the strange things they have never seen before. When older people avoid a stranger from another country, young people try to engage with them through positive activities. For example, in a small town, if a tourist visits for his or her academic research on modern agriculture from a foreign country, young people or children will try to talk to him or her.\n\nThese reasons are why I think that young people are more enjoyable than older people."}

I think it highly depends on the character of a person.\n\nPeople might be very successful doing what they have done all their life. Usually, they are very experienced in what they do, and with their knowledge and background, they are able to make the right decisions, which eventually might lead to great success.\n\nOn the other hand, people who take risks and who are willing to learn new things, theories, and perspectives can generally be characterized as more open-minded. They have to adapt to new situations and be more flexible. They must pay attention to market changes and adapt to their environment. It can also be assumed that people who seek new challenges are more motivated than those who do the same things every day because they will not get bored by daily monotony.\n\nNot only do new challenges lead to new opportunities for success, but I also think that having and gaining knowledge in more than one field, rather than being a specialist in one particular topic, provides a lot more options for success. Being able to follow and participate in discussions on a variety of fields might earn the respect of others. It is much easier to give an objective opinion if one can substantiate this opinion with solid experience in various fields. I think having a broad range of basic knowledge is far more impressive than just being able to lecture on one specific topic. People with common sense and a variety of interests are more likely to be employed by an employer than a specialist who has never looked beyond his narrow confines.\n\nAlthough I can see situations where experience in familiar tasks can lead to success, I, speaking for myself, would prefer learning new things and, accordingly, would also be willing to take some risks. Despite all these arguments about success, I also think that life is much more worth living with the opportunity to face new challenges and learn new things."}
{"file_id": "1152615.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with the statement that most advertisements show more features of the products than they actually have, making them easier to be sold. This phenomenon is observed almost all over the world, and I think it is reasonable to accept.\n\nThe first reason is that advertising is meant to highlight the positive aspects of products and appeal to people to buy them. It is the purpose of advertising. People who create advertisements always study the merchandise carefully and present it as more useful and valuable. Of course, they will present many unconvincing facts in a convincing manner. Even a piece of paper can be described as having the capability to make the user healthier than when using other kinds of paper. You may think it is ridiculous, but advertisements often exaggerate these claims.\n\nSecond, the company that pays for the advertisement is focused on the profits it can generate. The company engages in these practices simply because it wants to increase its sales and earn more money. Input and output are the primary concerns of a company. Therefore, management wants to make the products more attractive to the market, and the advertisement will be as persuasive as possible, with no concern for the facts. There are many illegal advertisements in China that mislead people and have terrible effects on society.\n\nThe last reason is that sometimes people like to see amazing things in advertisements, even though they do not believe them. For example, a woman who is not very fit may want to see some medicines that can help people lose weight. She may dream that she could be as beautiful as the figure shown in the advertisement. She does not want a real product, but just a dream.\n\nSo, advertisements often appear much better than they really are and are acceptable to society."}

For example, ten years ago, while most people did not know the values and benefits of the computer, Bill Gates did. Because he went ahead and tried the new thing—computers—he made a real big fortune from the latest technology.\n\nContrary to those who only do what they know, successful people are always trying new things. They usually have an open mind to absorb all the latest concepts, and they often take risks. For instance, if a businessman adopts an idea that he has never heard before, it must be very risky to use it if the idea is not practical to operate.\n\nThere will be two different outcomes when using new thoughts: success or failure. Most people will not dare to adopt new things because they are afraid that they may lose everything. In this way, they gradually develop the idea that they do not want to learn new things and take advantage of them.\n\nIn contrast, this idea is seldom formed in the hearts of successful people. They, of course, know what the risks might be, but they are not afraid. Successful people usually have a positive mindset that keeps them moving forward.\n\nIn conclusion, I truly agree with the opinion that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well."}

Also, I get a chance to meet many interesting people and make new friends from different walks of life, which also makes the tour even more exciting and interesting. It takes care of my spending as I can budget my trip well, allocating appropriately to shopping and other needs, and it also saves me from getting cheated in a foreign land.\n\nI can visit all the important places of the cities, and the guide would help in knowing about the importance and significance of the places better. In addition, I could be more involved in the group while traveling, which would help me in communicating with a variety of people and enhance my knowledge horizon socially, as well as give me a chance to learn about different minds. The guide would also personally help in finding happening and other interesting places in the cities which are not part of the schedule. It would also help in time management as we have to adhere to the timings scheduled by the tour guide.

{"file_id": "1165743.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with the statement.\n\nI think that facts show that most successful people have tried new things and taken more risks than unsuccessful people. For example, most big computer corporations are owned or managed by people who took many risks in the 1970s and 1980s by investing in the new, emerging computer products. Those people took many risks and succeeded.\n\nSuch reality is in accordance with the economic principle that 'more risk involves more gain.' Therefore, it is probable that a person who takes risks will have more profits than a person who only does what he knows best. This is under the assumption that the person who takes such risks is a well-educated person and not just a gambler.\n\nAlso, if a person only does what he already knows how to do best, he will not gain more experience and the knowledge that he will require in order to be successful. For example, if a person only does what he already knows how to do best, he will probably never fail. This may seem like something good, but it is not. It is very important to fail in order to learn from our mistakes. That is why successful people have often failed numerous times. For example, many of today's wealthy individuals have been declared bankrupt many times.\n\nFinally, the result of trying something new is most of the time a new product, which, after having the corresponding trademark rights declared, gives a person the exclusive right to sell it. For example, most successful pharmaceuticals have become such due to the invention of new drugs. This could only be achieved because such pharmaceuticals took many risks and did things differently. It is important to mention that this does not only apply to professionals but also to artists. Many artists have been successful because they have performed their art in a different way, taking many risks."}

Young people have more energy compared to any older person. More energy helps them to take part in more activities. However, this could only be true if this energy is spent towards positive activities.\n\nWhen a person is young, he is always in the learning stage. So many times, they may come across new places and new things; they will enjoy knowing about it because it would be their first interaction with it. For example, simple driving—young people may find it more joyful than older ones because driving would be a relatively new activity for them as compared with older ones, who could be frustrated with daily traffic and other issues related to it.\n\nIf you ask this same question to schoolchildren during their exams, it can be expected what their answers would be. But during their vacation time, it may be the opposite. This lets us know how immature a human being is when he is in his young ages. An immature human being means not understanding responsibilities towards their life as well as an older person could understand. In short, a young person could have fewer responsibilities in his life compared with an older person, which puts an older person into a more stressed life.\n\nHaving said all this, life is great. It's better we understand our different stages of life and enjoy each stage as it comes. Each stage of life has its own beauty; to lead a happy life, one should understand this and should enjoy his or her life to the fullest, no matter what age he or she is."}
{"file_id": "1142749.txt", "output_essay": "Nowadays, students have lost their interest in the provenance of ideas and concepts. As time goes on, there are fewer students interested in answering questions such as 'How was Newton's law conceived, and what is its mathematical basis?' or 'How was steel first created from its natural constituents?' Students are losing that curiosity in how facts are conceived due to a lack of interest in things they think already exist and do not need to be studied again by them because it was already clarified centuries ago by someone else. Instead, they would rather learn and understand the final results obtained years ago, which have been put under evaluation several times through all these years. To explain further this point, let us take a look at the two examples mentioned at the beginning of this essay: Newton's law. Back in Isaac Newton's time, it surely was important to prove his second law of motion by measuring the time a body lasts in free-falling motion from a determined height. Nowadays, students do not care for proving this theory by implementing their own experiments; they would rather study the formula developed by Newton and apply it in a physics problem with only one purpose: to get a good grade at the end of the course. Now let us take a look at the second example: the manufacture of steel. There is a big theory in this field, and research is still carried out on it. Many cultures were involved in the early years of the iron era, and a lot of experiments were carried out to study how iron reacted with air to produce steel; many manufacturing techniques were studied to come up with the idea of using high-temperature furnaces to produce steel. This last result is the one that matters for students; they are only interested in understanding how steel is formed in a chemical reaction in order to get a good grade once again. They do not care about proving to themselves that steel can be manufactured in such ways. The reason why students act this way has already been mentioned: they are told to worry only about a degree, and they are not allowed to let their minds think about what they really like. It would be better if students were allowed to study what they really like. In this way, a student who really likes chemistry and physics will surely wonder about the facts, while a student who wants to develop an artistic talent such as painting does not have to worry about things he does not really care about."}

Albert Einstein once said, \"Try to be a man of value, not a man of success.\" Success follows people who are innovative in their ideas and are expressive in presenting them freely. Albert Einstein never set out to come up with the 'Theory of Relativity.' It was his desire to explore and question every aspect of everyday life that brought him the fame of being the inventor of the 'Theory of Relativity.'\n\nConstant change is human nature. And the people who bring about this change in an evident manner are the ones who are ready to think outside the box. Centuries ago, everything was done on paper, from stories to accounts, medicine to religion, etc. Today, everything is written on tape drives and stored electronically. Thanks to mankind, who was constantly looking for options to change. We went from pen to typewriter, then to computer, and to supercomputers today. The numerous inventions made in every field of life are all because someone somewhere was thinking beyond the ways they knew how to do well. It was the quest to do things better and add value to what is being done today that led to new discoveries.\n\nTake the example of Bill Gates. He is successful today because he started Microsoft, a Windows operating system that sits in almost every household today. His desire to do something new brought him this fame. And his quest to constantly bring about change to the world is keeping his success intact.\n\nIn summary, it is seen all around: people who have taken the risk to do something new are the ones who have achieved success and fame."}

They might serve one's purposes for a short term, but in the long run, they usually reveal their shortcomings.\n\nThe very same rule can be applied in this case.\n\nAt first glance, the advantages of specialized knowledge seem to be overwhelming. Nearly every modern company or even scientists in universities serve as good examples. To be successful in your part of business, you have to know everything about it, and additional knowledge only serves as a distraction. Since the times of big breakthrough inventions are all gone, everybody specializes in a very narrow field. In a small subject, we now have an absolute expert, knowing nearly everything about it. To a certain extent, this is absolutely necessary. Who else can deal with nano-composites, for example, except someone who has studied this subject for many years? But as soon as a wider overview is needed, this type of scientist very often fails. How can they know about new methods in medicine that might well be adopted within the field of nano-composites if all they ever studied are nano-composites? It is therefore possible that lacking interdisciplinary skills often results in disadvantages. Furthermore, a person with a tremendous amount of knowledge in only one field most definitely lacks interest in other things, and therefore misses so many things in life.\n\nThe other extreme would be people who know something about everything but nothing of importance about any specific field. While these individuals might have the interdisciplinary skills, they would certainly lack the knowledge they need to combine anything of real use and importance. There is simply no need for these persons in academia, since a certain understanding of specific problems is always needed.\n\nI therefore strongly support the idea of a combination of these two types. Of course, I am aware of the fact that we can never gain specific knowledge in all academic subjects. This will remain an illusion.\n\nI favor the humanistic approach. Specialize in one or two subjects, but never lose your ability to overview a wider field. If you are a mechanical engineer, don't lose your interest in theatre."}
{"file_id": "1149147.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with the fact that if you want to be successful, you have to take risks sometimes. I want to stress that it does depend on the individual's situation.\n\nFor example, if a creative director of an advertising agency has had lots of success with using one certain method in creating an ad, it is smart to stick with that method. At some point, as time changes, people's interests change and the creative director needs to consider a different method in creating an ad. If the director won't consider doing so, he might lose his clients. This is when I would say that it is important to take a risk and do something different with your ad.\n\nBased on my own experiences, I have to say that I had more success with taking risks at times. For example, I have a great passion for the arts and therefore, I have taken quite a few drawing and painting classes in the past. At some point, one of my teachers graded me down on one of my projects because apparently, I always used the same method in drawing, and I never tried something new.\n\nThis is when I decided to try pastel paint, instead of the good old charcoal. My teacher was impressed by the color composition, which was a change from just black and white drawings. My teacher gave me a better grade, not necessarily because the picture was better than my other pictures, but rather because of the fact that I was able to deal with something new, such as pastel.\n\nTrying new things gives you exposure to different perspectives, which makes you a more open person to new things. If you constantly stick with the same old thing, you show a lack of flexibility. It also shows that you can only be successful in the same area.\n\nIf you try and practice different things, it gives you the opportunity to show more expertise in different areas. If you don't take the risk of trying something new, you never know whether you could be more successful or not."}

The reason for this is the simple fact that a tour guide would take you to a set of places for which the city is famous, and these places might not necessarily interest me in particular.\n\nI would like to cite a simple example. Last year, for New Year's, I had gone to Goa (which happens to be a major tourist destination in India). Goa is known for a lot of things: great beaches, brilliant churches (Goa was under Portuguese control for over 200 years, so there is a lot of European influence in the architecture), and a pretty rocking nightlife.\n\nMy friends and I decided against having a tour guide as 'Goan Music,' in other words, 'Psy Trance,' interests us more than the churches or the beautiful beaches out there. The tour guide would have charged us a bomb for showing the churches, talking a bit about the local culture, and walking us down the beaches! We went to Goa for the simple fact that it happens to be the hub for some great electronic music, and since everyone in my group was inclined to the same objective, all of us started exploring the city all by ourselves!\n\nWe bought some local maps, hired a couple of bikes, asked people for directions, and it all added to the experience! I wouldn't have enjoyed it to this extent had I gone with a tour operator.\n\nGuides are only out there to make money, and in today's world, guides aren't a necessity while going on a trip because you have enough information available in the form of books, the internet, etc.\n\nSo, I would strongly recommend going alone and doing away with a tour guide because it would add to the whole experience of travel."}

So, I had to act. I found problems and I mean that I solved problems by myself. Similarly, my father experienced the same thing. He had failed in business, but he didn't give up. He tried other things and kept working. Finally, he succeeded in his business. I want to say don't give up, keep trying to work hard.\n\nI will write another story. Everybody knows about Thomas Edison. When he was a child, everybody called him 'stupid' and 'foolish'. Even his parents were worried about him. One day, he brought in some eggs. He said, 'I can make chickens, mom, babies will come.' He kept wondering about things and trying to do them. Eventually, he succeeded in his work. We know about the light bulb. He discovered it himself. Anyone can try to do things and should not be scared of new things.\n\nIn conclusion, I think that successful people have a clear reason for their success. Those things are that they are not scared of new things and take risks. They keep trying to gain experience and take on challenges. We need to learn from their lives or lifestyles."}

Successful people are those who continually experiment to simplify existing things and are the ones who innovate. For example, in early man's time, people traveled by carts. But nowadays, we can travel overseas using cars, airplanes, helicopters. If humans hadn't tried new things or used their innovative minds, they wouldn't have been able to design new and faster modes of transportation.\n\nMoreover, for success, taking risks and trying new things is necessary. For instance, in my family, my mother is a housewife, as was my grandmother. However, I aspire to be a scientist, so I am challenging our traditional norms. I am attempting things that nobody in our family has, such as planning to go abroad for a doctoral degree because my country is developing. Therefore, I personally believe in the aforementioned statement.\n\nWe should always strive to innovate and contribute new ideas to the world. Creating new technologies by taking risks is the key to success. For example, if nobody had attempted to go to the moon, we wouldn't have been able to explore and understand its appearance and properties.\n\nHowever, trying new things can sometimes be dangerous. For instance, Kalpana Chawla, a renowned NASA astronaut, died when her spacecraft was returning to Earth after making some valuable discoveries.\n\nBut in the long run, \"Success goes to those who keep on trying new things instead of sticking to old ones\"."}

One is the traditional Otto motor, the other one is an electric one. This kind of car is very economical. They run on oil when they are in normal mode. In this mode, they charge up the batteries for the electric mode. After a short ride, especially fast rides (they produce more energy), you can use the electric motor. We have to support technical research to improve inventions like this. In the future, it will be more important to invest money in research.\n\nAnother point that underlines the theory is that there are countries in the world that are now beginning to use cars.

However, sometimes they have to choose whether to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects or to specialize in one specific subject. For myself, I will choose the latter but will try to get some balance as well.\n\nNowadays, knowledge is expanding every day; as a result, it is rather difficult for one to learn broadly and deeply at the same time. Having broad knowledge seems attractive, but actually, it is not practical upon second thought. In the academic circle, there are experts and authorities in almost every field, all of whom have specific research interests and accomplishments of their own. If one spends most of their time learning about many subjects, they may not have the time to conduct related research. Besides, since it is quite easy to access information currently, it is not necessary to know everything; if you want, you can look up the needed information soon.\n\nHowever, if one specializes in one specific subject, things will be quite different, especially when he or she chooses a valuable but rarely-touched field. Under this situation, he or she will become the expert in this field and it is possible to conduct some quite profound research on it, which will be more beneficial than knowing a lot but really understanding little about each subject. As long as researchers are willing to share their results, communicate with each other, and do teamwork when necessary, it does not matter whether all these researchers have broad knowledge.\n\nAt the same time, to maintain some balance, it is also important for a researcher to know some basic knowledge about related subjects, which could broaden their perspective and inspire fresh ideas.

There has been a gradual increase in the number of cars everywhere. I don't think that the number of cars will be reduced in the coming years. Instead, there will be more cars seen than what we see today. They play a major role in transportation.\n\nFirstly, cars are regarded as a status symbol for many people. They buy them just to show their status rather than using them for some genuine reason. Cars seem to have had a drastic impact on every class of people, starting from the lower middle class to the upper class. So, in no way can a car disappear.\n\nSecondly, they are considered to be more comfortable. A car is preferred because it is easy to reach our destination rather than waiting for some public transportation. It doesn't give much stress and makes people feel relaxed when compared to other means of transportation.\n\nA car can be used at any time and makes our work done in a cool way instead of rushing for other ways. Finally, nowadays, the prices of cars have also declined for various reasons. So, they are affordable even for a middle-class person, which again symbolizes a rise in the car population.\n\nBeing a car owner, any person can make plans spontaneously and even implement them, like planning for a picnic. An example of why anyone would go for a car is that it may be used for all purposes, both for official and personal matters. And a car doesn't release much gas, and it is not the main culprit for pollution either. Cars not only serve personally but they are even used as public transportation, like taxis. So, a car has its effect on every aspect of a person's life, helping to reach destinations and to enjoy luxuries too. I conclude that I can't imagine a road without a car as it carries many advantages."}

When students just see the concept in class or the definition of something, it's difficult for them to remember it just as they saw it in class. However, if they see a specific case about the same concept, it will be easier to keep it in mind because they can relate it to real life.\n\nFor example, last semester in my human resources class, I had a teacher who always helped us relate theory to practice. I remember one class where we learned what an interview was and what it consisted of, and she took a classmate to conduct a mock interview, explaining all the steps we needed to do to make it right and showing the most common mistakes that we could commit.\n\nI found it was so enriching for everybody in class, and after that, when I entered my first job, I could remember everything I had learned and I applied it to reality.\n\nWhen we learn facts, it also helps us to connect them with our own experiences.\n\nOn the other hand, I have had classes where we were filled with concepts and definitions of some subjects, but we really didn't know how to put them into practice, and I do think all this information goes away.\n\nIn conclusion, to learn in a classroom or out of it, it will always be better to understand facts and to relate them to reality. It will also be easier for us to explain and to teach somebody else because we have already absorbed this information. Professors should do this with students from a young age to provide them with an important tool to learn better."}
{"file_id": "1138106.txt", "output_essay": "Some people might say that it's better to be a 'Master of one' than being a 'Jack of all trades.' But in my personal opinion, it's better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in just one. Life is made up of not just one thing, but a variety of things and subjects. It is important for any individual to know at least the basics of almost all, if not all, subjects. Life is integrated with various issues.\n\nThe main reason for me to support the idea that experience and knowledge are needed in various aspects of life is to survive in this constantly changing world. The world can take any turn at any time in life. It is hard to predict the twists in the market. A market in one field can drop suddenly one day, and all businesses in that field will close. So it's better to have knowledge of other fields, at least the preliminary knowledge and skills, so that the person can think of starting up a new business if one doesn't work.\n\nThe second point is recreation. If a person knows a few more things to do in life other than his regular routine work, it will be like a change for him, which he can enjoy and have fun. You get to know more people around you when you interact, and it will help to build relationships between them.\n\nIt's a part of our duty to maintain a balance of everything in life. Let us consider one example: currently, it's the trend of computers and technology, and many people will only take up subjects in computer science and neglect other aspects like ecology, sociology, and economics. Who should care for the betterment and preservation of nature and the nation if no person is knowledgeable about at least the basics of ecology? Everyone should be aware of things taking place in and around his place, his society, and the nation as a whole.\n\nGeneral knowledge is required to be successful in life. Every business tycoon in this country has varied fields of experience and knowledge. If we consider the owner of McDonald's, who is not just a hotelier but a realtor too. Only because of this, he is able to start up millions of McDonald's centers in every busy commercial corner of the world. He integrated his knowledge of marketing and real estate into the knowledge of the food industry.\n\nThus, to conclude, in my views, I feel that to lead an independent and successful life, it's necessary to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects and I strongly agree with the statement."}
{"file_id": "1166363.txt", "output_essay": "Yes, I agree with the statement, \"The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.\" Traveling with a group of people is a preferable option to traveling alone. There are many factors that benefit us when we travel in a group led by a tour guide.\n\nFirstly, considering the security factor, which is a significant concern on tours, especially to foreign countries, we can feel more secure in a group than when alone. In the event of difficult situations, we will receive the support of everyone in the group.\n\nSecondly, traveling in a group is economically more recommended than traveling alone. We can share experiences and joy while traveling in a group and benefit from most of the expenditures we face. Many tourism departments in various countries offer attractive tourism packages for those coming on foreign tours. They provide discounts and valuable packages, especially for people traveling in groups rather than alone.\n\nThirdly, we can have a planned timetable and lots of fun throughout the tour with our group members. We can plan more programs and events that will entertain us along with our fellow members. Imagine if our group consists of various talented individuals; then we can organize seminars on research-oriented topics in a foreign land.\n\nLastly, apart from the above factors, such as security, reducing expenditures, presenting individual talents, and the joy we get while traveling in a group, we can also plan some industrial tours or participate in training programs that will enhance our skills in our job and more. Traveling in a group always showcases our identity wherever we tour."}

Some people might agree with this statement because a group tour is not lonely, and a tour guide will guide you to the best travel attractions. However, I firmly believe that traveling alone is the best way to travel. It is far more comfortable. Also, I can do what I really want to do without any regulations.\n\nTo begin with, a solo tour makes me feel very comfortable. Usually, a group tour is a little bit noisy and confusing. But individual travel allows for a calm, peaceful, and cozy tour. For example, when I was going to Japan, I went there with a group. Our tour group members numbered 15. So every time we moved to another location, I had to wait until all members were ready to move. Waiting too much made me angry. After coming back to my country, I thought if I had gone to Japan alone, it would have been a much more memorable trip for me.\n\nAlso, individual travel gives a great opportunity to encourage independence and endurance. When people travel alone, there are no regulations, so they can do what they really want to do. They should plan by themselves and decide what they eat and where they stay. By deciding these things, they will learn many things which couldn't be learned from books. For instance, when I was a senior, I planned to go to America for 4 weeks. I reserved airplanes, restaurants, and hotels. At that time, it was a very hard time for me. But now, I think through these tours, I have learned independence, improved my language skills, and broadened my social relationships."}

When the first Nokia portable phone that was compatible with a camera came out, advertisements everywhere showed that you could videotape scenes and take snapshots of friends. When people actually bought the product, what they saw was reality. Another example is when the iPod was released. Everyone was shocked at how a device smaller than a calculator could store more than a thousand songs. When people went and bought it, they saw how it could do it. It is not that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are; it is about the person who buys the product. Many people, when they see advertisements for new electronic devices, get so excited to see something that new and something that functions in a new way that when they buy the product and use it every day, they get bored of it. So when the person remembers how the product looked on billboards and newspapers and compares it with how it is after owning it for two months, he will think that the advertisement made the product seem much better than it really is. The reality is that the person has been using the product effectively, which led to him getting bored of it. My opinion is that most advertisements show what the real product is and that they don't exaggerate the product. Another problem is that many people misunderstand the advertisement. When the person goes to buy the product and then finds out that it doesn't function the way he thought, the individual then becomes unsatisfied. I think that people should understand the advertisement and what they are trying to say, understanding the message that they are trying to send."}

There is nothing wrong with the people because the effects of the products can also be dangerous, even if the products are portrayed as the most beautiful that exist in the world.\n\nThis type of advertising is most important, specifically for medicinal and cosmetic products that can cause very serious problems. There are so many cases of intoxications. For example, dietetic products are more difficult to actually help you, but by using nice words and false claims, they convince people to take them. The same goes for technology products. Design and beautiful colors are used to distract people from very important aspects like the processors, hardware, RAM, etc. People are attracted by the colors they see and the nice words they hear.\n\nIt relies on people's capacity and attention to understand what is true and right, which can only help them. For money, people may say and do wrong and false things. Another reason for this behavior is the success that is often linked with money. We are conditioned by advertisements, and this is very wrong. We must learn to read the labels on the products and verify that all the things written are correct by asking questions and doing some research. We must also find ways to convince people not to buy if they are not sure."}

Students who know more about different categories of knowledge are usually more open-minded, find it easier to make friends, and have a higher success rate after graduation.\n\nIn this modern business world, all businesses can be connected with other categories of business. Assume a student has graduated and is looking for a job in a company. Obviously, if the student says he or she has a BA degree in business, an AAS degree in finance, and some leadership experience in clubs, they are often hired more easily than someone with only a Doctorate in finance. This is because the student with the higher degree would require higher wages and more power in the company, but could only help the company's financial department. However, the other student, with some background knowledge of business and finance, could be able to assist the company in two departments, making this student more valuable and useful.\n\nMoreover, the student who has broad knowledge of different subjects has more opportunities to get a better job and be able to make more money. The multi-disciplinary knowledge helps people make friends more easily, especially if you have some common interests with others. It is key to making different types of friends around the world. And these friends might be the ones who will give you a good life in the future, which means that the more knowledge you have, the more life you get."}

Because of the sole guide's control and ability to be followed, it is more beneficial for the group to follow him individually than to follow many guides.\n\nControlling a group of tourists with one leader is more beneficial for the followers. This is because one guide can govern his group so that no one else can affect his decisions. Like the one heart in our bodies, the person who leads his group on a tour can make all of them follow him. Otherwise, it is hard for them to continue their tour. For example, if they choose to follow more than one person, confusion may arise.\n\nIf travelers depend on one guide on their tour, it will likely be more successful than if they choose to follow multiple guides."}

If we have a tour guide, then he knows all about the history of the place.\n\nWhile we have a tour guide, we have no worry about planning schedules for where to visit. The tour guide knows all the places in a particular location or all. He may plan the schedules according to our requirements. Generally, he knows all places and moreover, he has a myriad collection of historic events that we should know. He knows the best place to see first and which is the place to see last.\n\nThe tour guide advises where we should stay, the approximate budget for planning the tour, and he may know shortcuts to visit more places and boarding and lodging facilities. He explains about the places with their people's cultures, behaviors, and historic events.\n\nWe may save money while having a tour guide by his right direction about shopping, lodging, boarding, etc. This is because he has a wealth of experience in traveling and in demonstrating different places.\n\nIf we attempt to go without a guide, then some problems will occur, such as not knowing the specific location correctly. We don't know where we have to visit, and we don't know the historic events of the places.

{"file_id": "1171325.txt", "output_essay": "In my opinion, the statement listed on the right does not consider reality. The world is turning into a medical knowledge world. By that, I mean that medication this year saves thousands of people worldwide. The death rate in the world is decreasing over time. Nowadays, we can compete with nearly all infections in the world, except the HIV virus. But as we all know, also the HIV infections in the world are decreasing. People do care more about their health. The government encourages smokers to quit smoking; the USA helps other countries by providing them with food. This all leads to an increase in the world's population.\n\nAnother aspect is the freedom of opportunities. In our year, we do not have slavery or other criminal actions, besides war, that can lead to death. The USA and other countries provide starving African children with food and medication. They also teach them knowledge that is general to us, for example, using a condom to prevent the most known virus in the world, HIV.\n\nMore high-economic countries help citizens of countries with lower economies to share technical knowledge, which helps these citizens grow their economy. Thus, people have a longer living time.\n\nThrough all these factors, in my opinion, people will drive more cars than today. Cars get cheaper because the production of cars will get easier with new technology. Thus, people will buy more cars, or some might have more than one car for themselves.\n\nIn short, when the population of the world increases, the more cars we will have in twenty years. We all know that it is comfortable to drive a car to get from one point to another. This will, in my opinion, not change in the next twenty years."}
{"file_id": "1147775.txt", "output_essay": "A world with fewer cars! Sounds preposterous now, but I think this is going to be a reality in twenty years from today. There are various reasons why I hold this opinion. These include population growth, fuel crisis, and popular consciousness about the environment.\n\nThe population of the world is only growing by the day. Naturally, we would expect more cars to roll on the roads. But, we do not realize that land is not growing in proportion to people. With limited land, there will come a time when we will not be able to find more space for our cars. Then the recourse is a mass rapid transport system, which discourages car use. This has already been seen in Delhi, India's capital city, where the Delhi Metro Rail system has been created to deal with the stress that an increasing vehicular population was creating. Now, we see that the number of cars has indeed come down on the roads because people find it more convenient to take a train to the office, at a negligible price, rather than maintain their own car.\n\nAnother reason why the number of cars might go down is the shortage of fuel. The oil crisis is here for real. It is becoming increasingly difficult to satisfy the energy needs of the world. Very soon, the prices of oil are going to increase very highly. Early signs can already be seen. In such a case, running a car can be very expensive. Research on alternative fuels, like biofuels or solar power, is still in the nascent stage. Thus, it will be very difficult for the common man to buy fuel for his car. In India, the price of petrol has been increasing steadily, and my family now goes out in the car only when it is really necessary or when all four of us have to go out together. Otherwise, we use bikes or, simply, the public transport system.\n\nThe last reason why I think that cars are going to be fewer is the popular sentiment against environmental pollution. Cars use fuel which increases environmental pollution. Therefore, some countries, like those in the Nordic region, encourage their citizens to use bicycles, which are more eco-friendly. They are also a healthier option in comparison to cars as they keep the rider fit. Thus, conscious citizens support such ideas. This trend seems to be catching up, which makes me believe that it will in the future become very popular. In that case, the prospects for cars look bleak.\n\nTo conclude, I believe that cars are going to become rarer in the years to come because of a variety of factors. These include the shortage of two resources: land and oil. These are going to be scarce because of the growing population, in which case cars will not be viable. Finally, when people become more eco-friendly, they would look for options other than cars, which will affect the prospects of these automobiles."}
{"file_id": "1174572.txt", "output_essay": "Being a young person is a difficult thing nowadays. Life does not permit young people to behave as everybody wants. In other words, everybody has started to live just for their benefits. No one asks for what another wants to do. And young people are the biggest example of this. They do not give enough time to helping their communities. There are several places where this happens.\n\nFirstly, young people ignore the important things that are related to their local place. For example, the apartment where they live is going to be cleaned. And the older people ask for help from the young people to clean the apartment. But the young people who are staying in that apartment ignore the elders.\n\nSecondly, young people do not help their parents with housework or household problems either. For example, the television in the house has broken down. And on that day, the mum and dad can be very busy because of other problems. They ask their young son to take the television to the repairer. However, even the young man does not listen to them. Instead of taking the television to the repairer, he goes to a basketball game.\n\nThus, I believe that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities.

{"file_id": "1167441.txt", "output_essay": "The perspicuous phrase, \"On the move,\" has probably been termed after much thought. Research shows that since the dawn of civilization, man has been a tourist in a crude sense. This is evident in the study of nomads, shifting agriculture, and the like. However, my purpose in highlighting this fact is not to discuss history but to merely initiate the debate on whether there will be fewer cars in the coming twenty years or not. In my opinion, the number of cars produced in the future will be on the rise rather than experiencing a decline. I would like to support my stance with the following reasons.\n\nThe automotive industry has witnessed a manifold increase since man invented the wheel. So, to believe that this rise will ever decline is highly unlikely and improbable. Firstly, economic reviews show that living conditions will improve in the future, which means people will have greater leisure time. That suggests that people will have more time to spend with their families and go out on vacations, and using cars, people can drive to farther destinations.\n\nEven if the thought is inclined toward the rich, there is another reason to believe why car production will increase. There has always been a focus on science and technology improving the nature of things, and cars are not an exception. In fact, a lot of investment is going into making solar cars and more fuel-efficient cars. Certainly, the expenditure being done on the research is not to never make use of it in the future. This suggests that people want to have more cars in the future.\n\nLastly, necessity is being combined with luxury in the economic arena as of today. When people have a proportionate rise in income, they use less of public utility services. Taking the middle-income group as an example, I would like to illustrate that an increase in income always shifts people's preferences toward personalized commodities. One would definitely want to own something when one has the money to do so, and with the economic development throughout the world, people would like to switch to owning their own cars rather than using the public transport system.\n\nTherefore, I believe that indeed there will be more cars in the years to come."}

Firstly, these companies are taking high amounts of money from customers and, as a result, they want to appreciate these customers. Rather than using creativity in the preparation process, they just exaggerate the properties of the products. After all these deceptions, the products can be perceived as much more valuable by the public. In order to avoid these types of misleading advertisements, there should be an effective control mechanism, like a properly working group, which investigates the advertisements before they are published. A second solution might be strict regulations, such as fining the misleading companies, etc.\n\nSecondly, these advertisements only emphasize the positive attributes of the product but give no information about its drawbacks. In this way, people who buy the product do not know the weak points of the products. For instance, a product that can clean only smooth surfaces might be used by the owner on a rough surface, which will probably cause deformation to the product. Here, it can be stated that this problem is caused by the advertisement which did not include the constraints of the product.\n\nFinally, there is great competition between the products of different companies, which causes the omission of some ethical values. Rather than stating the drawbacks, praising is a common style in the advertisements.\n\nTo conclude, the advertisements are misleading in most ways, and these faults must be corrected by means of a proper control mechanism. Furthermore, we should know that frankness is the most important virtue on earth."}

On the same lines, it can be said that success follows people who try new horizons, who extend their limit of vision and dare to take on new challenges in a world that is ever-changing. I think that successful people keep trying new things and do not get stuck on any one thing.\n\nThe world has seen many industrialists who tried different businesses. Though they succeeded in some and failed in others, on the whole, they emerged as winners. One bright example that I would like to mention is that of an Indian businessman - Tata. Tata put his first foot in the world of business with an automobile manufacturing unit. He collaborated with foreign companies to provide the best available technologies to customers. The business started with trucks but soon flourished to other classes of vehicles. Recently, Tata introduced the cheapest four-wheeler on Indian roads for the common man. This journey is amazing. But this is not the only thing that Tata did.\n\nTata started different businesses apart from automobiles. Tea, salt, information technology, telecom - he seems to be ubiquitous. He is also successful in these businesses. Now he is planning to take over the world-famous brand 'Jaguar.' Certainly, Tata took great risks when he started every new industry. But great returns demand great risks. A man with vision can handle such risks and emerge as a winner. These are all qualities of a successful person.\n\nHad Tata been interested only in the manufacturing of trucks, he never would have had such a great impact on all other business areas. He tried out new things, and his efforts paid off. His success surely belongs to the way he conquered new opportunities in business.\n\nThus, it can surely be said that one who does the same thing that he already knows how to do well will have less chance to succeed than the one who tries different things and takes calculated risks for greater rewards."}

There are a couple of reasons for this. The first reason is that most advertisements incorporate some kind of 'bubble.'

For example, they entertain to showcase their appearance to people, leading them to believe that these advertisements are really good and thus support them. Another example is the use of commercial shows. Many people spend time watching commercial shows while watching television. Most advertisements utilize commercial shows and entertainment, making products seem much better than they actually are.\n\nSecondly, they are helping each other to make more profits through information exchange or other forms of assistance. They entertain and inform people who are not very knowledgeable about these advertisements. As a result, they attract more people, generate more profit, and produce more products than they are supposed to.\n\nMany advertisements enhance the perceived quality of products beyond their actual value. However, I believe this is one of their skills. Advertisements are a member of the economic cycle. So, I think they are not that bad, except for the excessive embellishment in some cases."}

In my country, there are a lot of tour agencies offering trips to different countries. However, traveling should definitely be done alone because the guide often does not allot much time, traveling alone is more flexible to control time and place to go, and the tour information they provide can be found individually.\n\nIn my personal experience, a tour guide does not give enough time to fully enjoy a site. For example, I once traveled to the Northeastern United States. I went to New York first. One amazing place was Broadway. The musical posters, commercials, and stores attracted me. However, the guide only gave me one hour. I wanted to visit the stores and see a musical, but in one hour, all I could do was take photos and buy a souvenir. If someone is going to travel, they must have flexible time to stay and do something they want to do. Watching a musical, having a cup of coffee, or shopping should be their choice.\n\nIf people travel alone or with their personal group, they are more flexible in time and deciding where to go. When I was in Cuba, I wanted to go to the beach, but it was rainy that day, so I changed my plan to stay indoors. In the evening, I enjoyed dinner on the cool-temperature beach. If someone travels in a group with a tour guide, you cannot change plans; you may end up going to the beach on a rainy day. Also, you might go somewhere you don't want to go and waste hours on a bus.\n\nPeople find tour guides because they are unfamiliar with the place. However, with the invention of the internet and the availability of numerous books about the place, everything you need to know is at your fingertips. People can find maps, places with good views, and where to eat delicious food. Then, they can choose places to go by themselves. My parents once went to Italy with only a book and enjoyed everything without any problems.\n\nFor these reasons, it is fun and also very practical to travel alone or in personal groups. Flexible schedules and individual preferences are the most important things when people travel indeed."}

Astronauts, despite having doubts of their return to Earth, have traveled into space. If it wasn't for their efforts, we would have remained ignorant of the universe and its miracles.\n\nBusiness is a field in which a lot of risk is involved. Nothing is guaranteed in business. There could be a huge loss incurred from the businesses which are undertaken. But still, risks are taken to achieve greater heights. It's the same with the stock market. The path to success in business is full of traps, and they need to be avoided to reach success. That is what many successful people do.\n\nBe it any field, many successful persons have taken calculated risks to reach where they are today. The elegant cricket player Kevin Pietersen, who is originally from South Africa, moved to England to keep his passion alive. The reason for this was stated to be discrimination and politics in sports. Had Kevin Pietersen not taken the risk of leaving South Africa despite being warned by officials that he wouldn't be eligible to play for his country again, the cricket world would have missed a great sportsman. He was also honored by the British government. He is now addressed as Kevin Pietersen MBE.\n\nThe legendary mountaineer Sir Edmund Hillary, along with Tenzing Norgay, climbed Mount Everest. The risk involved in it is of the size of a mammoth. They risked their lives to climb the tallest peak in the world with sheer hard work, and now they have a place in history. The information gathered by them is a giant leap in geological studies.\n\nThese few examples clearly indicate that success comes at a price, and risks have to be taken calculatedly."}

Many advertisements do not make products seem much better than they really are.\n\nNot all advertisements succeed in attracting consumers, which is evident for several reasons. To begin with, some advertisements discourage people from purchasing the products. To illustrate, in many countries, the advertisements for tobacco have warning sentences on them. When I traveled in Australia, I noticed that even photos of lung cancers were used in the advertisements. In this case, the advertisements warn us of the possibility of danger caused by using the products. Indeed, the advertisements for tobacco do not make the products seem better.\n\nFurthermore, some advertisements utilize a unique strategy to attract consumers. For example, Yukiguni Maitake, a Japanese food products company, uses a conspicuous strategy: Its advertisement suggests that consumers should not buy its products. This advertisement is unusual; therefore, many consumers are attracted and ultimately purchase the products. In view of this, advertisements sometimes apply a unique strategy that does not tout the merits of the products.\n\nNevertheless, some critics claim that the role of advertisements is to appeal to the products. However, the facts, as detailed above, reveal that some advertisements attempt to prevent customers from buying their products.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that advertisements usually use different strategies to attract customers.

{"file_id": "1157984.txt", "output_essay": "I disagree that traveling in a group led by a tour guide is better than traveling on our own. From personal experiences, I've learned that touring on our own provides more opportunities to become more knowledgeable about the place we're traveling to, more time to explore unknown places, and more chances to communicate with locals.\n\nAs a personal example, when I went to Cambodia last winter, I was with a tour group led by a guide. Before I went, I knew I had to study the places I would visit, but I postponed such duties because I was expecting the guide to explain everything. Just as I expected, when I visited ancient sites in Cambodia, the tour guide explained every little detail, leaving no room for me to discover more. However, when I traveled to Europe by myself this winter, I felt obliged to study the background information and European history because there was no guide to answer my questions. The fact that I was planning the journey on my own gave me more responsibility to learn about the places I would visit.\n\nSuch cases are not merely limited to my personal experiences. Also, when we travel with a group led by a guide, we have to follow the tour company's tight schedule. Our itinerary is often pre-scheduled, and we simply follow where the guide takes us. We don't have much free time to wander around new places other than the famous tourist sites. However, when we're on our own, we don't have to adhere to a strict schedule. We are free to go anywhere we'd like. Beyond famous tourist sites, we could simply visit local markets or take a walk down the streets—places that are ordinary but also where we can experience the locals' customs and culture.\n\nFurthermore, when we're traveling with a guide, we're too busy following the tight schedules to actually communicate with the locals. Touring with a guide often ends with visiting famous sites and taking pictures. But when traveling on your own, you have more opportunities to actually befriend the locals. Although there might be some language barriers, we can use body language and talk with locals about their lifestyle, customs, and culture. Traveling in a group led by a guide lacks the precious moments to learn about a country through firsthand experience.\n\nTraveling in a group led by a tour guide surely does have some benefits. We don't have to plan all our schedules, and we don't need to worry about not knowing something because the guide is there to explain everything. However, from all my journeys, the most memorable and lasting experiences were those when I traveled by myself. Starting from scheduling my itinerary, learning about the country, exploring new places, and meeting people from all walks of life is truly the valuable and real journey I will never forget."}
{"file_id": "1171026.txt", "output_essay": "I disagree with the statement. It may be true that a group tour is the most convenient way to travel because a tour guide knows a lot about the place, and there seems to be no wasted time thanks to the well-prepared plan. However, I think that traveling by ourselves is more enjoyable than a group tour, and there are three reasons that support my idea.\n\nFirst, by traveling individually, you can go anywhere at any time. For example, if you go to a tourist attraction in a group and you find the place attractive, you have to just pass through and cannot see the place well because of the time limit.\n\nNext, you can meet local people. If you are in a group tour, local people are not interested in them because you already have a lot of company, and the local people see you as one of them. However, if you go to the site alone, it draws local people's attention, and they might talk to you or at least be nice to you. Moreover, since they live there, they know where to go better than guides or guidebooks. In addition, you can learn about the traditions and cultures of the region, which the guidebooks do not tell you.\n\nFinally, you can be independent. Traveling alone is not always just fun. There are a lot of dangers around you. However, you can learn how to protect yourself when you are in danger. What you learn from the dangerous situation will be helpful for your later life."}
{"file_id": "1159884.txt", "output_essay": "The issue of whether young people these days give enough time to helping their communities or not is one that has been debated extensively over the last few years. I personally do not agree with the statement, as I feel that young people still play their part in helping their communities. The issue comes up again and again because people take the actions of these young people to heart without actually understanding the situations they face and seeing how things have changed for these young people over the years.\n\nFirst, I have always noticed that it takes a thousand good deeds to be appreciated and just one bad deed to be cursed. Very often, the actions of one person are taken as the trait of a group of people without actually knowing what these other individuals are like. A few bad examples have helped promote the idea that young people nowadays don't care.\n\nSecondly, a lot has changed in the life of young people. The world is a great deal more competitive today than it was ten years earlier. Everything from education to occupation demands much more. Time cannot be taken for granted anymore, and young people find themselves more and more time-bound every day. I don't think this aspect is completely understood. Yet, you see these young people doing the best they can to help their communities. A simple example of this is how, at the time of someone's death, everyone is there to lend a helping hand to the family which has suffered the loss, and at such occasions, if you try to think about it, it's usually the young people who run around to help all the time.\n\nMoreover, there are so many young people who have dedicated almost all their time to serve and help their communities. There are so many young people either involved with or running NGOs or organizations which deal with serious issues like education or providing ample food and shelter for their communities. These people have devoted all their time and energy for the betterment of their communities.\n\nIn the end, I would just like to say that there might never be a common agreement on this subject, but I firmly feel that young people are doing their part. I guess all we really need to do is open our eyes and see the bigger picture, and I have a feeling that the results, like me, might not support the statement either."}
{"file_id": "1166215.txt", "output_essay": "Traveling is sometimes for holidays and seeing new places, but sometimes it is for work. For the former, you can travel by yourself or with a group led by a tour guide. Sometimes you need the first one, sometimes the second one. I disagree with the statement, 'The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.' It changes according to your psychology or your destination, which can be abroad or within your country. I prefer to travel on my own because of several reasons.\n\nFirstly, when you travel with a group led by a tour guide, you must follow them throughout your journey. It does not sound good to me. It seems very restricted and boring. Before you travel to some places, sometimes you do some research about the place and you imagine something; also, you plan something. When you travel with a group, if a tour guide plans to see places where you planned to see, it is a problem. In addition to this, you can be bored with the place, but because of the group, you must stay there. So, it is not a good situation.\n\nSecondly, tour guides generally take you to historical places. Sometimes this is good, but for a person who is not interested in history or art, it is also a bad situation.\n\nIn conclusion, there are many reasons like these to prefer traveling on my own. A tour may not be as good as you expected. The hotel may not be clean or comfortable. Although there are some advantages to traveling with a group led by a tour guide, the disadvantages may outweigh them for some travelers."}

Although some people think that the use of cars will increase from what it is nowadays. Because they believe that the car is the most important thing and that it doesn't have side effects. But I think that there will be a decrease in the use of cars in the future for several reasons.\n\nFirst, nowadays, there is a problem that oil and gas are being depleted due to unplanned excavation. So, it leads to a lack of oil for transportation. It means that although we have a lot of cars, we cannot drive because there is no oil for transportation. Therefore, we need to find other substitutes for oil or alternative methods for movement. I think that finding alternative methods for movement is more important than finding more oil.\n\nSecond, the car causes air pollution. Actually, cars produce CO2 and NOx, which increase the Earth's temperature. As a result, the sea level is rising. Maybe our lands will be underwater. Imagine that condition where you don't have land to plant and to live on. Because of these problems, many people are studying to find other methods of transportation that do not pollute the air.\n\nThird, the car is inconvenient. It not only breaks down frequently but also can't cross other continents. Nowadays, we live in a global world. So, to increase the power of a nation, we should invent methods of transportation that can freely cross continents, like ships and planes, to trade easily.\n\nFor the above-mentioned reasons, there is no doubt in my mind that there will be fewer cars in use in the future. This is because they cause air pollution and gradually, the oil is being reduced."}
{"file_id": "1158307.txt", "output_essay": "Personally speaking, I don't think the best way to travel is in a group led by a guide. Firstly, travel is a course for relaxation and freedom for sightseeing. If we do everything on the trips as directed by someone, it just feels like working as usual. When I take trips by myself or with my friends, we can go wherever we want, we can eat whatever we like. We talk and laugh loudly, and we enjoy ourselves.\n\nSecondly, in the journey, the time we spend in the places we love depends on how much we like them. If we find some place beautiful, we can spend a good time there for longer. Once we feel tired during some part of a trip, we can stop and have a rest, we can have a drink in a cafe along the way, too. No one can stop you.\n\nThirdly, it is said that the tour guide may show you many things so you would learn more on the trip; however, in my opinion, it is not necessary for me to learn much by hearing what the guide says, also, it makes me tired. During the holiday, we should enjoy and learn things by trying and seeing for ourselves. We will discover more while we take a try at everything.\n\nThe best way to travel is to do it yourself or with a few good friends. It will give you an unforgettable time, and your friendship would deepen. I am not here to say the other choice is bad, but I think it's not as good as mine. You know, traveling in a group may make you tired. So, I don't think the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide. Enjoy yourself in your travels."}
{"file_id": "1174083.txt", "output_essay": "I am completely positive about the statement. Here, I would like to mention some reasons why group travel is the best way to travel. I work for a travel company as a tour guide, so I guess I can confirm the advantages of group traveling.\n\nFirst of all, tourists feel secure when they are traveling with plenty of people and their guide, who is a local resident of the site. People traveling in groups can defend themselves in difficult times and it is more likely to attract public attention when requesting help. In some places, it is suggested to tourists not to go out alone because of a high crime rate.\n\nThe second reason why I prefer group travel is the payment for the travel cost. Needless to say, it is noticeably cheaper than solo travel for certain countries. Even a number of tour companies offer special programs for group tourists, not only discounts but also free-of-charge trips for group leaders or a certain number of members. The third reason serves our company's main goal: 'More people, more fun.' It is much more interesting to travel with many different people in order to have a real vacation. Group tourists can attend different competitions, matches, and other attractive entertainment.\n\nTraveling is not only about moving from one place to another, but also about making friends and building relationships with them. It offers people more chances to make friends in an easier way. I know of many occasions where tourists get married after a long, exciting tour.\n\nIn conclusion, I have a strong point of view on traveling as a group. Tourists feel more secure, more respected, and guides feel more responsibility when they are traveling as a group."}
{"file_id": "1164179.txt", "output_essay": "This is a widely debated question, and I believe everyone you ask will give you a different answer regarding this aspect of the generation gap. However, there is a tendency to accuse the other group of enjoying life more than the one you belong to. Therefore, everyone's opinion, whether they are young or old, could be influenced by such bias. Thus, I am trying not to be swayed by this groupthink.\n\nI would say that the vast majority of our society enjoys their life, although older people might enjoy it more. Surely, one could argue that the young are lazy and only interested in partying. But I think this relates to their younger and more active bodies and minds. And I am convinced that the relatively short time young people spend partying cannot be compared to the long periods older people spend sitting around watching TV, playing poker, or spending their free time in women's gossip clubs.\n\nOf course, there are several older individuals who use their time efficiently by working, maintaining their front yards, or being active in sports clubs. There are also people who are ill and cannot do what they wish. But in summary, I want to make a statement about the average, normal, older person.\n\nYoung people are simply doing much more, in both enjoying and working, than older ones. I do not know any of my friends or classmates who think of life as only joy. They are all working hard and learning in schools, universities, or training for a trade to provide the best possible opportunities to get a job and earn money to support a family. Especially in today's times of mass unemployment, the younger generation must perform better to avoid being jobless. This was different in past decades when finding work was easier, and there was a shortage of factory workers. Today, workers must be well-prepared and qualified for their jobs.\n\nThe older generation is now enjoying the twilight of their lives in a financially secure situation. When today's young people become old, the situation will certainly have changed for the worse."}
{"file_id": "1174292.txt", "output_essay": "As we know, in this world, everyone wants freedom; no one wants to be a slave because they believe that they were born individuals. According to this statement, I do not agree with the following assertion. It is not necessary to travel in a group or be led by a tour guide. The main purpose of a tour guide is to lead the team and show the direction. In a group or with a tour guide, there are a lot of restrictions, like having to move only with the group. We can't move wherever we like. We have to follow all the instructions given by the group leader, even if we like the place or not, we have to stay with them. We can face lots of problems while traveling. If we are going in a group, we can't leave that place without permission. So nowadays, in our society, nobody wants restrictions; they want to move freely and enjoy anywhere. Take, for example, college students who are going on a five-day picnic with the permission of the college principal. The college principal suggests they go with a tour guide so that they won't face any problems in the future. But the students do not agree because they want to go without a guide or any faculty member. They want freedom because only then can they enjoy anywhere and use their time in a better way. Sometimes we need a tour guide, but not every time, and we also have to keep in mind that freedom must be there up to a certain limit; if it is excessive, it will not be good for the individual. In my opinion, the best way to travel is without any tour guide, but we have to manage all things in a right manner and in a systematic way."}
{"file_id": "1167264.txt", "output_essay": "I disagree with the saying that understanding ideas and concepts is more important for a student than it is to learn facts. Ideas give the student an insight into what and how a task has to be done. Concepts are studied from earlier editions of books and, generally speaking, from an abstract on what is already done. A concept also means the basic idea of what is to be done. It is the general background of any subject considered. Of course, without a concept, nothing is done properly; for example, when choosing a major. A student does not catch up with the course if he has no idea about the concept or the basics of the course.\n\nFacts are a very lively word to listen to. A fact explains what is true, true and only true. Facts are the things to be considered in every particular task. According to me, learning facts always puts us in the place where we have to be. Learning facts is akin to behavior, personal experience, something done. For example, consider giving a test which is really new to a student. He has to give many practice tests in order to face the experience when on the real test. If the student just goes to the test with all ideas and a fully known concept, it would not be as good a result as it would be when he takes practice tests before.\n\nAnother example is starting a new business. A man planning to start a new business has to learn the ideas, the concept of marketing, and as well the experience. He has to observe some businessmen, how they work with the daily shares. Having an idea and the basic knowledge about the business does not just click into the market. There would be less profit in the work done without learning facts.\n\nSo, these observations conclude that half knowledge is always dangerous. Thus, I disagree with the saying that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts."}
{"file_id": "1164862.txt", "output_essay": "Facts can be researched by students in order to improve their knowledge about an idea. There are several ways to support the statement that understanding ideas and concepts is more important than acquiring knowledge of facts. Science requires students to think constantly and develop a critical way of thinking. For example, for a lawyer, it is more important to learn how to think logically than to learn a set of laws in order to be successful in his career. A set of laws can change within one period of Congress; this will leave the lawyer who just learned a set of laws obsolete. He will need to go to university to learn again the set of laws to be useful in his field. Fortunately, this is not the way that lawyers learn about their career; most of the knowledge acquired at a law school is about thinking logically. Even with a change of legislation, a lawyer is still a lawyer. However, there is always the requirement to be updated with technology and new research to be successful in any given career. For a historian, there is no discussion that it is required to learn facts. The same concept does not apply to a doctor.\n\nThere is always the necessity to improve processes to evolve with society. This is the reason that universities develop research departments. If society does not conduct research, there will be no progress in many industries. In order to achieve progress, students conduct research to understand ideas and concepts. If their knowledge is based just on facts, they would not be able to discover new theories. For example, consider all the improvements in telecommunications. Thanks to the understanding of ideas and concepts, students have improved internet telephony, making it cheaper to call long distance.\n\nFinally, it would be impossible for society to progress if we just waste time learning facts. Like in a picture, society would be static with no improvement, like the Mennonites who prefer to live in the past, ignoring the new opportunities that ideas bring."}
{"file_id": "1165367.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. Due to advancements in technology and financial markets, access to money has become easy. Because of the excess liquidity in current economies around the world, many companies are expanding their businesses. There are numerous companies producing the same kind of products. They themselves know that it is extremely difficult to produce something different every now and then. However, they have all realized one way of selling the same products in different packaging to customers: advertisements! Now, technically, they know that they can't differentiate their own product from others available in the market. Let's take the example of a car advertisement. It's an entry-level car, the Hyundai Santro. They have Mr. Shahrukh Khan, a popular film star, as their brand ambassador for India. In their advertisement, it's shown that Mr. Shahrukh goes for a long drive with his girlfriend, who is again a big film star. Everyone in the world knows that Mr. Shahrukh sends a BMW to pick up his kids from school and drove the Santro in the advertisement for the first and last time in his life. But people are fascinated by this and buy cars, believing that if he uses it, it has to be a good car. Having one myself, I know it is a good car, but not because of the advertisement. They show that if you use this car, then you may get good-looking girlfriends, but actually, it has nothing to do with the car. I think it is appropriate to discuss an example of a Bournvita advertisement. It is a drink for growing children. They claim in advertisements that if children drink this, they will grow faster and healthier. If that were the case, then the producer should be the richest person on planet Earth. I agree with their claims regarding the content of the drink mix, calorie content, and presence of proteins, etc., but I can't believe this increase in height part. Let's take another example of a telecom service provider. In its advertisement, they claim that they provide hassle-free and customer-oriented service at their outlets. I fell into the trap and took the connection. The first time I went to the outlet with a complaint, I was left to wait for half an hour. Eventually, after having a verbal argument, I took a pledge not to believe in advertisements. I believe that to survive in this cutthroat world, companies will always invent ways to sell their products. Advertising is one of them. Whatever you see on TV, you should not believe it, as nothing in this world is as simple as it appears."}
{"file_id": "1172884.txt", "output_essay": "This essay is about products and advertisement. Do most advertisements make products seem better than they really are?\n\nFirst of all, we should think about advertisement and its goals. Nowadays, advertisements are used very commonly to support the selling process of a product. There are advertisements on TV, in newspapers, etc. Advertisement is a special part of marketing and it gives the possibility to show a new product to potential customers. Its main goal is to attract new customers for a particular product. The customer should think positively about this product and buy it.\n\nAs I mentioned before, the customer should have a positive impression of the product. To reach that goal, the advertisement will, of course, just show the strengths of this particular product.\n\nHowever, some advertisements may not really show the truth of the strengths and weaknesses of a product. I think that these advertisements are a few negative cases.\n\nAnother point is that the people from the marketing agencies, who design the advertisements, cannot tell lies about the product. People would recognize that lie just after they bought the product, and they would never buy a product from that company again.\n\nCompanies want to satisfy customers, and that wouldn't happen if they showed advertisements that are not true.\n\nAs I mentioned before, I think that advertisements show the best part of a product without showing the negative parts. However, I don't think that advertisements make products generally better than they really are."}
{"file_id": "1167709.txt", "output_essay": "The society we live in is based on consumption. I agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. On the contrary, nobody would buy these products.\n\nI think that nowadays, people really need to be sure of what they buy. They want to make sure that they buy the best product. So, the only way to ensure them is to create the advertisement they want to see, even if it is not true. This is the case, for example, for the solutions which claim to make you lose weight in only two weeks. Most women know it is not true, but as the advertisement shows fake benefits of the solution, women want to try it, and so, they buy the product. Women finally notice that the product does not work.\n\nIt is also the case for children. They often see toys they have ever dreamed of on television. The advertisement makes them believe that with this toy they will be the strongest, or they will be the best. As children are still ignorant of the principles of this consumption society, they believe what they see and they want to buy the toy. But once they have got it, they become aware of the truth and see that their toy will never give them what they were told.\n\nSo I think that, indeed, most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. It is one of the most important rules of the consumption society. Products have to always seem better than what they really are. People only buy what they think to be the best for them.\n\nAll advertisements have to lie because if they do not, the advertisement for another product would, and so, the truthful advertisement will not be successful. It seems that there is a tendency nowadays; people prefer to be told lies to feel more confident than being aware of the truth. That is why I think that only the advertisements which make products look better than they really are more successful."}
{"file_id": "1168591.txt", "output_essay": "I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. If one were to analyze the traits of successful people in the areas of business, entertainment, sports, or even politics, the one common trait to emerge would be their ability to take intelligent and thoughtful risks and keep pushing the boundaries of their area of expertise. Human beings are loath to change and do not like to get out of their 'comfort zone.' The average person would rather continue to do what they know very well because of the overall disruptive nature of 'change.' Trying new things is generally viewed as too risky to compromise a steady state of existence and established livelihood. But over time, it becomes necessary to change, adapt, and try new things because there are always others who would be willing to do the same thing in a better, more efficient way or for a lower price. The only way to combat becoming redundant and remain successful is to embrace change, experiment with new things, and take calculated risks. As an example, if you look at the traditional telephone companies or the media business, they have not changed in their behavior or in their business processes in the past century. The business owners believed in their own perpetual existence and were continuing to do what they had been doing all along. But, with the advent of new technology and the internet, their world has been rudely shaken. The number of adults who read a newspaper has been steadily falling. Most new telephone connections are now of the 'wireless' variety. Unless these traditional companies shake up their business and take a few risks on their own, they are doomed. In fact, the cycle of change and innovation has significantly accelerated over the past few years. Even the internet companies and wireless telephone companies have to constantly reinvent their business and continually try out new things to stay relevant in today's world. The concept of trying new things and taking risks is also important from an overall 'evolution' standpoint. Imagine if Bill Gates or Michael Dell had not continued to experiment in their garages, or had given up on their dreams and ideas, we would still have been using the abacus for adding numbers. All successful businesses and ideas are based on the bedrock of 'new ideas' and 'new concepts,' and it takes brave, committed, and passionate individuals to keep taking such risks and expanding the boundaries of knowledge. While the rewards for taking risks are typically huge, the rewards are not quite obvious until such time a risk is taken. In conclusion, the appetite for risk and trying new things are the defining traits for successful individuals in this world."}
{"file_id": "1163243.txt", "output_essay": "Does success come to you, or do you go to success? Is doing only what you are used to sufficient to take it to another level? The key to success often involves a certain risk.\n\nObserving successful people, you often find a pattern: those individuals are open to new ideas, willing to explore new paths, and continuously broaden their vision. They are not shy about taking risks, thus helping progress to be made.\n\nIf one only did what he has been doing for years, his vision would narrow, and his success would be limited. Many people succeed not by doing the same thing year in, year out, but by breaking out of their usual work patterns. Certainly, this very step involves a lot of risk. If you fail, you might lose your job. If you invest a lot of money, it might be lost. If you are working with hazardous materials, you might risk your health or even your life. But technical progress would hardly have been made if it were not for people who risked their lives to find ways to improve airplanes, cars, or machinery.\n\nIf no one had dared to award Larry Page and Sergey Brin with two million dollars in 1998, Google would not have revolutionized the internet. Now, it has paid off a millionfold.\n\nRisks must be taken, and people need to be open to new ideas to develop them further, to try them out, and to eventually decide whether they are worth it or not in order to gain a competitive advantage over their rivals.\n\nNothing is secure, and nothing is to be gained if we just stick with what we know, and only in very rare cases does success and development come to us. In most cases, we have to work hard for it, never knowing whether it will pay off.\n\nOne of the best examples might be stockbroking. Is the most successful broker the one who always goes for the safe bets? Generally, the highest revenues are made by investing in riskier stocks. And only those who are open to taking the risk will succeed long-term in this market.\n\nBeing open to new things and daring to take risks will bring you further than just sticking with the normal daily routine."}
{"file_id": "1170027.txt", "output_essay": "I think success can be achieved in different ways, not only by taking risks and chances. In the coming paragraphs, different points will be stated and discussed in order to properly analyze the statement given.\n\nFirst of all, success can be a relative term, because for some it may mean owning a private jet and having millions of dollars, but for others, success could simply be having a good, small business that maintains their family and gives them a decent life. Not everybody wants the same things; some just want to live a quiet, normal life and nothing more. Taking a risk is a possibility, but never a sure thing.\n\nAlso, it's difficult to achieve success in life, since it requires many abilities from a person. There are many key ingredients involved in the process of maybe achieving success. It takes hard work, dedication, being fully prepared, and intelligence. Usually, people don't achieve success by accident. It takes years and years, and sometimes that is not enough. Just because a person has all those ingredients doesn't guarantee them a bright future full of riches. Most people have worked hard all their life but haven't gotten anywhere they want to go.\n\nAnother important point is the fact that success can be achieved by doing what a person already knows how to do well. Sometimes it's as simple as that. To work hard at your craft and make smart moves can equally take you towards success. For example, if a person studies economics and ends up working at the NYSE, he can achieve a fortune by just putting to work all those years of studying he did in college or university. By just applying his knowledge to the stock market and making smart choices, he can become rich, but he can also lose it all. It's not so much about risk but about making smart choices.\n\nIn conclusion, I would like to be clear that while many people have taken risks and tried new things in order to achieve success, where some have won, many more have failed. Success is never a sure thing, and even if a person achieves it, the possibility still exists that it won't last for long.

There are several reasons why I think so.\n\nThe first is that the costs to drive and possess a car will be much higher than today. This is because the price of oil will get higher. You can already see this, as in the last few years the price for oil has exploded. Additionally, the taxes for cars will rise because the government cares about the environment and needs money. Therefore, not every person will have the money to use a car.\n\nAnother reason why there will be fewer cars is that there will be a lot of other options to travel from point A to point B in the future. For example, a Transrapid will be built in Munich in the next few years. So many people would not use a car if they have the possibility to go by the Transrapid. And today, many people are researching new ways of transporting people that are not as harmful to the environment as cars.\n\nA third reason is that more and more people are moving into big cities to get a job. Consequently, there will be more people in the larger cities of the country. And in big cities, you normally don't need a car. I think so because with a car you need longer than if you use other possibilities due to the many traffic jams in bigger cities. For example, a friend of mine studies in Munich and he needs one hour to get from his home to the university by car. With a bike or the subway, he only needs half an hour. So I think many people will then use a bike or go by subway.\n\nIn conclusion, you can say that there are a lot of good reasons why in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than today."}

In the following, I will first discuss young people, like teenagers, and then older individuals before coming to a reasonable conclusion.\n\nYoung people quite enjoy their lives since they are very active and energetic. They have the power to party and have fun most of the time. The main factor, I would say, that allows them to enjoy life more than older ones is because they do not have as many responsibilities and worries in life as older people do. They are helped financially and mentally by their parents, so they do not have to work or suffer in any kind of dispute like this. Another reason they enjoy life more is that they probably have so many things to try out and so many places to visit. Since everything is better when you try it for the first time, they have a big advantage there.\n\nOlder people, though, also have a lot of reasons to enjoy life to the fullest. If you have been a nice and fun person throughout your life, it could mean that you have more friends than younger people since you have more experience in friendships than they do.\n\nWhen you are an adult, you have a lot more freedom than younger people. So, you can do things that they cannot do, for example, small incidents like going on vacation without anyone's permission or making a decision that can affect your whole lifestyle.\n\nIn my opinion, I agree with the statement because, even though young people are more limited in doing things, it is much more fun and exciting. And you do not have to worry about as many things like your future, your job, or your financial status."}
{"file_id": "1176184.txt", "output_essay": "Taking risks and trying new things have one thing in common: they are scary, or at least, they are not as comfortable as always doing the same things. Yet, I am convinced that they are necessary in order to be successful.\n\nRisking can be frightening—I will not deny it. However, if you do not risk, you miss important opportunities to improve your condition. Every decision in life, from everyday to once-in-a-lifetime ones, implies some risk. If you are not able to take risks, this means that you are not able to make challenging decisions, with the obvious results.\n\nFurthermore, in certain situations, taking a risk can make the difference between someone who just accepts what he or she has (but might regret what he or she has not) and someone who is really satisfied. Just think of a recently graduated student who receives a very interesting offer that requires moving to another country: should he stay home and try to find an average job, or accept it? I am convinced he should accept it and leave straight away; otherwise, he might simply regret it for the rest of his life.\n\nOn a less personal level, there are contexts where trying new things is almost mandatory. This is the case, for example, with researchers: questioning the status quo, trying out different possible solutions is necessary in order to discover new things—and where would the world be without new inventions? I cannot imagine a researcher who does not want to try new things.\n\nFor all these reasons, I am convinced that successful people are those who are not afraid of risking. People who just keep doing what they are good at just miss out on opportunities—because that is what a change really is."}
{"file_id": "1172944.txt", "output_essay": "Responsibility plays a big role in our lives, specifically for older people. When a young child is having fun, he doesn't care about money, home, and issues that happen to any person. Young people think that they still have good health, but when they get older, their health will start to decline. I agree with young people who want to have fun more than older people for a couple of reasons.\n\nFirst of all, responsibility, as I mentioned in the beginning, makes any person think about how to make his life more secure and never think about how to enjoy life except after finishing everything he wanted to do. For example, in any family, the father always thinks about how to earn money for his children, the mother looks after the children and tries to help her husband financially. If we look at the children, we can notice that they want to play every day and have fun without thinking about anything. That was a good example of showing the difference in how young and old people act.\n\nThe second reason is that old people always start to take care of their health, which absolutely declines as they get older. On the other hand, young people think about no responsibility and no problems with their health, so why don't they enjoy their lives before anything happens in the future? For example, if someone who is 60 years old and is retired from his job, he could have health problems that prevent him from enjoying his life. Another man, who is 20 years old, has just finished his high school and wants to play sports and go out with his friends without any health problems, that is if we ignore the exceptions like handicaps.\n\nFinally, I agree with young people to have fun with their life before they get older because they will have more responsibilities than before. Also, nobody knows about his health and how good it's going to be. I hope everyone enjoys his life whether he is older or young."}

Thus, I disagree with this topic for the following three reasons.\n\nFirstly, I do not agree with this topic because cars will pollute the environment less in twenty years. Technology is becoming more and more advanced. In the future, we will not use gas or petroleum to drive cars. We will use electricity to replace gas and petroleum. Thus, the air will become fresher, and the greenhouse effect will decline as well. This will lead environmental groups to support people driving.\n\nSecondly, I do not agree with this topic because when you drive a car, you can feel calm, safe, and warm. You can drive anywhere with your family, wherever they wish to go. You can have your own space that public transportation cannot give you. You can also avoid being bothered by other people on the way to your destination. This reason is really important to those who have families or children.\n\nThirdly, I do not agree with this topic because you can show the status you have. For instance, you can drive a Benz to buy fruits or vegetables, and that will let everyone know that you are wealthy. Also, when you meet your old friends, which means you have been invited by old friends, you can let them know that you are not the same person as before! I know this sounds arrogant, but it is practically true.\n\nTo sum up, many people might advocate a different opinion.

We would probably be prehistoric; if no writing, no paper, no wheel, no medicine had ever existed, we would probably be extinct by now.\n\nThe prehistoric man didn't talk or have clothes, but in order to live, he started wearing the fur of the animals he hunted. Now, humans can survive the cold.\n\nAll that we are and have today is possible because of the foundation that was laid before us. If we hadn't taken the risks that our ancestors took every day, we wouldn't be here.\n\nAnd the world is going to keep changing, and we need to keep changing too, trying new things, taking risks. It's your option to change or not, but if you decide not to take a risk or not to try something new, my friend, you will be left behind and with time, cease.\n\nIn the times we live in nowadays, everybody has to try new things and take new risks, learn new things. It is really easy to become obsolete in this world. Even choosing your career, let's say, Doctor in surgery. You just finished university and after a couple of years, they discovered a new anesthesia that is better for the human body, but you don't know how to use it and you don't want to take the chance of learning something new, an improvement to your career. With time, this anesthesia becomes the only one available. What have you become? You have become obsolete because you refused to change. Now it's not a change anymore; it's what people are doing and they already know how to do it well, but not you.\n\nChange and taking new risks are inherent in our nature.

{"file_id": "1172794.txt", "output_essay": "The students' teaching method is very controversial between the approach focused on the facts and the other more based on concepts and ideas. I agree with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts for three main reasons: understanding ideas can help the student to understand facts, it is easier to learn facts individually, and understanding ideas allows the student to develop their own reflection and criticism.\n\nFirstly, it seems to me that when a student understands ideas and concepts, it will help them to understand the facts. Indeed, it would not be very interesting for a student to learn a succession of facts without knowing why these facts are happening. For example, historical facts are numerous, and it is impossible to keep all of them, but if you understand the ideas of a special historical event, you can learn better all the facts that are associated with this event.\n\nSecondly, I think that it is easier to learn facts individually than to understand ideas and concepts. As a matter of fact, the professor can give their students keys that will help them to understand the idea. On the contrary, the facts are not difficult to understand, and also the support of the professor is not indispensable. The professor can illustrate the facts with personal experiences and therefore make them more interesting, but he will not change the facts.\n\nFinally, I believe that the understanding of ideas and concepts for a student is the basis for the development of their own reflections and also to have criticism. By identifying the structure of a concept or an idea, the student can develop their own ideas and build also a thinking system. For instance, a student that understands well a special philosophy concept can develop their own theory about the concept.\n\nTo conclude, I can say that the understanding of ideas and concepts is the most important part of a student's learning process, even if it is not unnecessary to learn facts, but not as the first priority."}

There is a large variety of products available in the market today. Similar products are manufactured by many companies. Hence, customers today have a variety of choices.\n\nThe differences in these similar products may be very minute. Advertising helps in exaggerating these differences. Take cars, for example. One car manufacturer may exaggerate the spaciousness of the car by comparing it to a lounge ambiance in its advertisement. Another manufacturer in the same category may emphasize the outer design of the car, comparing it with the aerodynamics of a spaceship. Thus, both manufacturers have a selling point to be emphasized.\n\nBut as the saying goes, looks can be deceiving because all that glitters is not gold. There are so many instances in which the customer is fooled into buying a product because of the glamour created around it through advertising. These instances are coming to light almost every day. There are many letters in the 'Letters to the Editor' columns of newspapers that highlight this point. Let us consider a simple example of buying an apartment. One of my close friends wanted to buy a new apartment. He collected many brochures and visited many incomplete construction sites. He decided to finalize on the basis of brochure comparison. The brochure of the apartment he zeroed in on spoke about spacious rooms, facilities like a gym, sauna, play park, and many more amenities. After actually shifting to the apartment, he was surprised to see big spacious rooms accompanied by a lot of plumbing problems, no gym, the sauna without water in the pipes, and so on. But if the advertisement hoardings were to be followed, this was a dream apartment. This is a common case for a large variety of products.\n\nFrom the advertising point of view, advertisers are paid to make the products look good, even if they aren't. Take the example of a popular razor that shows leading sports personalities using it. This razor actually caused skin problems for a customer, according to a newspaper. But the company that made this ad made a profit and successfully helped in selling the product.\n\nThere are many more instances which help in supporting the statement that advertisements do make products look much better than they actually are, and I completely agree with this notion."}

Our personal goals focus on ourselves, whereas other generations' goals focused on the community. There may be many reasons why this change has come upon us; however, I guess the most important one is related to our new lifestyle. Our way of life pushes us to worry about personal things rather than global ones. We care about our personal image, our personal grants, and our personal skills. We have to. However, we must try to change, and we ought to realize what is happening outside, and in fact, we should lend a helping hand. Anyway, I think young people are not to blame for this kind of selfishness, but they are unaware.\n\nFirst of all, we have acquired a new way of life. We live comfortably. Our parents usually provide us with everything we need. Everywhere it seems as if nobody needs anything from us as long as our community is rich and everyone can reach a good position as long as they work. Thus, our goal is not related to our community in which everything runs 'perfectly well,' but it is focused on ourselves. Our own complaints and artificial needs are highlighted. We have to be perfect, not just good, but perfect. We have to worry about such things in order to survive in this 'ideal community.'\n\nInasmuch as we are so worried about ourselves, we are not able to see the problems our community has; we are not aware of them.\n\nRegarding this lack of awareness, we can explain why we do not help, but we cannot avoid trying to make people realize their selfishness.

Students are required to do a certain number of hours whether they like it or not. By doing community service, students help their communities and make time for them because they need to complete their community service requirement in order to pass the grade. Some schools will also give out honors to those who work beyond the requirement. We students will work harder and contribute more hours to the communities to gain those honors.

But I think this will take a lot of time and space, in terms of words to be written. However, I think that the statement reported in the left frame of this window should be validated, as no generalization can be made about something since what we state is just referred to our personal experience. Starting from this fundamental point that structures my idea on such a topic, I can clearly say that I do not completely agree with what is stated. As a matter of fact, there are young people who give enough time—sometimes, too much time—for helping the community, and there are, on the contrary, young people who do not want to be involved in this matter. I think that nowadays the importance given to a generic 'job' (not the one we referred to as the 'money-bringer' process, but the one of something a person can do for one reason or another) depends on the social, cultural, and political environment in which that job is performed. As a matter of fact, I think that it is true that young people have different aims in their life, but it is also true that in one way or another those people could be helping the community even if they don't know they are. What I am stressing is the idea that no one can say with certainty that a generic person P is contributing positively to the community instead of person Q who is not. I think that this has to be assessed from situation to situation and no generalization can be applied, in any case. However, I can see, from my personal experience within my family, that the thing which years ago guided young people to help the community, for example by assisting elderly people or people with some disease, etc., is no longer present nowadays: I refer to a mindset, i.e., SPIRITUAL SUPPORT, THINKING OF OTHERS (in Italian we call it ALTRUISMO)... but nowadays we look at CONVENIENCE, mainly (I underline again, NOT ALWAYS). Convenience is probably the main disease oppressing humanity because convenience makes us do something just for the 'do ut des' criterion, but this is not always the right thing to do. This can be found in every field: at work, at school, in sports (I live in Italy...). In conclusion, I can remark on what I just read in these few lines: no matter what you work for or where you work, no matter what people say to you and what people think about you (in a rational way, obviously), just do what you have been doing for so long, and you will help your community as much as you can..."}

In my opinion, you can understand a fact without knowing ideas and concepts about it, but you can't understand ideas if there are no facts and practical examples that support the idea!\n\nIt is difficult to understand ideas because they are made by other people with concepts and ways of thinking different from yours. And also, people have different ideas on different arguments, so it is not possible to explain or to describe something in one way or in one idea; everyone can have various and different ideas.\n\nIdeas can often be manipulated by people who want their idea to be dominant. A fact, to the contrary, can't be changed; it is the same for everybody, and its evidence proves that it cannot be changed.\n\nA fact can also be funny, scary, interesting... It can give an emotional impression which is easier to remember than an idea. If students learn facts, they can make connections between those facts and ideas and concepts that they already have. In my way of thinking, for example, learning facts is very important while one is studying history: when children learn history about Nazism and the Holocaust, they can't understand the meaning of these words if they don't know what happened, so, they can't understand if they don't know the facts!\n\nThis could happen also in other subjects like biology: concepts and ideas are made only after a fact has been observed!

Moreover, he'll be well acquainted with his native country and tell us additional things that sometimes aren't revealed in books, and we can ask him all the questions we would like to ask. Whereas by using a book, we don't get really satisfied with the results, and it doesn't provide that huge amount of information given by a guide.

That is why successful people like to take risks; they know they can seize the opportunity and exploit it to the maximum. That's how they move ahead, and with risk, there is always a finish line—the goal. So when successful people see that goal in their lives, they focus on it and do not look back or to the sides; they keep their minds on what they want, and that is why they achieve success.\n\nNowadays, successful people take risks, try new things, and seize opportunities—opportunities that require them to try new things, opportunities through which they will gain experience. They do not only do what they do best; instead, they are in search of new skills they don't even know they have.\n\nFor example, take Bill Gates. He was a man who one day woke up and decided to take a risk, seize a new opportunity, try something new—something no one had thought about. Maybe in those days when Microsoft didn't exist, people thought Bill Gates was crazy, but they didn't know what that decision would make him what he is today. Bill Gates is successful nowadays because he took an opportunity that nobody else wanted to grab.\n\nI agree with the statement 'Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well' because we have to go out into the world and explore new things to see if we are good at other things. There are many people who have become successful just by taking risks, so that means we can do it too.

Those who agree that travel should be led by a tour guide may think it will save more time, be much cheaper, and more efficient. Others think traveling by themselves may be a better choice; they believe they can travel according to their own plan and do whatever they want. By comparing the pros and cons, I think the former is better and more instrumental to be led by a tour guide. I will explain it and give some concrete examples.\n\nFirstly, being led by a tour guide will save much more time. Let us imagine we walk in a fabulous city, we appreciate the amazing views, the lake is so beautiful, the weather is so nice, and we just walk and walk without stopping, finally, we cannot even move a foot. After a whole day of walking, we have only seen the natural view of the city. The city is big, and we are small; it is impossible for us to reach every corner of the city. We do not know which place is famous, which way is a shortcut, or which bus we should take. However, if we have a tour guide, everything becomes easy. The tour guide will lead us to interesting places, some famous, but more importantly, some others we would never have the chance to know or find on our own. The guide will also tell us how to get there and which bus we should take. Isn't it a great feeling that you do not need to think about anything but just have fun?\n\nSecondly, it will save more money. Tour guides always have some discounts from the majority of hotels and suites; they can easily book a room at a lower price. They can give us many coupons when we buy something.\n\nThirdly, it is considered more efficient. We can visit many more places than if we were without a guide. When we arrive at the airport, there is a bus just outside waiting for us; when we go to a restaurant, the meal is ready for us; when we need to leave, someone is there to tell us.\n\nLast but not least, we can share our experiences with other group members, and we can easily find someone to take a picture for us. In conclusion, to travel in a group led by a tour guide can save more time, save more money, and help you arrange things more efficiently."}

Like this, many products appear better in the advertisement than in reality. So, I agree that most advertisements make products look better than they really are. The effect of this phenomenon is negative. The products are not as good as shown in the advertisements, and it sometimes leads to a waste of money.\n\nFirst, the product that you saw on TV or the Internet and bought because it seemed really good is not that good. For instance, one of my friends bought an MP3 player that was advertised on TV. In the advertisement, the MP3 player looked cool and its sound system seemed very good. But when he received it, the product's shape was not as cool as shown on TV, and the sound system wasn't really good at all. So, he really regretted buying it.\n\nSecondly, since you buy products that looked good on TV without checking their information, it's a waste of money. Often, when you turn the TV on, a lot of advertisements for movies are shown. They make the movie look really good. So, when you go to see that movie, you might be disappointed. One day, I saw 'National Treasure' advertised on TV, which looked really exciting. So, I went to see that movie with my friends. It was really boring, and I even fell asleep for a moment. The advertisement was exciting with all the action it showed, but in the actual movie, there were few action scenes, and the story was unacceptable to me.\n\nI think not all advertisements make the products look better than they are in reality, but most of them do. And I believe that advertisements should represent the products as they are in reality."}
{"file_id": "1175383.txt", "output_essay": "There are heated discussions about whether young people enjoy life more than older people do. Some people support this by claiming that young people have more friends than older people. They are full of energy, and so on. However, some argue against this, saying that older people have more children to share happiness and sadness with, and also that older people have a lot of activities to take part in. As far as I am concerned, both young people and old people enjoy life.\n\nAs we know, young people in school have a lot of time. They can play with their peers, talk with them, and study with them. School offers a wonderful stage for the young to enjoy their life. In addition, when young people have some problems, a lot of people could lend them a hand, such as their parents, teachers, partners, bosses, and so on. With their help, they can solve the problems more productively. Young people can surely benefit from that; they also can enjoy life better. Finally, young people have more energy to enjoy their life. They can do whatever they want to do; they can experience a lot of new things that older people have never seen, such as computers, video games, MSN, ICQ, and so on.\n\nOn the other hand, older people also enjoy their life. With the developments of science and technology, the conditions of people's living environment become better and better. Older people can live longer than before. They become more energetic and healthier than before. What's more, older people can enjoy the wonderful time with their children, their grandchildren who can bring a lot of interesting and funny things to their parents or grandparents. Also, as the community's living conditions improve, older people can take part in lots of activities. They can sing with other older people, they can dance, and do whatever they want to do.\n\nSweeping generalizations are impossible here. In a word, I think both young and old are enjoying their life better and better."}
{"file_id": "1168162.txt", "output_essay": "America is considered a great country because it offers opportunities to common people to gain a better life by trying something new, like pursuing a new business or realizing an extravagant idea. This example underlines the great importance in our culture of conquering something new and taking the correlated risks.\n\nIf we were born just to live the same life, do the same job, and have the same experiences as the people who lived before us, probably humanity would still be living in caves. The evolution of human beings is strictly related to what some people discovered when they tried to go down new paths. Think about Christopher Columbus, for example; if he hadn't navigated his fleet through the ocean, putting his life in danger, the Americas might not have been discovered.\n\nOf course, taking risks is the other side of the same coin. It's very rare to try new things without any costs, even the implicit ones like losing credibility or the social status maintained until that moment. For instance, in the past, many people died trying to develop aircraft. But with their persistence, we can now fly from one continent to another in just a few hours, and those who succeeded will always be remembered as pioneers and founders of our contemporary world.\n\nFor me, the real issue is always to understand the trade-off between the advantages that new things or discoveries can bring and the risks related to them or to the path to discover them. Truly successful men always analyze this relationship because otherwise, the results could be catastrophic, maybe not at the beginning but in the future. Quick success without any solid analysis behind it is to be avoided as much as the fear of pursuing your inspirations or new ideas."}
{"file_id": "1172599.txt", "output_essay": "Within the following essay, I discuss whether people trying new things and taking more risks are more successful than those using well-established practices.\n\nTo begin with, I provide a principal definition of success, because it is a matter of perspective whether someone is successful or not.\nSecondly, I highlight several arguments on the topic before concluding with my own opinion on it.\n\nSuccess is normally a well-constructed and established value within a society.\nEvery value typically consists of an imagination of distinctive goals.\nHowever, success itself is not adequate to a constructed goal but needs to be constructed by each community of people.\nIn Western countries, which share the same principles of economy and society, success can be defined as earning a lot of money, having a family, or simply being happy, whatever that may entail.\nNow, my perspective focuses on the economic aspect by earning a lot of money, and therefore I define success by it.\n\nBy examining the economic facet of success, I need to differentiate between new products and well-established products.\nNew products are normally accompanied by a greater amount of risks and also by a larger scale of innovativeness than established products.\nThe example of franchising, discussed earlier in this TOEFL, fits quite well.\nIt is relatively easy to buy the rights of a huge company like Burger King and to produce its products, but it also highlights the limitations of one's own freedom to establish something new.\nWhile starting one's own business is relatively costly and is followed by the uncertainty of product acceptance, it allows some room for creativity and personality.\nAdditionally, new innovative products could be sold at a higher price.\n\nNevertheless, it cannot be denied that you can earn money with both possibilities.\nPerhaps it's not really a question of success in this case, but of making it in a special way.\n\nFor my conclusion, I emphasize the hope of everyone to achieve success that leads people to start something new and innovative against all odds.\nThis hope might be imaginative but leads researchers to new inventions and ultimately humanity to progress.\nSo, it would be necessary for humanity but not for economic success in the short term.\nBy using well-established practices, you can succeed too, and in the case of new products, you need an established name to sell products better.\n\nTherefore, it's the mixture of both, risk and new ways as well as well-established methods, that leads to overall success, for individuals, enterprises, and humanity."}
{"file_id": "1169848.txt", "output_essay": "I would have to agree with the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.\n\nAs more and more cars are rapidly produced today, the government has been doing its best to provide necessary public transportation throughout the nation. The space allocated for vehicles will soon not be enough. Population growth directly contributes to the increase in the number of drivers on the road. Highways hundreds of meters tall will still be fully congested with drivers. With limited space or land throughout a country, any government would surely take steps to reduce the number of cars on the road, which could also cause pollution.\n\nAs does the government here in Malaysia, they are trying their best to reduce the number of cars on the road. One move made by the Malaysian government to reduce the number of cars is by imposing taxes. By imposing a heavy percentage of taxes on imported as well as local cars, it was believed to be an incentive for drivers to find alternative modes of transport. But this has obviously proved less effective. This automatically brought them to reducing the number of drivers instead. For example, an action taken by the government is by setting an older age limit for wannabe drivers to be competent on the road.\n\nThis delay of upcoming drivers is also supported by another wise move, which, like any other country, is by improving the country's public transportation. Public transportation is the one and only solution that can help curb future congestion on the road. Take, for example, the train. Easy accessibility, low and flat-priced tickets, and large-sized public transportation are the perfect characteristics of a highly effective mode of transport which many governments are vying to achieve. The most obvious example of highly effective public transport is none other than the bullet train located in Japan. Another example is the country, Australia, that I have visited. The sight of seeing only a small number of cars on the roads of Australia has clearly shown to me, as a Malaysian, what my country should aspire to be like. If in Australia, every now and then you can only hear a honk or the screeches of the tires, I'm sure in twenty years down the road, the roadway will be an empty one!\n\nThanks,\nSign"}

I don't think this is a good idea because students might share test answers, cause drama, or text friends at other schools.\n\nIf students share test answers, they might be wrong, and others will copy them. The teacher might have changed the test for each class period. Students will get angry at the person who gave them the answers. For example, my sister's friend got in trouble for cheating on a math quiz. She told me, 'Don't let someone bring you down; it's a big deal.'\n\nStudents might cause drama over small things. They might get their phones stolen and blame someone else. They might fight over a phone that looks better than theirs. My friend got in trouble over a phone once and said, 'I'll never use my phone at school again.'\n\nStudents who text friends at other schools might get in trouble because not all schools have the same rules. They'll get angry at the person who made a mistake. People need to focus on class and worry about school. School is only 9 hours a day, and you can text the rest of the time. I used to get in trouble a lot, but my mom told me, 'You have all day to text; get your grades up.'\n\nIn conclusion, the principal is thinking about changing the cell phone rule. She wants to let students use phones during lunch and free time, but I think it's a bad idea because of all the problems it could cause. Now, I need to listen to my teacher and do well on my test."}

I think that's a better idea than letting students bring phones to school and use them during lunch and free time. I think that because it can hurt students' learning. For example, a student was texting another student about something that happened at a different school. She didn't tell her everything because she had to go to class. Today was an important lesson, but the student didn't pay attention because she wanted to know what happened next. She didn't pay attention, and when she took a test, she failed. The other student was in class when she was texting. She didn't pay attention because she was busy texting, and that also hurt the other students' learning. They also failed the test.\n\nThat's why it's important not to let students bring phones to school. Also, if students bring phones to school, it might disturb other students. For example, if you bring your phone to class and forget to turn it off, it might ring suddenly. That might disturb the whole class and hurt the other students' learning.

While some people think students should not take online classes, others believe it's a good idea. Online classes are time-limited, so students can use their time wisely for other things. For example, students who have transportation problems every morning will find that taking classes from home makes their lives easier.\n\nTaking online classes from home is very valuable. These classes have fixed times, so students can plan their study and do a job in their free time. In the USA, most students take loans to finish their education. Doing a job while taking an online course helps with those loan payments. Clearly, it's beneficial to take online classes and accept distance learning.\n\nFor students without their own transportation, online classes are the best option. In the USA, not having transportation is a big problem. Students often suffer the most. They have to rush for public transportation every morning to get to campus on time. This can affect their attendance. Taking an online class solves these problems easily. Students can focus on their studies instead of dealing with transportation issues.\n\nOverall, taking online classes saves time and lets students do other jobs to earn money and avoid being late to class due to transportation problems.

Not all students like drawing, painting, singing, or acting.\n\nLetting students choose their classes will help many students.

One reason is that students can feel stressed when they don't understand something and have no one to ask. Another reason is that they may not know how to interact with people from different cultures. They also have to be responsible for their own schedule, which can be hard.\n\nStudents take classes at home, just like they would in a traditional school. Some classes are harder than others. If they struggle with a topic, they have to find ways to understand it on their own, like searching online or watching videos. Having people around can be helpful because they can explain things in a way that makes sense. But online students don't have that advantage.\n\nInteracting with people is another issue. When students don't have classmates, they may feel shy or unsure about how to treat people from different cultures. Some students prefer to go to school to be around others, but their parents want them to stay home. This can make students feel isolated.\n\nOnline school has its own schedule, and students have to be on time. They have to cover all the material for the day and finish on time. But they have other responsibilities too, and if they don't have enough time, they can get stressed. Stress can cause many problems, like acne, headaches, and insomnia.\n\nHaving good relationships with different kinds of people is important in life. Online students may not get as much help as they need, and they have to learn to organize their time well. If they're not responsible, they should think carefully about taking online classes."}

Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill said something that proves a common thought. I agree because I believe that without failing, you won't learn until you get it right. You need to make mistakes to understand and not mess up in the future. One reason failure is important for success is that you can't just see something and know everything about it; you need to take time and study. Many learners agree with this. We all learn the hard way or not at all.\n\nAs humans, we get inspired by something and make sure to achieve it. We learn about it to do it. My mother is an example of failure playing a key role in success. She came to the United States as a teenager and had me at a young age. She wanted to do big things, but it wasn't going as planned. My mother focused on money, but also on me. She wanted to set a good example for me. My mother realized she had to do something to get ahead. She didn't think negatively or give up. She had a choice: stress about her decision or go for it with a positive attitude. 10 years have passed, and my mother is now a supervisor at a school. She's setting a good example for me, and I learned that hard work pays off. Without feeling like giving up, messing up, and being stressed, you won't get to where you want to be. I thank her for sharing her struggles and difficulties with me. At 17, I realized that struggling isn't just about feeling depressed or going through a hard time; it's about trying your best to get what you want, and it's okay to feel like you're struggling - it's just the beginning of the path to your future."}

The problem is that people want to reduce the school day, but they don't say that factories and companies should do the same. So, it doesn't matter if schools are open for only two hours because students will stay home and waste energy playing games, watching TV, and using devices.\n\nJust because some people do the same thing, it doesn't mean energy will be saved. Some businesses already work four days a week, but schools need more than two hours of teaching.\n\nThe University of Washington disagrees because schools need more than two hours to teach, and people will still waste energy at home. For example, I have computers, phones, and TVs, and I sometimes use them all at once.

They have enthusiasm, and they know that if they stop trying, they'll lose their enthusiasm and courage. So, they keep trying, and their enthusiasm for success keeps them going. If they give up, they'll lose their enthusiasm and become losers.\n\nSecond, think about what inventors can gain if they succeed. If they invent something, they can patent it and sell it to companies. The company will use their invention to make a new product and pay them for it. Then, the inventor can stay at home and still earn money. They'll also become famous. For example, Thomas Edison invented the light bulb. His invention is in history books and newspapers, and people still remember him.\n\nThomas Edison is a great example. He tried to make a light bulb over a thousand times and failed. But he didn't give up. Finally, he succeeded, and his invention changed the world. He earned a lot of money and became very famous.

For some students, an art class is very fun because they share the same feeling - to be creative and to know the meaning of art. Art can teach you many things, and it helps you to be different and unique.\n\nFirst, an art class lets students express their feelings. Every student has their own way to express emotions. Some pick music, some pick painting, and some pick drama. When students express their feelings, it helps them to feel better. When a student attends an art class, they learn how to express how they feel and what art is all about.\n\nSecond, art helps students make choices and know what they want. Many students do not know what they want, and they are undecided. An art class can teach students how to know what they want. It's like choosing one of the many options, such as music, painting, or drama. It helps students see the world from another point of view.\n\nOn the other hand, art students are often the most positive students in school.

So, my point is that no matter how many times you fail, you must get up and keep working because you learn from mistakes, and if you fail, you will have another chance to improve what you did and make it better.\n\nKeep focusing on your dreams.

They have to stay at home to help their parents with food and cleaning instead of learning to get a good job.\n\nLastly, online classes are hard for students who can't take them at home. However, some students think it's a good idea for people who don't like school or don't have time. Many students agree that online classes are hard without a teacher, but it's always hard for students to learn at home because they have a lot to do."}
{"text_id_kaggle": "936D63E8CE0B", "output_essay": "Failure is the key to success. It helps you to keep going when things get tough. Failure is important because it makes you strong, you learn from your mistakes, and it prepares you for excellence.\n\nFirst, failure makes you strong. You don't give up when things get tough, but you keep trying to achieve success. Failure helps you improve in areas you're not good at. For example, getting better at math can make a big difference in your life. Failure opens new doors for people who take risks. It makes life meaningful by trying your best.\n\nNext, failure helps you learn from your mistakes. You forget about yesterday and focus on what you can do today to succeed. Many college students who drop out try again and find their way to success. You also become wiser and believe in yourself more. You know you can try again.\n\nSome people think that people fail because they don't work hard enough. They give up or wait until the last minute to do things. For example, some people rely on others to do their work without trying themselves. People who fail often don't set their priorities right and choose to give up. They don't take chances to try again.\n\nIn conclusion, failure is important in our daily lives. It helps us develop and grow. We've all failed at some point, and it's what helps us succeed.\n\nFailure is a powerful tool to improve ourselves. Success comes from taking chances and trying again. Life can be tough, but without failure, we wouldn't learn to get back up and try again."}

One effect is that students may find using their phones in school for class fun. Another reason is that it may be bad because they may fall off task.\n\nThe first effect is that students may find using their phones in class fun and helpful. We learn better when we use something we enjoy. Since we're used to our phones, we pay more attention to them. For example, if you told me to use my phone to get on Google Classroom, I would do it right away.\n\nAnother effect is that using cell phones in school for educational purposes can be bad. Some students may start doing things they're not supposed to do when the teacher tells them to take out their phones. They might go on social media or other websites they're not allowed to use at school.\n\nIn conclusion, some schools use cell phones in the classroom, and I think it has both good and bad effects."}

Many students have jobs after school, and adding two more hours to the school day will make it hard for them to wake up early. They might miss a lot of school because they're too tired from work.\n\nA longer school day has some benefits. We'll have more time in class to do our work, projects, or catch up on what we missed if we were absent. We'll also have more time to take tests. And we'll have an extra day to do things outside of school or sleep in. Some students or teachers might use Fridays to pay bills or go grocery shopping.\n\nBut there are also some downsides. Many students work at 5 pm or right after school. For them, making the school day longer is not a good idea because they'll lose an hour of work. For example, I work at 4 pm, and my shifts are very busy from Wednesday to Sunday. I get home late, around 1 am or 2:30 am, and it's hard to wake up the next morning. If the school day gets longer, it will be even harder for me to wake up at 6 am."}

When people are forced to do something they don't want to do, they only do it to get by. For example, students are often not allowed to choose their classes. They have to take classes they don't want to take, and as a result, they don't do well in those classes. They fail and lose interest in trying.\n\nEvery student should be able to choose their own classes. A student who wants to become an Algebra 1 teacher wouldn't want to take a music or art class because those classes aren't related to their career. In algebra, students learn important skills like factoring and solving equations. In music class, students learn how to write songs and sing. These are very different things. This student probably wouldn't do well in a music class because their interest is in algebra.\n\nIf students are forced to take art classes just because they have to, they might fail and lose interest. For example, if a student wants to become an Algebra 1 teacher, the school shouldn't make them take music, drama, or art classes. The student is wasting the chance to learn and succeed in other classes they might like, like Pre-calculus or Calculus. Students shouldn't be forced to take classes they're not interested in. Letting students choose their classes helps them learn faster and become successful in school and life.\n\nIn conclusion, students who take classes just because they have to probably won't do well in those classes and will miss the chance to learn things they're interested in. Students deserve the chance to choose their own classes. By letting them do that, they will succeed in school. Schools shouldn't require students to take music, drama, or art classes.

{"text_id_kaggle": "1557E40A4AC9", "output_essay": "School is very helpful to students. It provides many experiences and opportunities. In school, there are elective classes like drama, art, and music. These classes help students discover their talents and support their character development. Some people think students should be required to take a music, drama, or art class. I strongly agree with this idea.\n\nI have several reasons for this. Firstly, students can find out what they like. This can help them choose a career path in the future. For example, many seniors struggle to decide what to study in college and what they want to be in the future. If students take a music, drama, or art class, they will learn a lot and might easily find out what they like. They can also develop a skill in that area.\n\nIn addition, some students think elective classes are easy and not important for college. I disagree with this. Music, art, or drama classes are connected to regular classes like history, science, and physics. For example, music class is connected to history because we study the history of music. Music class is also connected to science because we learn how to produce sound on instruments.\n\nOn the other hand, if you do well in a music, drama, or art class, you can change your character in a positive way. If you are shy and quiet, you can become talkative, brave, and creative because these classes involve group work and sharing ideas. You can become a great leader. For example, when I was in 9th grade, I was shy and quiet in science and history classes because I was not interested in them. But in Photography class, I changed and became a different person. I talked a lot, shared ideas, and gave ideas to others. I was an active and creative leader in that class.\n\nIn conclusion, these reasons explain why students should be required to take a music, drama, or art class. These classes are important and will help students find out what they like, be useful in the future, and change their character in a positive way. I believe that if these classes are required, it will be very helpful to students."}

I agree with Prime Minister Winston Churchill that life has its ups and downs, and we need to go through tough times to learn from our own experiences. Life is about learning from our mistakes, becoming a better person, and gaining real-life experiences.\n\nMy first reason is that we learn from our mistakes. I have friends who have never had a hard time and only know about life through others. I think having some tough times is good. It makes you a stronger person; you learn to take care of yourself, and you see life differently. Many things change.\n\nMy second reason is that we become a better person. As a teenager, I tried out for cheerleading and soccer, but I didn't make it. I learned I wasn't good at soccer and didn't even like it. I also found out I'm not the type of person who can always be smiling and acting pretty. Instead, I found something I really like - rugby and JROTC at my school. I started to find the real me; I knew I wasn't like other teenagers, and I knew there was something special about me. Now, I thank the coaches who said no to me, because I'm doing something I love, and it makes me feel good and proud.\n\nMy last reason is that we gain life experiences. After I didn't make the soccer or cheerleading teams, I got sad and couldn't believe it. One day, I told myself, 'Sometimes things happen for a reason.' I think it was the best advice I gave to myself. I didn't want to explain to people why I didn't make the team, so I told them I quit. But it wasn't true, and it was killing me inside. I don't like to lie, so I started telling the truth, and it felt good. Yes, some people stopped talking to me, but others came into my life and forgave me.\n\nIn conclusion, life is about having fun, loving yourself, learning from mistakes, getting back up, trusting people around you, and asking for help. I think learning to get back up on your own is hard; we always need friends in life, and falling down sometimes can help us stop trying to be perfect."}

At home, students can easily get sidetracked by video games or other things. Some students might not take online classes seriously because it's easy to skip them.\n\nGoing to school is better for students because they can make friends and meet new people. In school, students can work on group projects, which might not be possible in online classes. When teachers assign projects, the school usually provides the necessary supplies like books, computers, and more. Students can also get help from classmates or other teachers at school. This makes learning more fun and interesting when there are people around to help or get help from.\n\nSome classes need to be done in person. For example, P.E. class is more practical. Science classes are also better in person because students learn by doing experiments with chemicals or other materials. In biology, students use microscopes to learn about cells. These classes won't be as good online because students can't do experiments and will miss out on a lot.\n\nSchool offers many opportunities like programs or clubs that online classes don't. Some courses, like academies, are very beneficial for students. Many students rely on these courses. These classes need to be taken in school because they involve group activities.

{"text_id_kaggle": "40007FDDC453", "output_essay": "Failure is important for achieving success.\n\nWinston Churchill, a former British Prime Minister, said that success is about going from one failure to another without losing enthusiasm. I believe that failure plays a crucial role in achieving success. I will discuss three reasons why: you learn from failure, you become more careful, and you become honest.\n\nFirst, I think you learn from failure because when you do something wrong, you try to do it better next time. For example, when I was young, I tried to ride a bike but fell. I didn't give up; I kept trying until I learned how to balance. Many people don't try to be successful because they don't face their problems; they quit. If you face your problems, you become stronger and won't fall easily again.\n\nSecond, I think you become more careful because you know how hard you worked to get what you have. You take care of your things and feel comfortable when you look at them. For instance, I felt happy when I bought my first phone. It took me a long time to save money, but I worked hard and bought it. It may be a small thing, but it was special to me. Now it's broken, but it's my first phone, and I keep it as a memory.\n\nThird, I think you become honest because if people ask how you became successful, you tell them the truth - that you didn't give up. You worked hard, fell many times, but got up and tried again until you succeeded. I'm honest; I fell many times while learning to ride a bike, but I didn't give up. If someone asks me why I didn't give up, I tell them that I was excited to ride, I wanted to have fun, and I wanted to go fast.\n\nIn conclusion, these are my reasons for believing that failure is important for achieving success. We can use these ideas to encourage people to take risks and tell them that if they face bad things, they should fight them, and they will be successful. I think everyone in this world has fallen at least once and didn't give up."}

I agree with Churchill's statement that failure is important for success because it gives us experience, makes us positive, and helps us accept our mistakes.\n\nFirst, failure gives us experience. When we fail, we learn from our mistakes and can use that knowledge to succeed. For example, if we had a bad relationship, we learn what not to do in the next one.\n\nSecond, failure makes us positive. We can't let failure make us feel bad or sad. For example, my mom wanted to get her driver's license, but she failed many times. At first, she felt bad, but she kept trying until she passed.\n\nFinally, failure helps us accept our mistakes. It's hard to admit when we're wrong, but when we do, we can try to do better next time. For example, if we fail a test because we didn't study, we need to accept that it's our fault and try harder next time.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that we should keep trying even when we fail because we have many chances to succeed.

Not everything goes as you want it to.\n\nMost people think failure is okay, but it's not. You should always try to succeed, even when it's hard. Giving up won't get you anywhere. If you don't try again, you might end up with a low-paying job.\n\nMany students want to graduate from high school and go to college for a better life. Some students drop out because they don't want to work hard. They want to stay home and do what they want. But parents want their kids to succeed.

However, in online classes, it's just the teacher, and there are no distractions. Another benefit is that students can ask the teacher any questions they have.\n\nIn recent years, technology has been a major distraction for students, with things like cellphones and video games.

For example, my younger brother had a bone marrow transplant and couldn't go to school because his immune system was recovering. He's taking online classes from home, and it's helped him from failing his grade.\n\nIn the end, I think everything has good and bad points. Online classes can help us in tough situations or cause problems. We can't say what's right or wrong because they help some people and not others. Everyone knows that online classes have good and bad points, so no one can decide if they should exist or not."}

Life is a mix of winning, losing, and accepting what happens.\n\nFirst, we need to accept when bad things happen. This can be a car accident, losing a house, or going bankrupt.\n\nSecond, we need to know that we will lose things we love. This can be a person we love, a car we like, or a house we want.\n\nThird, we need to make the most of our good times. This means taking care of our health, getting an education, and loving everyone.\n\nIn conclusion, success in life is a journey with many ups and downs. The most important thing is to know how to deal with failure, loss, and success to have a better life."}
{"text_id_kaggle": "6.00E+11", "output_essay": "Should your school extend the school day by two hours?\n\nSome people want a longer school day, while others do not. So, schools should not add two more hours to the day. Some students have jobs or family responsibilities. Instead, schools can offer extra time for students who need help or want to graduate early.\n\nAdding two hours to the school day is not a good idea. Students might be late to school or have problems with the new schedule. Schools should identify students who need extra time and give it to them. This will help students who struggle in class or want to graduate early. It will make things easier for students.\n\nHowever, there is a downside to changing the school schedule. It might affect how much sleep students get. If the school adds two more hours, they can keep the same schedule or change it.\n\nThe problem is that students might get confused about their schedule and class times. A four-day school week might work, but students will miss out on learning. They can relax, but they will still have a lot of work to do. A four-day week sounds good, but adding two more hours to the school day is a problem. Students have a lot of work to do in school."}
{"text_id_kaggle": "C2F7A800FCB1", "output_essay": "Imagine going to school only four days a week. I think this is a great idea because it would help us save energy and make many things better. We would have more time in school to learn and take extra classes. This would help our environment and make a big change in our lives.\n\nFirst, saving energy would help keep our environment clean. There would be less pollution, and it would be better for animals and people. Pollution makes people sick, and it happens when we use too much energy. If we save energy, we can also save food and other resources. This would help the government save money, and people could spend more time with their families.\n\nSecond, with a four-day school week, we could take an extra class or get extra help from teachers. We would be in school for ten hours, so we would learn more and have more time to work on projects. Students like being in school, so they would be happy to stay longer. If we take an extra class, we might be able to graduate with better grades. We could also spend more time with our counselors to talk about our problems.\n\nFinally, saving energy would keep our environment clean and healthy. Our environment is very important because we need clean air to live. If we save resources, we can keep our environment beautiful. The more we take care of the earth, the healthier it will be. If everyone saves energy and resources, our community would be a better place. People would like to live in a clean and healthy environment.\n\nWe should think about having a four-day school week because it would help us save energy and make our community better. The more we save energy and resources, the better our lives will be. If schools only have four days of classes, it would be good for many people, and it would save a lot of energy and resources."}

Others think online classes are better because you can do the work when you want.\n\nGoing to school is better for students because they can ask others for help when they don't understand. Online classes let you sleep in and do the work when you feel like it. You can also video chat with teachers about assignments or questions. In school, you have to do all the work they give you.\n\nEveryone learns differently. Some people have trouble understanding. Others speak different languages, and many people can't understand what they learn. We all have different ways of learning. That's why we have online and school classes, so people can learn in the way that's best for them. Going to school is good for young kids so they can understand their future better. It can help them get a good job or join the military.\n\nWhether you do online school or attend school, it can help your future with a good job. It can help you understand our cultures, states, how to manage money, and most importantly, it can help you read and write."}
{"text_id_kaggle": "916C937AF222", "output_essay": "Arts are important in everyone's life. They help us get rid of negative energy and stay positive. Arts like drama, music, or painting help us express our feelings without words. Arts also mean having a special talent. I think it's necessary to take an arts class. \n\nMany people don't know their talent. They might think they're not good at art or drama, but that's not true. For example, when I see a beautiful drawing, I think only a professional artist can do it. But when I watch them create it step by step, I realize I can do it too. Artists and musicians often have a positive energy because they see the world in a different way. We need to find our talent to do something we love and stay positive. We also need to know how important arts are. Without arts, the world would be boring. For example, we all watch TV, YouTube, or Netflix, which is a form of drama. Without art, we wouldn't have museums, beautiful buildings, or designs. Even photography helps us keep memories with friends and family. The great thing about arts is that everyone can do it in their own way. \n\nSome people might say that regular classes are more important, especially for students who want to graduate early or take advanced classes. However, when they discover their talents, they might change their minds. For example, my friend wanted to be an engineer, but after taking a photography class, he realized he was good at it and wanted to be a photographer instead. Another example is someone I know who finished college but loved drama, so he left his job to pursue drama and became a famous author. \n\nIn conclusion, high schools should require students to take an arts class because everyone has a talent, everyone needs to know how important their talent is, and knowing our talents can change our lives and future jobs. Arts make us positive."}
{"text_id_kaggle": "31FB79E16333", "output_essay": "Using cellphones in class can have negative effects like cheating, bullying, and sexual abuse. This is because students are not mature enough to understand their responsibilities.\n\nWhen students use phones in class, they get distracted and fail to complete their assignments on time. They get busy on their phones during class.\n\nToday, phones are a major problem in schools. A study in California shows that one in five students cheat during exams using their phones. Although students may need phones in case of an emergency, there are phones in the school office they can use. It may not be easy, but if schools ban phones, students will get used to not having them in class.\n\nPhones disturb us during class because everyone fails to focus on the teacher. For example, they chat, play games, receive texts, or take calls, even when the teacher is teaching. The best way is to not allow phone use and to keep phones outside the class. Students can keep their phones outside the class and pick them up during lunch or at the end of school.\n\nFights in classrooms often start because of phones. Students disturb and annoy others by playing music loudly on their phones.\n\nStudents who don't complete their work on time get busy on their phones and waste time. This causes students to lose interest in their lessons. A study at the University of Arizona found that phones are highly distracting to students. They tested students with and without phones and found that students without phones had a longer attention span.\n\nOverall, students don't need phones in the classroom. We have seen that phones have more disadvantages than advantages. In conclusion, phones are bad for students and should not be allowed in classrooms. Phones affect students' minds and cause problems."}
{"text_id_kaggle": "2F772DB6FB8E", "output_essay": "Most students take a music, drama, or art class because they enjoy it or want to learn more. However, not all students take these classes, and some don't take any electives at all. To graduate from high school, you need to take certain classes or electives.\n\nMy opinion is that if you don't like a class, you should talk to your counselor and try to switch. If you don't, you might not pass the class and have to take it again the next year or in summer school. Some counselors are not helpful because they say you need to take an art, music, or drama class to graduate. This is frustrating for students because the counselor is not supporting them. When the student fails the class, the counselor gets upset with them.\n\nThe good news is that our school offers many electives, so you don't have to take a class that doesn't interest you. You can take other classes like gourmet food, Spanish, PE, or many others.\n\nI find art, music, or drama classes boring because the teachers often do things their own way. They need to be more patient and slow down. This is why some students don't like these classes. Teachers need to motivate students more and change the class material because it's often the same every year. For example, I already had credit for Art 1 and Art 2, but my counselor put me in Art 1 again. I talked to my counselor, and she took me out of the class because I didn't need it.\n\nI never took a music class because I'm not interested in playing instruments. However, my father took a music class in school, and it was good for him because he learned more about music. Some people enjoy singing, which is why they like music class. Drama class is important because drama is a part of life.\n\nIn conclusion, these classes can be good because you learn more about them and how they relate to your life. Students, take your class, relax, and don't get frustrated. Every class has its problems, but you need to take them to graduate from high school and get your diploma. Talk to your counselor if you're having trouble with a class."}

This is a common way of studying in many parts of the world, and it can provide more opportunities for students who don't have time to attend school every day. This would be especially helpful for students with disabilities or illnesses.\n\nEvery student has a different life, and many students work and study at the same time. Online classes can help students who don't have time to attend school, live far from school, or have family responsibilities. For example, in my school, there are around thirty girls who are married and have families or kids to take care of. Some of them use online studying programs and do better than others who miss classes.\n\nOnline classes would also be helpful for students planning to attend college, since many college and university classes and exams are online. The biggest beneficiaries would be students with disabilities. This would give them the opportunity to study like other kids and share their experiences with them. It would also save counties and families money on private schools.\n\nAdditionally, online classes would allow students to catch up on missed classes or attend classes from home when they are sick or unable to attend school. I think this will become a common way of studying in the next ten years.\n\nSome people think online studying is not the right way to learn because they believe students will use it as an excuse to skip school. However, I think online classes can be controlled by requiring students to show a valid reason and get family approval.\n\nOnline studying has many benefits for students and society. We should use technology to make our lives easier, but we need to use it in a controlled way to ensure our kids use it correctly.\n\nIn short, online studying is a modern and useful way to learn and benefit students and society."}
{"text_id_kaggle": "BC0643D3DF44", "output_essay": "Do you think you can be successful after many failures, or do you think many failures won't help you succeed?\n\nThe path to success is not easy for most people. Some people may take the wrong path when they start something, but they will learn from their mistakes and gain more experience. Then, they will find their own way to succeed. I think as long as people don't lose their enthusiasm for their work, even if they have many failures, they will finally succeed.\n\nFor me, failure is not scary. Just be more confident, trust yourself, and keep going. Maybe you will be the next successful person.\n\nOne reason I think people will be successful after many failures is that failure is just an experience in life. Everyone will fail at some point. But if you can overcome it, it will make you stronger.\n\nSo, how do you overcome it? First, calm down after you fail and clear your mind. Then, talk to friends about what happened and why you failed. Solve the problem together and remember it so it won't happen again. This will help you succeed faster.\n\nAnother reason I think people will be successful after many failures is that in my country, China, there's a famous saying: 'Failure is the mother of success.' Many people have experienced this because success comes after failure. For example, my uncle started a company after college, but it failed. He didn't give up and kept working hard. He wrote down all his experiences and lessons in a notebook. Finally, he succeeded and now has a high salary. It's an amazing true story.\n\nOn the other hand, if you've had many failures, you'll be able to avoid making bad decisions in the future. Some people look charming and smart because they have a lot of experience. Experience is very important; it can improve us and help others. For example, if someone wants to swim in winter with a weak body, I can advise them not to because I got sick from swimming last week. That's how experience works.\n\nIn conclusion, I think failure is not always bad. As long as you don't give up on your dreams and are confident in yourself, failure can be good for you and help you succeed. And for people who are already successful but didn't have failures, they might make mistakes because they're overconfident. Moreover, in the future, you can teach your children your experiences and how to be successful. So, don't be afraid of failure; just keep working with enthusiasm and let those failures make you stronger."}
{"text_id_kaggle": "648D7D45A7BF", "output_essay": "I believe people should strive to achieve their goals because success is what everyone aims for. However, the idea that 'Success is going from failure to failure without losing enthusiasm' can be both helpful and harmful to some individuals.\n\nWhen we say this idea can solve or create problems, it means that some people get discouraged and don't want to try again. This becomes a big issue because they don't know if they can succeed the second time around.\n\nOn the other hand, we can use our failures to drive us to keep going until we succeed. For example, let's say we're trying to graduate from high school. We know it's our last year, so we'll give our best. If we fail an English class and get an F when we need an A, we can see that failure is right in front of us. But we'll try again in the third quarter and use that failure to motivate us.\n\nSuccess is all around us, like in stores, competitions, and different careers. In stores, companies start from scratch and work towards their goals, becoming big companies. We know mistakes will happen, but the key is to keep going because we'll see success coming soon.\n\nIn competitions, success is the most important thing. There are many competitions worldwide, but let's talk about success in sports competitions. For example, soccer is an area where success is always present, and top teams from Europe want to be the best. So, they created the Champions League, where the strongest team wins. Many teams compete, and all of them are driven by the desire for success.\n\nSome people think that failures mean giving up and trying again later, but not with the same effort. This is a negative mindset that leads to stagnation and never achieving success. In my opinion, it's crucial for people trying to achieve success to seek advice from those who have already succeeded. This can help them stay motivated and know what to do when they feel stuck, and failure will be the step that drives them to keep going."}

I think he's right about how important failure is to achieving success.\n\nFirst, everyone fails at some point in their life. Failure is something we all face. But success comes after we overcome that failure. So, failure plays a big role in achieving success.\n\nSecond, people who fail a lot are often very enthusiastic. No matter how hard it is to succeed, they don't give up. They want to keep going and have a good life.\n\nThird, failure is a common problem. To succeed, people need to work hard and try their best. It's not easy, but it's worth it. Failure only happens when people don't have goals.\n\nIn conclusion, I agree with Churchill that failure is important to achieving success.

You'll face problems, but you can fix them and move forward.\n\nMy second reason is to stay enthusiastic when you're working towards success. You need a positive attitude to succeed. Don't stress, because it can make you fail and lose your mind. Be strong and patient, and you'll make better decisions.\n\nMy third reason is that success takes hard work.

But they shouldn't be overloaded with work. As they grow, they'll face more challenges in college and university.

I agree with Churchill's statement that failure plays a crucial role in achieving success for three main reasons. \n\nFirstly, enthusiasm motivates people to keep going. It's not just about individual effort; others can help us too. For instance, if I fail, someone else can help me do better. Similarly, I can motivate others by showing them how to do things easily. Many people take on a job, fail, but then try again with more enthusiasm. However, some people give up when they fail and don't want to try again.\n\nIn a company, it's normal for people to lose enthusiasm, but that's okay because we make mistakes and learn from them.\n\nSecondly, failure isn't always bad because we can learn from our mistakes. For example, when I make a mistake at work, my manager encourages me, which boosts my enthusiasm. Being enthusiastic every day helps us achieve great things in life, even if we make mistakes. I like this reason because I know it's not easy to stay enthusiastic. I've made mistakes at work and felt like giving up, but I didn't. It's sad when people give up and don't want help.\n\nThe third reason is that with enthusiasm, we can achieve our goals in life, work, or business. It doesn't matter if we fail; if we have enthusiasm, we can do what we want. For example, my dad motivated me to do my homework when I was 11. Now, as an adult, it's harder to decide on a career, but I still have enthusiasm. I never give up, even when I fail. If you fail and then become a better person, that's great.\n\nIn a company, enthusiasm is essential for everyone who wants to be positive and successful.\n\nIn conclusion, I agree with Churchill's statement because we can do things better if we want to. Nobody is perfect; we make mistakes and learn from them. Just stay positive, do your job easily, and never lose enthusiasm. I will always stay positive and enthusiastic, even when I fail."}

Extending the school day by two hours and having a four-day school week can be beneficial. First, students need to learn to be responsible and take their classes on time. This is how we can improve every day. School plays a crucial role in shaping our future, and it's where we learn to become good individuals.\n\nFor instance, we need to attend our classes, do our homework, and be on time. These habits help us become responsible and reflect good character.\n\nSecond, extending the school day can help us conserve energy and resources. We have a lot to learn in the classroom, and this extra time can be useful for our education. With good education, we can grow and become better every day. Having ten hours of school time sounds good, as we can use this time for important activities. We should always try to take many steps to achieve our goals, and the benefits will be a better future.\n\nFor example, having extra time for homework and understanding class problems can help us get good grades.\n\nNext, I completely agree with having a four-day school week and extending the school day by two hours. Many students need more focused time, which is important for our education. The school can save money on fuel, and we can complete our class hours. Having an extra day off can be good for students who need more time to do homework and get good grades. The weekend is not enough time to do everything, especially when we have a lot of homework and family time.\n\nFor example, with two extra hours, we can focus and do well on our tests, have four days to do homework, take notes, and have fun with our families. The school buses can save fuel, and our educational hours remain the same.\n\nIn conclusion, I agree with extending the school day by two hours and having a four-day school week. This can help me achieve my goals and have a better future. School is the start of our future, and I always try to learn more and set goals to become a good person and get a good job.

There are people who really need that water, like in Africa where some places don't have enough resources. They don't even have good food or showers like we do. While we waste fresh water, some people don't even have enough water to take a shower.\n\nWe should appreciate the water and resources we have at home.\n\nIn my opinion, working four days a week is both good and bad. If you work four days, it sounds good, but some people need to take care of their families. They need to pay rent, phone bills, and car bills, and buy food for their families. So, I think working more than four days is good.\n\nAbout school, can we have only four days of school? I don't think so. We need education for our future. The school can't give us only four days because it's better for students to come to school five days. If we have only four days of school, it's not good. We need education for everything. If we have more days of school, we can be more successful in the future. Education, respect, and being nice to everyone is the key to the future."}

I think failure is like riding a bike. Sometimes we fall, but we get back up and try again. Failures are like climbing a tree to get fruit. We work hard and find a way to get what we want.

Many people want to work more and have a better life. They want to earn good money and have good things. If they only work four days, they will have less time to do this. They want a good community, but they don't want to be limited to just four days of work.\n\nAnother reason is that making the school day longer might not be the best idea either. The article says this will help save energy, but I think it's better to look at the good and bad things about a five-day school week, where each day is around eight hours. This shows that the community is not doing enough to help people have good opportunities.\n\nThe third reason is that both ideas, a four-day work week and a longer school day, are supposed to help save energy and resources. But some businesses already do this, and people want to save energy. Is making the school day longer really going to help?

This year, I didn't take an art class because I wanted to focus on my main subjects and get an advanced diploma.\n\nChoosing classes that make you feel confident is important for your education. Some students want to major in art, music, or drama. This is a great chance to gain experience and see if you're good at it.\n\nFor example, a student wanted to major in music, so he took a music class. At first, he was happy, but then he realized it was hard for him to read music. He changed classes and realized he wasn't good at it. It was good that he found out early.\n\nSome people think that students should be forced to take art classes to learn new skills. But I think students should choose what they want to learn. It's better to let students decide because some aren't interested and might not do well, which can affect their grades and chances of graduating."}
{"text_id_kaggle": "B1BB4BBB0DCC", "output_essay": "Education, determination, and technology are the most important things in today's world. Countries like the United States and China, which focus on education and technology, are the most developed countries. We know that education is crucial for a good community, but many countries do not prioritize it. Countries like Afghanistan, Iraq, Uzbekistan, and Egypt have low education levels.\n\nNow, it's easy to get an education. Students can take online classes and attend online conferences without going to school. To start getting an education is not hard. You just need to be determined, and you will be successful.\n\nThere are many reasons why people can't get an education. But the online world has made it easy for people who are disabled, girls who can't leave their homes, and people who have to work to support their families. For example, my sister works full-time to support our family. She wants to be a dentist, but she can't attend college because of work. Online classes help her get an education and support us financially.\n\nTransportation is also a problem, but online classes have solved it. Many people can't afford to send their kids to school, but now they can stay at home and get an education. Through their abilities, they can make a difference in the world. Now, there's no barrier to getting knowledge.\n\nOnline classes are easy and convenient. You can meet and interact with different people online, share your ideas, and get a wide range of knowledge. You can choose your teacher, timing, and classes. If you miss a class, you can watch it later. If you don't understand, you can email your teacher.\n\nEducation is a basic need and right for every person. There's no specific age or time for it. Knowledge gives us the sense of thinking, observation, and ability to do something. Through online classes, we can educate ourselves whenever we want. Education is the key to success, and all developed countries prioritize it. In conclusion, online classes are helping millions of students who can't afford college but are determined to get an education."}

We can look at other places, like El Salvador, where one teenager dies every day. Many kids prefer to join gangs instead of going to school. They do graffiti with negative messages. If they had an art class, they could use their skills for good. We can encourage students here to express themselves positively.\n\nI used to dream of being an actor, but I didn't take theater because I didn't think I was good enough. Many students are in the same situation. They're good singers, but they lack confidence. If we encourage them, they could become famous artists, singers, or actors. We should motivate them to dream big.\n\nSchool is important, but many students don't like coming. If they do something they enjoy, they'll be happy to be there every day. Some teachers use singing and acting to teach lessons because it's a great way to learn.

Cell phones can also help stop bad behavior in class. The school can see what students are looking at online.\n\nSecond, it's easy. You can quickly find the right information on websites. You can share answers with your classmates and teachers at the same time. Teachers can make sure everyone is learning the same thing.\n\nThird, it's useful.

Some students can learn at home, but they need someone to guide them and tell them what to do. This helps them learn something at home.\n\nThe goal is to help students get an education, which is important because some parts of the world need it. In my country, online classes at home won't work because students need to find food in the morning. If they're hungry, they can't focus on their schoolwork. Some families are very poor, and online classes at home won't work for them. That's why they need to come to classes, where the school can help them learn.\n\nIt works for rich people because their families can check on them and make sure they're doing their work. If it doesn't work, they'll send them to school. My point is that some students will benefit from online classes, but some won't. The ones who will benefit are those who are checked on regularly and are motivated to complete their work.\n\nThey will read their books regularly, which helps them understand what they're doing. The students who won't benefit will likely be on the streets, missing out on opportunities. Some schools want students to stay at home, but they need to make sure the students are doing their work. If the students aren't working, the school needs to call them back to classes.\n\nIf the students don't get help, they need to come back to school, where they can learn in a classroom.

This quote shows how important failure is in achieving success. Failure means not getting what you want or expect. Success means getting what you want or achieving your goal.\n\nMany successful people have failed many times. Famous people like Cristiano Ronaldo, Messi, Michael Jordan, and Lebron James are examples. They all failed before they succeeded. For instance, Cristiano Ronaldo had to leave his country and family at a young age to join a big football team in Europe.\n\nMany people are too scared to try because they're afraid of failing. They don't want to be judged or pressured. But Michael Jordan wasn't afraid to fail. Every time he missed a shot, he tried again until he got it right.\n\nEveryone wants to be successful. We all have goals, like raising money for charity or becoming a professional soccer player. Imagine if Steve Jobs had never created the iPhone. There would be no iPhone today. Think about playing a game and winning every time. It gets boring. Failing sometimes is better than winning all the time.\n\nThese are some reasons why failure is important for success. Most people are scared of failing, but I'm not. I know it can lead to success. So set your goals high and don't stop until you achieve them."}
{"text_id_kaggle": "D6068FF1B29A", "output_essay": "In my opinion, I have mixed feelings about students taking classes from home. Some students care about what's best for others, not just themselves.\n\nThere are many reasons for this.\n\nFirst, taking classes from home can be more comfortable and easier. Students who don't like coming to school might attend more often. The weather is another reason. Sometimes, schools close due to snow, rain, or cold weather, making it dangerous for students to travel. Taking classes online or by conference can be a better option.\n\nStudents can attend classes from the comfort of their own homes, and attendance might improve. Maybe doing homework online can also work well. If there's a penalty for not connecting, it could be a good idea. This way, parents won't worry about their kids being in school or not.\n\nHowever, there are some downsides. Not all students have access to the internet at home, so this option wouldn't be beneficial for them. They might prefer to go to school instead. I don't think schools will provide internet just for taking classes from home.\n\nAnother issue is that online teachers might not explain things well, leaving us with questions. We might not understand everything, and then we'll struggle with quizzes. In school, we have teachers who can explain things to us after class.\n\nIf students are struggling, online sessions won't notify us. In school, we have counselors, after-school sessions, and tutoring to help us. We won't have these services at home. Some students might be too lazy to take classes online and would rather do something else. Social media can also be a distraction.\n\nI think older students, like those in the last two grades, should be allowed to take classes from home. They already know what they want to do. Teachers should focus on helping younger students get ready for online classes.\n\nTeachers can discuss this in conferences and assign online classes to students who they think can handle it. I know that students who are sick or have other issues can already take online classes, and it's beneficial for them. If they apply and explain why they want to take online classes, it might work too."}

For example, I once failed an algebra test, but I studied hard and got a good grade the second time. I also worked hard in history and did well. If we try hard, we can be very successful.\n\nAnother reason is that we can learn from our mistakes. I once failed an English test because I didn't read the material. I learned that if I don't read, I won't do well. Mistakes are bad if we don't learn from them.\n\nWhen we fail, it helps us become smarter. We learn what we did wrong and try to do better next time.

Making fun of others for failing is not okay, because it can hurt their feelings.\n\nOne reason failure is not just about losing is that people may not know how to do something.

{"text_id_kaggle": "8CB337D8D65C", "output_essay": "Should students benefit from being homeschooled?\n\nIn my opinion, I think students should be allowed to be homeschooled. There are fewer distractions at home than in public or private schools. There are many distractions in school, and students don't realize they can affect their learning. For example, students often arrive late to class because they hang out with friends in the halls and don't pay attention to their schedule. When a student arrives late, they miss part of the lesson and distract others.\n\nAnother reason homeschooling is good is that there's no attendance policy, and students can learn faster. Some students always arrive late and miss half the lesson because they can't get up in the morning. Walking into class late ruins their learning time and distracts others. At home, students can learn faster because nobody holds them back, and they can move at their own pace. For example, if some students struggle with a lesson, it slows down the whole class.\n\nHowever, there are reasons why homeschooling might not be good. The time spent learning at home might be different from school. Students might get too comfortable at home and think they can sleep in whenever they want. Another problem is that students might get distracted by their surroundings at home. Since they're familiar with their environment, it's hard to pay attention and listen to what they're learning.\n\nIn conclusion, these are the reasons why I think students should be allowed to be homeschooled."}

When you focus too much on something, you can get lost and forget about what's happening around you. Some people are addicted to games, and it can affect their brain. It can make them want to drop out of school and play games all day. Social media can also be a problem when you care too much about what people think of you. It can make you depressed and focus only on yourself. And when you focus too much on your friends, they can lead you to do bad things and change your personality.\n\nFailure is also when you're lazy. When you're lazy, you won't do anything right, even if you're in school. You won't participate in activities or do your homework. You'll just sit around and play on your phone. Being lazy is not good; it lets you down and can make you fail in school.\n\nIn conclusion, if you work hard, you'll be successful. But if you don't care, you'll fail.

{"text_id_kaggle": "6D09A01DEF15", "output_essay": "Failure plays a big role in achieving success. Many successful people believe that after many failures, they will finally achieve a big success. This is a true statement that has happened many times in history. To be successful, you need to work hard because success doesn't come easily. A successful person is someone who fails many times but never gives up. They usually get more than they want because they try harder.\n\nTo be successful, you need to have many experiences. You can't get experience without failing. When you fail, you learn from your mistakes. You try harder to fix your problems and may fail again. For example, if you want to learn how to drive, you need to practice a lot. You may have some accidents, but you'll learn from them and become a good driver. Practicing also gives you different situations to face. At first, you may fail, but after practicing, you'll pass them easily.\n\nA person who never gives up after many failures becomes a strong person. A strong person always takes risks and is not afraid to lose. They always fight for their goal. For example, if you're a scientist researching why white blood cells are important, you may do many experiments that fail. But you won't give up and will try again until you get the answer.\n\nMost successful people started from nothing and had big goals. If they didn't fail, they would be too proud and wouldn't try harder. So, everyone needs to fail to reach the next level. For example, many famous soccer players started playing in small teams and lost many times. But they never gave up and finally played in big teams.\n\nIn conclusion, the quote from Winston Churchill that 'success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm' is true. To be successful, you have a long road with many failures. But if you never give up, you'll get closer to your goal. Never lose your enthusiasm, and you'll achieve success by trying hard."}

They would have less homework because they would have more time to do it in class. Teachers could review the lesson more, so students would understand it better. The school would stay on track with its teaching plan. Students would have more time for hands-on activities in science class. When students don't have enough class time, they struggle on test day because they only know the main points. With more class time, they could learn all the points.\n\nAnother reason I think this is a good idea is that students would have a longer weekend. They could sleep in on Friday morning and not worry about going to school. During the long weekend, students and teachers could spend more time with their families. Students could play sports or be active. They could even go on a short trip. Students struggle with tests and homework all week, so a longer weekend would help them relax. They could also catch up on school work if they missed a day.\n\nHowever, there is a problem with this idea. Students would not have much time for themselves. They wouldn't have time for sports during the week. Some high school students who want to work might want to drop out. Students would be too stressed, and their grades would drop. They would have a busy schedule and might rather skip school.

Many students have part-time jobs, and it's hard to go to school in the morning and work in the afternoon.\n\nIf we start school two hours later, students won't make it to work on time, and they'll be stressed. So, it's better to leave things as they are and have a vote to see what people think. I think there are more disadvantages than benefits, so we need to think about the students, not just ourselves.\n\nA good reason not to change is that school is meant for five days a week, not four. They want to conserve energy and resources, but adding more hours to four days is like having a five-day week. Some students might think this is a great idea, but they'll regret it when they can't do it anymore.\n\nBusiness people should leave things alone because they're doing this to make more money, and it's not good for everyone. They're trying to confuse people, and I know students would agree with me. We need to keep things the way they are for our own good.\n\nIt's a good idea for people who only work, but it's a bad idea for students who go to school and work. If I were in charge, I would leave things the way they are and not try to change them."}

I agree with Churchill's statement because I've learned from my own experiences that failure is part of the journey.\n\nI think of this quote like a kid trying to ride a bike. He keeps trying until he finally gets it.\n\nI've had a tough time in school. I fell in with the wrong crowd, missed a lot of classes, and faced consequences. I failed my freshman year, which put me behind. I struggled to stay motivated. I changed schools every two years due to family problems, and it became a habit. I didn't try hard in school because I knew I'd move again. I got bad grades. Then, in my junior year, I realized I was really behind. I told myself I needed to try harder. I studied hard for every test and didn't give up. There were times I almost did, but I kept asking for help. Luckily, I found help and got back on track. I tried new ways of studying and learned to remember things better. I even made sure to get a good night's sleep and be prepared for school.\n\nNow, I'm in my senior year, and it's very stressful. This is the year I need to figure out what I want to do with my life. I want to join the military, so I need to graduate from high school. To do that, I need to pass my classes. I'm trying my best, even when it's hard. Luckily, I'm passing all my classes and tests. I'm just a few months away from graduating.\n\nIn conclusion, hard work pays off. I learned that I need to work hard to achieve my goals. There may be obstacles, but I shouldn't give up. I learned from my mistakes and made a plan to fix them. It worked, and now I'm where I want to be."}
{"text_id_kaggle": "BCBE999300EA", "output_essay": "Winston Churchill said that 'success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.' This means that most people give up when they fail to achieve their goals. But enthusiasm is key to success. If you lose enthusiasm, you won't try again. It's a big deal to quit because you failed. Almost everyone fails in life. For example, no one succeeds without failing. If you don't try again, you'll never know what went wrong.\n\nFirstly, everyone fails at some point. Failure helps you find your problems. If you don't fail, you won't know what to fix. Many billionaires failed at first, but they kept working. They believed in themselves and learned from their mistakes. You have a choice: you can succeed or fail. If you try many times, you'll learn from your experiences.\n\nSecondly, losing enthusiasm costs you a lot. You might lose the success you were working towards, the money you could earn, and the happiness that comes with achieving your goal. People who go to the gym say 'no pain, no gain.' This means that if you don't work hard, you won't get the results you want. 'Never give up' is a simple phrase, but it's full of energy and enthusiasm. If someone tells you to never give up, you'll do whatever it takes to achieve your goal.\n\nThirdly, failure is part of the path to success. Many billionaires failed at first, but they kept working. Now, people look up to them as examples. In my opinion, they're still working hard to succeed again and again. There's nothing better than succeeding after working hard. Students study hard to get their dream job, car, or house. They know that hard work will pay off. Some people say that if you fail once, you should stop trying. But I think that's wrong. If you stop trying, you'll get nothing. If you work hard, you might get credit for it because you did it well. People will respect you more if they see that you're positive and trying hard.\n\nTo conclude, success after failure is the best because you learn from your mistakes. You have to be patient and work hard to get what you want. It's impossible to succeed overnight. Good things take time because you need a perfect plan. Your failure is your path to success because you learn new lessons, mistakes, and patience. These three things are simple but important. They can help you succeed if you work hard and do it right. Winston's quote is deep and cheerful. Never give up."}

Who wouldn't want an extra day off from school or work?\n\nIf we agree to this, school days would be a bit longer, but it would be worth it. We would get a day off, and businesses would get what they want. It's a win-win situation. The goal is to keep our community clean and safe by using energy and resources wisely. We should agree with the businesses because it helps the environment and keeps us safe. Plus, we get a four-day school week, which is a great deal.

Winston Churchill, a former British Prime Minister, said that success means going from one failure to another without giving up. Some people think that failing helps people become successful. They believe it's important to fail, learn from mistakes, and try again to achieve success. I think success is hard to achieve. You will face failures, you will have to work hard, and you will want to give up. But if you want to be successful, you must keep working until you achieve it.\n\nSome people think that failing helps you change your way of thinking. You have to work hard to achieve something in life. Don't think negatively; think positively, and you will easily achieve your goals. You will see yourself become successful. Failing is not just about getting back up; it's also about working hard and preparing for the future.\n\nPeople believe that failing is a lesson for life. You learn from your mistakes and understand how hard life can be. It's hard to become successful in life. Even famous people, like actors and soccer players, fail sometimes. They learn from their mistakes and keep trying to be successful. They never give up because they always want more.\n\nI believe that success comes from going through failure. If you never fail, you will never learn and never work hard to achieve your goals. You will never become successful. I have learned a lot from my mistakes, and I'm still learning. If you make a mistake, don't feel sad. Stay positive and keep trying to become successful.\n\nAs you can see, success is always hard to achieve. You have to fall, get up, and learn from your mistakes. I agree with Churchill that success comes from failure, but you should never lose your enthusiasm to learn and become successful."}

During class, they might use Facebook, Twitter, or other social media. Some students might bully others by posting pictures without permission. This can hurt people's feelings.\n\nSecond, cell phones can disturb the class. Students can't focus on their work if they have their phones. They will be too busy using their phones instead of paying attention. This can affect their grades. For example, a student might have had an \"A\" before, but then got an \"F\" because they used their phone too much.\n\nFinally, cell phones can hurt students' brain power. They might not think for themselves because they can quickly find answers online. This can affect their skills, like analyzing and thinking. Also, cell phones have harmful rays that can hurt their brain.\n\nIn conclusion, I think students should not use cell phones in class because of the problems they can cause.

For example, in cosmetology, people may fail to style a haircut, but they don't give up. They keep trying until they get it right, or they ask their teacher for help. When they finally master the style, they feel proud of themselves because they didn't quit.\n\nFailure can also teach us important skills. Failing at a task can be frustrating, but if we learn to control our frustration, we can avoid bad results. For instance, if we're frustrated with a haircut, we might get angry and forget what we're doing. But if we know how to stay calm, we won't lose a client or our job. Controlling frustration is a valuable skill.\n\nAnother good thing about failure is that it can help us make new friends. If we struggle with a task, we might not be the only one. We can work together with others to figure it out, and then we start talking about our personal lives. We might find out we have things in common, like a favorite color or animal.\n\nIn short, failure is a part of success. It makes us work harder, teaches us important skills, and helps us meet new people. On our way to achieving our goals, we can feel good about ourselves and believe we can do anything."}

If students aren't interested, these classes will be a waste of time. They won't learn anything, and it won't help them. That's why these classes should be optional. For example, a student who loves sports won't learn anything in a drama class. They'll be bored, and the class will be a waste of time. So, taking these classes won't be helpful for students.

I believe this is true in many cases and situations, as these words have different meanings and thoughts for me.\n\nWhen I look around at the things people have made to make the earth better, I see technology, cars, houses, and more. The people who invented these things had to go through many failures to get to this success. Thomas Edison, a scientist who invented many things for the world, failed many times before finding the right element to bring light to everyone. The more we fail, the more we succeed. He doesn't see failure as failure; it's just one step closer to success. The technology we use today is an example of success. Every year, we make new models; it's not because the last model failed, but because we want to make it better.\n\nI moved to America about a year ago, and I realized that they have created an environment where people are not afraid to fail. From education to jobs, we all have a chance to fail and be better; failure is just an opening to success. That's why retaking is so important to students. One of my favorite failures is from the first time I took a History class here; I thought it would be easy until I got 13.8% on my grade book. I started working hard, researching, and talking to my teacher. After a short time, my teacher came to me and said, 'Do you know how much you got on the test?' I shook my head and asked him, 'Is it bad?' He said no and walked away with a smile. I got 100%, and that feeling was amazing for me. I couldn't get that feeling without failing; failure makes success important and valued. So if we always succeed, then success will be meaningless. In my opinion, going from 100% to 100% is not as good as going from 13.8% to 100%.\n\nMy country is different; everyone knows everyone's grade. So students compare themselves to others and bring negative feelings. But in this environment, grades are private, and teachers just want us to be smarter than them, so failure is not a big deal; failure becomes less fearful and less embarrassing.\n\nSome people don't agree with this statement in different situations. Every time we fail, we get experience and pain, but sometimes we get only pain with little experience. If we can only do something once in a lifetime and fail, we can't do it again. It's painful when failure goes up, and the price of success goes up, pain goes up, experimentation goes up, and enthusiasm goes down. So sometimes people want to stay away from failure. Or in the case of a criminal crime, if he fails, he goes to jail, and when he comes out, he knows that success comes from going from failure to failure without losing enthusiasm. But his enthusiasm is so strong that he dares to try again and fails again. This statement means different things to different people.\n\nIn conclusion, Winston Churchill was right. Every time we fail, we learn something new and take one step closer to success. But that success is truly success only with people who are helping others and making the world better."}

They'll still get the same amount of study time as before. On the other hand, a four-day school week would mean more work each day. If we had that schedule, we wouldn't have time for school activities or homework. The time and space would be too tight.

They don't want to wake up early to go to school the next day.\n\nAnother reason is that students need to pay their bills. They need to buy things, pay for food and rent. If they don't pay their bills, they won't achieve their goals or have a peaceful life. They need to work to pay for what they need.\n\nThe final reason is that some students support their families back in their countries. They send them money and help them financially. The more money they make, the better it is for their families. We are a diverse group of students, and each of us has different reasons and goals.\n\nAs you read, everyone thinks differently and has different reasons. When we know our responsibilities, our effort, and our situation, we will realize that some of us need a chance to succeed in our own way. Our families will be proud of us. Then, our society will be better, and the world will be a better place to live."}

When we want to achieve something, we often face big obstacles. But that doesn't mean we should give up on our dreams.\n\nFailure is tough, but it's a part of life. We need to experience failure to learn from our mistakes and do better next time. When we fail, we can remember what went wrong and try again.\n\nIf we get a second chance, we should be confident in what we're doing because we've learned from our mistakes. As they say, we learn from our mistakes. Failure is like a punishment when we act too quickly without thinking. That's why we need to think before we act.\n\nI remember when I was trying to learn how to skate five years ago. My parents warned me it was dangerous, but I didn't listen. I got hurt, and my ankle was broken. My father told me, 'I told you it was dangerous. You should have listened to my advice.' But I learned from my mistake. I got back up, and I kept trying. I realized that if I wanted to be successful, I couldn't let failure stop me.\n\nThe most important thing is to never give up and keep working hard. Failures are just obstacles that we need to overcome. We should never throw in the towel because life is about persevering, no matter how tough it gets. We should never be shy and never look back. We should make the most of the opportunities we get because they might not come again. And finally, we should never rush through life because it's not about who gets there first, but about who does things the right way."}
{"text_id_kaggle": "6AC5C9BCE8D1", "output_essay": "Winston Churchill once said, 'Success is going from failure to failure without losing enthusiasm.' Some people think success is about doing good things. They believe that if you fail, you're not good enough. But I think failure without losing enthusiasm is the key to success. You learn from mistakes, get what you want, and become a better person.\n\nOne reason is that when you fail, you learn from your mistakes. You figure out what went wrong and how to do better next time. If you're smart, you learn from your bad decisions and gain from them. We all make mistakes, but we can learn from them. So, don't be sad if you fail; you'll always learn something.\n\nAnother reason is that if you don't give up, you'll get what you want. There will be people who tell you to quit, but don't listen. Keep fighting for what you want. When you finally get it, you'll see that failure isn't a barrier to success. You might face tough obstacles, but if you really want something, don't give up easily.\n\nThe final reason is that you'll become a better person if you keep fighting for your dreams. If you don't let failure win, you'll be a better person. You'll show others that giving up isn't an option. Everything good you do will lead you to success.\n\nAs you can see, failure isn't a barrier to getting what you want. When we realize that giving up isn't an option, we'll see the results of our hard work. Then, our society will be a better place, and we'll have many people fighting for their dreams and learning that failure is just an obstacle, not a reason to give up."}

There's a debate about whether schools should have a four-day week, with longer days, to save natural resources. Some people think this won't make a big difference, but I believe it's a great idea because we'll save resources, have more free time, and have extra time for homework.\n\nFirst, we'll save resources. If we take one day off, we'll save a lot of water by the end of the year. We'll also save energy and food. This will save us money.\n\nIn addition, students will have three days off. Some students work after school, so they'll get more rest and do better in school. They can hang out with friends, reduce their stress, and feel more energetic.\n\nFinally, students will have more time for homework. With an extra day off, they can get ahead with their schoolwork. Sometimes, students can't finish their assignments on time because they don't have enough time. With this extra day, they'll have more time to do their homework.\n\nIn conclusion, having a four-day school week is a great idea because we'll save resources, have more free time, and have extra time for homework. There's no downside to having one more day off. This will help us think about the changes we need to make to be a responsible society."}

Success can happen in many ways, but they all have one thing in common: failure helps us succeed.\n\nOne reason I agree is that when you fail many times, you learn what doesn't work. For example, President Abraham Lincoln didn't get elected at first. He failed twice before becoming president. When he failed, he changed his approach. He learned to connect with people's dreams and ideas.\n\nSuccess comes from failure. I know this from my own experience. I was on the wrestling team, and I failed many times in practice. But I learned from my mistakes. I practiced every move my partners used against me. I got better slowly, but I still didn't win at first. I kept practicing, and eventually, I became the best in my weight class.\n\nThis is why I agree with Churchill. I believe failure leads to success. Failure is always part of the process, and we shouldn't be ashamed of it."}

Some students work full-time and don't have time for more study. My friend, for example, takes online classes at home. He's been in the program for over two years and is still struggling. The class time is two hours, and if he doesn't understand, nobody explains it to him afterwards. He also pays $500 for one semester, and classes are held only two days a week. These programs take a long time.\n\nIn school, students can access classes, get teacher attention, and work on writing. If they don't understand, teachers can help them one-on-one.

In schools and colleges, there are work programs available. Students can study and work in the same place. They can make their own schedules for work. First, they finish their classes, and then they can work. Schools also have social workers who can help with whatever students need. In my area, there are many programs that help students through the school.\n\nIn conclusion, it's better for students to take classes in school. They can access evening programs, extra benefits, teacher guidance, work opportunities, volunteering, and college recommendations. These are not available in online school."}

Finally, students who have trouble getting to school will also benefit.\n\nSome parents think their kids need to be in school and have the same experience as other students. They think schools should find another way to help these students. \n\nI think this idea will really help students with health problems. For example, my sister had trouble with her legs and it was hard for her to come to school every day. If this program had existed four years ago, it would have helped her a lot. Students with health issues at my school were very happy when they heard about the program. My friend, who gets sick easily, was thrilled when he heard the news. He said, 'I can't believe our school thought of me and other students with disabilities.'\n\nStudents with responsibilities will also benefit. They can get a job and finish high school at the same time. They can help their families by paying some bills. Finally, they can stay in school and it won't affect their plans for college.\n\nStudents who have trouble getting to school will also benefit. Some students live too far away and it's hard for them to come to school. Others use Uber and it's very expensive.

{"text_id_kaggle": "A9A92BCA4B7D", "output_essay": "Failures Are Part of Success\n\nWinston Churchill, a former British Prime Minister, said that success is about going from failure to failure without losing enthusiasm. Failure plays a big role in achieving success. A successful person's life is full of failures, but they don't lose enthusiasm. Being determined helps people not lose enthusiasm, even when they face failures. To reach a goal, you have to keep trying, even when you fail.\n\nFirst, failures are necessary for success. You can't be successful without making mistakes. Everyone has dreams, and everyone wants to achieve their dreams, but it's impossible to do so without making mistakes. For example, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was a leader in the Civil Rights movement. He faced many challenges, but he didn't give up. He kept fighting for his rights, and eventually, he became a successful leader.\n\nSecond, every successful person has failures, but they don't lose enthusiasm. Having the power to stay enthusiastic, even when things don't go as planned, helps people achieve success. A successful life is built on many failures, but it's the enthusiasm that keeps people going. For example, Gabriela Douglas was the first gymnast to win a gold medal in the United States. She had many setbacks, but she didn't give up. She kept working hard and eventually achieved her goal.\n\nThird, being determined helps people not lose enthusiasm when they fail. Having a strong character makes people strong in the face of failure. Many people think that being successful means not giving up, even when you fail. It's true that failures can make people lose enthusiasm, but it's not impossible to stay enthusiastic. To repeat Churchill's quote, success is about going from failure to failure without losing enthusiasm.\n\nIn conclusion, Churchill's quote is inspiring and true. Failure is a part of achieving success. It's possible to stay enthusiastic, even when things don't go as planned. Being determined is the key to success. Success is about trying again and again, without losing enthusiasm."}

Others think that failure makes people lose interest. I strongly believe that success comes from not giving up, even when you fail.\n\nFirst, failure is not the worst thing. The worst thing is not trying at all. When you fail, you learn to try again and again until you reach your goals. For example, last year I didn't pass my US/VA History test with a score of 399. I was very disappointed, but I didn't give up. I studied hard and tried again. Now I'm glad I didn't give up, because if I had, I would still be taking the class.\n\nTrying your best and working hard are key to being successful. Every successful person works hard to achieve their goals. For instance, my friend is working very hard to build his business. He doesn't sleep much and goes to college during the day. He's almost reached his goal because of his hard work.\n\nMistakes are proof that you're trying. We learn from our mistakes and improve. For example, my classmate was afraid of speaking in public because of her accent. But she tried, and even though she made mistakes, she improved her English. Mistakes help us learn and not make the same mistakes again.\n\nIn conclusion, to be successful, you need to keep trying, even when you fail. Trying is better than not trying at all. You can achieve your goals if you work hard and don't give up. Mistakes are an important part of learning and improving. Don't let fear control your mind, and learn from your mistakes."}

However, it's also easier to cheat by copying answers from Google or others.\n\nUsually, students who take online classes are those who only need one or two more classes to graduate.

{"text_id_kaggle": "3CDE1D9E6E57", "output_essay": "One topic that people often discuss is whether schools should offer online learning as an option to help their students. Some parents might not like the idea of their kids staying at home to learn, but I think students should have this option. Let me explain why. Students learn at different speeds, they often wonder if they should go to school or stay home, and not all students need the same classes.\n\nThe first reason I think online learning is helpful is that students learn at different speeds. Some need more time to finish an assignment than others. I grew up in a place where teachers didn't check if we understood the lesson or needed help. They just kept moving forward, which hurt my grades. Having one-on-one lessons with teachers through a computer screen can be a great experience for students.\n\nThe second reason I think online learning is good for students is that they often wake up tired and wonder if they should go to school or stay home. Missing a whole day of school can hold them back from getting an education. I have a friend who stays home instead of coming to school because he feels no one helps him there. But when he takes classes online, he finishes all his work and has time to start on the next lesson. Online classes are helpful for students who find school difficult.\n\nThe third reason I think students should have online learning as an option is that not all students can take the classes they need to graduate at their school. Some students shouldn't have to take all the basic classes if they're not necessary. If a student wants to be an architect, they should mainly take classes for that. Online classes also give students time to think and explore more learning options.\n\nAs you've read, I believe students should have the option of online learning because it helps them focus, finish their work, and continue their education."}
{"text_id_kaggle": "EE1CEEADB315", "output_essay": "Some high schools require students to take a music, drama, or art class to graduate. But students should not be forced to take classes they don't want to take. If there are too many graduation requirements, fewer students will graduate. To get an advanced diploma, students need over 24 credits. It's already hard to get all these credits, and adding extra classes may cause students to quit. Students already have a lot of homework, and some classes require hours of work after school. This can lead to lower grades and less time for jobs. Some classes are also expensive. They require fees or materials that students need to buy. For example, a photography class can cost around $200 for a camera. Other classes can cost over $1,000 for things like dresses, travel, and food. Forcing students to take extra electives won't help because it can lead to lower graduation rates, more homework, and high costs. While some electives can be useful for future careers, forcing students to take classes that aren't relevant to their future won't help them.

Staying home to learn sounds great because you don't have to get up early, get dressed, or deal with other students' drama.\n\nLearning at home can be a comfortable way to learn. Some students choose this option because they are pregnant, move around a lot, or have anxiety that makes it hard to talk to peers and teachers at school. For me, going to school is not a good idea. I wish I could take online school or have video conferences with a teacher. My anxiety makes it hard for me to learn at school because I feel like people are always judging me or talking about me.\n\nSocializing with people I don't know triggers my anxiety and makes me feel bad. That's why I've never asked my parents to put me in online school. I have supportive friends, and it's my last year of high school, so I know I can do it.\n\nI've noticed that distractions can stop students from learning. There are distractions everywhere, but there are more at school. Students' drama is the worst because rumors and gossip can affect a student's learning environment. In my sophomore year, a friend had a bad experience. A new student joined our class, and my friend had to show him around. Later, some girls said mean things to my friend, and she went home crying. She started online school to avoid distractions and focus on her studies. I think that was the best option for her.\n\nIt's often hard to understand the teacher in a big class. Having a video conference with a teacher one-on-one can really help your learning. With these reasons and experiences, I think online schooling or video conferencing is a good idea for some students."}

It's not the same as being in class, but at least you won't fall behind. When you return to class, you'll be caught up with everyone else.\n\nSome students might need their parents' help with online classes. Since there's no teacher to supervise, it's easy to get distracted. So, parents should be involved too. Before each online class, take away distractions like phones and give them back when the class is over.\n\nI like online classes, but they're not for everyone. People learn in different ways. Some need one-on-one help, while others can learn by reading. It depends on the student. I think online classes are great for when you can't make it to school. You can just go online and catch up on the lesson. I think this would help some kids, and it's a good thing."}
{"text_id_kaggle": "C31019435CBC", "output_essay": "Winston Churchill said, 'Success is about going from failure to failure without losing enthusiasm.' I agree with him. If you give up after failing once, you'll never get what you want. Many people today give up on their dreams because they're afraid of failing again. But if you keep trying, you have to believe in yourself. Nothing is easy, and if you want something, you need to fight for it.\n\nIf you want to be someone in life and have a good future, you need to think about what you need to do to achieve your dreams. You need to find ways to make it happen. If your plans don't work out, try again in a different way. You need to believe in yourself and your abilities. I know people who gave up because they couldn't do it the first time. They didn't want to look at their mistakes, so they moved on. But they're not doing what they wanted to do.\n\nPeople who never give up usually succeed. It doesn't matter how hard it gets; they just keep going. For example, my sister took her driving test and didn't pass the first time. She was mad, but she kept studying and passed the next time. She was happy because she didn't give up. Sometimes, all you need is motivation. If you motivate yourself or someone else does, you can succeed.\n\nIn my opinion, failing is a lesson we need to learn. When something goes wrong, we can't just give up. We need to keep trying and not make the same mistake again. Life is hard, but that doesn't mean we can give up. This country gives us many opportunities to succeed if we work hard. We have many choices in life, and we can choose to succeed or fail.\n\nLife is like a game; we play it how we want to. We need to decide if we want to win or lose. We need to find a way to succeed without giving up. If we lose, we need to try again until we win. When we have a goal, we need to find a way to achieve it and not fail because we believe in ourselves.\n\nIn conclusion, never giving up, even if you've failed many times, will make you successful. If you keep trying, you'll eventually achieve your goal. If you've failed once, you can try again and not make the same mistake. People who never give up are more likely to succeed than those who give up easily."}

This means some people fight without a reason, some don't know why they fight, and others die for their country. These people want to protect and save their nation. Enthusiasm means never giving up. Everyone makes choices in life. Enthusiasm shows what you want, what your goals are, and why you fight. People with a purpose never surrender. People with different goals have different lives.\n\nI agree that failure is important to achieve success. Failure helps us do better next time. Everyone fails because nothing is perfect. We can't be perfect like gods, but we can fix our mistakes. We learn and try to do better. Churchill, the Prime Minister of Britain, made many mistakes, but he stayed positive. His country was enthusiastic, and he never gave up. Some people are like him, but others don't change.\n\nBefore winning at school or a game, you usually fail first. But if you have encouragement like Churchill, you'll probably win.\n\nIn conclusion, you can make a difference if you have a purpose in life. Don't give up; try to achieve your goals with enthusiasm and sacrifice. Everyone has their own thoughts, knowledge, and future plans. So, if you want something, remember you like it, and try to achieve it like a professional."}
{"text_id_kaggle": "5270E6F7CE23", "output_essay": "Imagine taking classes that help you achieve your future goals. You can do this by choosing your classes wisely and avoiding extra classes that may not be helpful. Art is one class that should not be required in schools. There are other classes that can give you more information and ideas about what you like or what you're interested in. Students should take art as an elective class, and there are three reasons why.\n\nFirst, not all students like art or are interested in it. Some students prefer challenging classes like Sociology or Languages, which can help them think or work harder. When students challenge themselves, they can feel more successful in their lives. For example, in my senior year, I took hard classes like AP Chemistry and Pre-Calculus, which made me work hard and reach my goal. Students want to improve themselves in something that makes them feel proud. Art may not help students improve themselves, because each student has a different goal. By making art required, it means you're limiting students' goals. Art should be an elective class, so students can choose what they're good at and what they think they'll succeed in.\n\nSecond, it depends on the student's future career. Students should take classes related to their future goals. By making art required, it means limiting students' choices and not letting them take what they need. For example, in ninth grade, my school forced me to take art, without asking if I liked it or if it was related to my future career. I felt like I was wasting my time and effort in art class, while I could have used that time for something I liked or something more beneficial. Students should take art as an elective class, so they can choose what classes will help them reach their successful future.\n\nLastly, most students don't like school because they feel it gives them extra work they don't need, like Art. However, if the school gives them the freedom to choose, students will make the right choices about what makes them enjoy and be successful at the same time. For example, when I was in seventh grade, I didn't like school because I didn't have any right to choose any elective. That made me hate school and see all my classes as hard. Students need some time and rest so they can continue and keep going. Students should choose what they want, not just what the school wants. That way, students feel more free and like school. Art is not something important that students have to take, but the important thing is the student and how to make them feel comfortable to make them a successful person.\n\nSome people might say students should be required to take a class in the arts, because they think art is everywhere and they'll need it in everything. However, art can be secondary in life. Sometimes art won't help you reach your life goal; students should have the right to choose what classes will really help them later and make their minds grow. Students should take art as an elective class, not by making it required in schools, so students can do what they like and might be more successful in the future."}

The problem with this idea is that we would have to work for ten hours straight, which is not good for our minds and bodies. Let me explain why. Normally, people can work until they get tired, but if they work too much, they can get very stressed or even have a breakdown. This can lead to anxiety and even death. Working long hours can also make our bodies weak and slow because we don't get enough sleep. We might fall asleep anywhere and not pay attention to our work, which can cause accidents. Some people work at night, and they won't be happy with this idea. It affects all kinds of jobs, not just hard or easy ones. Working long hours can also make us unhappy and affect our emotions. We might feel angry, stressed, or sad, and there won't be room for happiness. Imagine working for ten hours a day and then trying to be happy on your days off - it's not easy. Having a three-day break doesn't help because we'll still be tired, stressed, and worried. When we're in a bad mood, it's hard to be happy again. So, working only four days a week and having three days off is not a good idea. It's better to keep our normal schedule of 7-8 hours of work and five days a week, with two days off. This way, we can keep our minds and bodies healthy."}

Some people think that having a four-day school week with longer classes would be helpful. However, this would be stressful for students because they would have to stay in class for a longer time, which would disturb them.\n\nOn the other hand, some people think that a three-day weekend would be better than a two-day weekend. This is because students would have more time to study for tests or quizzes. The extra time in class would help students learn more, get better grades, and understand the lesson better. They could also get help from friends on class projects. Some people think that having more time with friends would be fun.\n\nHowever, this idea has a problem. On weekends, students do not want to study at all. They want to hang out with friends or family. The extra two hours in class would be too much, causing stress and emotional pressure. Students might not want to pay attention in class or listen to teachers. They can always get help from friends at home, so they do not need to stay at school.\n\nIt is also important to remember that spending time with family is more important than spending time with friends. Family will always support their children, not friends. So, family should be the priority. Having a four-day school week is not necessary because the extra two hours in class would be stressful and tiring.\n\nIn conclusion, staying in class for a longer time would make students feel anxious and disturbed. One solution could be to have a four-day school week, but without the extra two hours in class. This would reduce pressure on students. Many schools already have extra time, such as cougar time or lion time, which could be cancelled to give students more free time."}

If we add two hours to the school day, there are good and bad points. One bad point is that students will not learn much. They might sleep in class or get grumpy because they are too tired. If they sleep or don't do their work, many will fail their tests. One good point is that we would have three days off. But that's the only good thing. We wouldn't really save energy or resources because we would use the same amount. If we add two hours to the school day, we would need to eat three meals in one day, which is like eating for five days. We would waste a lot of energy because we would have to work harder to prepare three meals in four days. Adding two hours to the school day is not worth it. Our current school schedule is better because it's more efficient and saves more energy than adding two hours. Preparing food for meals would be hard, and we would also have to pay the staff who serve the food. That's why I don't agree with adding two hours to the school day. There's not much benefit to it. My conclusion is that adding two hours to the school day is a waste of time and money. It would also make students do poorly, and only a few would graduate.

I think the weekend should be three days long. I believe we all go to work or school for eight hours every day. Adding more hours does not change anything for us. I think our school should follow this model by making the school day two hours longer.\n\nThe first reason is to make the work environment more creative and successful. We need to focus on our work to reach our goals easily. We need more time to do our jobs. We will have more time to spend with family and friends. For example, I am a student at Wakefield High School and I also have a part-time job. My weekly schedule is very busy. I do not have enough time to study.\n\nThe second reason is to improve social life in our society. Life in the United States is often busy. We do not have time to spend with our neighbors. I believe this model helps us. For instance, there are times when I cannot see my family for a week. This is a big challenge for many families. I think making the school day two hours longer has more advantages for all of us.\n\nSome people think that adding two hours is too much. For example, it is too much work for someone who already works ten hours a day. But we will have three full days to rest. I prefer to have a longer day and get three days off on the weekend. It saves energy and resources.\n\nIn conclusion, Arlington Public School should follow this model by making the school day two hours longer. Considering the benefits of a four-day school week can solve many problems we face today. Many people are stressed, and some even die from mental health issues. I strongly agree with having four days of school. I believe it will solve many problems. This shows that this model is needed in our school system."}

In the future, kids might only want to talk to people online, not in person. Online classes can be unreliable too. Sometimes the connection doesn't work, and if you get disconnected during a lesson, you might not be able to get back online. The whole lesson will be wasted. Going to a real class has more benefits than staring at a computer screen. Talking to other students can help those who are shy or have trouble communicating. Interacting with the teacher is also good for students. They can ask questions, get help with problems, and get to know the teacher by talking about sports or the lesson. Teaching classes at home can be a waste of time and money for both the teacher and the student. Some students might choose online classes, but they might not learn anything or might ignore the classes altogether.

Schools might save gas for buses, but they can't save electricity. If they add two hours to each day, they'll use more electricity, not less.\n\nSecond, long school days can be frustrating for students. Not everyone can focus for a long time, so longer days might not be a good idea. For example, I used to attend school for four hours and thirty minutes in my country, and when I came to the United States, the longer school days were hard for me to adjust to.\n\nFinally, students need time for activities outside of school. Many students like to participate in sports, clubs, and community service, which take a lot of time. With ten-hour school days, students will have less time for these activities, making them harder to do.

Students will be prepared for the future, but they won't spend enough time with their family.\n\nImagine being a parent who can't see your child. How would you feel? How would your relationship with your child be? Would you want your children to spend more time at school? If not, then it wouldn't feel good not to see your child, not to have family time, not to play and go out with your child. You shouldn't agree with extending school hours. But if you're a parent who wants your child to spend more time at school, then it would be good for your student. They would spend ten hours at school and have a better education.\n\nIn my opinion, having a four-day school week with ten-hour days is not a good idea because I have a job and a baby to take care of. But for those who love school, they should stay longer and work more on their education. They will have good benefits like learning more and being able to do their work without problems. Students will be stressed about having too much work, but think about it: choose what's better for your children."}
{"text_id_kaggle": "38A9AEE19B1D", "output_essay": "Have you ever given up after failing at something? Winston Churchill, a former British Prime Minister, said, 'Success is about going from one failure to another without losing enthusiasm.' I agree with him. Losing doesn't feel good, but it can make you try harder and push yourself to do your best. Many athletes, musicians, and actors failed at some point, but they didn't give up. \n\nFirst, everything happens for a reason. Losing can motivate people to do better. For example, when I was younger, my soccer team didn't win a trophy, but we practiced every day to win the next year. We did win the trophy the following year. I think failure is good because I learn from my mistakes.\n\nSecond, not everyone succeeds on their first try. Many athletes, musicians, and actors failed before they became successful. For example, I failed 11th grade, but I didn't give up. With my teachers' help, I passed all my classes. Now I'm a senior, and I'm committed to graduating no matter what.\n\nThird, I always say that after a bad storm, a rainbow will appear. Many people lose hope and give up after they fail. They need to be patient. Patience is key to success, and effort is important too. You need to put in the effort to achieve your goals.\n\nIn conclusion, I think failure is good, even though many people give up. Those who use failure as motivation will succeed because they learn from their mistakes. Failure makes you try harder and push yourself to do your best. Many athletes, musicians, and actors failed at some point, but they didn't give up. A storm is always followed by a rainbow. These are the reasons why I think failure plays a significant role in achieving success."}
{"text_id_kaggle": "03FDC60BE33B", "output_essay": "Most students prefer taking online classes. In the last five years, over three thousand students have graduated from online classes. Online classes have many benefits. Students learn in a quiet environment, gain computer skills, and develop self-responsibility. They can stay at home instead of going to the bus stop. Many students have part-time jobs and work late at night, so they can sleep and attend online classes. They can take their time to finish their work and assignments. Some students don't feel comfortable at school, so online classes are the best option for them.\n\nFirstly, online classes provide a peaceful and safe environment. Many students prefer studying at home or in private places to focus on their work. They won't be distracted by others. Students who take online classes and work independently usually get good grades and stay healthy. A quiet environment helps you work harder towards your goals. It's easier to find information quickly. Many successful people work in private and peaceful environments.\n\nNext, online classes help students learn computer skills. Most jobs require computer skills, so it's better to learn online. Computers are very helpful in our lives. Taking online classes helps you work on a computer and get better results. Computers are the most useful tool for online classes. They help you work faster and find the information you need. Some people think students shouldn't take online classes because they won't learn about other cultures. However, computers can provide all the information you need. Online classes also help you pass your classes, improve your computer skills, and connect with the world.\n\nLastly, online classes teach students to work independently, learn quickly, and focus strongly. It's important for students to be able to work alone and learn how to work. Online classes require independent work. If you work independently, you'll learn faster than others. Working alone helps you remember your lessons quickly. Students who work independently usually get the highest scores. In every course, teachers require independent work, which makes life easier for students. Working independently is a good idea and helps you achieve your goals.\n\nIn conclusion, online classes are the best option offered by schools, and they're very helpful for students. They give you the freedom to take your time. Online classes help you learn more, improve your technology skills, and work towards your goals. Many people take online classes to graduate and become doctors or engineers. Online classes might take less time than regular school classes. If you work independently, you can figure out anything easily. Online classes have positive effects on students."}

{"text_id_kaggle": "BD994514CE6C", "output_essay": "Do online or video conferencing have benefits for long-distance students? Some people think that online classes are not good because it's hard to focus on a device for an hour or more. Most students get sleepy when they watch long videos, and they can easily cheat. However, I believe that online classes are a great way to learn because they save time and money, reduce dropout rates, reduce illiteracy, and are good for adults and students who have babies or jobs.\n\nOne good example is reducing dropout rates. I have a friend who went to Northern Community College. She was a good student. When her mom got sick, she had to take care of her and her younger brothers. She missed three classes and couldn't catch up. She tried to explain to her professor, but he didn't listen. She had to drop out of college and work.\n\nOnline classes also save time and money. For example, my sister's college is three hours away from our home. Our dad doesn't want us to live away from home, even for college. So, she has to drive six hours round trip every three days. She doesn't like driving, but she has to. If she takes her classes online, she'll save time and money on gas. She'll also work more hours and save. It's also good for the environment because it reduces pollution and traffic.\n\nOnline classes also reduce illiteracy. They're good for adults, like girls who have babies and boys who have to work instead of learning. My mom, for example, had to drop out of college after I was born because she didn't have anyone to take care of me. She's always sorry about that and says that if online classes were available back then, she wouldn't have dropped out.\n\nThat's why online and video classes are a great opportunity for all of us. They save time and money, more students will graduate on time, and adults will get more education. By doing this, we'll progress. All students, whether near or far, with or without babies, can take their classes anywhere and anytime they want."}
{"text_id_kaggle": "91FDC448604B", "output_essay": "Some people lose motivation when they fail repeatedly. However, failure plays a crucial role in achieving success. It makes you stronger, more persistent, and helps you avoid mistakes.\n\nFirstly, failure makes you stronger because it teaches you to keep going even in tough times. For example, when my dog died two years ago, I was devastated. I didn't want to go to school or talk to people. But with my girlfriend's help, I felt better and became strong enough to face reality.\n\nAnother reason is persistence. When you fail, you learn from your mistakes and become more determined to achieve your goals. In 8th grade, I was failing some classes, and my parents had to talk to my teachers. So, I sought help and succeeded with the teachers' guidance.\n\nFailure also helps you avoid making the same mistakes again. For instance, soccer players train hard to succeed. If they get injured due to a mistake, they learn from it and prevent it from happening again. Cristiano Ronaldo, a famous soccer player, once got injured and took two weeks to recover. When he returned to the field, he was fully prepared and scored two goals against Juventus.\n\nIn conclusion, failing makes you stronger, more persistent, and helps you avoid mistakes, leading to success."}

Instead of doing their work, they text or listen to music. They don't finish their work because they're too busy with their phones. Third, using phones in class can make students disrespect their teachers. When teachers are talking, some students don't listen. They text their friends instead.\n\nSome schools think cell phones are only for educational purposes, but they should also think about the bad things that can happen when students use phones in class.\n\nIn conclusion, using cell phones in class has many negative effects.

You may face many tough obstacles and fail at first. People may think you're a failure, but you can prove them wrong. The question is, are you ready to keep trying or will you give up?\n\nFailure happens often in our lives, at school, work, and home. We're afraid of failure because we don't want others to see us as losers. But that's not true. When you try to achieve something big, you risk falling short and feeling embarrassed. Don't let it get to you.\n\nFailure is a crucial part of achieving success, but only if you have the right mindset. Failure isn't the end; it offers valuable lessons to help you reach your goals.\n\nPeople like Albert Einstein and Walt Disney, who are remembered for their success, didn't succeed at first. They faced great depression due to failing many times. Einstein couldn't speak English well when he was young and was expelled from school. Walt Disney's ideas were stolen, and he faced many lawsuits. They could have given up, but they found the strength to try again. Because they didn't give up, they're now famous around the world.\n\nSome people might say that Churchill's approach to failure and success is unrealistic. When you work hard and fail, it's natural to feel disappointed. But the important thing is to acknowledge your feelings, learn from your mistakes, and try again with renewed enthusiasm.\n\nOverall, failure can help us improve and overcome challenges to achieve success.

If there's bad weather, some people might have dropped out and don't have time. They should have online classes for extra help, and it could lead to a better future.\n\nOne reason is that we have long snow days and other weather problems. Online classes could give us time to work at our own pace and not feel rushed. It could help students who don't have time for school because of work or other issues. If a student has to leave town for a family emergency, they can do online work and ask their teachers for help online. This way, they can get one-on-one help and catch up.\n\nSome people need online classes if they miss a credit and need it before graduation. They can take the class online and catch up on time.

They think it's a good way to find information on a topic in class. However, I think cell phones are a distraction because students use them to play games and watch entertainment like Netflix and YouTube.\n\nStudents who want to use their cell phones in school have their reasons. They say they need them to catch up on missed work or in case of an emergency. But I think students take their cell phones for granted and use them to play games.\n\nMany students have lost focus in school and focus on games instead. For example, a game called Fortnite is very popular, and kids are obsessed with it. When students are bored, they get distracted and stop paying attention. Teachers get frustrated when students play games on their phones during class. As a result, students don't do their homework and don't get enough sleep.

They don't pay attention to what's going on in class.\n\nIn conclusion, I think cell phones are a distraction for students in class and at home.

I don't think my school should do this. If we extend the day, students will have less time with their families, less time for homework, and less time for school activities.\n\nStudents need time with their families. Family is important because parents teach us values and show us that family is essential in life. I want to spend time with my grandmother who is visiting from El Salvador. If school is longer, I won't have time to visit her and have good conversations. She will leave soon, and I'll be late from school. My mom works late, so she can't take me to see my grandma. I have to help my mom with bills, so I work on weekends.\n\nHomework is also important for good grades and to practice what we learn in class. If we come home late, we won't have enough time for homework. When I get home, I need to eat, rest, and help my mom with chores. I'm tired and stressed because I'm a senior and have a lot to think about. After all that, I have to do my homework, and it's already bedtime.\n\nAdditionally, students won't have time for school activities. Many students are athletes and love to play sports. If school is longer, it will be too late for them to practice. They need time to practice to get better, as my grandmother says, \"practice makes perfect.\" Some parents don't want their kids out too late at night, so practices will start and end late. This means students will be home late at night.\n\nOthers may think that extending the day is a good idea because we'll have more time to learn in class and more time on weekends to study. But this is not true. We can ask questions and get help from teachers on another day. Most students work on weekends, so they don't have time to study anyway.

It's good that we learn new things every day, and school is a great place to learn, practice, and make friends.\n\nThe downside is that our school days will be very long, leaving us little time for anything else. We'll have to go to school or work, come home, and do our chores. This will be our routine for four days, but at least it's only four days.

Some people ask, 'Should my school follow this model by adding two hours to the school day?' Like some companies, they think schools should do the same.\n\nIn my opinion, as a student, conserving energy and resources is important. There are many advantages. One is that energy is essential for us. With energy, we have light, and without light, most people can't work or go to school. Dedicating time to this has more advantages than disadvantages. One disadvantage is that people who work four hours a week might get paid less. But they show they care about energy conservation and saving resources.\n\nIf students add two hours to their four-day week, they will lose learning time. It's like workers who get paid less. But if students add just two hours a week, they will learn more. Students should support this and follow what some factories do, because it's for our own good. Students can do this on Saturday mornings. They can make signs with pictures showing how we save energy. There are many ways we, as students, can help.\n\nWe need to tell people how to save energy. Sometimes we leave the TV on when no one is watching. If we turn it off, we'll save a little more. Our bill won't be too high either. Same thing, sometimes we leave the light on when we're not home. That's wasting energy, but people don't notice. Working together is better than working alone. We think more and are more creative.\n\nAnyone can help conserve energy and resources. When we know it's for our own comfort, we should do something. One day, we'll regret not doing something to save these two important things. We need to think about doing something useful for our community, not just locally, but globally, because it's for our own good. We should always conserve the things that benefit us."}

In my school, we have A day and B day, with four classes each day. We need five days of school to fit in all our classes. Many kids need to learn in classes so they can read, write, and do math. This helps them get good jobs like management or construction. Science classes are also important, so they can become doctors or engineers. History classes help them understand the past and future, and get good jobs in government. Language arts classes help them become English teachers.\n\nThe USA is one of the best countries for people to succeed. It has a strong economy and gives opportunities to everyone who goes to school and studies hard. They get good jobs and earn well because they study and work hard. That's why it's better to study. In other countries, they don't have the same opportunities because they don't have the same economy or rights. Some countries don't have schools, and kids don't learn. They just work and may not get good jobs because they can't read or write. That's why it's better to have five days of school and six hours a day.\n\nIt's better to study five days a week and six hours a day to get good jobs than not to study and get bad jobs.

When we fail, we should try to figure out what went wrong and do better next time. Every failure is a lesson we can learn from. We might feel disappointed, but we can do better next time.\n\nSecond, we need to believe in ourselves. Failure is just a setback, but it's a chance to learn and do better. We need to have faith in what we're doing and believe we can do it.

This also makes teaching easier for teachers.\n\nSome schools, like universities and colleges, have created online learning programs. This means students can attend classes from home using their phones, tablets, or computers. This program is helpful for students who live far from school, don't want to drive for hours, or have jobs. It's also for those who want to try new things.\n\nStudents can benefit from online school in some ways. They can choose their own schedule and take classes at any time. Also, many colleges and careers are expensive, so online programs can save money and reduce debt. However, this program requires students to be self-disciplined and responsible. They don't need to travel to school, and they can study at home.\n\nBut online programs also have some downsides. Students need to be aware of these before applying. For example, they won't have as much face-to-face interaction with teachers and classmates. They'll need to be responsible for their own learning. There may be issues with accreditation, and students may get distracted at home. It's essential to remember that students need to take their education seriously.\n\nOnline programs have improved the way we learn, but it's up to each student to keep trying hard and update their skills every day.

Some people think these devices are dangerous, but I believe they are only a problem when people don't know how to use them properly. When used responsibly, they can be very helpful tools. Many people think that having cellphones in the classroom is a big issue because they can distract students. I don't agree with this. I think cellphones can be very helpful in the classroom if students use them only for classwork. Cellphones can support students in many situations and make things easy and quick. It all depends on how students use them. Many schools allow students to use their phones under the supervision of teachers.\n\nStudents often bring their cellphones to school without permission, even middle school students have them in their pockets. This shows that schools can't stop students from using their phones during school time. Schools need to think about how to make this work to their advantage. Cellphones are powerful tools, and everyone agrees on this. However, most young people can't control themselves when using them.\n\nIf schools allow phone use, it can be a big benefit for both teachers and students. Students can search for information on the internet about the topic they're studying in class. There are many helpful websites on the internet. If students don't understand something in class, they can look for online teachers who can explain it in different ways. Students can also search for videos or images.\n\nSome students don't do their homework, and one reason is that they're bored or forget to do it. Teachers can make homework more interesting by creating online assignments or a creative website where students can complete their homework. If a student misses a day of school, this website can help them catch up. Many students have jobs after school and get tired of doing homework late at night. Teachers can help by posting links to the information students need to complete their homework. This can be an easy way for students to complete their homework. Sometimes, students miss school days, and with a school website, teachers can post everything they did in class, helping students not to miss anything.\n\nStudents can focus better when using their cellphones. Teachers can use this to improve the class by making online assignments with videos and pictures to explain the topic. Students can join in with their cellphones. Social media is popular among teenagers, and many teachers create group discussions on Twitter or Instagram. Students can share their ideas or information with each other by commenting. They can also share pictures and videos about the class, which can be great for shy students. The use of social media in class can be difficult because students can get distracted easily, but teachers can create an app to monitor what students are doing and interact with them.\n\nIn conclusion, students can use their phones as a support in the classroom because cellphones can be very powerful and helpful tools. Students just need to use their cellphones responsibly. Schools should think differently because everything is now technology-based, and we can use it to our advantage.

Some students have never tried them before and don't know what they're like. If the school requires them, students might learn more and gain new knowledge.

Adding two hours will make it harder for students to handle their responsibilities outside of school, such as babysitting, work, or sports. This will leave them with little time for their schoolwork. They will feel stressed about not completing homework or not being able to practice on time, which can cause them to fail.\n\nAnother reason I don't like this idea is the four-day week. Most students don't fully understand what they learn in class and may need help remembering it. With a four-day week, they might forget what they learned over the weekend. Many students also plan their weekends with friends or family.\n\nMy final reason is that parents worry about leaving their kids home alone while they're at work. This will cause parents to worry about their kids' safety and wellbeing. Adding two hours to the school day will also confuse the schedule for students and parents. For example, it will be hard to plan birthday celebrations or prioritize schoolwork over social life. This can cause students to fail.

If you fail, try again and again until you get it right. When you're chasing your dreams, you'll make mistakes, but that's okay. You can fix those mistakes and try again. Don't give up just because you fail. Keep trying until you succeed.\n\nSecond, having enthusiasm for what you do is important. It's better to try something you love, even if you fail, than to do something you don't care about. Your dreams are big, but your enthusiasm can be even bigger. Don't let fear of failure stop you. Keep working towards your dreams, even when things get tough.\n\nIn conclusion, don't give up on your dreams, even if you fail many times. Keep going, keep trying, and keep doing what you love. Having enthusiasm makes all the difference. It helps you enjoy the process and trust yourself more. You may think you're going to fail, but don't let that stop you. You could win in the end, and that means you didn't fail at all."}

Many people have different opinions on this topic. Today, we will explore why arts classes should be required and how they can benefit everyone.\n\nFirst, arts are becoming a recognized career path, not just a hobby. Many people make a living from their arts skills. We enjoy movies, which are a form of art that tells stories through actors and settings. Music is another form of art that expresses thoughts and feelings in a poetic way.\n\nSecond, arts have driven technological advancements. Without arts, we wouldn't have historic buildings like the Holy Chapel. Our ancestors invented fire, which helped them survive. Many achievements are thanks to arts. Arts have been around for decades and are admired by many.\n\nIn conclusion, arts have helped us progress and will always be important. Arts are not going away, so why not encourage our creative side? Many smart people struggle to express their artistic side. Arts are part of our world, so why not let people embrace them?"}

To be successful, you need to work hard and never give up. I know this from my own experience. I used to wake up at 5:30 am, get ready for school, and take the bus. After school, I worked eight hours at Chick-fil-A. Then, I went home to get ready for the next day. My mom always said, 'All your hard work will pay off one day.'\n\nShowing the world what you can do is the best thing you can do. You need to be yourself and not care what others think. For example, people thought I couldn't learn English in less than a year. But I challenged myself, and with the help of my family and teachers, I did it. Now, I'm a member of the National Honor Society and I'm graduating early from high school. Don't give up and keep fighting.\n\nBeing thankful is important. We should thank those who offer distance learning as an option. They are changing students' lives.

Imagine if you didn't have a computer at home; how would you study? Going to school makes learning more interesting and opens up a new world. Attending classes in person helps students understand lessons better, develop communication skills, and join school clubs.\n\nStudents understand lessons better in class. Sometimes, they don't get what the teacher says, so they ask the teacher or a friend for help. Subjects like Chemistry, Culinary, Welding, Art, and Fashion Marketing need hands-on practice in class. For example, in a Fashion Marketing class, students are asked to buy fabric and sew a garment as a project. They can do this project better with the teacher's help in class rather than at home.\n\nNot only do students understand lessons better, but they also learn to communicate with others. When students interact with others, they learn how to relate and react to people around them, building good relationships and teaching them to work with others.\n\nStudents also get to join different school activities and clubs, such as Soccer, Basketball, Volleyball, Key Club, Science and Maths Club, Art Club, Dance Club, and Drama Club.\n\nIn school, students become more active, build good relationships, understand their studies better, learn to communicate with others, and engage in activities that help them in the future.

It helps students understand what they're learning, but it can waste time and be expensive, and students can do more research.\n\nFirst, learning from home or through online or video conferencing helps students understand what they're learning. When students learn online, they can get more information about what they're learning and ask questions about what they don't understand. For example, many people, especially teenagers, feel shy asking questions in public. Online or video conferencing helps students ask questions and understand what they're learning.\n\nHowever, learning from home or through online or video conferencing can waste time and be expensive. Many students have jobs, so they can't take classes. These students have to use distance learning to improve their grades.

SpaceX, a company with no experience in building rockets, started with a simple idea: to make space travel available to more people. However, a big project requires a lot of effort and dedication. SpaceX faced many problems at the start; the main problem was how to land a rocket again to use it in future missions. They failed many times, losing millions of dollars, and nobody believed they could do it. Today, SpaceX is one of the most successful companies, earning millions of dollars by sending satellites to space. Failure plays a big role in achieving success; without failure, we cannot learn from our mistakes. Failure helps us stay enthusiastic and try to complete our goals, and it's essential for innovation.\n\nEveryone wants to be successful, but many people are afraid of failing. They think that if they try and fail, they will lose something. But if they never fail, they will never be successful. Failure is a chance to learn from our mistakes and correct them. For example, I had to build a rocket for my science class. I couldn't find a way to make it work, and I was nervous because the presentation day was near. So, I made a prototype to see what could go wrong and find the best way to make the rocket. The prototype failed; it couldn't even take off. I made several mistakes in my prototype that I fixed in my final project. On the presentation day, everything was perfect because I learned from my failure and fixed my mistakes. Learning from failure and fixing our mistakes is the key to success.\n\nSometimes enthusiasm is what drives us to do things. When someone is enthusiastic about something, they can try even if they fail. Enthusiasm can make people work harder for what they want, and failure can motivate them to keep trying until they succeed. Innovation happens every day - new phones, new cars; it's all part of innovation. Companies innovate to stay ahead of others, and some companies fail. But sometimes this failure is not bad because it helps them understand what they were doing wrong and create new services or products. For example, a farmer who only grows corn during summer might fail when the demand for corn goes down. But he can use this failure to come up with a new idea, like building chicken houses and providing chicken to big companies. This way, the farm can earn more money and be more stable. Keeping innovating, even if we fail, is the best way to succeed.\n\nFailure is something we will face for most of our lives. The only thing we can do is learn from it. If we keep trying, stay enthusiastic, and keep innovating, failure can help us achieve our goals. Failure gives us experiences we will never forget and helps us react better to future problems."}

Success doesn't come easily or quickly.\n\nWhen people fail, they often think, 'Why did this happen to me?' But failure isn't as bad as people think. An old man once said, 'You learn more from your failures and mistakes.' I believe that's true. When someone makes a mistake, they should try to fix it and do better next time. That's how people can start to see success in their lives, even with small things.\n\nThere was a man who lived in a city called the Lost City. He was homeless, had no family, job, or food. He had lost everything and his wife had left him. He was very sad and tried to kill himself, but he couldn't. One day, he thought, 'How can I become successful?' He saw many plastic bottles on the street and thought he could create something amazing with them. He started to pick up the bottles, despite what others said. He created toys with an old knife and the plastic bottles. In one week, he made three animals: a cow, a horse, and a duck. He went to a toy store to sell them, but the owner rejected him. He didn't give up and tried to make better toys. Two weeks later, he went to other stores, but they also rejected him. Finally, he went to one more store, and a businessman asked him how much he wanted for his toys. The man was happy and said, 'Five dollars each.' The businessman agreed to buy them and asked him to make more. From that day, the man's life changed. He started to create many toys, and they became more beautiful every day.\n\nThe businessman gave him money to buy materials, machines, and trucks to transport the toys. Finally, the man became rich. But before all these good things happened, he had to suffer and fail many times. This man is a big example because he never gave up and tried his best until he got what he wanted. He had some failures, but that's something that happens before success comes to us.\n\nEnthusiasm is the last thing a person can lose. Without enthusiasm, all things are lost too. Enthusiasm is the energy people need when they're pursuing something in their lives. Failures teach us what not to do next time, and that helps us get what we really want in our lives."}

My Spanish teacher, Mr. Generic, told us how hard it was for him to learn English when he was in school. He didn't have cell phones back then, and the dictionaries his school gave him weren't helpful. He had to ask his teacher for help, but that didn't always work. When he became a teacher, he worked with other teachers and the principal to let students use their cell phones in class when they needed to. He said, 'Everyone is smart in their own way, but with great tools, it can make a big difference.'\n\nAnother reason some schools allow students to use their cell phones in class is that they help us find the information we need, and they're free. In my classes, we're often allowed to use our cell phones to look up important information. Most of the time, students prefer to read on their phones because it's easier. The problem is that not all schools can provide books, and when students lose or damage them, it's a big problem.\n\nMy third reason is that cell phones help us learn important things and learn faster. Years ago, famous writers wrote about their research, stories, and beliefs. Technology has made it easier for us to access that information, first in books and now on the internet. Cell phones are a great tool that helps us learn new things quickly.\n\nSome people might say that technology has made education worse, but I think using cell phones in class is a good idea. We just need to use them wisely and not waste time playing games. We can have fun with our phones, but when it's time to learn, we should take advantage of the opportunity.\n\nIn conclusion, cell phones are a great tool for learning, and using them wisely can make a big difference.

One of the disadvantages is that I don't have much time for myself, but it's fine because I just need to finish school. After that, I need to work and help my family in my country. If it's not necessary to add two hours to the school day, some students who work don't need the extra hours in school. In my opinion, all students should prepare to graduate early and get a good job for the future. They need to finish school and college, and they also need to work to get many opportunities. It's not easy, but it's not impossible either. If you want to have a good life, you need to start working towards it now. If you have a job and you're studying, you might not see the importance now, but you will tomorrow. The problems you face are just a small part of what you can achieve in the future. You need to know what you want to achieve and work towards it."}
{"text_id_kaggle": "62C69450FE7E", "output_essay": "I think my school should conserve energy and resources. This would help both adults and teenagers. As a teenager, I have responsibilities like cleaning, taking care of my siblings, and working to help my family. Everyone has responsibilities, and taking one day off from work or school won't hurt anyone. We can use that day to catch up on sleep or schoolwork. Having a four-day school and workweek would make a big difference.\n\nI wouldn't mind staying at school for two extra hours. We could learn more about things we don't understand, and catch up on missing work. This would benefit everyone if we learn to use the time wisely.\n\nSome teenagers have two jobs, like me. I would be very happy if we only had to work and go to school for four days. Many of us don't have the energy to do five days in a row and need a day to rest. With an extra day off, we would wake up with more energy and be in a good mood.\n\nMany teenagers have chores like cleaning, doing laundry, and taking care of their siblings. We have a lot of responsibilities outside of work and school, and not many people understand that.\n\nSome people might not like the idea of working or going to school for four days and staying two extra hours. Everyone has a different opinion, and some people prefer their normal schedule. Not everyone would love the change as much as I would.\n\nI believe we should have four days of work and school, with each day being ten hours long. This would benefit everyone, especially me, in many ways."}

{"text_id_kaggle": "46A763F7D942", "output_essay": "Everyone needs to work hard to achieve their goals, whether it's a job or studying for school. We also need breaks at certain times in our lives to reach our goals. I strongly believe that schools should extend the school day by two hours, which would be a great idea because it can provide us with a better lifestyle.\n\nOn the one hand, extending the school day is a good idea because it can help people avoid stress during the school day. For example, when I was in my country, my school had a very busy schedule, and many of my classmates got sick due to too much homework and tests. Most of them got depressed, and some even had health problems like weight loss. Some of them gave up because they were too depressed and had too much work to do.\n\nOn the other hand, if students have more free time, we will have better grades. For example, I was a student at Tecnologico de Monterrey in Mexico, and I had to be at school a lot, even after school. Sometimes I had to go to counseling, and I had to do a lot of things. At the end of the semester, I usually forgot everything. I even lost my scholarship once. That's why I believe that having an extra free day is great for students like me. When I came to this country, I had more free time, and I realized that having extra time helps me be successful. My grades went up last year, and I was even on the honor roll the whole year.\n\nMany of us have families, and we need to spend time with our parents. Family is very important in people's lives. We should be thankful to our parents because they always do everything for us. That's why we need more time for them. For example, I often want to play or be with my father or siblings, but I have to do homework or study for tests. This year is a challenge for me because I have to take five SOL's tests, my admission test in November in my country, and my senior project. I would like to have a free extra day to be with my parents, siblings, and do all my things. My family is everything to me.\n\nI believe that having two extra hours each day during school would be like coming to school five times a week. For example, if I go to school for six hours every day for five days, the result would be thirty hours in total. If I add two more hours each day, except Fridays, I would get thirty-two hours in total. I think it's fair to have more hours of school because as a reward, I will have four free days and not just three. I will have more time to relax, and I will get better grades at school.\n\nFinally, my school should follow this model by extending the school day because it's helpful for everyone, even for adults. Breaks are great in many ways, and everyone deserves to have free time for their parents who have been a huge support for us. We deserve free time to avoid stress and be healthy. We need free time to get good grades and get a scholarship for college. All of these points will help us have energy and resources to have a better lifestyle. Having more extra hours in less days during a week is better than doing everything with stress. As my final thought, we are humans, not robots; we need breaks, and we have needs to serve as family, for example, and in the future, we will see how we improve in our lives."}
{"text_id_kaggle": "BC4212B1546A", "output_essay": "Winston Churchill, the British Prime Minister, once said that 'success is about going from one failure to another without losing enthusiasm.' I believe that failure is important in our personal and social lives. People who are successful in their jobs have more experience in their work and personal lives, and they have done well in school.\n\nFirst, we all have bad experiences with our families or friends. For example, a family might make a decision for their son, but the son might not like it and make another bad choice, leading to problems and failure. This can help him think about making better decisions in the future. Bad experiences and failures, including a good education, are necessary.\n\nIn school, many students fail tests or classes. Some students don't like to learn or study, which leads to failure. But others use failure as motivation and keep trying. People who are successful today, like good presidents, doctors, engineers, and lawyers, have all made bad choices and failed, but they didn't give up.\n\nFinally, people have more success in their jobs. They might face failures due to bad decisions or situations. For example, Barack Obama, the former President of the United States, made tough decisions and faced problems. When he started his election campaign, he faced failures because of his race or attacks, but he didn't give up and eventually became the President, helping people. Although he made some bad decisions, he made more good ones later.\n\nSome people disagree with Churchill's statement. They think that people who fail will keep failing and making bad choices, hurting themselves or their country. But I believe that failure is important in our lives; it helps us succeed in our jobs, gain experience, and do well in school.\n\nIn conclusion, Churchill's statement is true: failure is important in our lives. It helps us make good choices and have a better future. As a result, we have excellent workers and people today."}
{"text_id_kaggle": "288B3DD0D4F9", "output_essay": "I'm happy to share my thoughts about the four-day school week. Like many things, it has its good and bad points. I'd like to discuss some of my ideas about this issue.\n\nFirst, I think the four-day school week is a good idea because it gives us more time at home to do our homework and other school work. If we have four days of school, we need to make the most of our classes. This means we have more time to practice at home and finish our work. For me, it's important to have a clear mind and do what needs to be done. With three days off, we can relax and have plenty of time to finish our homework.\n\nAnother good thing about the four-day school week is that we can study more for tests and prepare better. This means we can get higher grades and have a better chance of passing. \n\nHowever, there are also some bad points to consider. If we have four days of school, we have to stay in school for longer hours. This can make us more tired. Some students have part-time jobs and get tired easily. Teachers also get stressed because they have a lot of work to do in a short time. This can be very tiring for both students and teachers.\n\nIn conclusion, whether the four-day school week is good or bad, it's up to us to organize our lives and make the most of our time. If we have a dream, we need to find a way to make it happen, no matter what schedule we have. We can still have a better future if we work hard and stay focused."}

If they're in school for ten hours, they won't have time to play games, sports, or do their homework. They'll also be too tired to sleep well, which can make them sick. Students need time to rest and refresh their minds.\n\nSome students have jobs after school, and extending the school day by two hours will cause them to lose their jobs. These students work to save money for college or to help their families. If they lose their jobs, they'll struggle to survive. Extending the school day will make it hard for them to balance work and school.\n\nStudents also need time to spend with their families. If school extends the day by two hours, some students won't have time to see their parents, who might work on weekends. Students will be too tired to do anything except sleep when they get home. They need time to spend with their families to refresh their minds and stay happy.\n\nIn conclusion, school should not extend the day by two hours. Students need time to do their homework, work, and spend time with their families. Extending the school day will cause problems for students and make them unhappy."}

This makes them want to try harder next time. They can show they care about something.\n\nFor example, many kids like playing video games. They get their parents to buy it for them. When they first play, they don't know how, so they fail. That's okay. After a while, they learn and start to be good at the game.\n\nThe same thing happens with teenagers and adults. When they start a new job, they don't know what to do. They fail until someone trains them. Then they start to get it right and become good at their job. Like when I started my job, I didn't know what to do. My coworkers trained me, and I became good at my job.\n\nEveryone fails, and that's okay. Not everyone is good at what they do. But they have people to help them be good at what they do.\n\nExamples of this are high school, college, the military, and the government.\n\nI chose these because teachers in high school help students be successful. Some students go to college and study what their teachers taught them. Others work in the government. Some students don't go to college, so they might fail and not get jobs. They might even become criminals. Others get regular jobs or join the military. Before they do, they need training so they don't mess up and fail. Everyone makes mistakes.

Using phones in class can also affect students' grades. Some students can control their phone use, but others might find it distracting. Not all parents allow their kids to have phones, so it could be stressful for teachers to manage. If we allow phones in class, we need to set rules for each student.

Some of them want to keep learning, so they use distance learning offered by some schools. This allows them to attend classes from home through online or video conferencing.\n\nFor example, consider teenagers who become parents at 17 or 18. Most are in high school, but they can't attend school due to pregnancy or parenthood. Distance learning helps them balance parenting and studying from home. Another example is seniors with few classes but full-time jobs. They can focus on their jobs and take online classes. This way, they can work, earn money, attend classes from home, and achieve the same result as other students.\n\nStudents benefit from attending classes from home by having time for extracurricular activities, such as babysitting, sports, or hobbies. Many students want to do these activities, but school gets in the way.\n\nTeenagers who become parents early often feel frustrated about not being able to attend school. This can lead to problems at home and worries about not finishing high school. Distance learning is a big help for these students.\n\nThe same applies to seniors. Many 12th graders prefer online classes over traditional school. They attend school for a few classes and then leave for work or other activities. Distance learning gives them flexibility in their daily lives.\n\nMost students enjoy staying home and doing what they like instead of going to school. That's why some choose online classes, so they can have time for activities they enjoy, such as sports, jobs, or hobbies.\n\nIn conclusion, distance learning can save many students' futures. They can do things outside of school, solve problems at home, get a job, and continue their education. Most importantly, they can succeed in life thanks to distance learning."}

Some people don't agree with Churchill's idea that failure is important for achieving a goal, but most people think that not giving up is key to success.

When we fail, we learn to make better decisions.\n\nIf we keep trying despite many failures, it shows we're focused on our goal. Staying enthusiastic about our goal gives us a better chance of success.\n\nAnother reason is that success is not perfect without failure.

If you finish early, you can spend time with family and friends or sleep. You can do it if you try your best and take your time.\n\nOn the other hand, I think it's a bad idea because some students might be lazy and not do their work. When working at home, we might rather sleep all day. We might forget we have work to do or get distracted. We might turn in our work late, and it won't count for full credit.

My sister couldn't enter high school when we moved to this country, so she took online classes. She did all her homework online and is still doing it. Now, she can speak and understand English very well, and she has time for other things like work, going to the store, and visiting her family.\n\nIf I have the chance to attend university in the future, I will take it.

My friend also took online classes, and he said it helped him because he could work and study at the same time. He takes an exam every semester to check his progress, and if he doesn't pass, he can take it again.

However, when schools let students use their cell phones in class, it often ends with kids not doing their work and failing assignments. This can cause problems in many classrooms, as some students don't have phones or disturb others who are working.\n\nMany students at school don't have electronic devices, making it harder for them to learn at the same rate as others. If schools use cell phones frequently, students without phones might get different results than those using phones for projects. It can also be a big distraction, as students often don't do their work and instead look at social media, watch videos, or do other unrelated things.\n\nOn the other hand, using cell phones in class can help kids get comfortable with technology. In college, you often have to do online classwork, so you need to know how to use technology properly. In high schools, teachers often let students use cell phones for educational purposes. It's easier for teachers to get students' attention and help them understand lessons online. Students can get assignments via email and do classwork online. Teachers can also use electronic devices to get most students interested in class.\n\nAnother reason students should be allowed to use cell phones in class is that many students come from different countries and may not understand the language. This can make it hard for them to keep up with the class. Schools often let teachers use apps like Google Translate to help these students understand and not fall behind.\n\nIn conclusion, using cell phones in class can be very helpful for many students.

Every time we fail, we learn something new and get more reasons to keep going. We also gain more experience.\n\nSome people believe that if you fail once, you'll always fail. They think that people who fail don't think big and will never succeed. But I don't agree. The main reason failing can lead to success is that we learn from our mistakes. I know many people who are trying to make their dreams come true. At some point, they think they'll never make it, no matter how hard they try. But they don't give up. I'm one of those people. I've failed many times in my life. When I was 16, I had a baby, and it was hard for me to attend school. Many times, I didn't have anyone to take care of my son while I was in school. That's why I'm in my 6th year of high school. But quitting school was not an option because one of my goals is to graduate. I've learned a lot more than I thought I would.\n\nAnother reason failing is important is that we gain experience and can be good examples for our kids and others. My cousin has a friend who wanted to fix his car by himself. He kept trying until he finally fixed it. Now he's the best mechanic in the city. This shows how much we can learn from our own failures. I think most people don't learn from others' examples because we need to have our own failures to learn and become what we want to be.\n\nIn conclusion, we can fail without losing hope. When we fail and learn from our mistakes, it gives us the energy to try again. Failing once or twice doesn't mean it's the end of the world. If we're alive, we have time to try again and be successful. I think everyone fails in life because life is about failing and getting back up again. It's like a game; you have to practice to be good.

Students have the right to take these classes, but they don't have to if they don't want to. They can choose other elective classes instead.\n\nThere are reasons why students take elective classes. First, they need to fill their schedule. After they finish their main classes like math, science, and history, they need to take electives. These classes help them learn new things. In music class, they can learn to play an instrument or sing correctly. In art class, they can learn to draw and color in different ways.\n\nSecond, elective classes help with their GPA and high school diploma. Students get to choose their electives, not their counselor. This way, they can pick classes they like and will attend. Some electives can even lead to future careers, like computer information.\n\nThird, elective classes are a way for students to have fun and relax. They can take classes they enjoy and make memories. I took elective classes in my last year of high school, and I had fun because I liked them.

This is because not all students will do their work if they need to get good grades. However, it's a good option for students who can't come to school or study at home. They can still complete their education with all the necessary classes. It depends on the students who want to take online classes. I think it's more effective when a teacher explains the class in person, and you can understand everything better.\n\nBut not all students can come to school every day. Some need to work and support themselves. If they can take online classes, that's better for them. They can learn and watch video conferencing online, and finish school from home. However, I think students should have the final say in whether to take online classes or not. I think it's better to come to school and take classes with teachers. When we have problems or questions, teachers can explain and help us understand more.\n\nFor example, I have a friend who comes to school every day. He does all his work and learns more because he doesn't have a job. He has time to study and get good grades, and he can focus on school. But if he gets a job, he'll be tired most days and won't be able to focus on school.\n\nAnother example is me. If I could change my classes to online, I wouldn't want to. I don't like school much, and I need to work to support myself. I don't come to school often because of this. I also find the language difficult, but I try to improve every day. This is my last year, so I'm doing my best to make it better. I don't want to take online classes. I think teachers are there to help and do their best for all students.\n\nIn conclusion, I think students should decide if they want to take online classes or not. I think it's better for all students to come to school and take classes with teachers. This way, teachers can help students learn more, and we can focus and do a better job every day. We can get more education this way."}

You can lose and try again if you still have enthusiasm. But if you lose and also lose your enthusiasm, you can't do anything. My grandmother always told me that what matters most is trying again, no matter how many times I fail. If you try again many times, you can turn failure into success.\n\nI want to say that you don't have to win to be a winner, and you don't have to lose to be a loser. For example, if I don't pass this test again, I'll be someone who fails again, but that doesn't mean I've lost my enthusiasm for passing and graduating this year.\n\nIf most people always win, they'll be comfortable and won't try to improve. That means the world won't make progress because people will only do what they know, and they won't try new things. Losing can be good because it makes us try harder. For example, technology keeps getting better because we keep trying.\n\nSuccess is about keeping enthusiasm even when we fail many times. If not, we wouldn't have all the things we have today, like TVs, cars, computers, and food. Do you think farmers give up just because they lose some of their crops? The people who created things in the past didn't give up when their first try didn't work out. That's why failure is a big part of achieving success."}

I think it's a good idea for some schools to use cell phones in the classroom. Many students don't have computers, so they can use their phones in math class or make videos for projects in English class.\n\nReason 1: Cell phones have been a problem in schools. Students often use their phones during class until they get caught by the teacher. Teachers don't like this because it's disrespectful. But teachers allow students to use their phones when they don't have a computer or haven't gotten one yet. For example, students can use their phones to play Kahoot or Quizzes in class.\n\nReason 2: Cell phones are a great tool for learning. Some schools have math classes or tech centers that use math to measure things. Many math teachers don't have enough calculators for each student. So students have to use their phones to do math problems.\n\nFinal reason, English classes sometimes use cell phones. For example, my English teacher told us to do a project on Romeo and Juliet, and we could use our phones to record scenes. My group and I recorded the scene on our phones, which made it easier for us to do. Phones are good to use in English class, but sometimes we can't use them.\n\nIn conclusion, cell phones are great for educational purposes. They help in math class or when participating in activities if your computer isn't working."}

When he was in school, he started a small company with his uncle, but it didn't work out because they didn't have enough experience. So, he tried to figure out what went wrong and learn from his mistake. Four years ago, he got over his bad experience and started again with more knowledge. Now, he's a successful businessman. So, success comes from learning from failure and staying motivated.\n\nFor example, when I was in school in Mexico, I was on a soccer team. I played for my school for three years, practicing with my teammates and coaches. When we got to a big state-level tournament, my school was one of 200 schools competing. We won eight games and made it to the semifinals. We lost the first semifinal game, and my teammates and I were sad. But we learned from our mistake and worked together to win the trophy. The most important thing was to represent my school and make it proud.\n\nAnother example is Raul, a famous singer. In an interview, he said he wanted to be a doctor before he became a singer. He was a good student and worked hard, but he didn't get into college because he didn't study enough. He failed to achieve his dream, but that failure led him to find his talent for singing. He started making music in school and now he's one of the most famous artists.\n\nIn conclusion, some people think failure has nothing to do with success because they believe successful people get there easily. But that's not true. Many famous people and businessmen say in interviews that they failed many times. They learned from their mistakes, got more experience, and found new ways to achieve their success."}

I believe students would benefit from attending classes from home because it would help them stay focused, have more time, and make better choices.\n\nIn a classroom with friends and strangers, it's easy to get distracted and lose focus on assignments. Some students know they can't stay focused, and their minds wander. But others can stay focused no matter what. Working online prevents distractions and gives students time to think about their work. This helps them avoid mistakes and stay on track.\n\nHaving enough time to complete tasks is important. Teachers often give deadlines, which can cause students to rush and make mistakes. Online, students have more time to think deeply about their work and don't feel rushed. They can work at their own pace and concentrate better.\n\nWhen students work alone, they can think about what's best for them. Some prefer to work independently because they know they can't focus around others. Others prefer to work with people. Working alone helps students think deeply about their choices and make better decisions.\n\nIn conclusion, attending classes from home has many benefits, including more time to think, more time to focus, and making better choices. Imagine being in a noisy classroom with 100 students every day - it's clear that working from home is a better option."}

Some people think cell phones are a bad idea because they can be distracting, but they can also be a great tool for learning and communication. Using cell phones in the classroom is a smart idea that can help students.\n\nParagraph 1.\n\nCell phones can be very useful in schools. We use our phones to stay in touch with people, and we can also use them to check our homework and even do our homework. Cell phones can make our education better.\n\nParagraph 2.\n\nUsing cell phones in the classroom can also save the school money. Most students already have smartphones, so the school wouldn't need to buy one for each student. The school could use the money to buy chargers for classrooms or to support extracurricular activities like clubs or sports teams. Some schools use money to buy Chromebooks, which is a good idea.\n\nCounter-argument.\n\nSome people think cell phones can be a distraction in class and make students isolate themselves. If students use their phones too much, they might not interact with others. Also, typing essays on a phone can be harder than on a computer. But there are apps that can help with essays, and phones can be regulated in class to minimize distractions.\n\nConclusion.\n\nSome schools are already using cell phones in classrooms to help students learn. The result of using cell phones in class can be positive because of their advantages. Cell phones are useful in class because they help students communicate, are cheaper and take up less space than computers, and can remind students of important tasks."}

Should my school do the same by adding two hours to each school day?\n\nMany companies have switched to a four-day work week. This is good for some people, but not for others. How would this affect schools around the world if they did the same? In this essay, I will talk about the good and bad points of having a four-day school week, including how it affects school schedules, costs, transportation, and whether it's a good idea.\n\nFirst, having fewer school days can improve attendance. With fewer days to miss, students are more likely to come to school and be more motivated because they have time to rest and prepare. Some students have tried this, and attendance improved by twenty percent in two years.\n\nWith a four-day school week, students have less homework, so they can finish their assignments on time. Teachers also have more time to prepare and organize things before the week starts.\n\nAnother good thing is that teachers have more time to do other work and don't have to work on weekends. Students can also attend other school activities on their day off.\n\nThis can also save a lot of money. The school will use less energy because it's not open for five days.\n\nOverall, I think a four-day school week would be better in the long run. More students would want to come to school, and teachers would be less stressed. I think this is a good idea, and many other students would agree: a four-day school week would make life easier and a better place to learn.\n\nIn conclusion, I think it would be better if students and teachers had a four-day school week. They would have time to do other things and work better. The most important thing is that they can enjoy school."}

So, I strongly disagree with making school and work days ten days long for several reasons.\n\nFirst, I think we will waste more energy than we do now. If we add the hours we waste energy now, it will be more than the four-day work week. This will put more pressure on machines, which can break and cost more money. Also, workers and students will be at work longer, which is tiring.\n\nSecond, students will be in school longer. With the current schedule, students have a hard time managing their time. Some students get lazy in school because of the long day. Adding four more hours will make it harder for them to focus in class, and more students will fail. Instead, we can find other ways to get power.\n\nLast, we need to find other sources of energy. There are many renewable and nonrenewable resources that can help us. For example, clean coal technology can reduce air pollution. We can also use solar cells as an alternative.\n\nFinally, people should try to save energy and resources to make life better. Making school and work days ten days long is not a good solution, but people can find other ways to keep energy. People can be creative and find ways to make their lives easier."}

They might get annoyed and angry from learning and writing all day, and they won't pay attention in class. The teacher will also get angry because the students aren't paying attention.\n\nSecond, students need time to do their homework and rest. They can't participate in sports if they're too tired. They'll be distracted and won't pay attention in class.\n\nNext, students can get tired from being in school for ten hours. They need at least eight hours of sleep, or they might get sick. For example, they might faint if they don't get enough rest.\n\nSome people think students should stay in school for ten hours to save energy and resources, and to learn more. But I don't agree.

Another reason is that it's hard to focus for ten hours straight in class, both for students and teachers.\n\nHaving a four-day school week with ten-hour days could save school resources.

However, I don't think students or staff can focus for ten hours a day.\n\nIf students could get eight to nine hours of sleep, the plan might work. But since many teenagers stay up late and don't get enough sleep, it would probably be a waste of time.

They can also travel to different places and still attend classes online without missing anything. If a student is sick, they can still take the class on their computer by listening to the teacher. There's no need to buy school supplies because everything is online.\n\nStudents also get to spend more time at home, get most of their work done, and focus better. They don't have to worry about waking up early, what to wear, or waiting for the bus. They have more time to organize their thoughts and work. If they have a job, they won't feel tired and will be more productive.\n\nOnline classes can help every student. I think all schools should offer this option. Even universities should have online classes, but it's also important for students to attend university classes in person to learn more.\n\nOne good thing about online classes is that students can talk without being seen, and they won't get teased by others. The teacher can also hear them clearly because there aren't many students in the online class. This can help prevent bad things from happening.\n\nOn the other hand, going to school can be tiring, stressful, or depressing. Students might feel stressed about getting good grades, and some might get bullied. Taking online classes can help students avoid these problems. They can focus on their work and feel comfortable at home.\n\nIn online classes, students don't have to worry about what others think. They can express their opinions freely without feeling shy or insecure.

But there were many reasons that almost made me give up on that dream.\n\nI think failure can lead us to the best things in life. If we don't try, we will never know if it's possible. Failure is not something to be afraid of. It can give us experiences in life that lead to success. These experiences are things that only life can offer us.\n\nFor me, failure is just another chance to try again, but with the same or more enthusiasm. When I started learning to draw or paint, there were many reasons that almost made me give up. One of the main reasons was that I didn't have enough materials. It was hard for me because I didn't have the same opportunities in my country. But I kept trying, and now I'm better at drawing. I have the materials I always wanted, and I'll keep getting better.\n\nI agree with Churchill's statement because we often don't appreciate what we have until it's gone. Failure can lead us to success because it gives us experiences that only life can offer. If we do something wrong, we can't fix the past. But we can learn from our mistakes and try to be better in the future.\n\nWe shouldn't be afraid to try new things in life because nobody was born knowing everything. Life is about doing new things every day and learning from our mistakes. For example, I was afraid to leave my country, but I saw it as an opportunity to see my father for the first time after 18 years. I was scared to fail, but I learned from my mistakes.\n\nThe hardest things in life are often the most worth it. I share Churchill's idea because you have to go through hard times before you succeed.

Even as babies, we tried to walk and failed many times before we finally succeeded. We learn from our mistakes and get better.\n\nIn school, we learn important lessons for life. We learn what to avoid and how to improve. At work, we make mistakes, but we learn from them and try to do better. We don't want to make mistakes, but we need to try and learn from them. The most important thing is to keep trying.\n\nWe're all human, and we make mistakes. But we can do better if we keep trying. You will get good at it if you work hard and never give up.

Many students and teachers have things to do after school. School is a place where students can learn more, but longer hours can be a big problem. Some students have jobs or community service to attend. One reason for adding hours might be to save energy.\n\nA four-day school week is good for students because they have time to do homework at home. However, some students don't like it because they have too much free time. The school wants to add hours so students can study more while saving energy. Saving energy is important for the environment because a clean school is healthy and helps students succeed. Clean air is also important for a healthy environment.\n\nSaving energy also helps our community. For example, in my country, each family uses energy at different times, and we waste a lot of energy. In the U.S., a lot of energy is wasted because people don't save it. The community thinks that saving energy at school or work is the way to go. However, students need to study five days a week to do well.\n\nOn the other hand, schools need students to attend five days a week to study. Students need five days to study, but not everyone likes coming to school. Some students might like a four-day school week, which can help schools and the community. My sister likes to study full-time and have a day off to rest. In many countries, laws are in place to improve student lives and make changes.\n\nIt's important to make changes in our lives because we can feel the differences it makes for us and our future.

I agree with Churchill that we need to fail to learn how to get back up to success. We also need to know how to stay strong in problems, understand how success works, and sometimes show others our own experience of success.\n\nFirst, everyone has problems in life. No matter how small, problems will always affect us. We may feel like giving up, but we can't. Even people who seem to have a good life have had problems. For example, someone who is rich or has a good business may have started from nothing.\n\nNext, success and failure are connected. We can't have success without first experiencing failure. When we achieve something important, it's because we worked hard and overcame many obstacles. Every success we have is because of the problems we faced and overcame.\n\nThird, we can show others that success is possible after failure. When I came to the USA, I didn't speak English, and it was hard for me. But I watched English videos, practiced with friends, and paid attention in class. I learned that success doesn't come easily; we need to work hard to achieve our goals.\n\nIn conclusion, to succeed, we need to experience failure and get back up.

I believe this is not a good idea for my school because some students work after school to help their families. Others play sports or do community service after school.\n\nThe first reason I disagree is that many students, like me, work after school to help their families. If the school day is extended, we won't be able to work and help our families. Even if we have Fridays off, some businesses don't work on Fridays, so we wouldn't be able to work then either. This could force some students to drop out of school to help their families.\n\nThe second reason is that some students play sports after school. If the school day is longer, they won't be able to play sports because it will be too late and dark. For example, if you want to be a professional baseball player, you need to practice regularly. That's why we shouldn't have longer school days.\n\nThe third reason is that some students do community service or attend a study club after school. If the school day is extended, they won't be able to do these activities because it will be too late and dark. If the school hours are extended, there won't be any study clubs after school.\n\nIn conclusion, I think we shouldn't have longer school days so that students who work after school can continue helping their families.

They need a teacher to remind them to focus. At home, there are even more distractions, so it's hard for them to pay attention. It's helpful to have someone to remind them to stay on track.\n\nIf students study from home, it's easier for them to cheat. Many students cheat to get good grades. At home, they can find answers online, so it's hard to know if they're not cheating. It's important to have someone supervise their work to make sure they're not cheating.\n\nAnother problem is that the internet can stop working during an important class or test. It's risky to rely on computers because you never know when they'll work properly. This can cause students to miss important lessons or fail a test.\n\nMany students don't like studying or doing homework.

You learn many things like how to use music materials, hold them, and sing with a group. It's a fun class, and any student can take it. Most schools in the USA have music classes because they're good for students who aren't good at studying but are good at arts. Music class has a lot to do, like learning the music, understanding the words, and practicing at home. You can even take the music materials home for more practice. Many students don't take materials with them; they just practice singing. Then, you'll go on a trip with the music class and sing together.

Many students draw good pictures and sell them for good money, and they give the money to the student, and the student gets more excited to draw more pictures to get money. Then, the student makes more pictures and gets more money. It can be their job; they can be an artist, and they'll make good money.

Arts classes require a lot of practice. They're easy classes, but you just have to practice to make it easier. All the students I know passed it, and they said it's easy. In the end, you'll be good at it, and you can go work and get money, and it helps you use your mind and think a lot. Arts also help students who don't know how to talk with people; it helps them ask questions, talk with people, and make friends. Arts classes can change your life, for example, if you're poor and don't have any money, you can work on some art store or something for arts, and you can get a lot of money, and maybe you'll be rich one day; this is so helpful for many students. I think arts classes are a lot better than electives because they can help you the best, they're easy, they can change your life from bad to good, and they can make you a better person.

When it's time for a test, students will have a hard time because they'll think about their phone and forget what they learned.\n\nIt's better to learn from the teacher because you're actually hearing it. The teacher is the best option if you're struggling. The teacher will make sure everyone understands and will move on. Some online programs can help, but you'll have a better chance of passing if the teacher teaches it. Hearing the information from a person helps you understand it better.\n\nIn conclusion, if we had to choose between the teacher and the phone, the teacher would win. Test scores would be very different. Yes, the phone can give you answers, but you won't remember everything. The phone doesn't review tests with you, but the teacher does. Those are some reasons why cell phones shouldn't be used during class."}

We must believe in ourselves and work hard to achieve our dreams and show others what we can do.\n\nIf we try our best and fail, we can still see success. If we fail once, we should keep trying. The second time might be better. Many people think that if they fail once, they will always fail. When I see someone who thinks like that, I encourage them to keep trying.\n\nSometimes I feel tired, but I never lose my enthusiasm to learn more. If we have enthusiasm, we can help someone who has lost theirs. I can motivate that person to keep trying.\n\nI support my dreams because I want to be successful and make my family proud. I love seeing my family smile, and that motivates me to try my best, get good grades, and pass tests. That's how I stay enthusiastic.\n\nIt also means we can keep going, no matter what others think. We should keep trying our best and be better than others. The best way to try is when we work hard on something we want, with enthusiasm and a clear purpose."}
{"text_id_kaggle": "090CFB3688B7", "output_essay": "Should Art, Drama, and Music Classes be a Requirement or Elective?\n\nShould everyone be required to take music, drama, and art classes? This is a big debate among students. Some students think these classes are great for everyone because they help people think creatively and expand their minds. However, I think there are many reasons why some students don't want to take these classes. For example, some students don't have enough time, others aren't naturally good at these subjects, and some just aren't interested.\n\nThese classes require a lot of effort and dedication from students. Not only do students need to work hard during school, but they also need to practice outside of school. For instance, if a student takes a music class, they need to practice every day to get better at playing their instrument. Unfortunately, this is not possible for many students, especially in high school. Most students have too much work, homework, or family responsibilities to practice every day.\n\nIn addition, students need to have some experience in these subjects. For example, in music class, students should know how to play an instrument, and in art class, they should know how to paint or draw. Personally, I wasn't good at drawing or playing an instrument, and even when I practiced, I didn't get better. Some of my friends were naturally good at these subjects, and they did well without much effort. This made it seem unfair to me.\n\nMany people say that if you want to do something well, you need to do it with passion. While this is true, we can see that many people do things without passion because they have to. In the case of art, music, or drama classes, students need to have at least some interest in the subject. Otherwise, the quality of their work will suffer. I didn't have any interest in these subjects, and I know many other high school students feel the same way.\n\nIn conclusion, art, music, and drama classes are amazing, but they require time, dedication, and effort. While they might be a great option for some students, they can be a problem for many others. Some students don't have the time, and others just aren't interested. For these reasons, I think these subjects should be electives."}
{"text_id_kaggle": "CA07DAA86DBD", "output_essay": "Going to school can be a big challenge for some students. Many teenagers don't get support from their parents and have to find their own way to finish school. They have to drive a long way to get to school, and some of them have kids at a young age and can't finish school because they have to work. Taking classes online or through video conferencing from home would be a big help for many students. They wouldn't have to worry about being late to class or getting stuck in traffic. Giving students an option is a great idea that will help many students.\n\nFirst, many students struggle to get to class on time. They have to drive a long way to school, and they have to find parking on the streets. As a result, they miss part of the class and don't know what will be on the next quiz. Taking classes online will help many of them, and they won't have excuses for not passing the class or not doing their homework. Some students prefer to take classes in school because it's easier for them to learn. However, taking classes from home doesn't work for everyone.\n\nSecond, many teenagers have kids at a young age, and this is one reason why students drop out. My cousin came to the U.S. when she was 16 and started school right away. Two years later, she got pregnant and didn't finish school because she made a bad choice. Now she wants to go back to school, but babysitting is too expensive, and she doesn't get paid much. Seeing this happen to my cousin made me realize that many of us don't have a choice between having kids and finishing school. If the school offers an option for students to take online or video conferencing classes from home, it's a big opportunity for students like my cousin to take a few classes and finish school.\n\nIn conclusion, we can't make excuses for not finishing school because we live far away or have kids. The school is giving us an option. By taking classes online or through video conference, it helps many students finish their classes at any time without being late or missing class. Some students prefer to attend school every day because they learn better in class, while others prefer online classes because it's hard to attend class or concentrate with other students around. I truly believe that everyone is different, and we all learn in different ways."}

If they fail, it will affect their grades.\n\nStudents already have a lot to handle with their regular classes. Adding more required classes would be stressful and frustrating. When I moved to the United States from Morocco, I had to adjust to a new school system. It took time to get used to. That's why schools should not add more required classes. It would make things more complicated, and students might fall behind.\n\nNot graduating on time is a big worry for students. They think about it all the time, and it's a big deal. Some students don't want to be left behind their classmates. If they don't pass all their classes, including music or art, they won't graduate. They'll have to take summer classes or repeat the class until they pass. I think that's a waste of time. That's why music, drama, and art should not be required.\n\nSome students don't like music or art, and they wouldn't choose them even if they had the option.

While music and art are important in our world, I don't think they should be required for school. I'm not saying they're not important, but they're extra classes that can cause problems for students.

I believe talking to a teacher in person is better than through a computer.\n\nStudents need an education to graduate and pursue a career they like.

For education, students study many subjects, including Math, English, Science, and History. They also have the option to take classes in music, drama, and art. These classes are free and help students relax between difficult subjects. I believe students should take at least one or two classes in music, drama, or art. This can help them discover their true selves, and these activities may become a big part of their lives.\n\nNowadays, students are forgetting about music, drama, and art. They only focus on important subjects like Math, English, or Science. But people are not machines; they have imagination and need entertainment. Music, drama, and art provide a place for students to express themselves and relax. After a difficult class, music, drama, or art can make them feel happy and give them more energy to study other subjects. For example, if students listen to soft music after a stressful class, they will feel more relaxed.\n\nIf students only study Math, English, or Science, they may become engineers, doctors, or nurses. They will make a lot of money and help their country, but their lives will be boring. They will only work, eat, and talk to machines. Music, drama, and art can make their lives more exciting. After working hard, they can enjoy music shows or art museums, which will give them more energy and make their lives happier.\n\nMusic, drama, and art classes can also help create talented musicians and artists. They can create amazing shows, movies, and projects that will be remembered for a long time. Many students are good at Math, English, and Science, but they may not know what they truly want to do until they take a music, drama, or art class. They may realize that music, drama, or art are their true passions, not Math, English, or Science.\n\nPeople use music, drama, and art to express themselves and make their lives more exciting. However, these activities can be bad if people use them to hurt others or cause conflict. Music, drama, and art should be used to make people's lives better, not worse.\n\nIn conclusion, students should take at least one or two music, drama, or art classes to help them feel better and discover their true selves. These classes can make their lives more exciting, bring happiness to people, and help them enjoy their lives."}

It means using less energy and resources. \n\nI recently learned that some businesses have a four-day work week with ten-hour days to reduce energy and resource use.\n\nLet's talk about energy. If we add two hours to the school day, we'll use more energy. This is because computers, smartboards, air conditioners, and lights all use energy. If we turn them on, we're using energy. So, adding two hours to the school day is a bad idea if we want to save energy.\n\nNow, let's talk about water. We use a lot of water at school, especially when we go to the bathroom.

Students should get to choose what they want to learn in school, besides the basics like math, English, history, and science.\n\nWhen students get to choose, they learn what they're interested in and get excited. They're happy and motivated because they chose the class themselves. They're more likely to pursue their dreams of being a musician, actor, or artist. When students do a good job, they feel proud. Choosing a class that's related to their future career is a big achievement.\n\nStudents love having the freedom to make choices, especially when it comes to fun classes like art, music, or drama. They feel smart and important when they get to make big decisions. Letting students choose is a right, and not letting them is taking away their freedom.

For example, they can have a video call during lunch or ask their boss for a break. My friend took distance learning and worked from 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. He talked to his boss and got two hours off to take his classes.

Young people get frustrated easily and think they can't do something if they fail. On the other hand, some people believe that you need to go through failure to find success. \n\nIt's clear that failure can get in the way of success, depending on how you think.

In my opinion, these students have more advantages than those who go to a regular school. Regular schools have many students, and teachers don't have time to meet with each student individually. However, online classes are better for students who don't like being around others.\n\nFirstly, many students in regular schools are noisy and distract the class. If we stay at home, we can focus on our work and follow the instructions. Sometimes, teachers stop the class because another student is misbehaving, which is disrespectful to those who want to learn. We want to concentrate on our work. That's why it's better to take classes at home and work in silence.\n\nAdditionally, living outside the city can help our education because we don't have to travel to the city to learn. Most people who live in rural areas are more educated than those who live in cities. In cities, we often hear bad language, and students learn it. But if we stay at home, we can avoid learning bad language. This happens not only in cities but also in schools, because some students copy bad language from singers. They think it's cool, but it's actually harming this generation.\n\nFinally, I prefer to stay at home, help my mom, clean the house, and sleep a lot. Sometimes I feel lazy and just want to sleep. If we take online classes, we can choose our own schedule, wake up late, and learn new things. We can also take breaks whenever we want. In regular schools, we have to wake up early, and sometimes we're late for our first class. At home, we'll never be late, and we won't stress about missing half of the class.\n\nTo conclude, more schools should offer online classes because we can be safe at home. We won't be in danger if someone wants to harm a school. There are many good reasons to study at home, such as learning more, taking classes at our own pace, and doing what we need to do.\n\nStudents will enjoy these programs because they'll have their own time to study and focus on everything without distractions from other students."}
{"text_id_kaggle": "CBFDC3A0F573", "output_essay": "Distance Learning\n\nSome schools offer distance learning, which lets students attend classes from home through online video conferencing. While some students choose this option, the goal of learning is to understand well. This is better achieved when you learn from qualified teachers in a school setting, where they can answer all your questions. But what happens when you learn from home?\n\nFirst, you need to ask questions, which can be a big challenge. For example, you don't have someone to ask immediately, unlike in a classroom. Some people need more than one explanation to understand a topic or exercise. Maybe you need help with a test question, and that's a big problem. However, distance learning can be helpful if you live far away, are sick, or need to work.\n\nSecond, you can cheat on quizzes or tests when learning from home. If students can cheat in a supervised classroom, they can also cheat at home by looking up answers online or asking someone for help. This means you're not learning, and you'll never learn if you cheat. You might get a good grade, but you won't gain any knowledge.\n\nThird, the school assignments can be difficult. You have to read and understand a lot of material on your own, answer questions, and send them to your teacher. Most students struggle with this and don't pass the class. They often say that no one explains the work well, and they don't know what to do when the test comes. You can ask the teacher or look for help online, but it's not the same as having a teacher explain it in person.\n\nFinally, many students have to retake the class, wasting the time they spent on it. They eventually realize the importance of having a teacher's help and not learning from home. Many teachers think distance learning is not a good choice because it's hard and being alone is more difficult. However, I think it's good for people who really can't attend school."}

{"text_id_kaggle": "7C08E5D66D08", "output_essay": "Do people need to fail before they can succeed? Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill said, \"Success is going from failure to failure without losing enthusiasm.\" There are many reasons why people should experience failure before achieving their goals. Failure plays a big role in achieving success. People should fail before they succeed.\n\nOne reason people always fail before they succeed is that nobody does well on their first try. Famous people often fail at first. For example, many famous people were poor before they became famous. They didn't have the money to pay for their careers or college, but they used their talent to achieve their goals without help from others. Failure doesn't mean you're not good at something; it means you need to try again.\n\nThe second reason people always fail before they succeed is that failure makes people angry, so they try harder. Students study more, athletes work harder, and adults take their time. For example, studying, taking time, and working hard are the keys to achieving goals and dreams. The third reason people always fail before they succeed is that athletes become successful because of their hard work. Most athletes were poor as kids. They became famous because of their talent, hard work, and persistence.\n\nSome people think you can succeed without failing. This is not true. Most people achieve their goals because they have experience or practice. If someone does well without failing, it's because they have experience. Everyone fails at first.\n\nCristiano Ronaldo is considered the best soccer player in the world. He was poor as a kid. His father was a coach, and Ronaldo played on that team. He often failed at kicking, passing, and playing his position. But he didn't give up; he kept practicing until he got it right. Today, he plays in the top European league. Failure is the key to success in life."}

But some people don't know which resources are helpful and which ones are harmful. If we use them incorrectly, it can cause big problems.\n\nAlmost all resources are important. They help us build houses and cars, and they create jobs for people who don't have work. They make life better. When we improve energy, we can switch to natural energy like sunlight and wind. This energy will never run out. We can use it for industries and save money. For example, Japan uses natural energy to power its fast trains. Some companies even have a four-day workweek with ten hours a day. This is good because ten hours is enough.\n\nIf we use resources too much, they will eventually run out. For instance, when we cut down trees to make paper and desks, and there are no more trees left. What will people do when a storm comes? If some countries use too much energy, others might not have enough. This is what happened in China when they grew too fast and needed resources to build houses. When resources are gone, they can't build anymore. Some people have to move to another country to survive.\n\nI think a four-day school week is a good idea. Students can learn about energy and resources, which are very important in life. With two more hours a day, I think students will be interested in learning about energy and resources.\n\nI want to learn more about energy and resources. One day, I can become a teacher and teach students about their importance."}

Don't be afraid to use that failure to find a new way to succeed. Without failure, you won't be successful. You have to take risks and try again.\n\nSuccess without failure is not real success. It won't last. You need to learn from your mistakes so you can do better next time. You might know when you'll fail, but you'll feel successful when you get it right. Don't worry about what others say. Don't give up on your dreams. Remember, you're stronger and smarter than you think.\n\nDon't take advice from someone who does things the wrong way. Instead, find someone who can give you good advice and show you how to succeed.\n\nAlways have a backup plan in case things go wrong.\n\nYou can't be successful without losing something first.

{"text_id_kaggle": "E1DDD9115527", "output_essay": "Hello everyone. Today, I want to talk about the downsides of home schooling. One problem with home schooling is that students don't develop important skills like communication, teamwork, and leadership. In a classroom, students learn these skills by working together on projects and solving problems. But with home schooling, students don't get to do this.\n\nWhen students work together, they try to do their best because they see what others can do. For example, when someone tries out for a sports team, they think they're good enough. But when they see how good others are, they want to work harder to be as good as them. This motivates them to push themselves.\n\nWorking in groups is great because students learn from each other and it's less stressful. When a group works on a project, each person has a job and they share their ideas to make it the best it can be. This makes it easier and faster to finish. Working alone is more stressful because the student has to do all the work and might not see all the problems.\n\nEven though some students like to work at home, they know that being in a classroom helps them remember what they learned. It's easy to say that students who work at home won't try as hard because they don't have a deadline. In a classroom, students have a set amount of time to finish their work.\n\nIn conclusion, students who attend classes are more likely to be successful than students who take classes at home. This is because students in a classroom participate in activities, work with others, and learn new ways to solve problems. Students who take classes at home don't develop important skills like communication, teamwork, and leadership because they have to work alone."}

For example, if I have a job now and school gets longer, what will I do with my job?\n\nSome students also have family responsibilities. My uncle works at 3 pm, and I need to help take care of his kids. Many fathers need help with things at home until they get to work. It's not something students can control, and it's often an emergency.\n\nThe schools might not see this because they think students don't do anything at home or don't want to study more. But every family needs something, and sometimes it's important or an emergency.\n\nWe could learn more in two extra hours, but many students already have a lot on their minds. We don't want to stay in school longer because it gets tiring.\n\nWe know we have homework every day, and with two more hours, when will we do it? When I get home, I'm tired and don't want to do anything. I'm sure many students feel the same.\n\nMaybe we should think about what time school ends. For me, it's already late, and many students don't have someone to pick them up. They need to take the bus, which doesn't always go to their doorstep. Some students live in unsafe areas, which is dangerous for them and their parents.\n\nIf something happens to a student after they leave the bus, is it their fault or the school's? It's both, because the school makes them leave late.\n\nIt's not just students; we should think about teachers too. They have lives outside school and want to work or spend time with their families. It's harder for teachers because they need to prepare homework for every class and study every day.\n\nSome businesses have a four-day workweek, but school is not a business. It's a place to learn and have fun. Businesses want to make money, so they don't mind working more hours. But schools are different, and we don't get paid for staying longer.\n\nIf we have to stay longer, we should at least get dinner at school. Food is important, and if we're staying until 5 pm, we need to eat.\n\nWe should decide how many hours we spend in class and what classes we want to spend more time on. Maybe if we can choose, we'll be happy doing things we like.\n\nIf we look at it, there are many disadvantages to extending the school day. I know my opinion might not be the best, but I want to express what I think is important.\n\nIn conclusion, I don't think schools should add two more hours to the day because many students have to work to survive, and many students have family responsibilities. It's too much for students to stay in one place for eight hours, let alone ten. It's also dangerous for students when school ends late. Schools are not businesses, and every decision should be approved by parents or discussed in a meeting. I'm sure parents have more reasons why it's not a good idea to extend the school day."}

However, I believe that attending school in person is better for students. If they choose to attend online classes at home, they will not learn much, they will play video games, and they will not succeed.\n\nThe first reason is that online classes are not as good as traditional classes. Students learn more in a classroom where they can focus on their teachers. For example, when I try to do online work at home, I get stressed and lose focus because there is no teacher to guide me. In school, I learn more because I can ask my teachers for help when I don't understand something.\n\nThe second reason is that students will spend more time playing video games than doing their schoolwork online. For example, when I open my computer, I like to watch videos, play games, or watch movies. This makes it hard for me to focus on my online classes. Online classes are difficult because there are many distractions, and students will not focus on learning. They will not be prepared for the next level of learning. Attending school is different because there are rules and teachers to guide us, and we can't make excuses not to learn.\n\nSome people think that online classes are better because technology can help students find answers and learn more. However, I think this is wrong because it assumes students are not smart enough to learn on their own. Students can succeed by attending school, not by attending online classes at home. Our teachers advise us to study and read books, which teaches us valuable lessons about life, failure, and success. This makes us smarter and helps us achieve our goals.\n\nIn conclusion, attending school is better because students will be prepared for the real world. If students attend online classes at home, they will not want to learn or study. They might think, 'There's no teacher to tell us what to do, so we can do what we want.' This is the sad reality, and I know it's true. That's why students can't benefit from online classes, they will just play video games, and they will not succeed."}

If students are lazy or don't have a way to get to school, why would they bother to attend a video conference and sit in front of a computer for a class? I don't think students would learn well this way. The teacher wouldn't be there to help them, and they could easily cheat on their work. The teacher would be busy with other students, and the students wouldn't get the help they need.\n\nStudents need to learn about education and society. If they don't have this in life after school, it would be hard to improve. They need to know how people can be and how to interact with their teachers. In my country, school is like a second home, and the teacher is like a second mother. They teach you like your parents do.\n\nI once took an online class, and the teacher wasn't always there when I needed help. There were ten people in the class, and it was very distracting. I couldn't listen well to the teacher, and I didn't learn much. I learned more when I was in a classroom with the teacher and other students.\n\nSometimes, students wouldn't attend online classes, and it wasn't just one or two. The calls weren't stressful because there weren't many students, but you can learn better without them. The teacher has more time for you. Students who don't attend classes often don't like how the teacher teaches, but that's a big problem.\n\nI don't think online classes are a good idea because when you go to school, you learn about responsibility and how to improve.

If people live far away from their schools or don't have a way to get there, the government or the school community should find a solution to get those students to school.

But what about students who already work? What about their parents? One disadvantage of this idea is that students won't have time for their activities, and they might not get enough sleep. However, this idea could be good for everyone, including teachers. The school just needs to plan the extra hours better. They could add activity hours to the schedule.

He learned from his mistakes and gained new experiences. For example, he learned how to handle bad situations and how to live on his own. Those bad things helped him become successful and open his eyes to the real world.\n\nFinally, my friend used to only think about himself. He didn't care about the people who loved him or the consequences of using drugs. But one day, he almost died from using drugs. He was in the hospital for two weeks and was in a coma. When he woke up, he was shocked to see all the people who loved him. He said sorry and started crying. In that moment, I saw that my friend was no longer a failure. He had succeeded in changing his ways. A few months later, he was happy and had stopped using drugs.

Some people think it's silly, but they don't know that not succeeding is a lesson in life because you learn from it. You should always think about what you want to achieve and the good things it will bring you. It also depends on your attitude; if you have a good attitude, everything can be good.\n\nFor example, in Mexico, a person who tried to become president for almost 20 or 25 years finally did it. He shows that not succeeding is a step towards your goal. His name is Juan Manuel Lopez Obrador, and he is the new president of Mexico. He never lost enthusiasm and never feared not succeeding. I think that failures are just that - they're not the end of the world. Get up and keep trying because if you don't do something, you're nothing. Life is hard for everyone, not just for you.\n\nIf you pay attention to each failure, you need a miracle in your life. I mean, just let it go because life is about troubles and failures. The problem is if you let those 'failures' affect you. Another example is the soccer player Lionel Messi. When he was a kid, he had health and height problems, but he didn't care about that. He kept playing, and finally, the club F.C. Barcelona paid for his treatment. Today, he is one of the best soccer players in the world and in soccer history.\n\nFailures aren't bad; well, in some situations, yes, but for me, it's learning. It's knowing that the road to your goal isn't easy, but I'm going to get it because I have enthusiasm and a good attitude, and failure isn't in my vocabulary. So, you have the choice - just keep working hard, and in the end, you'll have satisfaction for yourself.\n\nConclusion-\n\nYour achievement will be the result of your failures. It's not too much; the satisfaction or the lesson are the things you learn in life. It doesn't matter how many failures you have, it matters if you can overcome them. Always think positive and stay with a good attitude. Don't let troubles or failures affect you because life can give you many blows, but with your good enthusiasm, you can do whatever you want in this life."}

Online classes can help students in many ways. First, there are fewer distractions. Second, it's quieter. Finally, you have time for personal things. Online classes can benefit students a lot."}

Even if you fail, it's a chance to learn and try again. Michael Jordan, a famous basketball player, said, 'I've missed over 100 game-winning shots, but I learned from my mistakes.' Donald Trump, a successful businessman and former US President, went bankrupt six times, but he didn't give up.\n\nPeople often talk about successful individuals and what made them successful. But what they often forget to mention is the failures they experienced along the way. I grew up in a family of athletes, and we motivated each other to do better. If my older brother could outrun me, I would practice to beat him next time.\n\nYou can't be successful without experiencing failure. Failure doesn't mean you should give up; it means you're learning and getting closer to your goal. Winston Churchill, a former British Prime Minister, lost a war, but he learned from his mistake and later led his country to victory against a powerful enemy.\n\nI didn't grow up in this country, and when I arrived at the age of seven, I didn't speak English. I felt it was very hard, but I was motivated by my desire to learn. I failed many times, but I didn't give up. I knew that if I learned to speak English, my mom and the people who helped me would be proud. Failing made me try harder, and I learned to never give up.\n\nIn life, you will face obstacles that you need to overcome to achieve your goals.

{"text_id_kaggle": "7BCDFDF03FBC", "output_essay": "Over the years, schools have started offering distance learning to improve education. Many colleges in the country offer distance learning, which allows students to attend classes from home through online or video conferencing. This way, they can earn their grades and credits to graduate and be successful. I believe distance learning can greatly benefit students. Top schools like Virginia Commonwealth University, Old Dominion University, and George Mason University offer long-distance education to students in the country and state.\n\nThere are many reasons I think parents and students should consider distance learning. It's not just about studying subjects like Science, Math, or English. Distance learning also teaches students important life skills, like how to live on their own and achieve their goals. It helps students solve their own problems without relying on their parents. With distance learning, students can even get a job to support themselves. It prepares them for their future careers, which often require a lot of hard work and study. Some careers, like Medicine, Engineering, and Architecture, take more than four years to complete. They require a lot of determination to succeed. Virginia has some of the best schools that offer long-distance learning.\n\nSome people might worry about the safety of distance learning due to reports of school shootings and food poisoning. However, parents should know that long-distance institutions are protected by the state police department, which ensures the students' safety. Schools that offer distance learning protect the rights and lives of their students. The police department regularly checks on the students to make sure they're safe. Even during bad weather, students are protected and can continue their classes. Parents should understand the safety measures in place and the benefits of distance learning for their children.\n\nIn the future, distance learning will become even more beneficial and safer for students. Most jobs require students to study and practice a lot to pass and graduate. I encourage all students to try distance learning to explore new things, have a good study environment, and adopt a better way of life."}

Schools should have a four-day week by adding two hours to each school day. This would help save energy and resources, improve academic performance, and give students enough time to do their homework.\n\nSchools use a lot of energy and resources every week. For example, they use a lot of electricity and water. If we have one less day of school, the school will save money on food, transportation, and utilities.\n\nHaving a four-day week would also give teachers and students an extra day to rest. This means less stress about schoolwork. Students will feel more relaxed because they'll have more time to rest at home before coming to school. This helps students do better in school.\n\nHaving an extra day off also means students will have more time to do their homework. Many students say they don't have enough time at home to finish their homework. If this keeps happening, it can hurt their grades. With an extra day, they'll have more time to study and prepare for tests.\n\nSwitching to a four-day school week would make a big difference. It would be good for the school, students, and parents."}
{"text_id_kaggle": "64FA1F7F556F", "output_essay": "When we talk about Winston Churchill, the former British Prime Minister, and his famous phrase 'success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm,' we're talking about how important failure is in achieving success. I agree with his statement for three reasons. First, it shows that being consistent makes us successful. Second, it inspires us to make our dreams come true. Third, it teaches us to be enthusiastic and overcome our problems.\n\nHow does it show that being consistent makes us successful? When you're doing something you like, but others are better at it, what do you do? Do you stop or keep trying to get better every day? For example, if you're on a good soccer team, but the coach doesn't let you play because you're not good enough, you'll feel bad. But if you give up and join a new team, you might play, but you won't be famous. If you stay and keep practicing, you'll become a professional player and be famous.\n\nWhen I say it inspires us to make our dreams come true, I mean that seeing Churchill's successes makes us feel more optimistic and excited. We believe in ourselves and start doing things to become better. For example, if I want to learn how to drive a car but keep failing, I might say I can't do it. But after seeing Churchill's phrase, I got motivated to keep trying, and I learned.\n\nFinally, Churchill's phrase teaches us to be enthusiastic and overcome our problems. Even when we have problems and fail, we can feel like we can't overcome them. But we can by asking for help, talking to friends or parents. For instance, if you have problems in school, tell your parents, change your attitude, and you'll feel better.\n\nIn conclusion, Churchill's phrase helps us in many ways because it makes sense for our problems and questions."}

Many famous people have been successful, but they didn't start that way. They experienced failure and kept trying. For example, Harriet Tubman fought for her rights. She didn't succeed at first, but she didn't give up. She kept trying until African Americans were allowed to sit at the front of the bus. You see, Harriet Tubman wasn't successful at first, but she worked hard and didn't give up. Failure, hard work, and not giving up are key to being successful.\n\nHow can I relate to this quote? One day, I wanted to give up on getting a mountain bike I couldn't afford. I thought of ways to get it. Looking for a job was hard, but I didn't give up. I kept looking and thought, 'I'm going to get that bike.' I found a job, worked hard, and got my paycheck. I was able to buy the bike I wanted. Now I have a way to get to work on time and go anywhere I want.\n\nWhat does Churchill's quote mean? I think he's saying that there are always obstacles on the path to success. Not everything goes as planned. You'll have good and bad days, but you have to keep going. You have to have hope. I keep that message in mind when I want to give up. I tell myself, 'My success stories are stories I'll tell my family and friends.' Think about something you always wanted but couldn't get. If you got it, ask yourself how you did it. It's great to learn from failure. Just keep your head up and hope for the best."}

This can help many students learn and understand better. It can also help students who work on weekends, as they can do their homework on Friday and work calmly on Saturday and Sunday.\n\nFirst, adding two hours to the school day is a good idea because students learn and understand better. For example, students in English 11th at Generic_School got good grades after the school added two hours. They got more involved in the class and understood better. As a result, they got good grades, and the school's average went up. This new method helps students focus more and benefits the school.\n\nSecond, adding two hours to the school day is a good idea because it helps students who work on weekends. For example, my friend Generic_Name, who is 17 and works at 'Brickhouse,' can work comfortably because the school gives him more time. He spends that time working on Saturdays and Sundays and has Friday off to do his homework. As you can see, Generic_Name has enough time to do his activities. This new method benefits students who work on weekends by giving them enough time to complete their homework.\n\nSome people disagree, saying that adding two hours is not a good idea because students will get sleepy in class and teachers who live far away will be affected. They also think it will give students a chance to drop out of school. However, they are wrong because this will help students and schools. It will help students learn and understand better and benefit students who work on weekends.\n\nIn conclusion, adding two hours to the school day has both good and bad points.

Is failure important for success?\n\nToday, we live in a world where we often think that making a mistake is the worst thing that can happen to us. But we don't realize that these mistakes can help us grow and live life to the fullest. That's why wise people like Churchill asked, 'Is failure important for success?'\n\nMany people think that failing at something means we're not good at it, and we regret trying. But I believe we learn from our mistakes, and that makes us better people. We need to see problems as a way to find solutions and challenge ourselves. We're all different, and we have hidden talents. Failure is part of the process.\n\nFailure without losing enthusiasm is the key to success. If we fall down, we need to get back up and try again. I've read about people who failed but got back up and reached their goals. I'm sure Churchill had failures too, and that's why he's telling us how to overcome them.\n\nMany companies want experienced workers because they don't want to deal with new people. But I think these companies should respect new workers and tell them that failure is okay because we learn from it. That's how we can motivate people to keep trying.\n\nWe're not perfect, and every failure is a chance to do better next time. There are many stories about people who grew up in poor places and became successful. It's all about hard work. We have the strength to make a difference in ourselves and society. We just need to be humble and honest with others.\n\nOur parents play a big role in our lives when we're growing up. They can help us learn from our mistakes. For example, if we lose a soccer game, our parents can tell us that it's okay and that we learned something new. We also have friends who can support us.\n\nIn conclusion, failure is not bad. It depends on how we respond to it. We can learn from our mistakes and keep moving forward. We're not alone, and there are people who can help us. We just need to stay enthusiastic and keep trying. Remember, many great discoveries were made because of failures. So don't give up, and always keep pursuing success."}

To allow cellphones in class, students need to show they can control themselves. I think that if students can show self-control, they should be allowed to use their cellphones. But they should only be allowed to use them for listening to music or doing classwork.\n\nFirst, students need to put their cellphones away when they enter the classroom. If they don't, the teacher should take the cellphone away until the end of the class. If the teacher sees that students are showing self-control, they can let them use their cellphones to listen to music during class. But if the class starts misbehaving, the teacher can take that privilege away.\n\nSome students can't focus unless they're listening to music. They should be allowed to listen to music when they're doing independent work. The teacher should check on them to make sure they're doing what they're supposed to. If students are listening to music, they're less likely to talk to each other and get distracted.\n\nIf students are treated like adults, they'll be better prepared for life after school. If students are treated with respect, they should at least be allowed to listen to music. If the teacher and student respect each other, the class will go more smoothly.

To me, success means achieving the goals you set for yourself. It can take many forms, such as wealth, favor, prestige, or recognition. To be successful, you need to make sacrifices and be patient. This makes it harder to stay focused on your goals.\n\nI disagree with the statement for three reasons. Firstly, failing many times wastes money and effort. For example, if you want to become a doctor, you need to pay for college tuition. If you fail your courses, you'll have to pay again, which could be used for something valuable. You'll also have to put in more work.\n\nSecondly, failing repeatedly makes people feel ashamed and shy. When you see your friends succeed, you might feel upset or ashamed if you're not doing well. For instance, if you need to pass a geometry course to graduate, but you keep failing, you'll feel bad when your friends pass and graduate.\n\nLastly, I think the statement is wrong because it can make people lose confidence in their goals. When you lose confidence, you might try desperate measures to achieve your goals. For example, you might rely on superstitions to succeed.\n\nIn short, I disagree with the Former Prime Minister's statement. Success is not just about failing many times without losing enthusiasm.

Others are inspired by their family members, relatives, or inventors and are willing to go through a tough path to reach their goal.\n\nPeople from wealthy families are often inspired by their parents' achievements and want to follow in their footsteps. However, some people from wealthy backgrounds are not motivated to do great things because they were not raised to be leaders. On the other hand, people with good experience and education may not be motivated to achieve great things, but they want to live a comfortable life.\n\nPeople with good experience but poor education are more motivated to pursue their careers despite the challenges. A person with a strong personality can make a positive impact on the world with time, effort, and hard work. Those without a strong personality can learn from their mistakes.\n\nMost people today want to achieve great things, but they are not willing to put in the time, money, and effort required. Taking responsibility for one's actions during difficult times helps in achieving success.

I believe most students will disagree with this method of learning because it's hard to learn without a teacher's help. A student who attended classes from home told me it was difficult because she had to do all the assignments alone, like homework. She said the assignments were well-explained, but it's still better to have a teacher nearby. I've heard many stories of students who failed classes using this method because it's hard to learn and focus at home.\n\nMy friend told me that in 2010, he attended classes at home. He said he passed his classes with good grades, but didn't learn anything. He just searched for answers online, copied and pasted, and sent them to his teacher. At the end, he said he didn't benefit from attending classes at home.\n\nI don't think there are any benefits for students to attend classes at home instead of going to school. For example, I couldn't use this method because I have to take care of my younger siblings when I'm home. There's a student in Generic_School who uses this program. He wrote an essay saying that students weren't benefiting from this method, and many students argued about it. Some said they weren't learning anything on their own, while others said they'd rather take classes at school where there are teachers and time to do their work better.\n\nI believe even some teachers will disagree with this method. A student said it's possible to learn at home, but it's a difficult task, and recommended going to school to pass classes and learn. Of course, some students think attending classes at home will benefit them. Like my cousin, she's smart and has the time to focus on her work, but not all students have that.\n\nAnother student who graduated using this method in 2015 said it was hard to use this method and recommended going to school instead. My teacher told me it's better to go to school where you have many teachers to help you, and it's not worth studying at home alone.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe schools should not offer distance learning because it's hard to learn on your own when it's easy to learn at school with teachers who can help you.

You can learn from every mistake and do better each day. Just don't give up, stay enthusiastic, and be yourself. Remember, there are no limits to what you can achieve.

One problem with letting students use their phones in class is that they won't learn the right way. Another reason is that instead of doing their work, they will send messages to their friends or cheat. Some students might even lie to the teacher, saying they did the work when they didn't. This can affect students in many ways.\n\nMy first reason why students shouldn't use their phones in class is that they won't study or learn properly. When teachers let students use their phones, they get confused and don't know what to do. I've seen this at my school, where students don't know where to start when they're allowed to use their phones. They also get distracted by notifications on their phones. When my teacher makes us do work on our phones, it's hard to focus because of the notifications.\n\nMy second reason is that students will slack off and do something else on their phone. Many students use their phones to send messages to their friends. If teachers let students use their phones during class, they'll get away with messaging their friends and won't get in trouble. I've seen this in my classes, where some students don't do the work because they're messaging their friends instead. Students might also cheat on their work, and if they get used to cheating, they'll keep doing it.\n\nMy last reason is that students will lie, saying they already finished their work. I've seen students in my class say they finished the work when I know they didn't. It's not fair to the other students who do the work. If the teacher finds out the student lied, they'll get in trouble.\n\nSome people might say that students should be allowed to use their phones in class because they learn more that way. However, teachers can't just check a student's phone, and students might be playing games or looking up answers instead of doing the work. I've experienced this myself, and I know it's not true that students learn more with their phones.\n\nIn conclusion, I think schools shouldn't let students use their cell phones in class for educational purposes. I hope my reasons will change some schools' ideas about letting students use their phones in class. I hope schools and parents will understand why cell phones shouldn't be used in classes.

Students who have a tutor or do school activities can learn more at their own pace. We'll also save paper and energy by using less every day.\n\nBut there are also some bad points. If we have ten-hour classes, students might want to leave or skip classes. This means classes would need to be two hours longer. We'd also be looking at screens for too long, which can hurt our eyes.\n\nIf I had to choose, I'd choose the good points. It's a great idea to save the materials we use every day.

Others disagree, but I think my school should try this because it would help students in many ways. \n\nOne good thing about a four-day school week is that it would reduce stress for students and teachers. For example, when we had a four-day week on Veterans Day, everyone was happy and ready to learn. The extra day off made us feel relaxed, and we had time to finish our homework and rest. Teachers also had time to grade quizzes, prepare lessons, and spend time with their families. \n\nAnother benefit is that it would improve attendance. I've missed school many times for dentist appointments, and it affected my grades. If we had an extra day off, I could use it to catch up on schoolwork and rest. Many high school students have jobs on the weekends, and this extra day would help them do their homework and rest before school days. \n\nSome people think this schedule would be hard for students, but it would also save the school money. We would need less food, transportation, and cleaning services. The money we save could be used to buy things we need, like smart boards for classrooms. It could also help students who can't afford lunch every day. \n\nIn conclusion, I think schools should try a four-day school week.

My cousin used to help me get ready for school programs. I wanted to do something nice for her, but I didn't get the chance. Although I didn't cry at her funeral, I did cry in my room. She hated seeing me cry and told me to be strong. I wish she weren't sick. She would have met my friends, gone to public school, and done fun activities with me. She was my best friend, my everything. \n\nSecond, it's hard to understand what teachers teach when you're not in class.

For example, a student may think they will fail a test, but if they think positively, they can pass. If they succeed, they can help others who think positively, and that helps. We should always think positively, not negatively.\n\nIn my opinion, not everyone can be successful because they need to have good ideas to achieve great things. For me, it's not about failing; everyone can be positive in life, not negative. But it's up to the person to see the good in others.\n\nTo be successful, you need to have good ideas, not bad ones. You should be smart, kind, respectful, responsible, happy, and safe. Being a good prime minister and being sincere surprises others and makes them want to stay with you. You should not give up; you should be better and succeed.\n\nIn conclusion, don't think you can't do something. If you can achieve and succeed in life, think good thoughts, not bad ones. Be a good person, a good worker, spread good vibes, be brave, and be yourself."}

Should your school do the same by adding two hours to the school day? I don't think so. It's too much work and can be bad for your brain. It can also affect your health in the long run.\n\nSome people think it's the same as a five-day week, just with an extra day off. But that's not true. Students would get frustrated working long hours every four days. The only good thing is that you'd have an extra day to do other things, like homework.\n\nThere are many ways for companies to save energy and resources, which can help them make more money. But the people working for those companies work very hard. In school, some students have jobs after school, and adding two hours to the school day could affect their work. They might feel tired and have to do more work and homework. Not all students have parents who can buy them everything they need.\n\nWe need to save energy for homework, and it's necessary. We use energy most of the time because technology is advanced. We try our best, but that doesn't mean we should study or work ten hours a day.\n\nResources like money, energy, and food are important. Studying two more hours each day can affect students and teachers.\n\nIn conclusion, having an extra day off is a good thing, but studying more hours than normal is harder.

Some successes are easy to get; you just need to know what to do and when to do it. For example, going to school on time and getting good grades can be someone's success, and you can easily do that by going to school on time and listening to the teacher.\n\nI think you need to fail in life to succeed. Nothing in life is free; you have to earn it. You earn it by believing in yourself and never giving up. For example, Captain America joined the military, and people made fun of him because he was too skinny and weak. But he didn't give up. He did what he loved, which was saving people. He became the best soldier, and everyone who bullied him looked up to him. I think that's amazing - believing in yourself when everyone doubts you.\n\nI believe Churchill's quote about failing to succeed only works if you really care about what you want to achieve. I've wanted to succeed in some things, but when things didn't go as planned, I gave up. I think that's because I wasn't really passionate about it. For example, I love soccer, but I'm shy, and I can't play in front of people. I also love money, and I work hard for it. The difference for me is that I'm really passionate about money, not soccer. You can't succeed if you're not passionate enough.\n\nThe reason people don't succeed is because they give up after the first failure. They doubt themselves and stop believing they can succeed. But that's wrong because everything happens for a reason. Churchill's quote helps people understand success, failure, and how to work with both.\n\nIn conclusion, you do need to fail to succeed in life, and it's for a good reason. It may be hard to keep pushing yourself, but sometimes that's how you get where you want to be. Also, be passionate about it, and it will keep pushing you forward."}

We could spend those days with our families at parks, rivers, and lakes, or travel to other states or countries. To make this work, we would need to stay two more hours at school each day to finish our work. Would you like that? I think school should have a four-day week and longer days because students could learn more and finish their work each day, and teachers and students would have more time with their families on weekends.\n\nIf we had longer school days, we could learn more and finish our work. For example, in a technology class, your teacher might say, 'Type this lesson on the computer, and then I'll teach you how to save it.' If you're in the middle of typing and it's time to go home, you won't know how to save the lesson because the teacher hasn't taught you yet. If you don't have time to learn how to save it, what will happen to the lesson for the next day? However, with two more hours, you can finish the lesson, and the teacher can teach you how to save it.\n\nTeachers and students would have more time with their families on weekends. Normally, we have five school days and two days off, Saturday and Sunday. But if we had a four-day school week, we would have one more day off to spend with our families. We would have three free days, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, to go to the beach, park, or visit other states.\n\nSome students think that changing the school week wouldn't help them. But they're wrong. Having a four-day school week and longer days would help them by giving them one more day with their families, two more hours to finish their work, and more time to learn.\n\nIn the future, I hope our school changes to a four-day school week with longer days.

You will make mistakes, but as long as you are kind, honest, and brave, you can't hurt the world. We make a living by what we earn, but we make a life by what we give.\n\nI've heard many reasons why people give up on their goals, such as 'it wasn't meant to be' or 'it wasn't fun anymore' or 'life is about being famous.' But we often create excuses not to follow through on our commitments. Is this how we want to live our life? We don't want to be wrong, so we give up on a goal rather than risk looking foolish. Our beliefs about success can help or hurt our progress. We may have unconscious beliefs that we're not aware of, and we look for evidence to support our efforts to succeed. It's almost certain we will fail at some point pursuing our goals. It's almost certain we will want to give up. It's almost certain we will feel stressed and unhappy. And let's be clear on what success means: it means learning from our failures. It's about making progress in life, not just about being rich, famous, or well-known. We have to be careful about the mistakes we make.\n\nFor example, I've failed many times, but I never gave up. I always kept in mind the enthusiasm to get what I wanted. Some of those failures may happen in the future, but they can become a reality. Some of the failures I made in the past now help me succeed in high school or college. One of the mistakes I made was waiting too long for important things. Sometimes I wanted to give up, but I thought that if I couldn't wait, I would never succeed. Some people say that if you fail once, you'll always be down, but I think success is the ability to move on from failure and stay enthusiastic. I have some old papers that I thought I'd never use, but now they help me a lot in high school. That old paper, which I once wanted to throw away, now helps me a lot."}

It's already hard to get all these credits, and adding extra classes can cause students to spend less time on work and grades may drop.\n\nForcing students to take extra classes can also be expensive. Art supplies, costumes, and makeup can cost a lot of money. As you can see, making students take extra classes won't help because it can lead to lower graduation rates. Students already have enough school work to do, and it may be very expensive.\n\nMany classes require fees or materials that students need to buy. For example, photography classes can cost around $200 for a required camera. Many people can't afford these necessities. Another issue is the credit requirements. Some people think art classes help build confidence in kids. But if kids are forced to take these classes, they might feel bad about themselves because they're doing something they don't like. They might also feel unhappy about how they're spending their time.\n\nMaking students take unnecessary classes to graduate is not a good idea. This is clear from our society, which values specialization, and from the fact that students will drop out if they face too many challenges.

I think failure plays a big role in our lives because without it, we wouldn't be able to succeed and would just give up.\n\nOne reason why trying again is important is when you have schoolwork and you don't get it right at first. You keep working on it, and even if you fail, you try again until you get it right. When you finally do, you feel proud of yourself. For example, the person who created Facebook started working on it in college. I think he might have made mistakes at first, but he kept trying until he got it right. Facebook became very popular because it was new and different.\n\nAnother reason is when you like someone and want them to like you back. You have to keep trying, even if you don't succeed at first. You just have to wait until you finally do. For example, I tried to get a girl to like me, but it was hard because she didn't like most boys. At first, it was tough because she took a long time to answer my messages, but I kept trying until she started answering quickly. Now we talk all the time.\n\nLastly, when you invent something and it doesn't work out at first, you keep working on it until you get it right. Then, companies might want to buy what you made, and you feel good because it could change people's lives. For example, the Wright brothers invented the airplane. At first, it didn't work because of problems with the plane's structure. They kept trying until they got it right, and then they flew it successfully.\n\nIn the end, success is about trying again and again because without failures, we wouldn't be who we are today. From failures can come amazing things in life. Pursuing success is not easy because you have to try many times, even if you fail. But with enthusiasm, you can do anything you want, like coming to school even when you don't have many classes. Failure is an important part of our lives because it can lead to great things."}

If teachers are patient and consistent, students will become responsible users of technology.\n\nIn conclusion, some people don't want cell phones in school because they can cause distractions. But we live in a world of technology, and cell phones are a useful part of it. If we don't use cell phones in school, we'll miss out on their educational benefits. Overall, cell phones improve communication, provide learning resources, and encourage responsible technology use. Teachers and administrators should find ways to use cell phones in our schools."}

Online classes are also expensive, which is a waste of money. Many people in the US are poor and can't afford it. They have to work hard to achieve their goals.\n\nIf students attend online classes, they will fall behind others. For example, my friend Generic_Name got pregnant and took online classes. She couldn't attend classes every day because she had to take care of her baby and do household chores. As a result, she had to retake all the classes because she missed most of them. She said she wouldn't take online classes again and would rather go to school.\n\nSome people think online classes help them work and earn money. However, they can work part-time after school, 4 to 5 hours a day, without getting tired. They can earn enough money to pay rent and bills. They can live paycheck to paycheck until they graduate. They can even get a good job with a high school diploma.\n\nOnline classes won't help students learn because they don't take them seriously. They will fail the class and be unsuccessful. Many people can't afford online classes because they're expensive. They will fall behind others because of their household work and have to work harder to achieve their goals.

As a student, I know how it feels to go to school for almost a year without a long break. It can be overwhelming. Long breaks give us many benefits, like spending time with family, traveling, and staying home to relax and learn.\n\nOne reason long breaks are important is that we get to spend time with our families. When we're with our families, we learn new things. For example, they teach us how to cook new foods, and we learn from them. Learning at home helps us a lot in the future.\n\nAnother reason long breaks are important is that we need to travel and see new things. When we travel, we learn about new places and things. We discover new things that we like and want to be. That's learning too. I think we should have long breaks because after 10 months of school, we need at least two months to rest our minds. Even when we're not in school, we're still learning because there's so much to see and discover in the world. When we visit new places, we learn new things."}

Everyone is different, and we all have our own way of thinking. To be successful, you can't give up, even when you feel like you can't go on.\n\nWe hear stories of people who failed many times and learned from their mistakes.

To be successful, you have to start from the bottom and work your way up. It's not easy, but it's worth it.\n\nLife is a journey where you learn and grow. Failure teaches you valuable lessons and helps you understand what life is really about. Sometimes we make bad decisions that hurt us. Failure shows us what we're doing wrong, and we must learn from it.\n\nIt's never too late to learn from failure. Humans make mistakes, and that's normal. If you do something wrong, don't give up.

They made mistakes and failed, but they didn't give up. They kept fighting to reach their goals. For example, The Beatles, one of the best bands in history, were rejected, but they kept trying and achieved their goal.

Strong and smart people know that nothing comes easily, so we have to give our best to achieve what we want. The most important thing is not to lose hope and enthusiasm. If we don't lose these, it doesn't matter how many times we fail, we'll always get back up and try again until we succeed.\n\nTo be successful, we need to remove distractions that can make us fail.

So she stays home to control it and avoid getting embarrassed in front of people.\n\nBefore she started taking online classes, Generic_Name didn't think her illness was serious.

These are some reasons why I agree with Churchill's statement.\n\nFirst, people think you're weak when you fail many times. But they don't know how strong you are for trying until you succeed. It's easy to give up, but you'll never know if you could have succeeded if you don't keep trying. I have a friend who gets angry when things don't go his way. I've learned that things are easier when we're happy.\n\nSecond, you gain experience from failing. Think about it: when you're 60 years old and have grandchildren, what would you rather they ask you - what did you do to be successful, or why didn't you try to succeed? I bet you'd prefer the first one. So, we gain many experiences from failing and trying again. You'll tell them how hard it is to be successful. You'll also learn more because you won't make the same mistakes again. It won't make you perfect, but it will make you better.\n\nFinally, failing makes you appreciate what you have when you achieve success. It's hard to be successful, so you'll take care of what you get. It will also make you a better person, like being more responsible, helping others, and respecting people. I remember when my brother was a student, he spent money on clothes or anything he liked. Now that he's a professional who fixes computers, he earns more money, but he doesn't spend as much. He knows how difficult it is to be successful, so he takes care of what he has.\n\nIn summary, Churchill's statement is true. We should always try until we succeed. It will help us be stronger, gain experience, and appreciate what we have. Some might say that failing many times makes you weak.

{"text_id_kaggle": "10A0F2059774", "output_essay": "The school system has remained the same for years, leading most students to manage their time to succeed. Changing the system can have pros and cons for students. However, I strongly disagree with a four-day school week because students might forget what they learned, get used to it, and face difficulties in the future. To save energy, it's not necessary to extend school hours for more breaks. Students don't have many responsibilities, and I believe a four-day school week can hinder their learning development.\n\nFirstly, students will forget what they learned if they have fewer school days. For example, with a four-day school week, they might feel lazy to practice what they learned in class, leading them to forget everything. To remember, a student must keep practicing because the more you practice, the more you'll remember. Moreover, a four-day school week is not enough for students to learn, as they have a fresh mind and can easily memorize what they're learning. Teenagers can learn faster because they're not frustrated, and it can benefit them to take advantage of it in school. They need to practice and learn new things to get better and become competent students.\n\nAnother reason is that this can affect them in the future if they get used to it. For instance, getting used to a four-day school week will be a bad habit because it's not the same at university. Before university, students must develop their skills, as they have a lot to learn. If they have fewer school days, it can be a waste of learning. University is much harder than school, and it will be harder for them because students would have to put more effort if they have a four-day school week; otherwise, they'll struggle.\n\nAs you can see, not everyone has the same opinion. Some say a four-day school week will benefit students. They can have time to have fun after studying and doing homework. Everyone needs breaks to relax without stress or worries. I agree that everyone needs to get rid of stress and worries because someone could get sick if they don't take breaks. However, having too many breaks is not a good habit. Although a four-day school week has some advantages, it also has disadvantages for students whose main priority is to learn as much as they can with their teachers' support.\n\nIn conclusion, I strongly disagree with a four-day school week because it will hold students back from learning. Students won't be able to use their abilities and knowledge, and that will lower our country's potential in the future. Students won't put effort into classes because they won't feel like doing their responsibilities. Instead, the average of good students will decrease over time due to poor performance."}

I want to take a few minutes to explain why I think learning in school is better than learning from home. I believe that online classes or video chatting won't help as much because you can get easily distracted at home and won't finish your work. Being in school is much better.\n\nStudying from home isn't very helpful. You might be sitting on your couch trying to do your work, but you'll get distracted and forget about it. For example, what if your teacher assigns a quiz at home? You could easily cheat, and when it's time for a test, you'll fail because you didn't prepare. That's why it's better to be in school where your teacher can supervise you.\n\nIf your teacher catches you cheating, it will teach you a lesson. If you're struggling and cheat, the best way to ask for help is to ask your teacher. It's also nice to have classmates around. Some teachers assign group work, and it's helpful to work with your classmates. If you're not good at something, your classmate can help you. Also, if you don't understand something, your teacher is there to help.\n\nIf you take online classes, it's tough. Your teacher can't point out your mistakes in person. It's also nice to have your teacher around to motivate you and push you to do better. For example, what if three out of five students at home don't have internet access and can't take online classes? Their family might be poor and can't afford it. The teacher or school would be causing stress for the family to pay for internet. When the student's family barely makes enough money to pay rent and buy food, I'm sure you wouldn't want your student to worry about money issues.\n\nI have a friend who has money problems, and it's hard for her family to afford internet. She didn't want to see her parents work too hard, so she got a job herself. No one wants to see a student fail because of money issues. That's why I think online classes aren't as helpful as learning in school with your teacher and classmates.\n\nIn conclusion, online classes from home aren't as helpful as learning in school. The only time it's okay to take online classes from home is if you have a medical reason or if you want to graduate early and have talked to your counselor about it. Also, going to school teaches you important life skills, like waking up early for work or school."}

We won't have time for sports or other activities after school. This means we'll have less time with our families. Parents will need to find someone to watch their kids on days off.\n\nSecond, teachers and students will be too tired. For example, teachers won't have time to review tests and homework. Students will be tired and might not pay attention in class or cause trouble. They might fall asleep or be in a bad mood. They won't have time to study, and they might fail tests. This means they'll have less time for homework or sleep.\n\nThird, students who play sports or do other activities will have less time for those things. For example, they'll have to stay after school for practice and won't be able to spend time with their families. They'll also have less time to hang out with friends or finish their homework. This is stressful for students and means more work. The same is true for students who play an instrument; they always have to be at concerts.\n\nFourth, being at school more will mean less time with our families. For example, parents will spend less time with their kids. They'll need to find someone to watch their kids on days off. If they can't find someone, one parent will have to take care of the kids and miss work. This means they'll earn less money and spend more on food and electricity.\n\nSome people think it's a good idea because they'll have three days off on the weekend.\n\nIn conclusion, the school schedule should not change because parents won't be able to spend time with their families. Teachers and students will be too tired. Students won't have time for sports or other activities. They might fall asleep in class or cause trouble. Parents will need to find someone to watch their kids on days off, and this will affect their work and money.\n\nFinally, I hope the school doesn't change its schedule because it will cause many problems if they do."}

Students use their devices to do their work and attend classes from home through online or video calls. Would students benefit from attending classes from home? They might not focus on what the teacher says when they're with friends in class. However, some people think it's good for students to attend classes from home, which is true. They would pay more attention, and it reduces deaths at schools.\n\nLetting students attend classes from home online is a great chance for those who can't go to school due to medical issues. For example, students with disabilities that prevent them from moving or going out. They can make video calls and complete their work from home. They would be safe and happy to be part of society. It can also reduce bullying and suicide in schools. For instance, a student killed himself because his friends called him fat, which is very mean. Schools should teach students about the risks of bullying. Students might kill themselves over bad words. It would affect their future by making them commit crimes. For example, school shootings happen when students get angry at their friends or coworkers. This makes them feel frustrated with society. One day, they come to school with a gun to get revenge, which gives schools a bad name.\n\nSome students have a hard time focusing in class. Attending school from home through online or video calls can help them. They can pay attention in class without being distracted by friends. For example, some students love making jokes when the class is quiet. They get others' attention, so no one focuses on the lesson. Some want to play games when they see friends and help each other cheat on tests. Distracting students during class can make them fail because they won't understand their work. Concentrating lets students pay more attention and understand better. Staying at home can make them feel comfortable. For example, some students are too shy to ask questions in class. Online or video calls let them ask questions by emailing the teacher and participating in class.\n\nIn addition, schools are a priority for all students to attend. Somehow, students can attend school through online or video calls. It's very helpful for students to focus. It can also reduce school shootings and student suicides caused by bullying. Students should learn in a safe environment."}

There are many reasons why my school should not do this. \n\nOne reason is that it won't save energy. We will still come to school for the same number of hours per week, just spread out over four days instead of five. \n\nAnother reason is that some students have part-time jobs. If they have to stay at school for two more hours, they will be late to work and might lose their jobs. If they lose their jobs, they won't have money to pay their bills, rent, or buy food. They might have to drop out of school to find a daytime job to make ends meet.\n\nThe final reason is that some students are mothers and have to pick up their babies from daycare. If they can't pick up their babies on time, they will have to pay extra money. This will cause them a lot of problems, including being late to work and not having enough money to take care of their babies. \n\nIn conclusion, I don't think it's a good idea for schools to extend the school day and have classes only four days a week. It might save a little energy, but it will cause a lot of problems for many students. They might lose their jobs, not have enough money, and even have to drop out of school.

One reason is that teachers give too much work. Another reason is that kids just don't like school. Some kids may not like school because they have things to do after school, like walking their dog or doing chores. I wouldn't like a longer school day because I want to go home and play games, hang out with friends, and sleep. I wouldn't have enough time with my family. I want to spend time with them, like going out to eat or having fun. Another reason kids may not like school is that they get tired, hungry, and it gets dark early. With a longer school day, you get more work and have to stay up late to finish homework. The next day, you'll be tired again. Adding another class because of the extra half hour is bad. Kids might sleep in class because they're used to sleeping after school. Or, they might goof off and talk to friends because they like playing after school.

Almost everyone uses cell phones in different ways and places, especially students. Cell phones are always with us and can help us find information or connect with others easily. Some schools even use cell phones in the classroom. This means cell phones have both good and bad effects.\n\nFirst, most students are smart and like using technology. They use it everywhere, including at school. There are two kinds of students: those who don't know English well and those who do.\n\nSecond, cell phones can help students who don't know English well. They can use their phones as a dictionary to find words and sentences their teachers teach. They can also use them for other classroom work. Regular students can use their phones to find information from different sources in the classroom.\n\nThird, there are also bad effects. Using cell phones can harm our eyes and bodies. It can also distract us from our lessons. If we always use our phones in class, we might not learn as much. Additionally, it's not good to use our phones to cheat on homework or quizzes.\n\nFor example, I'm an ESL student, which means English is my second language.

I passed the class early, before my friends. I didn't have to study Geometry all year.\n\nOne good thing about taking classes at home is that you don't have to go anywhere. I used to go to school, and my dad had to drive me every day. He was always angry with me in the morning because I woke him up. I know my dad is tired and needs sleep too. So, I started taking online classes. After that, everything was great - my dad got good sleep, I could eat breakfast while taking classes, and there were no problems.\n\nFrom my experience, online classes are helpful and fun. You can take different types of classes, like video chat or online classes. I took online classes, and it was my first time. You can listen to the teacher and see what she's doing on the computer screen. You can also chat with other students taking the same class. Even if you can't see the teacher, she sends her photo by email at the beginning of the course.\n\nAnother benefit is that you can finish a class early. You don't have to spend the whole year on one subject, especially for seniors who need to pass two classes in one year. I took Geometry because I wanted to take Algebra 2 next year, so I can graduate. It really helped me. My friends and family were surprised when I passed the class in two months. I was proud of myself, and my parents said, 'You did a good job, son.'\n\nI think all schools should start online classes. It's helpful and easy for everyone who can't afford transportation.

Teachers would get too stressed, and kids would be unhappy because they wouldn't have time to relax or have fun.\n\nAnother reason I don't think they should add more time is that it would be too late after school to do other things. For older kids, it would be at least 6:30 or 7:00 before they get home. If they have sports after school, it would be even later. They wouldn't have time for anything else.\n\nThe last reason is that it would mess up their plans.

Second, failures motivate you to work harder. Third, people will always criticize you, but you should not give up.\n\nI believe that failures can make you successful if you keep working hard. I remember a true story about a boy named Generic_Name. He was born in the early 90's and had a tough childhood. He got infected with a disease and had to cut off his hand. Despite this, he started playing football and worked hard to become one of the best players in the state. He faced many challenges, including coaches who didn't believe in him.

This won't work if we only have two days of school per week and two hours per day. If we have ten hours of work, it will be stressful, but they have to pay us well. Two hours is not enough time to learn everything; we have seven classes in one day, so how can we learn everything in two hours? We also have tests, and everyone will get a zero.\n\nTo get a good job, we have to study a lot and go to college. But some students don't have the opportunity because we don't have enough money to pay for college or the right papers to get into a good college. Like me, I want to be a police officer, but I don't have the right papers. It's very difficult for us because we can't get a good job. All we can do is finish high school and find another job.\n\nFor example, if I find a job that pays seven dollars per hour, I have to pay for a lot of things like rent, bills, and help my family. Many Spanish people have two or three jobs because we have to pay for a lot of things. They didn't go to school in our countries years ago, so it's not easy. My mom only finished 3rd grade, but she works every day. That's why I try to be a good student because she didn't have the chance to go to school, and I do.\n\nIf they only give us two hours of school, it's better to find another job because two hours is not enough to learn what we need to know. But if they give us more hours, how much will they pay the teacher? That doesn't make sense. In two hours, how many classes can they teach? One? We want to get our diplomas, and that's the most important thing. Without a diploma, it's harder to find a job or go to college.\n\nI have an idea: if they want us to work ten hours a day, they have to pay us well, and we can study five hours. It's not enough, but it's better than nothing. We can work one day and go to school all day when we have off. If we want to make money while we study, we can take one class if the school says yes. Businesses can adopt that when we have time; we can do that, take classes only.\n\nIn my opinion, I don't want to go to school for only two hours; I don't want to waste my time if I can do the same at home. If they give me the chance to speak for everyone, first, I have to talk about my ideas, and then I can make a decision before I tell everyone what we can do. But we have to see; not everyone likes to work. Some people like to ask their parents for money, but that's not fair to our parents because we are young, and we can work and make some money to help our family.\n\nStudies are first; that's what my mom tells me every day. Because I have a dream to be a police officer in this country, not in my country, because they don't follow the rules. We have to start from the bottom and make an effort so they can give us a better position.\n\nA lot of people have the chance to study, but they don't care. A lot of people want to study here to learn English, but they don't have the chance. Maybe my ideas don't make sense about the two hours, but if they approve, I'm not coming, and I'll go to work and pay maybe twenty-five dollars per class. If they pay well, I can buy everything I want; for example, the things I don't have are a car, my own house, and things my family needs. I can find a job for my sisters, or we can have our own company.\n\nI love my family, and if I have everything in my hands, I will do it to make their dreams come true. It's not easy, but with God, we can make it. But they have to study all day, not two hours. By extending the school that way, they have to have ideas about what we have to do to make our dreams possible because some people can't go to college and see if we can study more. But with two classes, they will say no, you don't have all the requisites to be here in this college; they're going to make another college for the students who study here and only study two hours.\n\nThat's all my opinion about the two hours for school and ten hours working per week. Maybe I am not correct with my decision, but I wrote all what I think about the two hours school.\n\nThat's all I have to say about this."}
{"text_id_kaggle": "9B9FEFC6AF83", "output_essay": "Should the school extend the day by two hours to conserve energy and resources? After considering the benefits and drawbacks of a four-day school week.\n\nToday, many companies are trying to save energy and resources because they are running out quickly. These companies are worried about the harm that could happen if they don't take action. Some companies have started working four days a week, with ten hours each day. Schools are also thinking about adopting this schedule, but reducing learning time could affect students.\n\nMost schools have a five-day week with eight hours each day. To save energy and resources, some schools are considering a four-day week with a two-hour delay. In my opinion, it's a good idea to help conserve the world's resources, but I don't think we should cut two hours of learning. I believe we need more time to study to reach our goals, and having only two hours means we're just spending time in school without achieving much. For example, a student needs about eight hours a week to review four assignments a day, which means they need at least one and a half hours for each assignment. Two hours are not enough.\n\nSaving resources and energy is necessary for our lives, and it's our job to protect them. However, there are other ways to do this without shortening the school day. For example, businesses or environmental groups could have a special day to help the Earth. They could divide tasks like cleaning rivers, picking up trash, and planting trees. Schools could also use renewable energy, like solar panels on the roof, to save resources. In my opinion, this is the right way to conserve energy without changing the school schedule.\n\nAs I said before, the school doesn't need to extend the day by two hours. If the school starts later, students will just go home early and waste time playing games or hanging out with friends instead of learning in class. Working on tablets at home won't help students learn as much as they do in school. Most students don't even use tablets to work because they're lazy or don't understand the topic and need a teacher.\n\nIn conclusion, schools should focus on teaching because it's where students build their future. Extending the school day by two hours is a waste of time and doesn't give students enough time to learn. There are other ways to conserve energy and resources without affecting schools. I believe we can make a difference with renewable resources without affecting schools, so let's let students spend more time in school, not wasting time at home."}

Today, I will explain why I strongly disagree with making school longer and how it would affect students.\n\nFirst, I think it would make students very tired. Students are already tired from the long school day. If we add an hour and a half, it would be too much. For example, you wouldn't have enough time at home to finish your homework. You would also have less time to do your chores. So, making school longer would just make students more tired.\n\nSecond, I think it would make students more stressed.

Online classes can help people keep their values without being influenced by others. When you go to regular school, you meet people who can change your way of thinking and behavior. This can affect your future. Online classes make life safer, and parents feel more confident about who their children interact with. Taking online classes makes you more responsible for your achievements.\n\nSome people think online classes are not good for ESOL students because learning a new language is difficult. They need a teacher to explain and help them understand. Writing and speaking are also important parts of learning a language. If you take online classes, you need to practice speaking to achieve your goals.\n\nOnline classes provide different options for students who want to learn in a different way. This is about finding the best way to learn, so you can focus, avoid distractions, and learn better. Most students who take online classes finish school faster. Deciding to take online classes has many benefits, makes you more responsible, and gives you the freedom to manage your time."}
{"text_id_kaggle": "7172C3C82401", "output_essay": "Many people, especially teenagers, don't have the chance to go to school because they need to work to support themselves. This is a great idea for them because they can take classes from home and learn after work. The most important thing is that they should get an education.\n\nIn my opinion, it's too bad for teenagers who have parents to support them. They have all the time to go to school and learn faster than those who didn't have the opportunity.\n\nFor teenagers in the United States, it's very hard to attend school because some of them came here to work. However, they've reached the age to attend school, but they were forced to work because they support their family back home. I think this offer from some schools is amazing because now they can learn from home through online or video conferencing. School is very important because if you have more education, you're more valuable. If you don't have education, your value is low. Therefore, these people need to make good use of this opportunity because if they get an education, they'll get a better job too.\n\nLife is weird sometimes because people who can attend school don't want to, and those who can't attend school want to. I've met people who have everything they want, but they don't like school because they prefer to do other things like smoke or drink. They're getting bad habits and wasting their time. For them, it's a bad idea because they have all the time to learn faster than others.\n\nFinally, education is very important for everyone because with education, you can get a better job and a better future. I struggled with school because I work and attend school, so I know it's hard to do both things at the same time. But I know that I'll be successful if I don't give up. I trust in God that He's giving me strength to keep working hard, and I'll get my diploma. After that, I'll keep working for my future.\n\nIn conclusion, all opportunities that come to us are good because they only come once. This opportunity from some schools is really good because when students get sick and can't go to school, they can do it from home and not fall behind. As I said before, education is very important to achieve goals in life. For those who don't have the opportunity to attend school, I just say that they need to work very hard. In life, nothing is impossible; if God closes doors, it's because He's going to open another one much better."}
{"text_id_kaggle": "8B72978E5087", "output_essay": "Some schools allow students to use cell phones in class to help with their studies, but this often becomes a big problem. The idea is to use phones to find answers or look up definitions, but the problem is that students often use them in the wrong way. Phones can easily distract anyone, and students often use them for things that are not related to classwork, which can lead to failing grades.\n\nEven though some schools let students use their phones in class, many students use them to cheat or copy answers. We students often want to take the easy way out and don't think about the consequences. I know someone who always gets caught cheating on tests. To solve this problem, teachers should collect phones at the start of each class to prevent cheating and only give them back when a project requires a phone.\n\nCell phones are designed to notify us when someone texts us, and this can be hard to resist. Most of us can't control ourselves and want to know who sent the text and what it says. This makes us focus on our phones instead of the class. I can usually control myself, but when I know someone has texted me, I start thinking about who it is and what they said. To solve this problem, teachers need to collect phones at the start of each class.\n\nStudents also use their phones for other things. Many students check social media or play games during class. They do this because they get bored or lose interest in the lesson. I remember a smart student who would often open Facebook during class. To all teachers, I say: collect phones from students at the start of each class to help us stay focused and finish our work.\n\nIn conclusion, some schools use cell phones in class for educational purposes, but many students misuse them. We use phones to text, play games, cheat, and check social media, which gets out of control. If teachers don't do something about this, bad things will happen. What will you do to stop this problem?"}

I'm a hard worker, I love learning new things that interest me, and I'm willing to try new things outside my comfort zone. These traits make me a good intern. I would learn a lot from you and take away valuable experiences. I'm a hard worker, so if you choose me, I'll do my best to make it happen. I'll show you how determined I am. For example, last year I studied hard for the SOLs and got the second-highest score in my class. I also like learning new things that interest me. Last year, I chose to take an auto tech class where I learned to work on cars. I picked this class because I'm interested in cars. If I get an internship, it won't feel like work because I'll enjoy it. I'll put in extra effort. I'm also willing to try new things. This year, I took a dual enrollment class, which is harder but saves time and money in the future. This shows I'm willing to step out of my comfort zone. I think this is important for a high school student in an internship because you meet new people and are in a new setting. I'm prepared for that. Even though I'm not the smartest student with all A's, I'm a hard worker, I love learning new things, and I'm willing to try new things.

{"text_id_kaggle": "2D0CDBC81DC0", "output_essay": "Some schools offer students the option to take classes from home. I believe this can be beneficial for students.\n\nMost schools provide this option. They offer online classes, which are the most common way to do this. Online classes can be helpful because students can finish their work earlier than usual, giving them more time for other activities like sports, reading, or spending time alone. There are two types of online classes: private and group classes. Private classes can help students understand better because they get individual attention from the teacher. This is a good option for shy students who feel more comfortable sharing their ideas without others around. Group classes are similar to regular classes, but online. Students can choose their own schedule, making it hard to miss a day.\n\nSome schools also use video conferencing. This is great because students can communicate better with the teacher and other students. It's like a regular class, where everyone can see each other. Video conferencing helps students understand better because they can see the teacher and other students. They can share ideas and help each other if they don't understand something. Teachers can also make classes more interesting by doing different activities.\n\nSome students can't attend regular school for various reasons. They may be sick and need to stay home, or their parents may have jobs that require them to travel a lot. Some students may have been bullied and prefer to stay home. For these students, online school is the best option. They can still learn the same things as regular school students.\n\nIn conclusion, online school can be very helpful for many people. It offers many benefits, such as flexibility and individual attention. Students can take classes from anywhere, and they have different options to choose from. Online school can be the best choice for many people."}

Community parks are also great because they teach you about your community and other cool things.\n\nSome people don't like going to parks because they find them boring. This is because they don't get out much and don't make time to have fun. Parks help you make memories with your family and friends.\n\nYou can do many things in parks, like learn new things, hang out with friends, and walk your dog. Parks help you spend less time on your phone and more time outside. If you're stressed, parks can help you relax.\n\nIn short, parks want to give you the best experience possible.

When you have imagination, you are more open-minded.\n\nImagination helps you think more and come up with new ideas. Knowledge is about knowing what's already true. I think Einstein was a great scientist because he had a lot of imagination. When you have an open mind, you can think about anything.\n\nKnowledge can limit your thinking because you already know what's real and what's not. For example, if I wanted to make a car using only my knowledge, I would make a boring old car. But I want to make a cool new car that no one has ever seen before. So I need to use my imagination to create something new and inspiring.\n\nImagination and knowledge are different, but imagination is special. As kids, we have a lot of imagination and that's why adults often ask us questions and are impressed by our answers. We don't know a lot, so we make things up. That's why some adults think kids are cool because we don't just rely on knowledge."}
{"text_id_kaggle": "3AD91D812260", "output_essay": "I think a four-day school week is a good idea. If it helps the environment, that's even better. By adding two hours to the school day, we can save energy. We can save a whole day of energy waste by doing this. So, why not try it?\n\nHelping the environment by saving energy and resources is always a good idea. We should try this and add two hours to the school day. The energy we save will help not just us, but many people around us too. However, this change can have both good and bad effects on students.\n\nA four-day week can be good or bad for students. It can be good because some students will like having an extra day off to have fun and relax. They won't mind staying two more hours in school. Also, they can work more with teachers and focus on their schoolwork. They won't have too much homework.\n\nOn the other hand, it can be bad because some students, like me, have part-time jobs. We won't be able to get to work on time if the schedule changes. This change can mess up our personal schedule and cause trouble. It can also affect how well students do in school because they're used to the normal schedule. Adding two hours and having one less school day can make it hard for them to keep up with their work.\n\nA four-day school week can save a lot of energy. For example, think about saving one day a week. It may not seem like much, but it can make a big difference over time. We can use this time to help our community and save natural resources. Wasted energy can harm other natural resources we need to live, like water.\n\nIn conclusion, I think many schools can try this. More businesses and people in our communities can also help. If we work together, we can save more energy and resources. It's our responsibility to make a change that will help everyone. Just think, one day can make a big difference."}
{"text_id_kaggle": "C636432ADCE2", "output_essay": "Many people wonder what makes them feel accomplished: doing something or doing nothing. Most people think that doing something helps them achieve more.\n\nSome people disagree because they think doing nothing can be helpful too. Doing nothing doesn't mean being lazy; it means taking time to think and find better ways to reach their goal. It can also help avoid risks that come with taking action. It's better to be careful and wait than to take a risk.\n\nHowever, I think doing something is better. As Thomas Jefferson said, 'You can do a lot if you keep doing things.' When you're always doing something, new and better ideas come up. This helps you find the best way to reach your goal. There's no good reason to do nothing because, as they say, 'Starting is halfway to finishing.' And 'It's better to regret trying something than doing nothing.' These quotes show that doing something gives you a strong foundation.\n\nI can relate to this idea. When I try new things, I'm often afraid of taking risks. This fear makes me do nothing, which doesn't help me reach my goal. Now, I know it's better to face my fear and try.\n\nIn conclusion, most people think that doing something helps them achieve more, and doing nothing can give them time to think.

{"text_id_kaggle": "C3A77797BBC5", "output_essay": "Some schools let students use their cell phones in class for educational reasons, but I think that's a bad idea. Using cell phones in class hurts students' learning, can cause mental problems, and leads to fights with classmates and teachers over social media or online videos.\n\nCell phones shouldn't be allowed in class. They're a big distraction for students. When students use their phones, they can't focus on the lesson. It's impossible to do two things at once and give your full attention to both. For example, if students are listening to music while the teacher is talking, it's hard to pay attention to both.\n\nUsing cell phones in class also lowers grades, wastes time, and makes it hard for students to follow instructions. As a result, students don't know what to do in class or with homework, and they can't learn new things. For instance, a student was texting in a finance class and didn't know about a project deadline. He lost time texting and got a zero on the project.\n\nUsing phones in class has a big impact on student learning. Most students have phones, but not all of them use them in class. Students who take school seriously don't use their phones during classwork because they know what they need to focus on. However, some students just want to waste time on their phones because they don't like school, which leads to a lack of interest.\n\nIn conclusion, using cell phones in class is not a good idea. Maybe schools need to change their rules, give better instructions, and teach students what their goals should be. Denying the use of cell phones or limiting their use, such as allowing them for only 20 minutes before class ends, would be a good rule. I strongly believe that using cell phones in class hurts learning and doesn't let students develop their minds correctly."}

They also learn about other jobs, which might change their mind about their chosen career.\n\nTo have a good career, you need to like what you do. Students can think about what they enjoy and decide what they want to do in the future. For example, if a student likes cooking, they can learn about being a chef. If they like planning, they can learn about being a planner. It's helpful for students to visit companies to think about their future.\n\nWhen students visit companies, they might change their mind about their chosen job. They might learn about other jobs that they like better. Having many options can help them make a better choice. They can also stick with their original choice and keep learning.\n\nSome schools don't have the same opportunities as others. But students who do have these opportunities can share their experiences with others. This can help other students learn about jobs and make informed decisions. Every student has the right to choose their own path and set goals for themselves.\n\nIn conclusion, this is a great opportunity for students to think about their future. They can turn what they enjoy doing into a job. They might also change their mind, which is okay. They can share their experiences with others and help them make informed decisions.

Success doesn't come easily; you have to work hard to get it.\n\nMany parents send their kids to school so they can be successful in their future careers. The kids need to work hard and finish their tasks. If they're idle, they won't achieve anything. I agree with Thomas Jefferson because when you make an effort, you learn new things that can lead to more success. The more you sit around, the less successful you'll be. If you make it a habit, your mind will tell you to keep being lazy. Keeping yourself busy is another reason to work hard.\n\nSome people might say that doing nothing also has a purpose. I don't agree because not doing anything won't get you anywhere. My parents taught me that if I don't listen to my teachers and don't do my work, I won't be able to go to college or build a career. Not doing useful work is another way of being idle. In my opinion, it doesn't serve any purpose. It's satisfying to look back at what you've achieved through hard work, rather than just sitting around.\n\nI believe that we achieve more when we're always doing something rather than doing nothing.

It's great to know what you want to do early, but it shouldn't be required.

If students really like a club, they might want to do something similar as a career. For example, there are clubs like UNICEF that are also companies.\n\nLastly, there are volunteer opportunities and courses outside of school that can help students find what they like. For example, students can volunteer at the American Cancer Society or take courses like pottery or fencing.\n\nIn conclusion, students have plenty of time to choose their career during high school.

As the saying goes, 'Practice makes perfect.' Students have three years in high school to improve themselves little by little. With enough practice, students will learn a lot about their career. It's a good idea for students to set their own career goals and work hard to achieve them.\n\nSecond, taking career-related courses helps students build a strong foundation in their field of study. It's good for students to learn about their profession early on. They will get the knowledge they need, which will help them in the future and make them want to learn more. It also helps students when they apply to college, since high school courses are often connected to college courses.\n\nThird, it helps students develop their character. Students will understand society better and develop a sense of responsibility while studying their career. When they start working, they will behave well and use what they learned in their projects. It's also good for the country's economy, as talented people will help society grow.\n\nSome people think that taking career-related courses will limit students' future goals and hobbies. However, it also has many advantages. For example, students will learn to behave professionally, the country needs talented people, and colleges will accept students who are good at their major. If students change their minds, I think parents and teachers should give them advice before they choose their courses. It will help students figure out who they are. With their help, students also need to think carefully about their future, since it will determine who they will become.\n\nIn short, taking career-related courses is good for students' future development. It's like a guide that shows students the right path."}

When technology was not as advanced, kids played outside. They played with jump ropes, basketballs, or went for walks or bike rides. As a kid, I loved playing outside with friends. It didn't matter if it was cold or hot; I was always ready. Socializing is good for both kids and adults. For example, when parents take their kids to the playground, they both meet new people and make friends. Today, it's rare to see kids playing outside. Many kids sit inside and play video games or watch TV all day, which is not a good way to make friends. Some people think playing video games is socializing because you can talk to other players, but it's not the best way. Another problem technology has created is social media. Everywhere you go, people are on Instagram, Snapchat, Facebook, Twitter, and so on. I use them too. But these apps have driven people apart. They can be fun, but they also have many negatives. For example, they make it easy to judge people you don't know. It's better to have a face-to-face conversation with someone than to use your phone or other devices. You get to know the person better that way. Looking back, I prefer playing outside with friends to being on my phone all the time. I didn't care what others thought of me, and that was better."}

Students should have more time to think about what they want to do. If they don't rush, they can try different classes and find out what they like. They might find a career that they really enjoy.\n\nOne reason students shouldn't choose a career too early is that they need time to think. For example, if a student likes math, they should have time to look for careers that use math. If we give them time, they can find the best career for themselves. They can take different classes and learn about new careers.\n\nAnother reason is that students feel rushed if they have to choose a career too early. If they don't have to choose right away, they can think about it during high school. Maybe some students don't know what they want to do. If we give them time, they can find careers that interest them.\n\nThe last reason is that students have a lot of schoolwork to do. If they choose a career that takes a lot of time, like sports, it can be hard to focus on school and their career. It's better for students to focus on one thing at a time. Finding a career can be hard if they're trying to do too much at once.\n\nSome people think that making students choose a career early helps them in the future. I don't agree. Students can learn more about careers in high school if we let them think, don't rush them, and let them focus on their schoolwork. This helps students get good grades and find a career that they really like. It helps them be sure they're choosing a career that's right for them."}

Because I'm bilingual, I can teach them some English. Many students enjoy spending summer with family they don't see often.

We need imagination and creativity to make learning exciting and enjoyable. Some people think knowledge gives you imagination, but I think it's the other way around. You can't learn without imagination.\n\nWhen you lose interest in something, it can affect how you feel about other things. For example, you want to build a birdhouse, but you have no idea how. You go outside to look for inspiration, but you don't see any birdhouses. Then you look at the houses in your neighborhood and get an idea. You decide to use popsicle sticks to build it. Finally, you finish the birdhouse and learn something new.\n\nMaking your own ideas is a great way to use your imagination. The more you use your imagination, the more you learn. The more you learn, the smarter and more independent you become. Some people think that knowledge gives you imagination, but I don't agree. As Einstein said, 'imagination is more important than knowledge.'\n\nIn short, without imagination, you can't learn. People don't understand how important imagination is.

{"text_id_kaggle": "DFA37BC88FA6", "output_essay": "I don't think students should be allowed to take classes from home. I believe they won't learn much and won't focus on their schoolwork. Parents might distract them, or they might play with their siblings instead of paying attention. Taking classes online means spending most of your time indoors, which is bad for your health. Many students won't have friends to play with because they won't be going to school. They also won't be able to participate in activities or experience new things every day. Students can learn more by going to school.\n\nFirst, taking an online class at home can be difficult. There might be a lot of noise, and parents might ask you to do favors for them. If you have siblings, they might distract you from your schoolwork. You might also have trouble hearing or understanding the teacher because of a bad internet connection. It's hard for teachers to explain things online.\n\nSecond, students who take classes at home won't be able to participate in outdoor activities or have fun with friends. They won't be socializing with anyone except their teacher, and they might become unhealthy from spending too much time indoors. Students won't reach their full potential if they're learning at home. If you're talking to the teacher online, they might not understand you, which can be frustrating for both of you.\n\nThird, students who stay at home might become unhealthy because they're not getting enough exercise. They also won't learn important skills like getting to school on time or driving safely. If you go to school, you'll learn how to respect others and set boundaries. You might even make friends or start a relationship.\n\nStudents can improve their social skills by going to school. They'll become more outgoing, playful, and friendly.\n\nFinally, not going to school can make you feel isolated and lonely. You might not understand your teacher, or you might not be able to learn on your own. That's why it's better to go to school where you can learn with other students.

If a model posts a picture wearing clothes from a store, it attracts people to shop there and promotes the clothes. If you offer a sale with a promo code, it attracts even more people. For example, if you're promoting the Lindsey Lohan Club House and shopping at FashionNova, your promo code could be \"LindsClub30\".\n\nI've recently started vlogging my life. Vlogging is making videos about my daily life. If an ambassador posts fun videos, it attracts people to visit the club house, and the club house becomes more popular. Working in an upscale club house means making sure everyone has fun and buys food, drinks, or merchandise.

Most middle school students get cell phones from their parents. When they're in high school, cell phones become a must-have item, so some schools don't allow students to use them in class, while others do for educational purposes. Using cell phones in class has many benefits. Students can quickly and easily research information and save it on their phones. This also gives them a sense of freedom, making them more responsible for their studies.\n\nAs children grow up, they often ignore their parents' advice, thinking they're adults and know what's right. Schools then assess them, thinking they only go to school to socialize with friends and don't care about studying. Without cell phones, they might create distractions for those around them. Day by day, they can become bad students. Students need to feel free to focus on their studies. In the US, high school students attend classes from 7:20 am to 2:10 pm, leaving them with plenty of time for homework and leisure. They still have freedom and don't feel too stressed. In Asia, however, students attend classes from 7:00 am to 11:30 am, take a break, and then return to school from 1:00 pm to 5:00 pm. This is a tough schedule, with at least eight classes a day. Both American and Asian students have homework, and if they feel free at school, they'll do their homework well. When people enjoy their daily activities, they do them well and achieve excellent results.\n\nBad students aren't necessarily bad at studying; they just don't want to improve themselves because they find their activities boring. If teachers focus on students, they'll see that bad students often work together in groups because they share the same attitude of not caring. If schools allow students to use cell phones in class for educational purposes, these groups will likely win activities. Why? Bad students aren't stupid; they just find studying boring. But if schools allow them to use cell phones, they'll eventually learn when to use them and when not to. Every student will find activities more engaging when they're allowed to use cell phones in class. If teachers create activities and offer rewards or extra credit, the winning group will likely consist of bad students, who research information quickly and efficiently. As they enjoy school more, they'll achieve better results.\n\nMoreover, schools still have rules for using cell phones. Students can only use them for educational purposes, not all the time. This helps students understand when they can and can't use their phones. If they could use them anytime, cell phones would become a distraction, not a benefit. Students would use them for games or texting, not for learning. So, schools need rules to help students become good students.\n\nIn conclusion, allowing students to use cell phones in class has many advantages, but also some disadvantages. If schools have proper rules, using cell phones can greatly benefit students' studies."}

He worked hard, practiced every day, and was very responsible with sports.\n\nIf you want to achieve your goals, you have to work hard. If you don't, nothing good will happen. There was a young soccer player named Maradona. He was very talented, but he was lazy. He never practiced, went to parties, drank, and did bad things. Now he's out of shape, and no team wants him because of his discipline.\n\nIdleness can also affect you in school.

When the test day came, I was scared because I didn't know the answers. After the test, the teacher told me my score, and I got an 'F'. From that day on, I always study for my quizzes and tests.\n\nYou need to work hard because hard workers always win, like Cristiano Ronaldo. People said he wasn't good at soccer when he was young, but he never gave up. He practiced every day and became one of the best soccer players. He won many leagues, trophies, and fans. He teaches us that if you work hard, you'll get what you want in life.\n\nIf you're lazy, it can affect others. For example, let's say you work as a cleaner at McDonald's.

The restaurant gets closed, and many people, including you, lose their jobs.\n\nWe can accomplish more if we're always doing something. Hard workers always win, and being lazy can affect others. You need to forget about being lazy and work hard to achieve your goals.

{"text_id_kaggle": "933951E2A198", "output_essay": "Today, a student's self-confidence is very important when it comes to learning. Self-confidence helps students feel good about themselves and do better in school. There are two common ideas about self-confidence when learning: one is to praise students' work, even if it's not perfect, to make them feel good about themselves, and the other is to focus on their achievements.\n\nSome people think that achieving good grades is more important because it shows that students have worked hard, been disciplined, and been consistent. This leads to success in school. For example, let's say there's a student named Generic_Name who does his homework and studies every day. Years later, he becomes a top student in his class and gets emails from universities that want to work with him. This makes him feel very confident about himself. We can see that his hard work has given him opportunities and made him feel good about himself.\n\nThe idea of building self-confidence by praising students has some problems. Praising students too much can have bad consequences. For example, let's say there's another student named Generic_Name who doesn't have a regular study routine. He watches TV, eats, and then does his homework at the last minute. As he grows up, he doesn't feel very confident about himself because he doesn't do well in school and doesn't have a plan for college. We can see that giving students too much freedom can be bad for them because they're not mature enough to make good decisions about their studies and future.\n\nIn conclusion, we can see that both ways of building self-confidence exist in students. Building self-confidence through achievements seems like a better option because it gives students more opportunities and makes them feel more confident about themselves. Praising students too much can make them feel bad about themselves because they can't manage their studies and free time, and they see that other students are doing better than them."}

If we stayed in school for eight hours, we would all be in a bad mood by the time we got out. This would ruin our day. \n\nI think this is a bad idea because we already spend too much time in school. If this happened, we wouldn't have the energy to do anything after school. We would all be too tired or grumpy. I think this idea should be dropped because students already dislike school.

{"text_id_kaggle": "8B1F8FCC9E56", "output_essay": "Working alone can show what someone can do by themselves. Being in a group can cause problems and lead to bad results. Some people prefer to work alone because they can get more done and avoid distractions. There are three reasons why working alone is better than working in a group. \n\nFirst, working alone helps you get more done. You don't have to listen to people talking about different things. Your friends might be playing games or texting, and the work doesn't get done. You can finish your work, and when it's time for your friends to help, they might not want to. In a group, people can get lazy and stop working, leaving you to do all the work alone. Working alone is better because you don't have to wait for others to finish, and it's more beneficial. It shows you what you can do alone and what you can't do in a group.\n\nSecond, you can work at your own pace and not feel rushed. Working in a group can make you work faster because your friends might be telling you to hurry up. When you rush, your work might not be good. You don't want to get a bad grade on something important. Working alone has its benefits. You can work as fast or slow as you want, do things in order, and get a good grade. It's better to take your time and review your work to make sure it's correct.\n\nFinally, you don't have to worry about someone not doing their part of the work. Working in a group can be hard because you have to worry about others' work. You have to worry if they did it right or not at all, plan how to do the work, and know who does what parts. If you did your part and others didn't, and you get a bad grade, they might get mad. Working alone has its benefits. You don't have to worry about someone getting mad at you for not doing their work.\n\nWorking alone is better because you can get more work done and work at your own pace. You don't have to worry about your group not finishing their work and getting a bad grade. Being in a group can be helpful too because more people are there to help."}

It's easy to use and provides new and interesting ways to learn in schools and colleges. People can find almost any information they need because of technology.\n\nTechnology gets better and better over time, making life easier for everyone. It's easy to use, and people of all ages can use it. For example, an old man who can't leave his house can order food, clothes, or other important things online from his bed. He doesn't have to suffer unless he wants to go out.\n\nNow people can find answers to almost any question or fix things by searching online. For example, if a family is struggling and their daughter's computer breaks, they can find a video that shows them how to fix it. They just need to follow the steps, and they can fix the computer without spending any money.\n\nTeachers' lives are also easier now. They can teach in a fun way, so students don't get bored. A good example is Kahoot, which lets students have fun and review at the same time. Teachers can also grade tests and quizzes easily using multiple-choice questions and a Scantron. They can even summarize a whole unit by showing a movie that covers all the events. This is a great way to teach students!\n\nBecause technology is easy to use, people can learn and fix things without spending money. It also helps teachers and students do their work.

{"text_id_kaggle": "099D0608A3B0", "output_essay": "In my opinion, we get more done when we're always doing something. This is because when people stay busy and use their time well, they can accomplish a lot more than if they did nothing. Being busy and active takes up a lot of time, but the results are worth it. It's better to stay busy and achieve your goals. Being busy helps in many ways. It can get rid of bad energy and prevent people from doing bad things. The results of being busy are much better than being inactive. Inactivity can ruin many good things in life that people often don't notice. It's easy to mess up your life in a short time. Thomas Jefferson said it best: 'it is wonderful how much may be done if we are doing.' It's amazing how much you can get done in a short time. Even inactivity can be useful when you need free time or time to relax. Inactivity can mean wasting time or taking a break to calm your mind and soul. Personally, I've made mistakes by thinking I had nothing to do when there was always something I could do to improve myself or something else. I've learned that no matter how good or bad you are at something, you can always fix it by being active and staying busy. That's why I think Thomas Jefferson's quote is perfect."}
{"text_id_kaggle": "723F93E94783", "output_essay": "Albert Schweitzer, a famous philosopher, said, \"Example is not the main thing in influencing others; it is the only thing.\" This is true. To influence people and help them do better, someone needs to set an example. The reason is that humans need examples to learn from and improve. When someone sets an example, others can see the changes in their life and feel motivated to do the same.\n\nHaving an example to look at is the only thing that inspires people to do something useful. For instance, new technology has inspired the new generation to create better products that change the way we live. One creation leads to another. For example, the invention of the telegram led to the creation of the telephone. The telephone inventor used the telegram as an example and created a better way of communication. This chain of examples is improving over time and will have a big impact on the future.\n\nTo get motivated and do better, people need an example to inspire them. For example, I watch motivational videos on YouTube to get motivated. When I watch these videos, I notice that they all give examples. Hearing these examples gives me the motivation I need to stop procrastinating and get my work done. Examples are useful in any situation, not only to inspire but also to teach others not to make the same mistakes.\n\nSome people say, \"I don't need examples to be influenced; I can do it myself.\" But this is not true because, as humans, we need something to rely on to do what we need to do. We need examples to help us achieve our goals. Also, people might say that they can be influenced by other things, but examples are the most effective way to inspire people.\n\nTo summarize, examples are essential in our life because they help us achieve our goals faster and prevent us from making the same mistakes. Examples influence us and the people around us to do something great for our society."}

There will be times when no one is around to tell you what to do. If you always follow others, you'll always rely on them. Sometimes, you need to trust your instincts. If you don't, you might get into trouble because you did what someone else thought was best for you, not yourself.\n\nSecond, it's a good idea to listen to older, wiser people. In the music industry, new artists ask for advice from experienced ones. If they get into an argument, they'll ask for guidance instead of fighting on social media. Life is important, and we can learn from people who have been in our shoes. That's why we seek their advice. And that's my take on this."}
{"text_id_kaggle": "AE96DEBA74B3", "output_essay": "Thomas Jefferson said, \"Determine never to be idle; it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing.\" This means that if we keep working, we can achieve a lot. For example, Thomas Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence, and that's a big accomplishment. We can achieve our goals too if we keep working towards them.\n\nMany high school students set goals for themselves every year. They work hard to achieve those goals. For instance, someone might say, \"My goal is to graduate from high school.\" It doesn't matter if you're a student or an adult; anyone can set a goal and try to achieve it. Michael Jordan, for example, became the world's best basketball player because he set a goal and worked hard to achieve it.\n\nSetting a goal is easy. You just need to think about what you want to do and write it down. The hard part is achieving that goal. Many people fail to achieve their goals. But if you work hard, you can do it.\n\nPlaying sports can also help you achieve your goals. Many athletes set goals and work hard to achieve them. For example, Lebron James said he would lead his team to win the NBA title, and he did it. Tom Brady set a goal to win his sixth Super Bowl, and he achieved it too.\n\nWhen you achieve something, it makes you a better person. You can do anything you set your mind to. For example, I got a job because I worked hard and impressed the people interviewing me. You can make someone's day better by doing something nice for them. Don't give up easily, and make every moment count.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that if we keep working towards our goals, we can achieve them. We can achieve great things in many ways. It also makes us reliable people. So, I believe that we humans are capable of doing amazing things if we trust ourselves."}

I think students learn more when they're at school, not at home. They can socialize better and understand the world outside their homes.\n\nMy first reason is that students learn more when they're at school. My mom always said that being around motivated people helps you learn better. When my mom was in high school, she got help from her teachers and friends. She didn't do homework at home because it's easy to get lazy at home.

I've experienced this myself. We meet new people in class and can ask each other questions. Meeting new people is a good experience because you can make connections and build trust. This helps you prepare for anything, like applying for a job.\n\nAnother reason is that students understand the world outside their homes better when they're at school. Socializing gives you confidence to face challenges. School prepares you for what's outside. One of my teachers, Mr. Generic_Name, told us that life is full of challenges, and you need to face them. He said, 'If you think school is too hard and you prefer to stay at home, you won't like what's outside.'\n\nSome students might say it's better to take classes at home because they don't feel comfortable with other students or they had an accident. But I think students can find a way to solve their problems by talking to their parents or a trusted teacher. If a student doesn't like to socialize, they need to understand that school is not a paradise, but it's better than staying alone at home.\n\nFinally, if some schools offer the option to study at home, it can be helpful. But I think the best way to learn is when you're with other people who are learning the same things as you. You can share your experiences and get support from your teachers. If a student has an accident and can't go to school, it's okay to do their work at home. But when they're better, it's better for them to go back to school."}

Practicing at school helps me get closer to that dream. When I play the violin at school, I feel happy. When I'm sad, I play to cheer myself up. That's why I'm in the choir - to have fun and enjoy playing."}

When we work together with different people and ideas, it's easier and faster.\n\nWhen you work alone on projects, you might not know what to do.

But some people prefer to work alone because they can focus better or they like being alone. \n\nIt's like playing soccer. If you're alone, you can't win. But if you're with a team, you have a better chance of winning. You can work together, make plans, and score goals.\n\nAnother example is boxing. If you're fighting with a partner, you can make plans and win together.\n\nIt's also like working with your family. If you have a wife and kids, you should work together as a team. Don't tell your wife what to do; help her instead. Be nice to her and work together. She's your partner, not your worker.\n\nI think people have forgotten how to work together.

But it can also be fun, whether it's at school, in sports, or in after-school activities. You can always improve your skills, but is it worth it, or would you rather learn something new?\n\nI think repeating a mastered skill is not enjoyable. You already know the basics, so it's not exciting. However, learning a new skill is always fun. You're motivated to keep going and find new ways to improve. One good thing about learning a new skill is that you can help others with it.\n\nFor example, you can use your new skills to help in your community, at the library, in school, or in sports. I've learned new math skills and mastered some topics. But then I moved on to learn new skills, like playing a sport or doing a new activity.\n\nSo, when you've mastered a skill, you can build on it, but it might get boring. It's more beneficial to move on and learn something new in a different way."}

When we're always doing something, our brain is always working to get things done.\n\nMy school, Generic_School, has activities that keep students busy, like soccer. The season just started, and the team is always active because they have practice or games most days. Even with homework, they have to go to practice, which makes the team better and helps them reach their goal.\n\nIn my math class, we all did poorly last quarter, which made our teacher upset. So, she gave us more homework every day. After a few weeks, our grades got better because doing homework daily helped us do well on tests. That's what our teacher wanted - for us to practice and do well in her class.\n\nSome people think you don't need to be active to get more done in life. But being active most of the time can help you get better at achieving your goals and having more experiences.\n\nWhen we're always doing something, our brain is always working to get things done. Many people want to be someone important, and that's what Dominion High School wants for its students. But students have to do their part by always doing something that helps them.

You can get a lot done if you always keep busy.'\n\nI think he's right. If you're always doing something, you can finish almost all your tasks. Even small things like sitting down or waiting are doing something. You might think you're not doing anything, but you're actually resting or waiting.\n\nThink about your daily routine. You wake up, take a shower, go to school, take a quiz, and eat lunch. These small tasks add up to make a big difference. If you forget one task, it can affect everything else. For example, my friend forgot to do one chore, and it ruined his mom's plans.\n\nOn the other hand, doing nothing can also be helpful. Sometimes you need to wait for something good to happen or wait until you're ready. You might need a break or need someone else to do their part before you can continue. Even when you're waiting, you're still doing something.\n\nI believe that doing something is important because it helps you finish your tasks.

I believe that praising poor work lowers standards and undermines learning. In my opinion, true self-confidence comes from achieving something.\n\nFour years ago, I moved to the US and barely spoke English. I remember a incident in my 8th grade Biology class that still upsets me. We had a test, and I scored 44 because of my poor English skills. When I saw my score, I was upset. Then the teacher asked me to pass my test to a boy in the middle table. He started laughing and showed my test to his friends. I was shocked and felt humiliated. I thought my teacher would encourage me, but he was angry and asked how I got such a bad score. I felt like crying and ran out of the classroom. After that, I studied hard to improve my English and get better scores. I didn't want anyone to look down on me.\n\nWhenever I think about that incident, I get emotional. It reminds me of a movie about a black woman who worked in an office with white people. They looked down on her because of her race and gave her tasks that no one else wanted to do. One day, she got a chance to prove herself and did a great job. She got promoted and earned the respect of her colleagues.\n\nAs a Chinese student studying abroad, I've faced many rude comments about my culture and people. Some people say Chinese people are gross or that all Chinese people are smart. One day, a customer got angry at my parents in their restaurant and told them to leave the country because they didn't speak English well. I stood up for them and explained that they work hard to improve their English. I told the customer to respect our culture.\n\nIn conclusion, what you achieve makes you a better person.

For example, if a student is bad at math, they shouldn't work on a group project so everyone can get a good grade. Another example is a student named Generic_Name who wants to make money but does nothing. Generic_Name could start by making a resume and looking for a job. No matter where they start, they'll eventually achieve their goal.\n\nWhat's the point of setting goals if you do nothing? If you study hard to become a politician and run for president, you can make a difference. If there's a war, what would you do out of respect? You could enlist in the US army to help. If you keep your grades up, you could get an award for being a great student. Even small actions can lead to great accomplishments.\n\nDoing nothing serves a purpose, but it doesn't benefit you. For example, Generic_Name has a project due in two weeks but prefers to play video games. By doing nothing, they're only benefiting from playing games, not achieving their project goal. If they balanced gaming and project work, they'd achieve both tasks.\n\nIn conclusion, whether you do something or not, you can still make a difference and achieve something.

{"text_id_kaggle": "01B1CFD8215F", "output_essay": "Each person in this world is unique. They have their own choices. I believe that people should make their own decisions about important life matters. This means they won't rely on others. This is highly recommended because people know themselves best, they learn from their mistakes, and listening to themselves won't lead to blaming others.\n\nFirstly, people know themselves better than anyone else. For example, we face many challenges every day. Sometimes we succeed, sometimes we don't. But we always try to act like everything is fine, so we don't hurt others. Therefore, others don't really know who we are or what we're like. So, I don't think others should make decisions for us; because we know what we like, what we're good at, and what fits our personality.\n\nSecondly, when people make their own decisions and they don't work out, they learn from their mistakes. For instance, as a junior in high school, I'm thinking about my plans after graduation. I talked to seniors and cousins to get ideas. Most of them said they chose four years of university, which is fun. You get to talk to professors, live in a dorm, and experience different lifestyles and cultures.\n\nHowever, I realized that I don't have enough money for university, and I didn't get a scholarship. I noticed that others' lifestyles are different from mine. I changed my decision and learned that everyone's situation is different, and I should choose what's right for me. Copying others won't help my future and might harm me. So, I believe in myself and do what's right.\n\nLastly, listening to yourself won't make you blame others. For example, my friend told me to move out of my family's house after my 18th birthday. She thinks I'm an adult now. But I know my family is important to me, and I don't want to hurt them. If I hurt them, it might come back to me in the future. So, I didn't listen to her and followed my heart. In the end, nobody blamed me, and I didn't blame anyone.\n\nIn conclusion, making your own decisions is important because you know yourself best, you learn from your mistakes, and you won't blame others. People should be independent because others' decisions can be harmful and cause problems in their lives. So, be a person who knows what to do, never looks back, and learns from every step of their decision."}

When you choose, you must be sure it's what you want. You can't let others change your mind. To succeed, don't give up and keep making decisions, even if others disagree.\n\nProof: For instance, making decisions is not easy. You must think carefully about how your choice will help you. If it doesn't, it's a bad decision. Then, you must find a way to fix it and be more careful next time. If you don't make your own decisions, nobody will do it for you. You'll never know how hard it is to decide on your own.\n\nExplanation: Imagine you want two things at the same time, but you can only have one. Some people will tell you which one is better. But you must make your own decision and not let others change it. If you pick something you don't like, it's not your decision. You might have chosen it because someone said it was better. But if you don't like it, it's not good. You'll never learn to make your own decisions if you listen to others.\n\nConnection: Making your own decisions is good because you can do what you want.

But is it a good idea for students to decide on a career at such a young age? Taking classes in high school that will lead to a specific career is not a good idea. It won't help students find out what else they're good at, and it can be stressful.\n\nDuring high school, students are too young to make big decisions. They should take classes they find interesting and discover who they are. It's important for students to figure out what they like to do, who they want to be, and what they want to study.\n\nForcing students to choose a career before high school won't help them discover these things. Some people are already in college and still don't know what they want to study. Knowing what you want to study is a tough decision, and students might make the wrong choice if they're not mature enough.\n\nWhen students enter high school, it's important for them to take classes they really enjoy. It's true that taking classes that will help them graduate is important. These classes will prepare them for the future and help them choose the right career. But taking classes they're passionate about is more important. They might discover what they want to study while taking a class they love. For example, a student might take a dance class and realize they want to study dance.\n\nChoosing a career before high school can be stressful because it's a big decision. Students can't just say, 'I want to study this career,' if they're not sure.

This lets you know what you're working towards. Some people say it's too early to choose a job in high school, but high school is meant to prepare you for college. In high school, you take required subjects to graduate; why not take classes that give you a taste of the job you want?\n\nWhen kids grow up, their parents ask them, 'What do you want to be when you grow up?' They have big dreams, like becoming an astronaut, doctor, or teacher. But they don't know what it takes until they start college; that shouldn't be so. Why do they have to wait until then to know if this job is for them or not? High school is where it needs to start; why start later when the future is here today?\n\nMost college students change their major because they weren't ready or prepared for the classes. This can be prevented by letting students take classes that will help them in the future. When you take job classes in high school, you can figure out if this job path is good for you or not. It's unlikely you'll make a mistake when you start college because you know what you're getting into. High schools require students to take courses to graduate, but not everyone wants to take an art class just because it's required. Sitting in a class that's beneficial to you is more effective because you're receiving information you'll need.\n\nGetting support from students taking job classes in high school means students won't be forced to take courses they're not interested in. Students who are unsure about their passion or what they want to work towards in the future can explore new things to get an idea of some jobs out there. For example, if a student is undecided about becoming a political science major or a nurse, they can take one political science class and one nursing class. This helps the student figure out which job path is best for them.\n\nCommitting to a job once you enter high school is very beneficial for students, even for those who are unsure about what they want to be in the future. Committing to a job opens opportunities for students to learn about different fields. This can also change and open students' minds about their job path. Once they reach college, they'll already know the material, which makes them less stressed about the classes they'll take in college because they got a head start in high school. This can lead to long-term success for students who take job classes in high school."}

When we imagine, we get new ideas that lead to great results. Scientists create new inventions by imagining something new. Our imagination has many advantages.\n\nWhen we imagine, we get new thoughts. To make these thoughts real, we need to research and learn more. For example, if we want to invent something for eagles, we need to learn about them. As we research, our knowledge about eagles grows. I believe that every new invention starts with our imagination. I made a toy for my little cousin sister using a juice tin can, and it all started with my imagination.\n\nWhen we want to invent something, we need to use our knowledge to make it real. For example, scientists want to create a medicine for a disease, so they use what they know about it and gather more information. In all cases, we use our knowledge because of our imagination.\n\nImagining something new is very profitable for us and the inventor. We get to use the invention, and the inventor earns money. To invent things, people need to imagine what they want and plan how to make it happen. Being creative also involves our imagination. I wanted to make a ring for my mom out of metal, so I imagined how I could make it beautiful and unique.\n\nWhen we imagine, we grow our knowledge. We want to make our ideas real, so we find ways to invent them. For example, if I want to make a toy for my dog, I research what the breed likes and how I can make the toy. I learn about the breed and use my knowledge to fit my new idea into the plan.\n\nImagination is not just useful for inventors but also for others, like police officers. A police officer might imagine what happened in a murder case and investigate from that angle. If the officer's prediction doesn't work, they imagine another way to solve the case.\n\nMost people use their imagination every day, even if they call it something else, like being creative or having thoughts. Imagination is beyond our knowledge because we use knowledge to make our imagination real. People should understand that imagination is more important than knowledge, and they can make their imagination real. I believe everyone has the power to imagine and can use it wisely to create or find something new."}

They might not listen to the teacher or pay attention to what's going on around them. They might even forget what they learned. This can be very stressful for students. If a student forgets a lesson, the teacher has to teach it again, which can be stressful for both the student and the teacher. Teachers might also have trouble adjusting to the new schedule and get tired too.\n\nFinland has shorter school days, but they have one of the best school systems in the world. Adding an hour and a half to our school day might not help us and could even hurt us in the long run.\n\nI think our school, Generic_School, doesn't need to be longer. We already have seven-hour school days, and making it longer could make many students unhappy. This could lead to behavior problems like violence, sadness, and anger.

If you do too much work, you might get too tired, and that's not good for your health. There are many examples that show too much work can make you stressed or give you a headache. That's why I don't think they should start an after-school homework club.\n\nOne reason is that you need free time after a long day of school. Many kids get frustrated and angry if they don't get much free time. For example, some students like to take naps after school, but they wouldn't be able to if they had to stay after school. Another example is that they wouldn't want to come to school, and that may be because of too much work. There would also be too many hours of school work, like exams, tests, and quizzes.\n\nSome students have part-time jobs. Having an after-school homework club would cause problems if they have to work. Not all students get free time like others; maybe they want to earn money, but they wouldn't be able to if they add an after-school club. For example, if you work at 3:00 pm, you wouldn't be able to work because clubs can be an hour and a half long, and middle schools usually end at around 2:30.\n\nMy final reason is that teachers and students get tired after a whole day of school. I think they shouldn't add more hours to school, so they have more time to rest and not worry about school work. Teachers can get stressed because of students' behaviors. For example, students not listening to the teacher might make the teachers want to go home early. Even students can get stressed by teachers; it can be because teachers yell too much, and students can get headaches from that.\n\nIn conclusion, they shouldn't add an after-school homework club because students and teachers have other things to do that don't involve school. Having too many hours of school can cause stress and headaches from having to do a lot of homework. Also, many students have part-time jobs, so they wouldn't stay after school.

{"text_id_kaggle": "42031E46ADA3", "output_essay": "The meaning of success is to achieve your goals. Success comes to people who work hard and make an effort. To be successful, people need to take action. If people choose to do nothing, they will not achieve their goals. I believe that taking action helps people achieve more because it teaches them new things, helps them use their time wisely, and helps them learn from their mistakes.\n\nFirst, taking action teaches people new things. To achieve more, people need to learn. For example, if a student doesn't go to school, they can't learn from their teachers, so they can't do well on their homework or tests. When someone doesn't know the meaning of a word, they should ask someone who knows or look it up in a book or online. People who don't try new things or take action will find it hard to learn.\n\nSecond, taking action helps people use their time wisely. Someone who does nothing can't reach their goals. An active person's brain works better and faster than an inactive person's brain. This person will be careful not to waste their time on things that can stop them from achieving their goals. So, they spend their time learning and achieving more. Trying is better than not trying.\n\nThird, taking action helps people learn from their mistakes. Someone who takes action can see what they did wrong. Sometimes, when someone tries something, they might do it wrong, but next time, they'll try a different way because they learned from their mistakes. For example, when someone takes a test, they might get some questions wrong, but if they retake the test, they show they learned from their mistakes and will try to find the right answer. Life is about making mistakes and learning from them. People can't learn everything without making mistakes.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that people can achieve more if they take action. Taking action helps people learn from their mistakes, learn new things, and use their time wisely. When someone achieves more, they get closer to success. Most of the time, success brings people good things. Successful people may feel happier and more calm than unsuccessful people. Taking action is important in this way.

If we don't get a break, we'll forget what we learned.\n\nMany businesses would lose employees, and students wouldn't get work experience. They would be too busy with schoolwork to get a job and earn their own money. This would hurt businesses like water parks, cruises, and beaches that rely on summer visitors.\n\nPeople would also lose connections with family and friends who live far away. They wouldn't be able to visit them during the summer.\n\nWinter is not a good time for a long break because it's too cold to do outdoor activities like playing sports, grilling, or going to water parks. Athletes need time to train for their sports, and a shorter summer wouldn't allow for that. We already have a week-long spring break, so that wouldn't change. In the fall, we're just starting school, and we need time to get to know our teachers, classmates, and the school.

School is already boring with the hours we have, kids have things to do in the afternoons, and we're already in school for a long time.\n\nFirst, school is already tiring. We have to wake up early, go to school, and sit for at least five hours. Many kids get tired easily, so it's hard for us to sit that long. When we get to school, we're already tired.\n\nNext, many kids have plans in the afternoon. If we add more time to school, we'll take away from their free time. Some parents are strict, so kids have a curfew. Adding more time will give them less time to have fun. If they have family things to do, school will get in the way.\n\nFinally, we're already in school for a long time. We get to school at 8:00 a.m. and leave at 3:15 p.m. Many kids don't like the long hours, so why add more? Kids will just complain about the hours.\n\nIn conclusion, many kids find school boring, we're already in school for a long time, and we have personal things to do after school.

We always have fun together. She's a very kind person and always nice to me. I've been close to her since I was a kid. When I was little, she would take me to nice restaurants to eat cheese pupusas, which were my favorite. I like spending time with her because she's always happy and fun to be with. We go to the movies and the pool together. I only get to see her twice a year because she has a job in El Salvador. She comes to Virginia, where I live, during the summer and Christmas to see me and her daughter and have some fun as a family. I don't get to see her much, but when I do, I cherish that time.\n\nIn El Salvador, there are many foods to try, but I only like three. They sell good tamales in the markets.

I buy them all the time when I go to El Salvador. I've been eating them since I was a kid. Pupusas will always be my favorite Salvadorian food.

{"text_id_kaggle": "47DCB7763FF9", "output_essay": "Schools that partner with companies can help students explore the world through internships and find out what they like. What do students want to do in the future? Schools should partner with companies because it helps students know what's best for them. For example, it helps them discover their interests, get opportunities to explore, and communicate with others.\n\nOne reason it's beneficial is that students get to know what they're into. If they get an internship, they can work with people from different cultures. This helps them learn how to work with others and do what they want. Many students don't know what they want to do or be. An internship helps them decide what's best for them. Some students take classes with friends, even if they don't like them, because they don't know what they want. Later, they quit because it's not what they like. This causes trouble for school counselors who have to change schedules. An internship helps students know what they're interested in, so they won't get confused in the future.\n\nAnother reason is that students get many opportunities to explore the world. It's hard for students to learn about the world on their own. An internship is great for exploring and learning new things. It helps students know how the world works and what they can achieve by working with others. They can learn new languages, make new friends, and get a job anywhere they want. In the United States, companies often look for students who speak more than one language because it makes their companies more effective.\n\nThe last reason is that students will be able to communicate and understand how to talk with others. Many students know a lot but don't talk because they're shy or not confident. An internship helps them become more confident. When students work and talk with others, they won't feel shy and will feel confident by practicing.\n\nCommunication is very important. If students don't talk, they won't understand what's happening, which can affect their school lives. Communication skills are essential to improve themselves. If students don't communicate, they won't get ideas or learn new things. Communication gives them the chance to speak and feel confident.\n\nSome people argue that internships are not great for students who already have many things to do. However, if schools partner with companies, this could be the best opportunity for students to experience what they're interested in, discover the world, and become confident and communicative.\n\nIn conclusion, schools that partner with companies help students make confident decisions and not feel shy about them. It also helps them know what they want to do in life. This partnership allows students to learn new things and languages, which is very difficult without an internship. I think students should get this internship to help and improve themselves."}
{"text_id_kaggle": "8D87BB07D992", "output_essay": "Introduction Paragraph\n\nPeople should ask for help from others when making decisions. Most people who make their own decisions without help often regret it. Getting advice from others can give you confidence and direction. Some people think they know what's best for themselves, but that's not always true. Asking for others' opinions is a good idea, especially when you're unsure.\n\n1 Paragraph\n\nAsking for others' opinions is always a good idea. For example, if you're unsure about your future career, you can ask your school counselor or parents for advice. They can help you make a good decision and feel confident about your choice. Making decisions alone can lead to bad outcomes. If you're unsure, ask someone for help - it can be anyone, not just parents or teachers. Most people don't ask for help because they're shy or don't want to share their problems. But being confident and asking for help can make a big difference.\n\n2 Paragraph\n\nPeople who make decisions alone can end up in good or bad situations. Many teens make their own decisions without asking for help, and it often doesn't work out well. Teens often don't care until they face the consequences. You should discuss your situation with your parents or someone you trust, because they have more experience and can give you good advice. Your parents are often the best people to talk to when making a decision.\n\n3 Paragraph\n\nMaking decisions can be easy or hard, depending on the situation. If we make a bad decision, it can affect others. For example, if you're working on a group project and one person makes a mistake, it can affect the whole team. We need to make decisions that benefit everyone. If you're new to a job, don't do anything until your manager tells you to. If you start doing things without knowing what you're doing, it can cause problems. So, make sure to discuss the situation with others. Older people have been in similar situations and can offer valuable advice.\n\nConclusion\n\nAsking for others' opinions is a good thing. Making your own decisions can be good or bad. No matter what, be confident when asking for help. Everyone has the right to make their own decisions, but asking for advice can always help."}

You can show them how to do things step by step. Being there for people and supporting them is also a good example. You're showing them they deserve love and care, and they're worth everything.\n\nSitting with someone and helping them improve a skill is a good example. You can also work with people who are struggling. Social media is important because most people use it. By posting something nice or commenting on something, people will be happy.\n\nShowing people that there are good people out there is important. You can make videos showing kindness, help someone older, or give things away in public. This sets a good example for younger people who are still growing up. Schools should show these videos to kids because they learn more at a young age.\n\nHelping a mom with her kids or a newborn baby is a good example. Adults will try to help you because they're more experienced. You can learn from them and improve on things you find hard to do. This shows that people are helping in different ways and that you can do the same for younger people.\n\nSome people might try to stop you, but you need to show them you're better than that. You can handle everything that comes your way. Don't let people bring you down; keep your head up and don't worry about them.\n\nHelping people from other countries and showing them around is a good influence. You can help them learn a new language and get settled. When they're settled, they'll want to help others too. Helping someone pay for their food because they forgot their money is also a good influence.\n\nHaving someone to help and seeing them happy is one of the best things. Setting a good example is good, but you need to show more than that. People will look up to you if you show them more, and they'll be happy for you.\n\nYounger people will look up to you and say, 'That's how nice I want to be.' Seeing them help other kids is even better. They need to start setting good goals for themselves.

I agree with this statement because if you only do what you're good at, you won't learn anything new. From my experience, learning to fix cars and solve math problems are great examples of this.\n\nI've always been curious about cars and how they work. Now that I'm in high school, I have the chance to attend a special school to learn about cars and how to fix them. We started with brakes. I studied hard to learn everything about brakes. I got so good at changing brakes that I could do it on my own, but I knew I still had a lot to learn about cars, like engines and electricity. If I only stuck to brakes, I wouldn't have learned anything else.\n\nAnother example is when I started high school and learned algebra. At first, I wasn't good at it, but I worked hard and got better. When I mastered algebra, I knew I had to move on to geometry. If I only did algebra, I wouldn't have learned geometry, and I wouldn't have that skill.\n\nSome people might disagree with this statement because there are successful people who only do one thing. However, I believe that no matter what you do, you can always learn more. If you keep learning, you'll have more opportunities in life, and it will teach you valuable lessons. If you stop learning and only do what you're good at, you'll be limited.\n\nThis is why I think it's important to keep learning.

Students need free time to talk to friends and family. Doctors and specialists recommend this. But with longer school days, students won't have time for this.\n\nWe also need time with our families to share thoughts and ideas. Some kids go to after-school clubs, which takes even more time.

Some people prefer to work alone, while others like working in groups. It's all about personal preference.\n\nIn my opinion, working alone is the best option. It lets you do what you want without worrying about what others think. If you make a mistake, you can easily try again. Working alone is a challenge, and I think that's great. It helps you stand by what you believe in. For example, if you have to write about why older people should make decisions, you can give your own opinion without being influenced by others.\n\nOn the other hand, some people think working in a group is better. They like getting help from others and making new friends. Working in groups can also help you make decisions faster. For example, if you're researching ways to improve the US economy, each person in the group can focus on one way.\n\nHowever, I think working alone is still the best option. It has more benefits than working in a group. When you work alone, you're in control and can do things your way. You don't have to agree or disagree with others, which can be stressful. If someone in your group doesn't do their work, it can cause problems for everyone. I remember a time when I had to work in a group to choose a history topic.

They won't have time to get rid of the stress they built up during the school year.\n\nPeople are right that students don't remember much when they come back to school in the fall. However, it's not a good idea to make summer vacations shorter. Students need a break to relax from all the stress they get during the school year. In the summer, you can do many fun activities or travel because the weather is nice.\n\nMany students work hard throughout the school year to get good grades and pass their classes. Giving them a break from all that stress will make them come back with more energy the next year. Many students take school seriously and study, do homework, and stay after school for extra help. This makes them feel more stressed and tired. For example, some students also have a part-time job in the afternoon. They might stay after school and then go to work right away because they don't have time to go home and eat or take a break. These students must feel twice as tired as others, and that's why they deserve summer vacations. If educators make summer vacations shorter, students will feel pressure and stress out more.\n\nPeople like to travel in the summer because the weather is nice. They can decide where to go, which is not possible in the winter or fall because sometimes airlines cancel flights. Visiting different places, like a museum or park, or just staying home and doing fun activities helps people forget about everything and feel good about themselves. For instance, in the last weeks of the school year, school gets harder because students are doing final exams and stressing out. But students know that after that, vacations are coming. What if they only have three weeks of break? Students will feel stressed because three weeks go by fast, and going back to school after that, they won't have time to travel or do fun things. It's a very short time, and maybe they will remember everything from last year, but they'll also feel a lot of pressure, and that's not good.\n\nIn conclusion, educators should not make the summer break shorter. Students need to take a break and relax their minds from all the pressure and stress they get during the school year.

If we add an hour and a half, they'll barely have time to shower, do homework, and eat.\n\nWe shouldn't add an hour and a half to the school day.

The school board should add an hour and a half to the day so students don't have to stay after school, and they can learn more.\n\nNext, students won't need to stay after school because they'll have enough time in class. Teachers will be happy with the extra hour, and students might leave a bit late, but they'll get more learning time.\n\nAlso, students can learn more with longer school days, and teachers can teach two lessons in one class with the extra time.

We go to school for 10 months, and I think we need time to spend with our families and friends. During the school year, it's usually cold and snowy, so summer is the best time to go out and have fun. A 3-4 week break is not enough because I don't think students will want to be in school during the summer. Summer is the best time of the year because we can visit places we can't go to in the winter, like the beach and pool.\n\nMy reasons are why we can't have a short summer break. Many students have summer jobs, and we won't have enough time to spend with our families. If we only have a 3-4 week break, we won't have time to enjoy the summer. We won't be able to go to the beach or do other fun things we can only do in the summer.\n\nIn conclusion, I think students should enjoy their summer. We wake up early every day, and we need a break from school. Summer is the only time of the year when we can have fun and relax. Teachers need a break too, so they can spend time with their families."}

Since students are young, they can learn from others and get ready for their future.\n\nMy first reason is that students can learn more about a company before they decide to work with them. They can visit the company and see if they like it. If they do, they can stay and learn more. If they have questions, they can keep going back until they decide to work with the company.\n\nMy second reason is that students can find out how to get a job more easily through these partnerships. They will have more time to study and do other things they like, such as playing sports. They can stay after school with friends and help each other. I believe many students want to know more about partnerships so they can learn about them.\n\nMy third reason is that students will have more opportunities in the future. They will learn how to work with others, so they won't have problems when they start working with teams. They can meet people who have worked at the company for a long time and learn from their experience.\n\nIn conclusion, I think schools should have partnerships with companies for students who want to learn. I want my school to have a partnership so I can learn more, get ready for my future, and have an easier time finding a job with the company I want to work with. Since I will have experience working with the company, I hope to get a job with them."}

They don't want to go to class without knowing what they're learning about. I know how other students feel about school and why they think it's hard. Remembering can be hard, but it's how we learn. It helps us with tests, our future, and the career we want.\n\nWhen students help each other, they get to know each other better.

Older students have already learned what younger students are learning.

{"text_id_kaggle": "D3B7CFC1E4B8", "output_essay": "Why do people praise students' work to build self-esteem, even if it's not their best effort? Some people think praising students' work helps build self-esteem, while others believe it lowers learning standards. Praising people's work can help in many ways, like making them more confident and creative.\n\nWhen people give you compliments and positive feedback about your work, it gives you confidence. You feel like you can do anything and want to work harder because of the great feedback. Even if you didn't put much effort into your work, you'll push yourself to do better to get more compliments and recognition. For example, imagine you're doing a science project and you're worried that your teacher and classmates won't like it. But when they give you positive feedback, you feel better and more confident. So, when the next project comes around, you make sure to do better.\n\nMoreover, when people praise your work, you don't want to let them down. You think you need to do something bigger and better. You don't want people to give you bad feedback, which can make you feel like you're not smart enough. That's why praising people's work is better, as it gives them a chance to create new ideas. For instance, remember a time when you shared a new idea in a meeting and people liked it? They gave you compliments, which built your self-esteem, and you started to think of new ideas.\n\nHowever, not everyone agrees. Some people think that if you don't tell people the truth about their work, they won't learn from their mistakes. They believe that if you praise someone's work even if it's not good, they'll think they can get away with doing less. But if you tell them what's wrong with their work, they might feel bad and give up. So, when you're doing your work, think of the positive things to avoid stress.\n\nThe real question is, why do people think it's not a good idea to praise people's work, even if it's not their best effort? When people tell you that you did a great job, it makes you feel better, gives you confidence, and makes you want to achieve more. The more people praise your work, the more ideas you have to make it stand out, and the more people will praise you. Even those who believe in being honest would like to receive compliments on their work, even if it's not the best."}

For example, with technology, you can work from home without going out or meeting people. But you also don't give yourself the chance to make friends. You don't share your life or feelings with others. This means that when you're having a hard time and need someone to talk to, you'll keep everything to yourself because you don't have friends. Not expressing your feelings can lead to depression and health problems. Using technology to avoid human contact is not helping; it's making life harder.\n\nPeople who use technology all the time don't share with their families. For example, my brother is always in his room playing video games. We can spend the whole weekend at home without seeing each other. I barely see him, and it's not a good situation. I want to spend time with him, talk about school, and share my life. Unfortunately, I can't, and it's all because of technology that's separating families every day. It's sad to see people on their phones all the time when they could be talking to others in real life.\n\nTechnology lets you shop, play games, and read books online without talking to others. However, there's nothing more fun than hanging out with friends and doing the same things together. For example, on a Saturday morning, you can shop online from home, but it's boring and stressful.

Parents think it's good to have a phone, iPad, or laptop until they get addicted to it, though. Especially teens, they try to hide things from their parents.

It would reduce their time with family and friends, leave them with less time for homework and studying, and cause stress.\n\nIf the school day is longer, students would have less time to spend with their family and friends. For example, if you have plans with a friend who goes to a different school, you wouldn't have much time together.

Adding an hour and a half to the school day would affect a student's social life.\n\nThe longer school day would also affect the time students have for homework and studying. They would need to balance their time between socializing and doing homework. If they don't, they might fail and have to repeat the grade. You might need to study for a test and do math homework, but you wouldn't have enough time for both. It would be hard to study and do homework if the school day is longer. It would also be stressful.\n\nThe extra time would mean extra classes, which means more work. If the school day is longer, you would have to take two more classes.

Extra classes also mean you need more school materials, which some parents can't afford.\n\nIn conclusion, I don't think it's a good idea to add an hour and a half to the school day. It would reduce the time students spend with family and friends, leave them with less time for homework and studying, and cause stress."}
{"text_id_kaggle": "242632EC61DF", "output_essay": "Today, some people prefer to work alone, while others prefer to work in a group. Working in a group has many benefits, such as finishing difficult tasks, sharing ideas, dividing the workload, improving communication, and preparing us for a good performance. Some people may prefer working alone because they enjoy it, but it doesn't have the same benefits as working in a group. Teamwork is helpful and feels good.\n\nIf people like to help each other, why not work in a group? It's helpful to have a team to help me. If I don't know something, my team can help me. If I make a mistake, they can correct me. By helping each other, we can finish our task. Seeking help is important. It's always good to help each other.\n\nWorking in groups finishes tasks more efficiently than working alone. We use our skills together to gather more information. People who work alone may not have access to as much information as a group does. Working alone is not helpful, especially when there's nobody to ask questions, and all I have is the internet, which I don't trust as much as my team.\n\nBy working with others, I can improve my productivity and do well in our performance. I'm more active when I work with others, asking questions or seeking their opinions. Working alone is not as productive. Working in groups gives us the opportunity to have a good performance. We all want to fix our mistakes and learn, so we have a good performance in the end. Working in a group creates less work for each individual and increases productivity.\n\nWorking in a group is better because new ideas are generated. Sharing thoughts and ideas is important. Communicating with others helps us know what to do and not do, which is important. As a team, we finish tasks faster. We gather facts from different points of view, which creates diversity, and diversity is key to success.\n\nWorking alone is not as helpful. Studies show that people who work alone have more work. There aren't many helpful sources around, except the internet, which isn't as helpful as a team. They have more responsibilities and more to worry about.\n\nOverall, I think working in groups is beneficial because it creates less work and allows us to finish tasks faster. Working together shows criticism from team members, which produces our final product, our performance, and creates different points of view. If we treat each other like a team, motivation increases, and we students can communicate with each other. Even though many students don't agree, working in a group is more beneficial than working alone."}

They can just search for the information they need. The internet is also easy to access. However, I believe visiting a company is important. Students can learn more about their future job and share their experiences with others.\n\nIf students visit your company, they can find out if they like the work.

For example, when people work together, they can come up with great ideas and good words. Also, people can have more than one idea, so you can learn new things.\n\nWorking with a group helped me a lot. When I was in fifth grade, I didn't like working with others. I liked to work alone. People would ask me to work with them, and I would say no. I would struggle to finish my work by myself. Then my teacher gave us a group project, and we needed at least four students. I had to join a team, so I worked with them. We came up with great ideas together. I had some ideas, and my teammates had even better ones. After that, I never worked alone again. I always looked for someone to work with.\n\nWhat I learned that day is that you should always try new things. One thing I like about working in groups is being creative. I tell my friends that when you work in groups, your attitude is important. What I mean is don't judge people by how they look. When you work in a big group, you'll meet many different people.\n\nWorking with others is better than working alone. If you get stuck, your teammates can help you, and you can work together."}

When you work by yourself, it's easier and you can work harder because you decide what you want to achieve in the future.\n\nIn my opinion, working alone is better because you won't be distracted by others. For example, when you work with others, you might not be as good as them because everyone thinks and has different skills differently. I remember when I first came to America, my art teacher gave me a project, but I didn't understand what to do. A friend helped me, and I finished the project on time.\n\nAnother reason working alone is better is that you're sure about what you're doing, and you can express your own ideas. You can develop your own skills and decide what you want to be in the future. I think working alone is easier because you can focus better and work harder every day to achieve your goals.\n\nSome people might say that working with others is easier, but I think working alone leads to better results. When you work alone, you feel more comfortable because you're trying to be the best you can be. You're in charge of your future and can do great things.\n\nOverall, working alone is better because you try to do your best, and the most important thing is that you're in control of your future."}

For example, if you forget your wallet at the store, you can use your phone to pay. Technology also helps students learn. They can use computers or phones for school projects or catch up on missed work online. Kids also have fun playing games with friends online.

When students work together, they can finish their work faster and get it graded. This makes the teacher's job easier. Students can also learn more about a subject and get to know each other.\n\nWhen students work together, they can share their ideas and insights. Each student has a different view on a subject, so they can help each other. Working in a group can also help students finish their work faster. However, it's important for the teacher to put the right students together in each group. If students who are friends work together, they might not focus on their work.\n\nAs a high school student, I know that my friends prefer to work in groups. They think it's faster and more fun. But sometimes, one student does all the work, and the others just copy. This is a problem because it's not fair to the student who did all the work.\n\nIf I were a teacher, I would want my students to work in groups more often. This would help them work together, talk to each other, and understand the material better. It would also help them get better grades. I think this is a good way to keep students engaged and focused in class.\n\nIf a student doesn't understand something, their group members can explain it to them. This can help them understand the material better. I think this is true because I often ask my friends to explain things to me, and it helps me remember.\n\nStudents should take advantage of the opportunity to work in groups. If they don't understand something, they can ask their group members for help. This can help them learn more and get better grades.\n\nI think teachers should consider this: students need more time to socialize and talk to each other, not more time on their devices. This would make students and teachers happy. Teachers would get grades in earlier, and students would have more opportunities to ask questions and learn from each other. I think this would create a perfect classroom environment."}

I'll always be available if you need help.\n\nI think the best job for me is working in a store like Target or Walmart. I'm good at this kind of job because I have worked in a store before. I got many awards for being a good worker, being kind to everyone, and always having a smile on my face.\n\nSome people think working in a store is hard because you might not know the answer to a customer's question. But most of the time, you have a device that can help you find the answer. You can look up where an item is or when someone asks you where to find something.\n\nOthers think working in a store is easy because they've been doing it for a long time. I agree because the more you work, the more you learn. My parents and friends tell me I'm a hard worker and I never give up.

When you're young, you don't know what you want to do, or you might want to do many things and can't choose just one. Do you think it's a good idea for students to pick a career at a young age? No, because at that age, we're not sure, and we have many ideas in our minds that we can't decide on.\n\nFor example, one day I might want to be a flight attendant, and I'm happy for a few days. But then I change my mind and want to work with cars. This shows that we don't know what to choose for our career at a young age.\n\nSome people think it's a good idea because you start planning what you like and find a career that fits you. It also helps you think about your future goals, like where you'll live or if you'll move to another state. It can prepare you for the real world and prevent negative thoughts. In some places, students are expected to choose a career by high school, which puts a lot of pressure on them. It's like saying, 'You need to do this before you do that.' Kids get stressed because they think too much and don't know which job to prepare for.\n\nMy idea is that we should let students take their time. Let them finish middle school easily before they enter high school with a lot of pressure. Let young people choose what they want without pressure. Committing to a career at a young age is both good and bad. It's good because you start thinking, but bad because you might change your mind quickly. My position is that we shouldn't force students to pick a career at a young age. They have their whole life to think about careers, and all that thinking can cause problems. My conclusion is that adults should let students take their time and not force them to choose a career quickly. Let them live their life and plan easily, so they can choose what they really want to do."}

The world is not all good or all bad, but we can make it better if we stop waiting and start doing something. It won't change unless we make it change. If someone is strong and willing to take action, it's amazing to see what we can do. We've done many good things over the years, but we also have bad habits that have hurt the world. We need to take care of the world to show we can be good and make a difference. If we work together, we can make a better world. We should never forget who we are and that we're hurting the world and ourselves. We're wasting our resources on wars instead of using them to live happy lives. We should show everyone that if we work together, we have the power to be happy. Humans may not be the smartest, but we can do something and keep going. We should never stop trying and look back only to learn from our mistakes. Kids today have a lot to learn, and they're the next step in life. We're not doing a good job showing them that hard work pays off. They think phones can do everything, but we need to teach them to use their minds. I want my kids to be strong and nice, not reliant on phones. They'll accomplish more than us if they know that hard work pays off.

Thomas Jefferson once said, 'Never be idle... It's amazing how much you can do if you're always doing.' But I don't agree with him. When you're not busy, you have more time to plan events or solve problems in detail. You can spend time with your family and make memories. You won't miss important events like birthdays, dance recitals, or school plays.\n\nYou'll have time to plan a problem or a special event carefully. This is one reason I disagree with Thomas Jefferson. For example, if your daughter is getting married in seven months, you'll want time to plan the wedding. You'll not only plan the wedding but also get to walk her down the aisle and hear her say 'I do.' On the other hand, being active can earn the money to pay for the wedding without struggling. But you'll have that covered because you had time to overcome the problem.\n\nSpending time with your family is key to a happy life. This is another reason I disagree with Thomas Jefferson. Having a child is a wonderful gift. You'll have time to prepare for the baby's arrival, build a crib, and decorate the nursery. By not always being busy, you'll have time to watch your child grow, teach them new things, and make special memories. You'll have time to give to the people you love.\n\nIn conclusion, I disagree with Thomas Jefferson. You don't have to be always active to achieve something great. You can achieve great things when you're not always active. That's why I disagree with Thomas Jefferson and believe you don't have to be always active to achieve something great in life."}

Everyone can contribute their ideas, and if I make a mistake, I have others to help me. Working with people is good because you meet new friends, get help when you need it, and can help others too. It's great to help others when they need it. When you work alone, you might get stuck and have no one to help you. That's why working in a group is better. I support working in a group because it shows you can be a good leader and work smart. You help others, and they help you when you need it. When you work alone, you might run out of ideas, and your teacher might be busy helping others. That's why I think working in a group is better.\n\nI know some people like working alone, but it's good to try new things, meet new people, and have fun while doing your work. When I work in a group, I feel happy because I can talk to someone if I get stuck. I used to dislike working in a group because I thought one person might do all the work and take credit for it. But now that I work with a good group, I don't have to worry about that. I still believe working in a group is best because it's happened before. You have to trust people sometimes, and it's hard to trust people. But when you work as a team, you can get people working together.\n\nIt's great to work together because when you turn in your work, everyone gets a good grade, and everyone is happy. They know the group helped with the work. So when the teacher gives them work, they know which group to work with to pass. In college, you'll be working in groups, and it's going to be hard. I've seen people working together, asking each other for help, and putting their skills together. That's why I like working in a group; everyone helps each other to get a good grade. It's not going to be easy, but when you work as a group, you know you're in good hands. You know people will help you if you get stuck, and their ideas will help you in the future."}

Usually, people in a group help each other, and it's harder to work alone. Even though some people think working alone is better, working in a group is better because of shared work and help from others.\n\nFirst, working in a group is better because everyone does their fair share. This means people don't have to worry too much about their workload. In short, people like to share the workload so they can finish it and feel relaxed. Shared work is better for group projects.\n\nNext, working in a group is better because people can help each other. Some people need help with things they don't know or have forgotten. In a group, they can ask their partners for help. Also, their friends can help them stay focused. It's clear that helping each other is a benefit of group work.\n\nOverall, working in groups can be very good and helpful. People like working in groups because they can make friends and finish their work on time. Often, teachers create groups with different students, so they can make friends from their class.

{"text_id_kaggle": "4BB857FA140D", "output_essay": "Technology has a big impact on our daily life. It lets us do tasks without interacting with others. Technology plays a vital role in our life. One reason it's important is that we can't find important information without it. For example, if something happens in a place we know, we can find out what happened. Another reason is that technology helps us communicate with others, like our families or friends, no matter how far away they are. A third reason is that technology helps us complete many tasks, like doing homework research, which can help us learn new things, such as a new language or how to do things like fixing a bike or a computer. Technology is crucial because without it, we wouldn't know important information, like the weather forecast.\n\nTechnology has its advantages, but it also has its disadvantages. Technology is important, but we need to use it correctly. Technology is great, but some negative things are that we use it too much, like texting our friends all the time. Another reason is that it can distract us. For example, in class, some people can be on their phones, texting or doing something else, and they won't pay attention to the teacher. Technology can be good or bad; the key is to use it in a way that helps us, not hurts us. If we use technology correctly, we can be successful someday, because it gives us opportunities to achieve our goals; we just need to use it in a good way and not for bad things."}

Most students look forward to summer vacation, but some educators think it's too long and that students forget what they learned when they return to school in the fall. I don't agree with them because sometimes you need to rest, study, enjoy life, and work to get what you want.\n\nWhen you're in school for too long, you can get frustrated and feel like your brain is going to explode. You might want to learn new things and expand your knowledge. Sometimes you want to travel to a place that makes you feel comfortable and learn new things that can help you in the future. You might want to visit your grandparents and tell them about your life.\n\nSometimes you want to work during the summer to buy something your parents won't buy for you. Working can teach you how life outside of school works.

To be honest, I don't think anyone likes homework, but it's necessary. For example, I dislike homework, but I like the idea of homework clubs. I hope my school starts one. It's a great way for students and teachers to get to know each other better. Students can express their feelings and get help with difficult subjects. Teachers can be proud of their students' good grades, and students can make their parents proud. It's a win for everyone. I fully support this idea. The club should allow students to bring their own food and snacks. It should meet every other day. Homework is important in school, and not doing it can have bad consequences. Overall, I think teachers are nicer now than they used to be. They want their students to succeed. They help students pass their classes, go to college, and find a good job. Teachers are always there to help, but you need to show them you want their help. If you're doing the work but don't understand it, they'll help.

{"text_id_kaggle": "0F1285CEAE53", "output_essay": "Everyone knows that some people are good at what they do. However, sometimes these individuals don't feel confident about their skills. There are talented people everywhere. When they know their limits, having experience is a good sign for them to move forward. Ralph Emerson, a famous writer, said something that makes you think about growing. He said that growth happens when you gain experience in your work. I agree with that: unless you try something new, you will never grow.\n\nTo begin, when you have experience, you can move forward in your job. You can look for a better position because of the experience you gained from working hard. There's no need to do something you've already done. A negative mindset makes you think you can't do it, and you keep trying, even though you've already mastered it. With this experience, you can teach someone, share, and then move on. So, learn something new. When a student asks you for help in Science and you got an A last year in that class, you can share and help the student by teaching them with the knowledge and experiences you have.\n\nMoreover, you don't need to do it again. That means you've already done it. People don't grow when they're still doing the same thing. Lack of belief in yourself is a big obstacle. That means you need to start believing in your skills, and you'll get amazing results from your work. Experience is just a step to keep moving forward and not stay in the same place. Doing things you've already mastered is boring for some people. If you learn something new in class, then you can move on to another topic. Don't do it again because you're not going anywhere. A student took a test and got a B+ grade. But the student is not happy because they didn't get an A. The student decides to retake the test because they think they can get an A. It's not good for the student because not everyone needs to get an A, and a B+ is a very good grade.\n\nLastly, not knowing when you're done can lead to bad results. You need to know when you've finished your goal so you don't keep going. Having a clear mind about what you're doing is very important. As soon as you know the truth about your experience, it may make you grow. Look at the life cycle; things never stop growing. So, you have the same path to follow. Doing something you've already mastered doesn't make you grow. Simply, you do your work, get experienced, finish, and move on. A student who likes to do everything with details and wants to get an excellent grade has a project. The project is to talk about the two strands in DNA. The student has the option to write an essay or present slides. The student decides to write an essay; everything was good in the essay. But the student decides to do the project in slides too. So, the student presents both to the teacher by the due date. By the end of the semester, the student looks at the grade book and checks the grade of the project. The student has a D because they turned in two ways to turn in the project. When just the essay was enough.\n\nIn conclusion, if you keep doing the same thing you've already mastered, you'll never grow. You need to be positive and know your experience well. Follow the life cycle. Don't stop and keep working hard. Have experience, and don't keep doing the same thing; know when you're done. These are some reasons why you're not growing. Growing is part of our life."}

For example, when I worked on a group project about World War 1, everyone shared their thoughts and ideas.\n\nWorking in a group also helps you learn new things. You hear new ideas and information from your team members. Even if you don't agree, you think about it and remember it. I remember discussing Romeo and Juliet with my classmate, and my friend made a great point about why it's the greatest love story.\n\nSurrounding yourself with people also gives you the chance to make new friends. You can talk about more than just the assignment. You can share your interests, hobbies, and stories. I met a friend while working on a project, and after we finished, we got to know each other and had a good laugh.\n\nIn conclusion, working in a group is better because you communicate more, learn new things, and make new friends.

Goals help you strive to do better.\n\nIf you start planning for a career early, you and your family can learn about the requirements. You can ask your counselor about the minimum GPA needed. You can also look for colleges that fit your career goals. Your parents can start planning how to pay for college.

Today, scientists have created amazing technology that is very helpful, like phones, planes, and apps. It can be amazing how much it can help people. For example, when people need to talk to someone, they can just take their phones and make a call, even if they are far away. But technology also has a negative impact because it makes people too independent and less sociable.\n\nFirst, using technology too much can hurt people's health. Many people spend hours playing video games and don't do any exercise. They stay in their rooms and don't know what's happening around them. This can make their bodies weak and sick. Playing video games can also hurt their eyes. Some kids even think life is like a video game and do bad things. So, technology can hurt people's health, body, and brain.\n\nIn addition, using technology too much can damage relationships. It can distract parents from taking care of their children. For example, a kid might ask his dad for help with homework, but his dad is watching TV and says he's tired. The kid then asks his mom, but she's on social media and says the same thing. The parents have time to help, but they choose to watch TV and use social media instead. This can make the kid feel like his parents will never help him, and he might stop asking for help.\n\nSome people might say that technology makes things easier and safer. For example, you can buy things online and don't have to go to the store. But I think this argument is weak. We can do these things without technology, and people are becoming too dependent on it. People use technology to have fun, solve problems, and learn new things. This makes them less sociable, which can affect their relationships.\n\nTechnology has brought some good things, like communication and scientific advances. But it has also brought many negative things, like video game addiction and damaged relationships. Looking at all the reasons, I conclude that using technology too much has a negative impact on human lives."}

We can't be lazy. If we don't do anything, we'll never achieve anything. You might think you're not good at anything because you can't achieve one thing. But when you want to achieve something, you need to take action, and if you don't, it might feel like you're giving up too easily. Giving up too easily can ruin everything, and you'll regret not trying hard enough.\n\nAnother reason I think we need to take action is that there might be something hard for you to do, but you'll need to do it if you want to achieve it. When something is hard, you might fail a few times, but that's okay. You can try again, and eventually, you'll succeed. When you do, you'll feel great about yourself, and you'll want to do more things you never thought you could.\n\nThe final reason I think we need to take action is that when you achieve something, you'll feel happy.

This helps the younger students' brains grow. I think it's a good idea to have older and younger students together in a program because older students can get community service, teach new things, and help the program.\n\nFirst, older students can get community service by helping younger students in programs. This helps younger students understand what they're learning better. Younger students can also learn something new, which might be different from what older students learned. They might even teach older students a new way of doing things.\n\nAnother reason I agree is that older students can teach younger ones what they haven't learned yet. Older students can share their mistakes so younger students can avoid making them. Younger students can learn from these mistakes and not repeat them. Older students can also give advice or help with problems. Many young students struggle with depression, anger, or loneliness, so they can talk to older students. Older students can help with homework or making friends.\n\nFinally, programs need help from older students because there are often many kids and not enough teachers. Teachers are busy grading papers, giving tests, and meeting with parents. Older students can make a big difference by helping teachers and younger students. They can be role models and show younger students what's good for them. Younger students can have friends, and teachers can be happy about the help.\n\nIn conclusion, older and younger students work well together.

If someone doesn't know what to do, they can ask for help. In a group, we talk to each other. We can learn a language easily by talking. When I came to the US, I didn't know English. I started talking to other students, and I learned. If I didn't know a word, I asked my teacher or friends, and they helped. In a group, we can learn each other's language. Working alone makes it harder to learn a language. Some students learn a language on their own, but it takes longer.\n\nSome students don't like group work. They don't want to talk to others, and some are shy. But group work is better. In a group, we help each other finish work quickly. We can finish on time. Group work helps us communicate.

You can spend time with family and friends, take a break from hard work, and enjoy life.\n\nMy first reason is that you get to spend time with family and friends. When I'm sad, my friends ask me to play basketball at the park. We have a lot of fun shooting hoops and playing games. When we leave, I forget why I was sad and go home with a smile. My family also loves going to the park. We get bored at home, so we ask our parents if we can go out. We walk to the park and play basketball, go on the swings, and have a great time. We don't even notice how long we've been there.\n\nMy second reason is that you get a break from hard work and can relax. After school, I often do a lot of work and feel stressed. To relax, I go to the park and play basketball. I just shoot around, practice, and take it easy. After that, I feel much better. I'm not in a bad mood when I go to school, and I can work harder.\n\nMy final reason is that going outside is better than wasting time on your phone or computer. When I get home from school, I don't want to spend all my time on my phone. I go to the park and play soccer or basketball. It's way more fun than being on my phone. I used to waste my time on my phone, but then I started playing basketball. Now, I'm good at it, and people ask me to play with them. When we're at the park, we don't use our phones at all. We just have fun and enjoy life.\n\nSo, going outdoors is a great idea. You can spend time with family and friends, take a break from hard work, and enjoy life. Next time you're bored, go to the park and have some fun."}

If students don't study for a long time, they forget what they learned when they come back. I have three reasons to support this idea.\n\nFirst, winter has many short breaks. For example, there's Thanksgiving break and Christmas break. Some students come back late because they want to spend time with their families. When they return, they have a lot of work to catch up on.\n\nSecond, winter weather often cancels school. The cold and snow make it dangerous to drive, and the low temperature can be life-threatening. Rain also makes the streets icy, causing accidents.\n\nThird, it's hard for students to come back to school after a long break. They don't want to do anything, and teachers give them a lot of work to do quickly. This stresses students out because they have too much to do in a short time.\n\nIn conclusion, I think winter vacations are a good idea. Students would feel better if they didn't have to deal with school cancellations and could have a long break in the winter. This would be better for everyone's well-being."}

It's a great idea that's good for students. It gives them the chance to learn more and shows them that it's not just about when school ends, it's about getting an education. Without it, we wouldn't be able to get through life. If we didn't have this chance, some students wouldn't get the education they need.

It can also help people who come to the United States and need to learn English.\n\nIn my opinion, technology has a positive impact on people's lives. It allows people to do many things without leaving their homes. We can use technology to fill out papers for work or to find a job online. Many places ask us to do this online because it's easier. At school, we can use technology to join a team or try out for a sport. Some teachers give us homework online, and we can study for tests on our phones. I think this is helpful because I can take practice tests and know if I'm ready for the real test.\n\nSome people prefer to read on their phones, computers, or tablets instead of reading books. This is because it's easier to carry and they can get all the information they need. They can even read at home instead of going to the library. For example, my cousin likes to read on her tablet because she forgets to return library books and doesn't want to pay for them.\n\nTechnology also helps people take classes online.

How do you build self-esteem? Some people think praising a student's work helps. Others think achieving things is the best way. Does self-esteem come from praise or achievement? Achievement is the real way to build self-esteem because it helps students set higher goals and motivates them to work harder.\n\nAchievement is the best way to build self-esteem because it helps students set higher goals. Even small achievements make people confident. When students complete a task, it boosts their self-esteem. They want to set higher goals and do more difficult tasks, which helps them keep their self-esteem and expect better results. Setting higher goals is the first step to building self-esteem. For example, getting good grades on tests makes students realize how important it is and want to do even better next time.\n\nThere's no better way to motivate students than by showing them their own achievements. When students see their results, they get confident and want to do their best. Their self-esteem makes them want to do better than before.

Some people suggest that summer vacation should be shorter, around 3 to 4 weeks, and have a longer winter break instead. I will share my opinion on this issue and provide reasons to support it.\n\nFirst, students do forget what they learned during the school year when they're on summer vacation. They're not in school, so they don't want to read books or do writing to remember what they learned. They feel free from school, homework, and studying for tests. I think students deserve a long summer break after working hard all year. They can spend time with friends, go to the movies, or travel. I think summer is the right time for this.\n\nSecond, students can't remember everything they learned, but they can review it at the beginning of the year. Students just want a long break to rest their brains. Some students love going to the beach or pool, and summer is the perfect time. They can't imagine having a short summer break. Students start making plans for the break as soon as summer begins. They get excited when winter is almost over.\n\nThird, students enjoy summer because they can do many outdoor activities. Some students prefer summer so they can get a part-time job or do other things during the day. For example, some students like sports. Students love that summer break is long, so they can enjoy it without worrying it will end soon. They also prefer summer break to travel or visit family and friends.

I want to visit companies to decide my future career, gain experience, and learn about the work environment.\n\nOne benefit of visiting companies is deciding my future career. Students need to decide on a career before finishing school so they don't waste time trying different jobs. My teachers say students need to set goals in school. If students know their goals, they can start working towards them. My uncle didn't know what career he wanted after high school, and he wasted a year trying to figure it out. I'm asking to visit your company so I can start working towards my goal. I read that McDonald's closed because their employees retired, and no one wanted to take their place. Students are your future employees, so let us visit your company and decide if we're interested in a certain career.\n\nAnother reason to visit your company is to gain experience. Companies want employees with experience. In my workplace, a student without skills wasn't hired. No company wants an inexperienced employee. My parents say every workplace needs experience. Without experience, students will struggle to find jobs. Our society wants students to have both education and a career. If students see people with education but no career, they might not want to go to school. By respecting our society and teaching the next generation, please let us visit companies and gain experience. If a student wants a high-paying job, they need experience. If we learn from your company, we'll have better careers in the future. If we want our country to remain a superpower, students need experience.\n\nVisiting your company also lets us learn about the work environment. In my workplace, new students don't know how to behave. If we visit your company, we'll learn how to act in the workplace. Our future careers will be more successful. Every workplace wants good morale. With good morale, employees will act like they're part of a family. Every employer wants coworkers with a positive attitude. To have a positive attitude, we need to visit companies and learn more about the workplace.\n\nIn conclusion, managers should select students to visit their companies to learn about their desired careers, learn about workplace morale, and gain experience.

The older student could take notes on how to write lessons, so they would be prepared to write lessons for their own class later.\n\nI also think that helping in a classroom with younger students would help older students know what to teach and what not to teach. When you're young and learn something new, it stays in your mind for a long time. If older students teach at a young age, they would remember the teaching skills for a long time. As they get older, they wouldn't have to worry about how to write lessons and could start their class right away.\n\nI believe that having older students help in a school with younger students would help younger students learn new things. They could learn interesting things from the older students, like why they wanted to become teachers. This would make younger kids want to come to school every day and enjoy their school days more. They would understand what they're learning more quickly.\n\nHaving high school students teach would be more fun for younger kids because older students know what it's like to be in elementary and middle school. They know how hard and boring school can be. If they teach, class wouldn't be as boring, and they would make the topics more fun and easier to understand. Younger students would want to learn more.\n\nIn conclusion, I think that having this program would help many high school students achieve their dreams. Both older and younger kids would enjoy working together, and class wouldn't be too hard for the teacher to control. Students wouldn't be stressed out about going to school and doing work all day. I think it would be better if they had this program."}

Some students have responsibilities outside of school.\n\nFirst, many students have things to do after school. They may have other classes, like swimming lessons. They need to take care of their pets, help their family, or clean their home. Some students don't have time for extra hours, or they need to be somewhere else at a certain time. If we add an hour and a half, what will they do with that time?\n\nSome students also need to take care of their younger siblings. Others need to cook at home. Some students have health problems and need to see a doctor daily. Some have a sick family member they need to care for. They may need to go with their family to buy food or do other things at home. When will school end if we add more hours? Students whose parents pick them up will know the new schedule, but they might not like it.\n\nIf we add more hours, students will have less time with their families. They will only see them on weekends and at night. I think it's a bad idea to add more than an hour and a half.\n\nFinally, adding more hours can affect teachers' plans. Teachers have their own things to do, like cooking or taking care of their children. They need to prepare lessons for the next day or plan for assemblies. If we add more time to the school day, teachers will have to adjust their schedules too. They might even need to find a substitute teacher if they have an appointment."}

For example, helping homeless people, those who can't afford food, or those who can't buy clothes can make a big difference. If one person can do it, others can too.\n\nMany teenagers spend too much time on their phones or other devices, which makes society focus more on social media than on other activities like sports or spending time with friends. Research shows that using phones for too long is bad for our health. So, parents should limit their kids' phone use and encourage them to do other things.\n\nWe can also influence others by being loyal, responsible, and confident. This makes a good impression and can inspire people in many ways. For example, being loyal to our parents shows them we can make our own decisions. Being on time at work shows others we're responsible. And being confident in ourselves can inspire others to believe in themselves too.\n\nAll these ways can inspire people to help others, make good choices, and believe in themselves."}

We would have to write letters, which would take a long time to arrive. I think technology is good for us. It helps me become the person I am today. I enjoy playing games and talking on the phone because it makes me happy.\n\nShopping online is easier because I don't have to deal with crowds and arguments at the store. I can find what I need online, and they always restock items at the same price.\n\nTechnology has greatly improved the way we work. It helps me finish tasks quickly and efficiently. When I was younger, I struggled with math homework because I wasn't good at it. But when I learned how to use a computer, I could finish my homework in just 10-15 minutes. I watched videos that explained the work, and it made it easier for me.\n\nIf you use technology correctly, it can improve your life.

I think the school board should not make the school day longer because students have a lot of things to do outside of school. Here are some reasons why.\n\nSome students have to take care of their brothers and sisters after school. Their parents work when they get home from school. If the school day is longer, their parents will be late for work because they have no one to take care of their kids. Some students have to work or help their parents with money. Many students have a single mom or dad who needs help. Some students need to support their families.\n\nMost students need to study or do their homework after school. They have tests the next day and need to study for them. Many students are behind on their homework and need time to finish it. Students are also very tired and just want to rest after school. They want to sleep and refresh their minds.\n\nSome students tutor younger kids after school. They help them with their homework or study a subject. They want to help, but if the school day is longer, they won't have time. Many students play sports and have practice after school. Their coaches don't want them to be late because they have a lot to do. Coaches are strict about being on time.\n\nSome students go to church after school. They need to go there to help or pray. Their parents don't want to be late to church and are strict about it. If the school day is longer, the students' parents won't be happy. Some students do community service after school. They need to do it to pass a class or for something important. They don't want to be late because they just want to finish it.\n\nSome students' parents might be sick, and they might be the only one to take care of them. What if something bad happens to their parents when they are at school for another hour and a half? We shouldn't take that risk. Many students have to visit their family members after school. They need to get on the road after school because there won't be traffic, but if the school day is longer, they will be late and there will be a lot of traffic.\n\nAnother reason is that students are sleepy and might sleep during class. Teachers don't want that because it distracts other students. Students just want to go home and sleep because they wake up early to get ready for school. They are tired of waking up early and hate to get out of school later than normal.\n\nMany students have to pick up their brothers and sisters at the bus stop. If they don't get there on time, the bus driver will take them back to school. But they have no way to pick them up from school. When their parents find out that they were late, they will get mad at their child and the school board. It's not their fault that they were late; it's the school board's fault because they made the school day longer.\n\nMany students have appointments after school. They don't want to be late because they don't want to go back another day. If they're late, they might have to make another appointment. In conclusion, students have a lot of things to do after school. They have to help their parents or families; they don't want to be late or miss anything important."}

When you try new things, you'll be more likely to try other new things too. This can help you reach new heights and achieve more than you thought possible.\n\nWhen you try something you're not good at yet, you can learn more and gain experience. For example, if you join a soccer program, you'll learn how to play soccer and get more experience. The same goes for an art program - you'll learn more about art and get more experience. This is a great way to see how smart you can be.\n\nIf you keep trying new things, you'll become less nervous and afraid. It's like doing a presentation in front of your classmates - if you just do it, you won't be nervous anymore. This can help you build confidence in yourself and others. You'll be able to do what you've always wanted to do and decide if you want to keep going to achieve more.\n\nFinally, trying new things can help you achieve long-term goals. When you gain knowledge and build confidence, you can use them to achieve your goals. For example, if you want to become a pilot, you'll need to learn about aviation and gain experience. This knowledge and confidence can help you reach your goal faster and make it easier to understand.\n\nI strongly believe that this statement is true - if you don't try new things, you'll never grow. I think that trying new things can help you gain knowledge, confidence, and achieve new goals. If people keep trying new things, they can become wiser.

So, I think there shouldn't be an after-school homework club.\n\nStudents usually have things to do in the afternoon, like sports practice or dealing with an emergency.

Always doing something is better for me.\n\nFor example, if someone has a job and takes a break or quits, they might get lazy and not want to find another job. I know someone who quit their job, thinking they'd find a better one. But they started getting lazy, didn't want to go out, and couldn't afford gas to get to school. They started giving up on college and stayed home all the time. When their parents pushed them to go back to school, they started going again. But they still don't have a job because it's hard to find a good job and go to school at the same time.\n\nAnother reason is that if I'm always doing something, I get better at everything. For example, if I'm struggling in one class, it can distract me from my other classes and make me want to give up. I don't want to come to school, and when I do, I'm often off track. This happens when I don't understand something, and I give up easily.

I believe we can achieve more if we keep doing things. Let me explain why.\n\nFirstly, when you achieve something, you might want to try it in a different way to make it more challenging. For example, I play soccer and I have a special way of kicking the ball. One day, I saw a video of people kicking the ball in a different style, so I decided to try it. After a few practices, I got it right, and I felt proud of myself.\n\nSecondly, you might have started something but never finished it. You might have wanted to do something else and left it behind. For instance, in soccer practice, my coach told us to do planks for a minute. I was nervous and didn't do it. But then I thought, 'How can I get stronger if I don't do planks?' So, I started doing planks, and after a few practices, I could do it for a minute.\n\nThirdly, you might have given up on something, but then you came back stronger. My soccer coach made us run 16 laps around the track. We all complained, but then we decided to do it. We didn't finish, so our coach was angry and made us do extra exercises. The next day, we decided to have our own practice to work on our endurance. We all agreed and worked hard. Finally, we did the 16 laps, and our coach was proud of us.\n\nLastly, you might want to try something you've never done before. For me, it was changing my style and being more confident. I went clothes shopping and bought new clothes. I made many outfits and tried them out. I felt good about myself and got many compliments.\n\nIn conclusion, everyone should have accomplished something in their life. It feels good to achieve something, whether it's big or small.

Miley Cyrus is a good example. She works hard and faces challenges every day. Her role model is her father, who is also her manager. He was a successful singer and knows a lot about the music industry. That's why Miley asks him for help. Because of that, she's a role model for many people today.\n\nTeachers also show us that asking for help is important. My English teacher, Ms. Johnson, taught us that we can learn from each other and from people with more experience.

She said I should make a list of the good and bad things about dropping the class to help me make a decision. She also told me not to give up easily. Her advice really helped me.\n\nIt's important to ask for help from people with more experience because they can teach us a lot. In the future, I think we should all be more open to asking for help.

As good as it sounds, technology can be too distracting.\n\nTechnology has been very helpful for people who travel far away from their families or for families who live apart. It has solved the problem, and now, with the help of online apps, people can communicate with each other worldwide. It lets people share pictures of happy memories with their families across the world. The way technology has helped people stay in touch with their relatives is amazing and very helpful.\n\nTechnology has also made shopping and paying bills easier.

Technology has made our lives easier, and we can enjoy time with family instead of spending all day paying bills.\n\nHowever, technology is not just for communication, shopping, or paying bills.

Some people believe that students need to feel confident in themselves to learn. Others think that praising poor work hurts learning by making standards too low. They believe that true self-esteem comes from achieving something.\n\nFirst, self-esteem comes from praise because people need confidence to achieve their goals. Students face many challenges, and most don't give up. What helps them get through these challenges? It's confidence. Confidence is believing you can face a tough challenge and not give up. Many people have done this. For example, in the manga/anime Naruto, the main character Naruto always had confidence. He wanted to become the Hokage, a top leader. Naruto went to a school to learn ninja skills, but he failed a test three times. He didn't give up. He kept practicing and eventually mastered a difficult skill. This shows that confidence can help you overcome challenges and failures.\n\nMoreover, self-esteem comes from praise because it helps people feel comfortable when taking on a challenge. Students often get nervous before a test or exam. They study hard, but when they encounter a difficult question, they get scared and stressed. What they need is confidence. For instance, imagine a student has a math test coming up. They study hard and memorize formulas. On the day of the test, they just need to believe in themselves. When they get stuck on a question, they remember what they learned and feel more confident. This shows how confidence can help people overcome their struggles and relieve stress.\n\nHowever, some people disagree. They think that praising poor work hurts learning by making standards too low.

It's hard to make friends with classmates if you don't know them. Group projects can solve this problem by allowing people to talk and get to know each other. Your teammates can also help you in class or with other subjects. I've made friends through after-school activities, and even though we only spent a few hours together, we got to know each other and became close friends.\n\nA group project can be completed faster if everyone contributes a little. For example, a Broadway show requires not only great singers and actors but also a large crew. No one person can put on a show alone. Even a small costume requires a team of people to design and create it. It's possible for one person to do it, but it would take much longer. When you have a great team, why not take advantage of their ideas and help?\n\nTeamwork may not always make the dream work, but it gets you closer to it. Teamwork is essential in real life. You can learn from your teammates and improve through every project. Don't let one difficult person stop you from working in a group. It's worth trying, and you might even find friends you enjoy working with. When people work together to solve a problem, they can find a solution much faster."}

When you're at home, it can be boring and you might not know what to do. I like spending more time in school to learn more and get smarter. I don't like staying at home for too long. I like going to school and learning more about what I already know. That's why I think the school day should be longer.\n\nAnother reason I want to study more is that at home, I have to clean my house before I can study. This takes a lot of time. I have to clean the living room, then the kitchen, and finally my room. So, I don't have much time to study. I prefer to study first and then clean my house. It's more efficient that way. I can study, then clean, and finally read a book."}
{"text_id_kaggle": "9497054F9CEB", "output_essay": "Why playing a sport is enjoyable.\n\nFirst, it's entertaining. When you play a sport, you don't think about things that stress you out. You're doing something that makes you happy. Everyone needs entertainment in their life. If you're not doing something, you get bored. But if you do something, you have fun. For example, when you practice with a team, you have fun at that time.\n\nSecond, it's fun. When you play a sport, you're happy. For example, when you're playing soccer and you're winning, you're happy. Talk to others and make new friends. Do things you like and help others when they need it.\n\nAlways try to be happy, not just for yourself, but also for others.\n\nThird, it's educational. When you're on a team, you learn how to work with others. You learn how to communicate and search for ideas. For example, when you're playing soccer and you have the ball, you need to talk to your teammates to figure out what to do. This is called working together. Work hard and you'll feel good about what you're doing. Learning is important because it will help you in the future. Learn to respect your coach and teammates.\n\nPlaying a sport is enjoyable because it helps you relax. For example, when I came to the U.S.A, I didn't know how to speak English. But I joined a team in Generic City and started practicing. I learned new words and how to talk. Now, I know more than I thought I would.\n\nEnjoyable means having fun, being entertained, and learning.\n\nIn conclusion, playing a sport is good for people who are in bad situations. For example, someone with depression needs to be entertained so they can stop thinking about their problems. Playing on a team is good for your health. Take care of yourself; playing a sport is a good way to make your life easier."}
{"text_id_kaggle": "0E06044E2717", "output_essay": "Some people don't want to do their work. They know they should do it every day to be successful. But they still don't do it. They might not do their schoolwork, job, or even household chores. In my opinion, life would be easier for these people if they could get up and try to do things instead of being lazy.\n\nImagine two people. One is very smart but doesn't do anything. The other is not as smart but works hard. Can the hardworking person be more successful than the smart but lazy person? Yes, because success is not just about being smart. It's about taking responsibility and doing what you should do every day. Working hard and smart every day helps people achieve more.\n\nA person with depression is a good example of this. Depression is a serious problem that affects daily life. It can make people feel tired, hopeless, and not want to do anything. They might have trouble sleeping and eating too. These problems can lead to failure and more stress. A depressed person might look lazy, but they can't control their feelings. They get stuck in a cycle of inactivity. The main idea is that depressed people often can't do what they need to do, even if they want to.\n\nCan someone achieve things without doing them every day? Yes, but it's not the same. For example, a student must do their homework on time to get good grades. If they don't study all year, it's not the same as studying every day. They might still graduate, but they'll miss out on good grades. Who wouldn't want to go to a better college or get a better job? People should try to do what they can every day. After doing everything, it's okay to fail and feel relieved.\n\nIn my opinion, one of the most important things is doing things step by step. It shows how someone can get better every day. For example, saving money every day can add up to a lot. People can learn a new language in a year by trying every day. There are many examples like this, but people must learn how important it is to do something every day. Some people can't even do that. In conclusion, people might achieve something by being inactive, but it doesn't mean they should ignore how much they could achieve by being active."}

If school were all year round, students wouldn't have time to spend with their families. Summer break needs to be long because it's the only time students can be with their families and friends. If winter break were longer, people wouldn't go outside and have fun with their families because it would be too cold.\n\nStudents need rest from school. Going to school all year, five days a week, would be too much for students. They would have too much homework, quizzes, and tests, and they would have to get ready for big exams. Some students stay up late to finish their homework or study for a test. This is not good for their bodies, and they need some rest. Their brains need a break too. Not getting enough sleep affects how they think in school.\n\nSome students have after-school clubs. Many students are on the football team, and they have to practice every day after school. On Fridays, they have to get ready for their games, and many people come to watch, including family, friends, and college coaches. Most sports clubs meet after school for a long time, and students don't have enough time to finish their school work. Having school all year round would not be good for students with clubs.\n\nIn conclusion, having school all year round is not good for students. They need breaks to rest and have fun. Most students want a longer summer break because they spend more time with friends and family then. In winter, people want to spend time with their families. Spring break should be longer because it's a time when everyone wants to go out and have fun. Having school all year round won't work if students don't get their rest."}

Being inactive doesn't make sense because you could be doing fun things outside with your family and friends.\n\nAnother reason is that if you have a family and you're very lazy, your wife might not want to stay with you. She might look for someone who works hard. Your kids might not respect you or rely on you if you don't do anything.

You should always try to do things that make you uncomfortable, and you can master anything if you put your mind to it. Use the methods that helped you in the past to master something new.\n\nI've always tried to do things that make me uncomfortable to master something. For example, I went skydiving to help me play the clarinet without fear. It took me time to master the clarinet, but doing other scary things like riding roller coasters and playing other instruments helped a lot. Once I tried new things, I got better at playing the clarinet. I became a good player after I faced my fears.\n\nIn addition, use the methods that helped you in the past to achieve your goal. If you try, you can do it. Don't give up. Try new things that scare you, because it will help you master what you want. My grandfather always said, 'Have faith in what you want to master and believe in yourself.' I always told myself, 'I can do it; I won't give up.' Mastering something shouldn't be your only focus, but you can do it if you try hard.\n\nLastly, I agree that you should try new things to master what you want. You won't grow and succeed if you don't try. Doing scary things helped me, and I think people should try them too. Always remember, without faith and believing in yourself, you won't achieve your goals. Never give up and always try your best. Never be a quitter and master what you want."}

My mom taught me to respect others and help those in need. I want to go with one of the police officers to learn how it feels to save people from danger. I also want to be a homicide detective.

{"text_id_kaggle": "56A597D6ABA7", "output_essay": "In today's world, there are two kinds of people: those who like working and those who don't. Thomas Jefferson once said, 'If you want to be lazy, be lazy. But it's amazing how much you can do if you keep doing things.' He believed that the more you do, the more you achieve. It's not just about working or resting, but about finding a balance. This way, you can do more with your daily life and achieve more than you expected.\n\nSome people think that being inactive is necessary because it's the only way for your body to rest. When I was five, I was told that the more you sleep, the more you grow. In kindergarten, we had to take naps even if we didn't want to. People who don't rest enough can get depression, headaches, insomnia, and even memory loss. Resting is important because without it, we can't do our daily tasks efficiently, like going to school or working.\n\nHigh school is a crucial phase in your life, where you decide who you will become in the future. I believe that the more you do in your classes, the better your grades will be. In my freshman and sophomore years, I didn't do much in my classes and was okay with getting a D. Now that I'm a junior, I realize that bad grades affect my GPA, and my GPA decides whether I go to college or not. So, I work hard in my classes and don't accept anything lower than a C.\n\nIf you always do something good with people or at work, it can affect your life in a positive way. If you work more, you might get more money, and if you help someone, you might get a new friend. It makes you feel like you've achieved something, and that feeling is one of the best. For example, Taco Bell had a competition to see which of their restaurants worked hard and fast. We worked hard to please the customers, and our manager won a trip to Hawaii, and we got a raise.\n\nMy family has a saying, which is 'The more you do now, the less you'll do later.'

{"text_id_kaggle": "71E7AE98D33A", "output_essay": "Expecting high school students to choose a career is a bad idea that often leads to failure.\n\nI disagree with this idea for three main reasons: age, growth, and influence.\n\nAge is a big factor. Research shows that most students are not mature enough to make big decisions when they enter high school. Their brains are still developing, and they are not ready to plan their future. For example, when I was a kid, I wanted to work for my favorite cereal company. But as I grew up, I changed my mind because I realized it was a childish dream.\n\nGrowth is another reason. As students get older, their ideas and views on life change. They start to see things differently and may no longer want to pursue a career they chose when they were younger. But if they're forced to choose a career before high school, they may get stuck with a choice they no longer want. For instance, someone might want to work for a cereal company when they're young, but later develop a passion for carpentry.\n\nInfluence is also a major factor. Students are easily influenced by their surroundings. If they grow up in an area where everyone wants to be a doctor, they may want to be a doctor too. For example, when I was growing up, all my friends and I loved riding bicycles and wanted to become bike pros. But as we got older, we started to see our true potential and explore other career options.\n\nExpecting students to know what career they want at a young age is like asking a child to become an adult overnight. It's impossible. Students need time to grow and explore their options before making a decision. In fact, research shows that only three out of ten students know what career they want to pursue before entering high school. The rest are still unsure.\n\nIn conclusion, students entering high school are too young to choose a career. My reasons and examples show why I disagree with societies that expect students to identify a career at such a young age."}

Students need longer summer breaks to refresh their minds, try new things, and spend time with family and friends.\n\nDoctors and scientists say our brains need time to relax or we can get stressed, depressed, and lose focus.

Some people think we should have shorter summer vacations and more breaks throughout the year, but I think this can distract students from their goals.\n\nEveryone has dreams they work hard to achieve, but too much of anything can be bad. Longer summer breaks let students practice their skills and talents outside of school. They also need social and religious education, which longer breaks can provide. Many schools offer summer school to help students catch up on credits, and this takes two months. Longer summer breaks are a good idea because they help students do better in school.\n\nIn today's busy world, we have little time for family, and relationships need time. We often forget about our loved ones while focusing on work or school. Schools keep children busy, but sometimes too busy. Longer summer breaks let families plan trips and spend quality time together. Teachers say students who spend time with their families are more open-minded and involved. Education is important, but so is taking care of ourselves and our families.\n\nI believe the school board should not change the summer vacation rules because they help students achieve their best and do other activities.

{"text_id_kaggle": "2EA88D8BFE85", "output_essay": "Let's be honest, can you really achieve a goal without putting in some effort? Many people believe that you get what you work for. For example, when we work hard for what we want, we gain experiences, become more mature, and learn how achieving something makes us more successful in life.\n\nI know most people just want to relax and do nothing. That's okay, but if you don't do anything, you won't gain experiences that can help you in the future. On the other hand, doing something, no matter how small, can help you learn and prepare for tough situations. For example, I took a first aid class in nursing school, and one day I was able to help someone who needed it after a car accident. If I hadn't taken that class, I wouldn't have known what to do. This experience taught me that small actions can make a big difference.\n\nWhen you do things, you become more mature. Most people say that the more you do, the more your brain develops, and you understand things better than those who don't do anything. For example, if we compare two people, one who does things and one who doesn't, it's clear that the person who does things knows how to handle everyday situations better. I believe that the more you do, the more mature you become.\n\nDoing things also helps you become successful in life. It's clear that the more you do, the more active you are, and the more active you are, the smarter you become. For example, if you're not active, you won't learn as much as someone who is active. You'll find situations harder if you haven't learned or done anything. On the other hand, active people will find things easier and won't have any problems. So, I think you should try to do something that will make you feel proud of what you've achieved.\n\nIn conclusion, while it's nice to relax and do nothing, it's not as good as doing something that will give you accomplishments, make you more mature, and help you become successful in life. With these three things, you can make a big change in your life. Inactivity will never let you achieve something important in your life, but being active and doing things you like to learn will help you improve your life."}

I think our school should have a homework club because it can help students in many ways.\n\nFirst, students can finish their homework early. This means they won't have to do it at home and can relax instead. It's also easier for teachers because they can focus on other things.\n\nSecond, students can get extra help from teachers and peers. If someone is stuck on a problem, they can ask for help. Many people are willing to lend a hand. Sometimes, students just need to try solving the problem on their own before asking for help.\n\nThird, a homework club can provide a quiet place to work. Some students have trouble focusing when it's noisy. They can use noise-canceling headphones or find a quiet spot. If they still have trouble, they can work slowly and take deep breaths.\n\nHaving a homework club can help students improve their studies. They can finish their homework early, get extra help when needed, and work in a quiet environment. This can lead to better grades and a better future."}

He also became a US citizen when he moved to the United States. This shows that anyone can do it if they try. There are many things in life that can make the impossible possible. For example, Apple's iPhones, iPads, and iPods are all examples of how technology can evolve. It's not just about working hard, but also about doing it for your family and business. I remember when I was 5 years old and living in the United States. It was a dream come true for my family - a place where we could have a better life. But we had to make sacrifices. My dad had to leave his family behind and work hard every day. He would come home dirty and sometimes with blood on his hands. My mom worked in a dangerous area at a gas station where there were often shootings and robberies. But things started to get better when my oldest sister graduated from high school and went to college. My second oldest sister is about to graduate next year. We moved to a better house, and my sisters started working. My oldest sister works at a bank, and my second oldest sister works at a Brazilian restaurant. I just started working at a laser quest and trying to do well in school. I'm not doing great, but I know I can do it with the help of my family and friends.

However, many people prefer to take the easy way out, which can become a habit. With this mindset, people won't achieve much in life.\n\nSome people think taking the easy way is better, but facts show the opposite. In the past, before technology, people had to do tasks by hand and meet deadlines. By doing more, you can achieve more and learn from the process. Today, people use technology to make tasks easier. This has become a habit worldwide; kids and adults use technology to finish assignments or copy and paste. Technology is useful, but it can also make us lazy. If everyone uses their time wisely, they can achieve more, build confidence, and complete tasks.

Some educators think the summer break is too long and that students forget what they learned when they return in the fall. However, I disagree. During the summer break, students get to spend quality time with their families and friends. They can also visit exciting places like Disneyland and the Eiffel Tower. Additionally, students who failed courses or didn't pass their SOLs can attend summer school to catch up and graduate.\n\nMy mom always says, 'Family is Everything.' So, summer breaks are important because they let students spend time with their families. For example, I wake up early and get home late every school day. Sometimes, my parents are not around when I get home, so we don't get to spend enough time together. In my opinion, summer break should be longer so students can be with their families.\n\nDuring the summer break, students can visit new places and learn about different cultures. Last summer, my family and I went on a cruise, and it was the best experience of my life. We were only gone for three weeks, but I was very happy about the trip.\n\nSome students fail their courses or don't pass their SOLs during the school year. However, summer school gives them a chance to retake what they missed and pass with good grades.\n\nIn conclusion, summer break should be the longest break because it's one of the most enjoyable seasons, and everyone wants to have fun.

If you just do your best or do good, you might inspire someone without even knowing it. When I got an A, I wasn't thinking about my brother being influenced. I just wanted to do well in school. But my good grade ended up inspiring him.\n\nI think being a good influence helps people succeed, which makes them happy. It also makes you look mature and responsible.

Technology makes things easier for us. We can buy everything without fighting with someone or getting into trouble. When we go out, some people are mean to customers. Sometimes, when we buy something, someone steals it or tries to steal our money and hurt us.\n\nSome people think technology is bad because some people use the internet to do bad things. They try to find kids to talk to and make them do what they want. Also, people who use computers a lot are often antisocial and don't like others.\n\nWhen I came to the United States, I was 14 years old. A store employee asked me why I didn't know how to speak English in a mean way. My brother told me what the employee said, and it made me feel frustrated and sad. I started to cry. My mom was there, and she wanted to fight for me, but I stopped her. We left the store because it was a waste of time. Now, we do most of our shopping online because it's easier. My mom and I don't have time to go to the grocery store, so we order food online. It makes our day easier because I have a baby, and my mom has my little sister and brother. We don't have to take them out in the cold weather.\n\nTechnology can also be good because it helps us avoid bad situations. For example, my cousin was buying a computer at Walmart. When he was about to leave, two people showed up with knives. They took the computer and punched him in the chest. Now, he's dead, and he was only 17 years old. The police couldn't find the people who did it. This is why I think shopping online is safer. We don't want more people to die.\n\nIn conclusion, technology is good for people's lives because we never know what will happen when we're out.

To others, it might mean doing their jobs, researching, or helping others.\n\nIn the past, people were more active because they didn't have technology. They did everything by hand. Today, many people sit at home and let technology do the work, which has both good and bad effects. The bad effects have caused health problems like obesity and diabetes. Being active can also mean exercising.\n\nI believe that if someone works hard to achieve their goals, they can do anything they want if it's realistic. We can look at famous scientists like Albert Einstein, Stephen Hawking, and Thomas Edison, who worked hard to make discoveries that changed our lives.\n\nAs a lazy person, I agree with what Thomas Jefferson wrote.

On the other hand, doing something can lead to significant accomplishments, like Edward Jenner's discovery of the cowpox vaccine. My point is that every effort counts, no matter how small. Inactivity is only acceptable when there's nothing we can do about it. However, it's not a safe option, and inactive people are often looked down upon.\n\nIn my opinion, quote writers often draw from their own experiences. Thomas Jefferson wrote this quote because he had to choose between being active or idle, and he made his choice.\n\nClearly, he chose to be active. He wrote a quote about it, and it's a reminder that idle people often follow their brain, while active people follow their heart.

We can build our future by working hard, and later on, we won't have regrets. When we accomplish something, people will look up to us, especially our children. We can inspire others to do the same, creating a chain reaction.\n\nIf we take a moment to think about Thomas Jefferson's quote, we can become different people.

Imagination also helps us picture things we've never seen before. When we have imagination, we can create anything we want.

Every day, we imagine new things or good things we want to happen.\n\nImagination is not just about being happy. Sometimes we imagine good things, and sometimes we imagine bad things. But we're always imagining something. Imagination is special, and when people don't have it, we can help them think of special things they'd like to do. Sometimes it's hard to imagine things, but that's because we're not thinking of something special. When we imagine, we get creative, and that's important too. Sometimes I imagine graduating from college and having a good career. Also, when I create something, it's because I imagined it. If imagination weren't important, we wouldn't have what we have now. We wouldn't have electronics, clothes, shoes, or anything else.\n\nWhen we're kids, we have a lot of imagination. But as we get older, we don't have as much. We start thinking of things in a different way, and we create things that amaze people. In my opinion, I think imagination is very important. Have you ever thought about how long it took for the first person to solve a math problem? Now we have easier problems to solve, but imagine how long it would take you to solve the hardest math problem in the world.\n\nImagination is everywhere. Every time you see something new, you imagine lots of things about it.

It's true that sometimes it's hard to learn what the teacher teaches you, but if you keep imagining that it's hard, you'll never learn. Just never imagine that you can't do something because you can. Always say that you can, and imagine that everything will be fine.\n\nIt's very important to know that imagination is good for you. Imagination helps you think about important things you want to say. It also helps you think harder, and that's good because you get more ideas. Imagination is like an idea that you always have in mind. Many times you get lots of ideas, and it's because you're imagining important things you want to share with others. Sometimes people like to share what they imagine, and it's good because other people could have imagined the same thing too. Sharing is part of the imagination too, and that's good because when you have many ideas and you share them, your imagination gets bigger, and you get more creative.\n\nScientist Albert Einstein said that imagination is very important, and that's true. Albert Einstein had a lot of imagination because he created many amazing inventions. He was very smart and knew how to solve the hardest math problem in the world. His imagination took him very far and made him famous because he was very smart, intelligent, and imaginative. Think about it; how hard he worked to show many people what he could do. Would you be able to work that hard so that you can tell people about your amazing inventions? I think it would be very hard to work like how Albert Einstein used to work.\n\nRemember that imagination is very important and is always around us. We just need an idea to get started to imagine. When people hear your ideas of imagination, they get creative too because it gives them an example of something that can become true. Without imagination, we wouldn't know what to do; it would be hard for us to think about important things.

When he doesn't understand something, he asks the teacher or friends for help. He keeps working hard until the end of the semester, but he feels very tired. All his hard work makes him a good student, but he doesn't have any friends. He didn't hang out with friends in school for a long time because he was too busy studying.\n\nAnother example is when I was a freshman. I tried to join many clubs in school because I thought that if I didn't try, I wouldn't have a chance to do them later. So, I worked hard to attend all the club meetings, sports events, and keep in touch with everyone. After a while, I was so tired; I felt like I needed more time to rest and have fun. So, I quit playing sports and yearbook class because I didn't have time for them. In the end, I realized that trying to be busy all the time is not good because I get tired and want to have more time for myself to hang out with friends.\n\nSome people also give up on what they want to do; they choose to do something they don't like, and then they give up. Students who want to be rich in the future study careers they don't like. In college, almost half of the students change their careers during the school year. Most students want to find jobs that make a lot of money, so they choose the hardest careers to study. For example, one of my friend's sisters wanted to become a lawyer, but she didn't like laws. She studied hard, but she had to stay up late, work harder than others, and sometimes she wanted to give up. So, she changed her career to become a math teacher because she likes that job.\n\nAnother example is when I played basketball in middle school. I'm not good at it, but I tried hard to be on the team. I went to the camp, the park, and played everywhere, but when I made it into the team, I felt like it wasn't fun. I wanted to have fun, not just worry about winning or losing. During practice, it wasn't fun at all; I had to remember the plays and know what's going on during the game. So, I started to give up, but I'm glad I was on the team. Doing things all the time can help you work faster and better, but if you're not having fun and making yourself work harder, you may not achieve your goal.\n\nHowever, some people may say that people accomplish more if they are always doing something. It's wonderful how much can be done if they are always doing. Keeping up with your work and working hard may improve your skills; the more you work, the better you get. But if you keep working hard all the time, you may get tired, need some rest, and give up on what you normally do. Sometimes, taking breaks is better; you don't have to worry about your goal, and you don't have to work hard every day to reach your goal. Working all the time is not good for you; it makes you feel tired and want to give up. Staying happy all the time and having fun with friends will make you feel better. Don't work too hard; there are more things waiting for you to try."}
{"text_id_kaggle": "83F2A3B31F21", "output_essay": "Having self-reliance is a very important skill to develop. It lets us express our thoughts and ideas. Self-reliance means making decisions based on what we think is best for ourselves. It has many good effects on our lives, especially on our personal growth. It boosts our self-esteem, we learn from our failures, and we're more likely to be happy when we do what we think is right.\n\nBeing self-reliant is important because it makes us feel like our opinions matter. It helps us feel good about ourselves, like we're smart and trustworthy. When we make our own decisions, it shows we're mature enough, and our self-esteem grows. We're more likely to be happy when this happens.\n\nEvery day, we make decisions, like what to buy at the store or what to order at a restaurant. Sometimes we make mistakes, but it's okay. We learn more from our mistakes than from following others. When someone tells us what to do, we don't learn from our experiences. We need to use our self-reliance to gain knowledge and experience.\n\nDoing what we love is good for our daily lives. For example, when choosing a career, we should pick something we enjoy and that makes us happy. We need to trust ourselves when making these decisions. Then we can study what we think is best and pursue our dreams.\n\nIt's also good to get guidance from experts when making decisions. They can help us make the right choices and succeed. Having a mentor prevents us from making bad decisions that can affect our lives negatively. Discussing important matters with an instructor can help us and reduce stress.\n\nSelf-reliance is trusting ourselves and believing we're making the right choices. We use it every day when making decisions. I believe everyone should be able to make their own decisions and have self-reliance. When we use our own ideas and opinions, we're more satisfied with ourselves and more likely to live a happy life. There are many advantages to having self-reliance, and it's up to us to decide whether to use it or not."}

Teachers and students can volunteer to help those who need it, and many schools have a homework club or study zone after school.\n\nFirst, students who struggle with subjects like science, social studies, English, and history can stay after school with a teacher who volunteers to help. This is especially helpful for students in elementary, middle, or high school who need extra support. Teachers can also recommend that students who struggle stay after school with them.\n\nSecond, teachers and students who don't struggle can volunteer to help others. This way, if a teacher is busy with another student, the volunteer student can help someone else. The volunteer student can use their own work to explain how to get the answer to another student.\n\nHaving a homework club also has its advantages and disadvantages. The advantages are that students can get their homework done on time, get a head start on tests and projects, and use school computers if they don't have one at home. Teachers can recommend the club to students who struggle. Any school can have a homework club. The disadvantages are that some students promise to do their homework but don't, which can lead to failing quizzes and tests.\n\nFinally, many schools have a homework club or study zone to help students who struggle with their homework or want to get a head start on studying. These clubs can be very helpful, and some schools even offer treats or snacks to students who attend. Each school is different, but having a homework club can really improve student achievement.\n\nIn conclusion, having a homework club after school can be very beneficial for students who struggle with certain subjects. It can help them get their homework done on time, understand difficult concepts, and get a head start on tests and projects."}

As a student, I believe this will make a difference. For one thing, we will have more time in class to finish our work. This means we will have less homework, so we can relax or play outside when we get home. We will also have a break from schoolwork. Additionally, teachers will have more time to teach us what we need to know, so we can understand our work better. For instance, I often don't have enough time in class, and there are many students in my class. My teacher can't always help me, so I have to do my work at home. But it's hard to do if I don't understand it. That's why I think the school board should add 30 minutes to our school day."}

If not, there are three reasons why adding one and a half hours to school each day is a bad idea.\n\nFirst, students need breaks. Working too much can hurt their schoolwork. Many schools in our county have bad grades on the SOL because students don't sleep well.\n\nSecond, students get tired easily. If we add one and a half hours to our school day, we'll have to wake up early. We usually have eight hours of school and 11 hours of sleep. If we add extra time, we'll have to go to school at 6 am. Many students won't like that because they won't feel fresh and will be grumpy. This can affect their grades.\n\nThird, students can get in trouble with their parents. Some students do after-school activities and get very tired. Parents might get angry because students don't do their chores.\n\nIn conclusion, I don't think we should extend the school day. It can hurt everyone in the school and even get some teachers fired because students aren't learning well.\n\nPlease don't extend our school day!"}

When people are inspired by you, it's a great feeling.\n\nYou can inspire many people by being a good role model in society. If you do good deeds, help others, and put their needs before your own wants, you show them that they can make a difference too. This is especially true for children and teens who may want to follow in your footsteps. For example, when I was young, I was inspired by Arnold Schwarzenegger, the bodybuilder. I admired what he did and the speeches he gave. I wanted to live a life like his and be like him.\n\nYou can inspire others in many ways, such as being a good athlete, chef, businessperson, or just a kind and caring person. But to inspire others, you need to have good behavior. If someone inspired you when you were young, and you grew up to be like them, that can have a deep impact on others.\n\nI think this is especially important for parents. They need to set a good example for their children, because kids will often follow in their parents' footsteps. If you're a good parent, you can inspire your children to have a positive and helpful attitude in life. You can also inspire others on how to be a good parent.\n\nIt's very important to be a good influence, not a bad one. There are bad influences out there, like people who do drugs, drink, or smoke. These behaviors can especially influence teens. For example, my dad used to smoke, but he quit because he didn't want me to follow in his footsteps.\n\nInfluencing someone in a positive way is a beautiful thing. You can be anyone and take any positive action, and it will inspire someone. This is important advice for parents, because we will all be parents one day, and the sooner we learn this, the better it will be for our children's future and for us.\n\nIf we show the power of humanity and the strength of our good behaviors, the world will become a better place."}

When we have energy, we can accomplish a lot or do even bigger things. Being inactive won't get us anywhere in life because we won't want to work towards our goals. Inactivity only holds us back and has no real purpose. If we want to keep learning, we must accomplish many things to reach our goals. It's pointless if we don't try our best; success won't come to us easily. Accomplishing our goals has a good purpose; it helps us a lot. For example, if we finish school and get our GED, we'll have many job opportunities. Another reason it's good to accomplish things, like learning to change a tire, is that one day we might need to do it, and we'll know how. We get more done when we're active rather than inactive; it doesn't help us become the person we want to be. Why is it always good to be active? We learn new things, and we don't waste our time.

There were many things to do at these parks.\n\nWhen I go to a park with my family and friends, I like to go hiking and have a picnic. I enjoy hiking with my parents, cousins, or siblings. It's always fun to get outside and breathe fresh air. I like being alone sometimes, as it's nice to have no one holding me back. Even when I'm with someone I trust, it's great to share my feelings with them. After hiking, I return to my family, who are very loving and supportive. I also love the food they bring, especially what my mom makes. We have a great picnic with the people I love.\n\nWhen my family goes on a picnic, they bring a lot of food. We often have two families with us, and each family brings many dishes. Sometimes, there's a mix-up, and we end up with the same dishes. But usually, everyone brings different foods.

When you work in groups, you get to share ideas and consider different viewpoints. Yes, working in groups can be difficult and confusing at times, but I believe it's more beneficial than working alone.\n\nOne advantage of working in groups is that you get many different ideas. Sometimes you might get stuck, and that's where your peers can help. They can motivate you or give you ideas to get started. The more people in the group, the better, because you have more brains working together.\n\nIn groups, you also get to see things from different perspectives. This can be helpful because what might be right for one person might be wrong for another. For example, I once worked on a project about ethics and morals with a group of six people. We came from different backgrounds, and our opinions on stealing varied. Some thought it was okay in certain situations, while others thought it was always wrong. Working in groups helps you see these different perspectives.\n\nWorking alone can be good too, but not always. One problem with groups is that they can lead to arguments and conflicts. On the other hand, working alone means you don't have to deal with others' opinions, and you can focus on your own ideas without stress. You can express yourself freely without fear of judgment.\n\nIn conclusion, working in groups brings many benefits, including a variety of ideas and perspectives.

With cell phones, we can send messages, make calls, and do many other things. Cell phones have made it easier for people to communicate. Before cell phones, people used to send letters or messages through the telegram, which took a long time.

Computers also have apps that help students learn new things. We can even play games online and talk to the people we're playing with. So, computers are very important and have helped us learn a lot.\n\nTV is another technology that has many useful things. Most people watch movies or programs on TV. There are many helpful programs on TV that can teach kids, inform us about what's happening in other countries, or give us news. I think the news is the most watched program because it tells us about many things, like sports, disasters, and more.\n\nCars, motorcycles, and airplanes are also technologies, but they're a little different. They help us travel from one place to another, and we can go to different states or countries because they're so fast. I think these are the most important technologies humans have created. Because of them, we can easily visit our families or go to another country to study.\n\nTechnology has also helped create new technologies, so now we can do many things easily. Technologies are used in almost all countries, at home, school, and restaurants to protect people and make things easier. In schools, people mostly use technologies like smart boards and computers. The new technologies humans are creating are more advanced than before, and now we even have robotic technologies.\n\nBefore humans created technologies, people had to do many things by hand, like writing and making food.

I remember helping my dad fix his car engine and electronics. I also remember taking my bike apart to check the chain and brakes. Helping my dad and grandpa in the garage was exciting for me. I liked helping people with things I understood. I don't claim to know everything about mechanics or engineering, though.\n\nThis is one reason I chose this program - I want to learn more about mechanics and engineering.\n\nThe Academy is about teamwork, patience, and imagination. I've developed these skills. Team members share ideas to solve problems. We check each other's work to make sure it's correct. If there's a problem, we take our time and fix it. If we don't understand, we ask for help. Imagination helps us see different solutions and picture the final result. I use these skills in school, working in groups, being patient when mistakes happen, and imagining our finished product.\n\nIt would be amazing to participate in this program - a dream come true. I've been in many airplanes, but never close enough to touch the metal and hear the engine roar. I'd love to visit your academy and see what you're working on.\n\nI'd like to build, fix, inspect, and work with imagination and patience alongside the people in the program. Can you make my wish come true?"}
{"text_id_kaggle": "9A76FBF5B3FC", "output_essay": "Humans create technology to make their work easier and faster. However, I think that relying too much on technology can prevent people from being successful. Sometimes, people use technology for bad things. For example, a student was told to write an essay about Thomas Jefferson. Instead of thinking about it or using his textbook, he copied someone else's work from his phone. This is bad for his future because he didn't learn anything about Thomas Jefferson. This shows that always using technology to help yourself can have negative effects and prevent success.\n\nBefore technology existed, people were more active and did their work on their own. They would talk to others and get to know them. Today, technology makes people spend their time on social media or playing video games. As a result, people don't talk to their families as much. They are too busy with technology and don't have time for each other. People need to stop using technology too much and start talking to others again."}

The long summer break we have now is meant to be our time to relax and not think about school. If students are worried about forgetting things, they can always go to summer school.\n\nMany people don't think school is stressful for students, but it's a real problem. Homework and high expectations from teachers can be overwhelming. An all-year-round school year would make it worse. Summer is a time for students and teachers to take a break and clear their minds. Yes, we still learn new things during the summer, but an all-year-round school would increase stress for everyone.\n\nHaving a long summer break is ideal because it gives teachers and students time to rest and prepare for the next school year. Another reason I don't like the idea of all-year-round school is that summer is a great time to travel and explore new places without worrying about school. With a long summer break, students and teachers wouldn't have to worry about keeping up with schoolwork.\n\nIn conclusion, an all-year-round school year would be more stressful, and we wouldn't have as much time to do what we want. If students need extra help, they can go to summer school. I prefer a 2-3 month summer break over an all-year-round school year."}
{"text_id_kaggle": "1602B1FA1069", "output_essay": "Have you ever thought about how technology is changing our lives? Ten years ago, our lives were very different. Technology is changing how we live and how things work. For example, instead of going to a store to buy a book, I can just use my phone to download it. This has both good and bad effects, but we can't control how life is changing because we're addicted to technology.\n\nTechnology has taken over our daily lives. We do many things on our phones. For example, let's say I'm hungry but don't want to go out to buy food. In the past, I would have to go to a fast-food store. Now, I can use an app like 'Uber Eats' to order food and have it delivered in under 25 minutes. This means we have less time for human contact, which can be both good and bad.\n\nHaving less human contact can lead to many things. The bad things it can lead to are making us anti-social. This is because without human contact, we get used to not being around people and prefer our phones. It can also make us lose our social skills and become lazier by relying on technology. However, having less human contact can also make us more independent and not need to rely on others.\n\nIn conclusion, having less human contact can be good, but it's usually bad.\n\nTo prevent this, we should go out sometimes to places like libraries, fairs, or malls where we can meet people. Technology will likely take over soon, and jobs will be online. It's up to us to choose the right path for a better future, not just for us, but also for our kids."}

Full days are great because our classes are longer, and we have more time to learn new things and finish our SOLs and other tasks. Half days are just a short time to do a little work and have some fun. Sometimes, half days are a waste of time because we think we can have fun, but we really need to focus on our schoolwork.

{"text_id_kaggle": "23058E7FEBF8", "output_essay": "Should people make their own decisions or seek expert advice? Many people make decisions based on their emotions. Life is full of challenges, and the world is full of people who can be mean. If people wished good for each other, the world would be a better place. Unfortunately, people can be cruel and often wish for others to fail. The world population is growing rapidly, with over seven billion people. Despite being surrounded by people, many individuals suffer from loneliness and depression because they are afraid of each other. It's hard to trust a friend these days. Although people might need counseling during difficult times, making their own decisions has a greater impact on their lives. Making one's own decisions gives individuals the opportunity to have a positive self-image, develop decision-making skills, and become independent.\n\nFirstly, people who make their own decisions tend to have a more positive self-image. I learned this from personal experience. As a student, I had issues with my father and went to my counselor for help. However, her solution made the problem worse, and I felt worthless. I felt there was no one who cared for my safety. I felt lonely, and my self-image was low. Having a positive self-image is important to do well in school and life. We teenagers, especially, lose our self-image easily, which can lead to depression. Making our own decisions helps us be confident and responsible for our actions.\n\nSecondly, to develop good decision-making skills, we need to practice making decisions on our own from a young age. Parents should allow their children to make decisions, such as choosing classes or after-school programs. As they grow up, they will develop good decision-making skills that will help them deal with the real world. People should make their own decisions by thinking about what's right and what's wrong. Many people promise things when they are happy and give up on them when they are sad. It's important to separate feelings when making a decision. Controlling our emotions when we make a decision helps us make the right choices.\n\nThirdly, making our own decisions will help us develop the feeling of being independent. Leaning on others is dangerous and a common mistake people regret. Feeling independent is precious, which is why our fathers fought for independence for our country. Making our own decisions helps us control and navigate our lives. It helps us be confident and make a difference in our community. Being independent gives happiness. Many women don't make decisions for themselves, but their parents or spouses do. Especially in underdeveloped nations, women don't have the power to make decisions for themselves. It's a human basic right to give someone the space to be themselves and let them make their own decisions without any consequences.\n\nAlthough people making their own decisions have greater benefits, seeking advice from experts before making decisions also has its benefits. Experts who listen and analyze one's situation to set a good path are helpful. Experts work based on science and logic. Getting help from an expert might sound like there will be fewer mistakes in deciding the path, but the person who relies on the expert to make decisions will have less confidence. People might feel comfortable talking to others about their decisions, but depending on others to make decisions will decrease one's ability to compare and contrast problems.\n\nIn conclusion, making decisions by ourselves has greater advantages than letting experts make decisions for us. Trusting one another has become hard. People enjoy other fellow humans' suffering. Sharing secrets has become hard. People are becoming disloyal and backstabbers. Keep your next move secret. Try to make your own decisions to help yourself become independent, develop the skill of making decisions, and develop positive self-esteem."}

If I value independence, I'll get good things in life if I think positive.\n\nI'll seek guidance in my life because I think I'll need authorities to help me become someone. I always go to my parents for things like food or money. I don't want to be like people who rely on others too much.\n\nBoth seeking guidance and independence are important. When I tell someone about my authorities, it means I want to make my own decisions and do my own things because I'm becoming an adult. I won't be asking my parents to do things for me.\n\nIf someone doesn't know what decision to make, I can't help them. They need to make it themselves. I can help them, but not give them ideas. They can ask their parents instead.\n\nWhen I was little, my parents made decisions for me, but now they can't because I'm almost an adult. If I want to seek guidance, I can. Maybe others don't want to, and that's okay.\n\nMy conclusion is that I might do both - seek guidance and be independent - so I can be better in life. Maybe I can tell my future kids about the good things that happened in my life, and maybe they'll want to do the same when they're older. Maybe they'll want their parents or friends to guide them, which is important.\n\nFor example, when a kid tells their parent that they're going to college and moving out when they turn 18, I'll think twice. I think that when you make that decision, you need to work to pay the bills and rent. Maybe others will stay with their parents until they're old, but it's my decision, and no one can tell me not to do it. My future kid will be a respectful person because I'll teach her not to tell others her decisions."}

However, it's also true that if we work too much, our bodies and minds get tired, and we can't handle normal life stresses.\n\nBeing busy all the time isn't always a good idea.

{"text_id_kaggle": "3867639DFCE4", "output_essay": "Has anyone ever boosted your self-confidence by praising your work or simply saying you've done a great job? Knowing you've done well is always great to hear. Achievements help build self-confidence because they reward your hard work, motivate you to do better, and make you feel good about yourself. All of these ways show how achievements can help build self-confidence.\n\nSome people think achievements are the key to building self-confidence, but praising someone is also very effective. Praising someone can help them feel confident, try harder, and feel good about themselves. Even if someone doesn't do as well as expected, it doesn't mean they should give up. Giving someone confidence can help them improve and keep trying. If you don't get credit or recognition for your work, you tend to lose interest. Praising someone can start at a young age, so when they're older, they're ready for life. Studies show that 82% of kids who were praised in elementary school grew up to be successful in their field.\n\nAfter achieving something, your motivation to do better is what drives you to keep achieving. Many articles say that motivation is a key factor in achieving success and building self-confidence. In some studies, 78% of kids who want to achieve have more motivation than those who don't. Imagine thinking you can be successful in your task or activity; it gives you the motivation to try and be better than others. The motivation to do better can be used throughout your life, as long as you have the drive to succeed.\n\nSome people take achievements as a reward for their hard work and efforts, which helps build their self-confidence. Working hard for something and doing well is one of the best feelings you can have. Giving your time and effort to something means it's important, so you should try to do your best. Research shows that 97% of people who worked hard and stayed focused were happy with their achievement and had better self-confidence. Sometimes all you need is recognition for your hard work, and that's enough to boost your self-confidence.\n\nStaying confident in yourself is important for building self-confidence. Staying confident throughout a project is crucial, which helps you achieve your goals. Kids in middle school were asked if they would do well on their tests, and most of them said they would. When the results came in, 85% of those who were confident actually did well. Sometimes confidence is all you need, even if you don't have anyone else to help or support you. Staying confident in your studies and efforts is what gets you through in the end.\n\nIn conclusion, knowing you've done well is always great to hear. Achievements help build self-confidence because they reward your hard work, motivate you to do better, and make you feel good about yourself. We can help people with low self-confidence by taking a few seconds to congratulate them on their achievement and letting them know they did great."}

I will talk about how technology is bad.\n\nTeens get mentally and physically hurt from social media. A good example is depression. Depression is high among teens today. I know this because I'm living it. Who better to talk about technology being bad than someone who has lived it? Social media can control people's lives. Sadly, most teens depend on social media and can't fight it off. Teens watch other people's lives and think they're great, but people only show the good parts.\n\nYounger kids, like teens, learn less because they spend too much time on smartphones watching videos and playing games. They could be reading, interacting, and learning instead. As adults, we should teach kids that not everything is on phones. That's not the real world. Kids spend so much time watching videos that they forget to play outside. I remember playing outside with friends when I was younger. Now, having a smartphone takes up my time, so I don't socialize. I just check my phone every 5 minutes.\n\nCriminals, like psychos and rapists, have more power to hurt people because of technology. Technology is available to everyone, everywhere. We don't know if bad people have social media accounts. The risk of teens and adults letting strangers follow them is high. Bad people can easily make fake accounts and stalk someone.\n\nTechnology gets better every year. New things come out, and people want them. They get more expensive each year. People only want the new versions because others have them. Teens, kids, and adults make decisions based on what others do.\n\nIn other ways, technology can be useful and good. You just need to know how to use it. I'm an example of this. As you get older, you want to change things for the better.

We can get to know each other better and catch up on things. Technology has many impacts, but it's useful in many ways. However, people need to learn how to use it wisely. Many students in college or high school get addicted to their phones and don't focus on their school work.\n\nTechnology is useful in school, like iPads or MacBooks. It helps us get work done fast and is better than writing things down. We can watch school-related videos to learn new things, and some people find it better to learn through online games. But too much technology isn't good because students can get distracted. If people limit technology, I think the way people interact would be different. It would be somewhat good.\n\nTechnology helps us in many ways, like GPS instead of using a map. But some people text and drive, which is dangerous.

We took her to the hospital, and the doctors treated her with a machine that gave her oxygen. I was scared, but she got better. This shows that technology helps people, especially in hospitals.\n\nTechnology is making life easier for teachers. They use Microsoft PowerPoint, Word documents, and online tools to teach us. They even grade our assignments quickly with 'Grade Cam.' Imagine how hard it would be for a teacher with over a hundred students without technology.

If someone wants to see a family member in another country or state, they can just make a video call or send an email or text, and that's it.\n\nIf someone wants to buy something or order food, they can just order it online, and they'll get it. That's the fastest way to do it. So, they don't have to spend time going to the store or waiting for the food. It's great.\n\nIn conclusion, I think life is easier now with technology because it makes things faster and helps us learn new things. It also brings us closer to the people we love and lets us know what's happening every day all over the world."}

If I get a master's degree, I can do many things in my life. The world has many opportunities, and I want to study more to achieve perfection. Whatever I want to do, I can find a way. I can find a different job, study more, and make a better life.\n\nThe most important thing in my life is to help people who are struggling. I want to help them with money and teach them how to study so they can have a better future.\n\nIf I get a master's degree, I can get a better job and provide for my family. I can teach them how to study. I can improve my English, buy good food, nice clothes, and spend time with my family. I will be happy with them.\n\nIf I have time, I want to study, find a better job, and learn more about history. With my family's support, I can do anything I want. They always help me when I need it, and I never give up. I want to try my best in life.\n\nSo, when we want to do something, we should think positively and ask our family for help.

They want to get out of high school and start their career, but they should enjoy the process and not rush. Students should always think about their future because it's important. They should care about their future and have fun planning their career instead of stressing about it.\n\nThinking about a career at a young age is a great idea.

Summer vacation is about three months long, which is perfect for doing things like going to the beach, playing sports, and spending time with family. This break is good for students because they need time to relax and have fun. Some teachers think summer break is too long, but it's also good for them. Teachers can get tired of teaching, and some students can be lazy and don't want to do their work. If students had breaks all the time, they might become even lazier. Students and teachers need a break to rest and recharge. This way, everyone can come back to school ready to learn. Our bodies need rest to stay focused throughout the year. But if students forget what they learned, teachers need to help them remember. Teachers can make a plan to help students catch up. I don't think we should change the summer vacation schedule. Students are smart, and when they come back to school, they can quickly get back to where they were before."}

A world where people find a cure for aging, end hunger in poor countries, and answer the question: are we alone in the universe?\n\nIn the past, we used our hands to build things. Now we use machines. Henry Ford, an American businessman, wanted to start his own car company. He was determined to change the world, and he worked hard to succeed. We need people like Ford and Jefferson, people who are determined to make a difference. We need kids to grow up to be leaders, entrepreneurs. We need to encourage kids to work hard and achieve their goals.\n\nI want to share what motivates me to succeed: I want to prove people wrong who said I wouldn't amount to anything. I want to show that skin color doesn't matter anymore. You just need to be determined to succeed, like Martin Luther King Jr., who fought to change America and prove that skin color doesn't matter. Many people have tried to change the world but gave up. What makes determined people special is that they don't give up; they have a reason to make a difference.

They learn from their good and bad choices and understand that the more decisions they make, the wiser they will be.\n\nWhen kids start making decisions, they grow stronger. A young child can't make decisions because their brain is still developing. But as they grow, their brain develops, and making small decisions helps them learn. As teenagers, they take on more responsibility and learn that good and bad choices have consequences.\n\nParents who teach their kids to make decisions are teaching them to be responsible. Many parents want their kids to learn responsibility, and letting them make decisions is the best way. For example, teenagers are allowed to date, and parents often let them figure out if their choices are good or bad. It's important for teenagers to make both good and bad decisions. If they make a bad choice, they'll learn not to make the same mistake again.\n\nPeople become more mature based on the decisions they make. In the US, high schoolers can get a driving permit. Parents want their kids to be responsible and make their own decisions. If a teenager makes a bad choice, like driving with too many passengers, they'll get in trouble. But they'll learn from their mistake and make better choices next time.\n\nMaking their own decisions makes a person stronger and more mature.

Teachers ask this question because they want better results. Working with a group has many benefits. When people discuss a topic in a group, they can complete the assignment faster. It's also more fun because they can talk and listen to each other.\n\nWhen people work in a group, they can hear and think about more ideas. This makes the project better. Everyone sees things differently, and when they work together, they can use these different views. Each person does what they're good at, and they work together with focus.\n\nThe work is better because everyone does things differently. This helps the group and the project. It's also easier because there are more people to help. Each person is responsible for helping the others, which is another benefit. The assignment takes less time to complete, and it looks better and different each time.\n\nWorking with others is also enjoyable. People feel happy and comfortable. When they work with friends, they have a great time, making it fun and entertaining. Friendship helps people work together with more confidence, sharing moments with people they like.

Although working alone helps you focus, it has fewer benefits. I think working with others is better because you share ideas, make friends, and overcome weaknesses.\n\nFirst, working with others helps you share ideas. As a student, it's better to work with others than alone. You get different ideas and opinions to make good decisions. You need to share ideas to solve problems. It's true that 'two heads are better than one.' One idea might be wrong, but with others' opinions, you make the right choice. For example, if you have a worksheet to finish but don't know the answers, working with others can help you figure them out.\n\nSecond, working with others helps you make friends. Many students are too shy to ask questions in class. Working in a group helps them. Making friends means taking part in class activities. Some students are too afraid to share ideas in public, so group work is best for them. When you work in a group, you make new friends and work together as a team, which helps you work hard and stay united. For example, you might be shy around your teacher or classmates, but not your friends. You can ask them questions and share your thoughts.\n\nThird, working with others helps you overcome weaknesses. Everyone has weaknesses. Working in a group can help you fix some of them. If you're stuck on a question, it's best to ask the group for help.

I agree with this because it's always good to stay active, like studying for a test, working towards a goal, and never giving up.\n\nFirst, studying for a test is important, even if you've already passed one. It's good to keep studying for the next test. For example, I studied for my world history test for two hours every day, and when the test day came, I did well. Then, I started studying for my biology test, and I did well on that one too. If you've already mastered a test, it's good to keep studying for the next one. This way, you'll feel less stressed when the next test comes.\n\nAlso, if you're trying to achieve a goal, it's good to keep working towards the next one. For example, I wanted to be student of the semester, so I worked hard, did my homework, and stayed after school to get things done. When I achieved my goal, my next goal was to get a summer job. I kept looking online, and I finally got a job. If you're trying to reach a goal, it's good to keep working towards it. This way, you'll feel good about yourself when you achieve it.\n\nMost importantly, never give up. If you're on a sports team, you need to practice every day to win. For example, I played football in high school, and we won a silver trophy. Then, we practiced every day to win the final match, and we did. If you're on a sports team and you win a game, you should keep practicing so you can win again.\n\nSometimes, it can be hard to keep working towards the next goal, but it's good to stay positive and believe in yourself.

People talk to others on the phone. Some don't talk face-to-face; they use technology instead. For example, when you travel to another country, you have to speak their language; you can't use technology to talk to them.\n\nTechnology has both good and bad effects if you use it correctly. There are some good things about technology: it sends mail quickly, allows phone calls, lets you talk to someone, and makes online shopping easy. But technology also affects people's minds by making them play too many games and spend too much time on the phone, and not talk to others.\n\nThe most important effect of technology on humans is talking. Many people don't talk because they use technology too much, and it affects their lives by making them sit at home and be on the phone for hours. People need to talk more than just being on the phone. Technology is growing every day, which means that in ten years, people won't be talking to each other. Everyone will talk on the phone or use other technology.\n\nThe second most important effect of technology is on kids. When a kid cries, their parents think that giving them a phone or technology will make them stop crying. I think that's not a good idea because their mind will get used to it, and every time they cry, they'll want a phone to calm them down. Parents let their kids have a phone and let them use it even during lunch or dinner. It's good now, but in the future, it's not that good because they won't know how to talk to someone without using technology.\n\nOverall, I think technology is good. It's good to use technology, but not all the time, not to talk to people, but to get work done. Don't let your kids use technology too much; it's not good for them. Technology makes them prefer phones instead of talking in person."}

When he thought about the phrase, 'Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow,' I imagine he felt scared but also brave.\n\nFirst, Emerson didn't just think about the phrase - he wrote it down. He didn't write it just for himself, but to change our minds. Sometimes we're okay with what we know, but we're not happy with it.\n\nThis phrase makes me think about trying new things and finding what we really want. We shouldn't stay in the same place because we're scared.\n\nThe phrase is telling us to move forward, learn new things, and grow every day.\n\nSecond, we often get stuck with our problems. I remember when I was a kid, I fell down in the park and stayed there for almost an hour. I didn't want to get up because I felt comfortable. My mom found me and told me it was time to go home, where I had a nice bed. This reminds me of Emerson's phrase. Growing isn't just about getting more things, but also about growing in our minds. For example, someone might have a lot of money but want more. They're growing in wealth, but not in their minds. It's better to grow in our minds by being a good person, loving others, being respectful, honest, and making friends. That's what makes a person different.\n\nIn conclusion, remember Emerson's phrase: 'Unless you do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow.'

But it's a great idea because students can feel stressed at school with homework and projects. Schools should think about how students feel.\n\nWhat are the benefits of a long and a short summer break?\n\nA long summer break is good because students can work, hang out with friends and family, and do what they want. A short summer break is good because students won't forget what they learned.\n\nIn my opinion, a long summer break is a good idea. Students can have more free time at home. If teachers think students will forget, they can give them a little homework. Then students can enjoy their vacation. For example, when I'm on summer break, I work, buy what I want, and spend time with my family and friends.\n\nI think schools should think more about this. Students don't always get a break. They're in school all day and can't do what they want. It's fair to have a long summer break. Some students have to take classes in the summer, and they only get two or three weeks, which isn't enough. As a student, I feel stressed sometimes because I have to think about my grades and all my work. When I'm on vacation, I enjoy every day because it's not always possible, and I can sleep more.\n\nIn conclusion, students should have a long summer break. They can enjoy their vacation and do what they want. It doesn't happen all the time, and they can even travel to other countries if they want."}

I've experienced this myself. For instance, I had to do my chores. I had to fold my clothes, clean my room, and do other tasks. I finished all of this quickly. If we want something but don't do anything to get it, how will we get it? We need to take action to get what we want.\n\nSome people think that doing nothing can also be helpful.

I don't like seeing people sad or angry. I want to make the world a better place where people don't judge others based on how they look, where they come from, or how they dress. For example, I had a friend who was often talked about because of her appearance or where she came from. She felt so bad that she wanted to do harmful things.

Choosing a career early does not harm students' lives. In fact, it's a good idea because it prepares students well for their future goals and lets them finish their career early.\n\nFirst, when students choose a career in high school, they learn a lot by the time they enter college. For example, a student from a specific school said that all his high school classes were related to his future career. He felt lucky to have taken those classes, which helped him succeed in college. So, it's a good idea to prepare students for their careers at a young age.\n\nSecond, when students focus on their career in high school, they can finish it quickly. For example, a literature expert said she finished her master's degree in just two years. She had a certificate in literature when she graduated from high school, which helped her finish her degree quickly. Overall, choosing a high school that guides students towards a specific career is a great decision.\n\nSome people think that 15-year-old students are not mature enough to choose a career. For instance, a student said he wanted to be an art teacher for kids when he was 15, but later realized he didn't enjoy it. However, taking classes that prepare students for a specific career is still a good idea, as most students will have two valuable certificates or degrees by the time they finish high school.\n\nIn conclusion, choosing a high school that guides students towards a specific career is excellent. Starting to focus on a career at 15 will give students many advantages. A student who focuses on a specific career in high school will be well-prepared to finish college quickly.\n\nAlthough some students may not be mature enough to make such a big decision.

These phones were not like the ones we have today. They had to stay at home and be connected.\n\nOne good thing about technology is that it helps us find our way. GPS guides us to where we want to go.\n\nGPS uses satellites to show us the way. It tells us if we're going the right or wrong way.\n\nWe can even see the area around us using satellite mode. It shows us houses, roads, markets, and even cars if we zoom in.\n\nThis is helpful for jobs like tracking people. The police can use it to find someone's address.\n\nParents can also track their kids if they leave the house without permission.\n\nAnother way technology has helped is through machines. Machines can do what they're programmed to do.\n\nFor example, Alexa is a device that answers our questions. Machines also help make our clothes.\n\nA long time ago, Eli Whitney invented the Cotton Gin. It made a lot of fabric, so we could stay warm and comfortable.\n\nPhones are very popular around the world. Everybody uses them.\n\nAlexander Graham Bell became very famous. He invented the phone, which became very popular a hundred years later.\n\nPeople back then didn't have the technology we have today. They had to ride horses and follow signs to find their way.\n\nWithout technology, the world would be much slower today."}

Idle means someone who doesn't work hard or have a purpose. For example, if you don't study, you won't achieve your goals or get a good education.\n\nIf you want to join the military, you need to work hard in school. I want to join the United States Marine Corps, but if I don't study hard, I won't make it. To join the military, you need to study hard to pass a test and go through training. If you don't like to run or study, why choose the military? There are many jobs that don't require running or studying. But if you want your dream job, you need to work hard.\n\nMany people have goals they want to achieve before it's too late. But some people are lazy. If you want to be the fastest reader, you need to read every day. My goal is to lose weight. To reach that goal, I need to be active, like running or lifting weights. People need to be active to lose weight.\n\nEducation is very important. Many students go to school to get an education and prepare for the future. Students who study have more opportunities in life than those who don't. Some students regret not doing well in school because they didn't get a good job.\n\nIn conclusion, always work hard towards your goals, school, or anything you want in life. You may not always achieve it, but at least you can say you tried. If you don't try, you'll never get there. The world has good things for you, but if you're lazy, you'll never see them. You just need to try your best and never give up. Be happy with yourself and don't give up."}

Today, things are very different; students have many opportunities to explore different careers.\n\nDear Manager, I think every student should have the chance to explore careers because it helps us figure out what we want to do in the future, gain experience in different types of jobs, and it's essential for a country's growth.\n\nEvery student has a dream job they want to achieve when they grow up. Having the chance to discover what we want to do in the future is very important. For example, a high school student wants to finish college, get a job, and be successful. But that student doesn't know what's the best fit for them. By giving students the chance to explore different jobs, it will help them find the right job, and it will reduce stress and depression. From my experience, some students in my school are struggling with depression because they're worried about their future and jobs. I believe that if we had the chance to discover what we're interested in, it would help us reduce stress.\n\nHaving experience means having knowledge. It's an honor to have experience in different careers. In the United States, it's very important to have experience before applying for a job. Since we're students and we had the chance to gain experience, I strongly believe that we can find the best career for us, and it won't be difficult when we move to the next level. For instance, a friend of mine, a college graduate, applied to a hospital as a surgeon, but the manager needed art skills, which she didn't have. It ruined her plans and made things complicated, and she couldn't get the job.\n\nFinally, developing our country is in our hands. If we had this opportunity, we would work on developing our country. Most students will be dedicated to their jobs if they find their best fit; they will work with passion and kindness and will inspire the next generation too. For example, a student who dreamed of being a designer worked hard, created amazing clothes, made everyone happy, and became the most famous designer in the world, just because he found the right job for him.\n\nSome company managers think it's not important for students to partner with their companies, but I totally disagree. First, it determines our future jobs; second, it gives us experience; and lastly, it inspires others and develops the country.\n\nIn conclusion, we can see how the United States has developed since students had opportunities to explore their careers. A huge difference came in those years, as I said, students in the past didn't have the opportunity and had a hard time achieving their dreams. And I believe that if all companies open partnerships with schools, it will help us gain experience, develop, and inspire others, and will lead to a bright future for students."}

If I make a mistake, my group can correct me, and we finish the task on time.\n\nI believe working in a group is better because if I have a big task to finish quickly, I need help. If I have friends who can assist me, we can finish on time. For example, if I have to make a presentation on finance, I can write it, and someone else can make the graph. I think this way is better.\n\nHowever, I also think that working alone is good because sometimes others can distract me, and I forget to do my work. If I'm talking too much, my boss might get angry, and I could lose my job. For instance, my dad lost his job because he was texting on his phone and distracting others. Now he knows better and doesn't do that anymore.\n\nThe problem is, if I like talking to others too much, working in a group can be a distraction.

Many friendships and relationships start with social media or exchanging phone numbers. People always have some way to contact each other.

{"text_id_kaggle": "2D7557DCE6AF", "output_essay": "Have you ever heard the saying, 'If you want to make it in life, you have to start with yourself'? This saying relates to what author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote. Everyone has their own talent, dream, and goal. But how do we achieve them? Giving up, doubting ourselves, and lacking motivation won't take us to success. Emerson's statement is motivating. He says, 'Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow.' This should open people's eyes.\n\nMany people lack direction about their future. I'm not saying it's easy, but someone needs to start somewhere. For example, my uncle's friend lost his sister at 14 due to a tragic event. This led to unhealthy actions in the household, affecting him and his parents. At 16, he decided to honor his sister and reunite the family. He joined the high school wrestling team. He wasn't the best, but he worked hard to become undefeated. His sister's death motivated him to achieve this goal.\n\nBeing confident makes us feel good physically and emotionally. On the other hand, doubting ourselves is easy when we're unsure. For example, when a teacher asks a question, a student may wait for another student to answer. What if the other student is correct? The doubting student may think, 'I should've said it myself.' This happens to everyone, but sometimes we need to be confident, even if we're wrong. We can learn from our mistakes and use them to do better.\n\nDo you think giving up is the right thing to do? In my opinion, giving up is for losers. If you want to get somewhere in life, you need to strive to do your best. Giving up brings no good. It's like running around the track and giving up just before the finish line. Giving up is not the answer; pushing ourselves is.\n\nTo conclude, I strongly agree with Ralph Waldo Emerson's statement. We need to add confidence, push ourselves hard, and use our weaknesses to motivate us to find our purpose in life."}

To achieve our goals, we need to work hard.\n\nSome people might not want to move on after achieving their goals because they want to focus on what they've already achieved. For instance, if someone wants to be a teacher, they need to study hard to become one. Every goal requires hard work. Sometimes we might not reach our goals, but we shouldn't give up. We should try again and again. Giving up means we won't achieve anything in life. I think a goal is not just about achieving something, but about working hard to get there.\n\nShould people stop after achieving their goals? I don't think so. Our goals are endless, and we should always strive to achieve more. If we finish one goal, we should want to achieve another one.

The only problem is that you need a debit or credit card to buy online. This helps almost everyone in the United States because you can buy things from other states too.\n\nPersonally, I like buying online because it's easy for me. I go to school in the morning and work in the evening, so I don't have much time to go out and buy things. I've had bad experiences with mean store employees. One time, I went to Giant with my mom to buy baby formula for my little brother. The manager said they didn't have it, but we saw it near the entrance when we were leaving. I was angry because some people can be very mean.\n\nI prefer to have less contact with people because many workers seem unhappy and forced to smile. I used to work at a sandwich shop, and I loved smiling and asking customers about their day. Technology also helps people who don't have transportation. They can order things online and have them delivered to their door. You can even order cooked food, like Chinese food, and have it delivered in 30 minutes or less.\n\nHowever, there's a downside to buying online. There are hackers who can get into your accounts and steal your money. My dad's credit card information was stolen once, and someone was buying things with it. We couldn't track them because they used different addresses.\n\nMany people play games on their devices. There are fun games for all ages, and you can download them easily. You can even buy things in the games, like a new pool table design. I play 8-ball, but I'm careful not to buy anything because I'm afraid of hackers.\n\nYou can also read books on your device, which is very convenient. I used to read on my phone, but now I don't have much time to read. I like sad or romantic novels, but I don't like horror or mystery books.\n\nIn conclusion, technology is very helpful in many ways. It's especially helpful for people who don't like talking to strangers. They can do everything online without leaving their house. However, you need to be careful when using technology because it can also be bad. You should be at least 18 or have an adult's supervision when using technology. Don't leave your accounts open or share risky information. Be careful when buying things online. With all that said, I hope you understand what technology can do and that it's a positive thing."}

I believe you don't need to decide on a career in your first year of high school. This essay will explain why it's better to choose a career at the end of high school, or in your junior year. Picking a career and committing to it at the end of high school helps you grow as a person and makes you proud of yourself.\n\nFirst, you might not know what you want to do when you start high school. You're still a kid and need time to learn about different careers. You should wait until your senior year and make a career plan. This is very important because it gives you direction and helps you see what you want to do in the future. For example, if you don't know your strengths, weaknesses, and skills, a career plan can help you with that. This shows why it's essential to wait and make a plan.\n\nIn addition, high school offers many different classes for different careers. You can take classes like business marketing, engineering, and art. You might change your mind about a career in high school, and that's okay. High school is a time to explore different careers. You can always change your mind, and internships can help you find the right major. Internships are great experiences that can help you make decisions about your future.\n\nAnother reason is that freshmen don't need to choose a career right away. It should be a process. For example, a famous basketball player, James Brook, didn't know what he wanted to do after high school. But when he was a junior, he started taking basketball seriously, and now he has a successful career. This shows that you don't need to decide on a career when you're a freshman.\n\nAfter thinking about all this, I believe that choosing a career at a young age is not a good idea. You should care about your career when you're a senior or junior. Don't worry about choosing a career when you're a freshman; it's not necessary. If you pick a career and commit to it at the end of high school, it makes you grow as a person and makes you proud of yourself. This will help you when you start looking for jobs."}

This means they need it all the time and can't live without it. Many teens are addicted to their phones and need to use them constantly. Social media is a good example, as most teens use it daily.\n\nTechnology can have both positive and negative effects on people's lives. It comes in different forms and serves various purposes. As technology continues to develop and change, people will adapt to these changes, for better or for worse."}

But I believe that if you're always doing something, you'll achieve more. \n\nFirst, when you're always busy, you get used to doing your best. Some students have trouble focusing on homework. I think that if you keep doing things, you'll earn something big. When you find something that makes you happy, especially if you get paid for it.\n\nSecond, people want to work with someone who works hard. Nobody wants to work with someone who does nothing. In my opinion, someone who's always doing something has more chances to find people to work with.\n\nThird, some people wait for a reason to do something. Students take their time to do things.\n\nI think doing nothing is a waste of time. Today's students are getting lazy and don't want to do homework, classwork, or take tests.

{"text_id_kaggle": "21CCDFC527FA", "output_essay": "Imagination is important because it helps us understand things better. For example, when we read a book with no pictures, we use our imagination to picture what's happening. Imagination is like our own private world that only we can see. It helps us think in ways that make sense to us. Knowledge is what we know and how smart we are.\n\nImagination makes learning easy and fun. It's like having pictures in our head that help us understand things. It's almost as important as knowledge. Knowledge is how we think, and imagination helps us think in a way that's easy to understand.\n\nKnowledge is important because it shows how smart we are and helps us in life. But it can be boring to read a book with no pictures or do homework. Imagination helps make things more fun. For example, when we play hide and seek, we can imagine we're a spy and do what the spy would do to hide. It makes the game more fun. We can also imagine what's happening in a book with no pictures.\n\nSo, do I agree with Albert Einstein? I do. He said that imagination is more important than knowledge. I think both are important, but when we use them together, it's even better. We can have fun while we work and finish it on time. Imagination helps us enjoy life and make the most of it."}
{"text_id_kaggle": "6AFE8F926910", "output_essay": "Have you ever felt excited when your teacher tells you to work with your friends or classmates who are good at a subject? As a student, I always have a great day at school when my teacher lets me work with my friends or classmates who are good at a subject. When I work in a group, I never feel like I'm having a bad day at school, no matter how big the assignment or project is. Working in a group is better because it helps students share their ideas and communicate with each other.\n\nThe first reason working in a group is better is that it helps students share their ideas. For example, when students work on an assignment or project in a group, they share their ideas, and that helps them finish their work without too many problems. In my freshman year of high school, my English teacher gave us a project based on a book we read in class. She put students in groups, and each group had four students. In my group, we met every day after school and shared what each of us thought about the book. Everyone shared their thoughts, and one of us wrote everything down. Doing that every day helped us finish our work easily without getting confused. This shows how working in a group helps students finish their task easily by sharing their ideas.\n\nThe second reason working in a group is better is that it helps students communicate with each other. Some students at school have trouble talking to their classmates during classes. Other students find it hard to talk to their classmates because they think they're mean. A good way to get those students to talk to their classmates is by putting them in groups during projects, assignments, and classwork. Working in a group helps them communicate because they need to talk to each other to finish the project, assignment, or classwork. Therefore, letting students work in a group is one way to help them talk to each other.\n\nSome people may say that working alone is better because it helps a student stay focused. For example, when students work alone, they can focus on what they're doing. They don't have to worry about who's doing the work or who's not, and that helps them finish their task fast. However, when you work in a group, you have less work to do because you can share your ideas with other students, and they can share their ideas with you. A person who works in a group has less work compared to someone who works alone.\n\nIn conclusion, working in a group is better because it helps students share their thoughts and communicate with each other. If students work in a group on a project, assignment, or classwork, they can finish the task easily because they get to share their thoughts and talk to each other. Working in a group can give students a great day at school, and they don't have to worry about how big an assignment or project is. Students get excited when they work in a group, and they should be given that opportunity."}

This means, do we get more done if we're always doing something, or is doing nothing also important? Most people think doing nothing is important, and here's why: it lets our brains rest. Without rest, you'll get too tired and your brain won't work well.\n\nOne reason people think doing nothing is important is that it lets our brains rest. For example, after a stressful day at work, you want to relax and do nothing at home. This helps your brain relax and understand things better. You'll go back to work feeling fresh and ready for the next day. I had a similar experience in 10th grade when I was stressed about not passing to the next grade. I took a day off from schoolwork and realized I could get help after school to catch up. This shows that doing nothing can be helpful.\n\nAnother reason doing nothing is important is that without rest, you'll get too tired and your brain won't work well. There have been cases where people passed out from working too hard and not sleeping enough. If you don't rest your brain, it won't work at its best. It's been shown that 95% of people who pass out are mainly due to exhaustion.\n\nSo, this is why you should rest and relax sometimes.\n\nSome people may say that you get more done by working, like learning more things. However, it's been shown that people pass out due to lack of sleep from work or school. You shouldn't risk your health just to learn more.\n\nIn conclusion, doing nothing is important for your mental health. It lets you rest, and without rest, you'll get too tired and your brain won't work well. Overall, this is why doing nothing serves a purpose in life."}
{"text_id_kaggle": "7BC44C6974ED", "output_essay": "Should schools partner with companies to help students find their dream job? Many schools offer various activities, classes, and company partnerships to help students discover their future career. This helps students prepare for their ideal job from a young age. Some people think schools should not provide these opportunities because they believe students take advantage of them. However, schools should offer company partnerships because they give students a better chance to achieve their desired job and prepare them for the future.\n\nThose who disagree think students get too many opportunities from schools and take them for granted. They want students to find their own way without school help. But well-educated students can make a company better and bring change. They gain experience from school partnerships, which is essential for getting a job.\n\nStudents can plan their future by taking advantage of school opportunities like company partnerships and academies. This helps them take a step forward and think about their interests. For example, I want to be a nurse because I like helping people. My school has a nursing program that prepares students for the job. But a company partnership would give me real experience. Some people believe that students can make better decisions if they have hands-on experience. Schools should provide more company partnerships so students can achieve their desired job.\n\nEvery student should have the chance to discover their ideal job. If a school does not offer partnerships, students who know what they want to be should still get opportunities. Students can prepare for their future job if schools provide more company partnerships. This helps them see if a job is hard or easy and if they are interested in it. Some schools offer partnerships for certain jobs, and it would be great if they offered more opportunities. I would like to try a partnership in the Nursing Field to see if it's right for me. All students want to experience their desired job before committing to it.\n\nIn conclusion, schools should provide company partnerships because they help students achieve their desired job and prepare them for the future. We all want a good job, but it takes effort to find it. Before we get a job, we want to experience it to make sure it's right for us."}

{"text_id_kaggle": "9D0BFC12EB89", "output_essay": "How can people work effectively? When people work on projects or tasks, they often have too much to do or find it hard to finish alone. In school, teachers give assignments, and students need to finish them within a limited time. So, how can students finish their work more easily and quickly? Working in a group is more effective than working alone because you can share the workload and teach each other.\n\nWhen you work with a group, you can divide the workload with your teammates. Some tasks are too big to handle alone. But when you work with others, they can take on some of your workload. For example, in a science class, students can share their positions when conducting an experiment. One person writes the report, others prepare the materials, and so on. By sharing the workload, students can save time and finish their work early.\n\nAnother reason group work is effective is that people can learn from each other. When people work, they may not know something. But in a group, teammates can teach each other what they don't know. For example, in an after-school study club, students help each other and learn from the teacher. By working together, people can help and learn from each other.\n\nSome people think working alone is better because it helps them grow and develop. They think that by solving problems on their own, they can find their own answers and build a study plan. For example, studying for the SAT is a good example. When students study on their own, they can find their own answers and grow effectively. However, they may have problems that are too hard to solve alone. But if they work with friends or others, they can learn how to find the answers.\n\nIn conclusion, working with others is better than working alone. When people work together, they can save time and learn more effectively. So, try to work with your friends."}
{"text_id_kaggle": "6F9FF71B9E51", "output_essay": "Thomas Jefferson said, 'Determine never to be idle... it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing.' This means that if you do something, you will get more work done than if you did nothing. Jefferson is right. If you want to achieve a big goal, like going to college, you need to work for it. If you don't work for it, you won't make it.\n\nSports are a good example of why doing something is worth your time. If you want to become a professional in a sport, like football, you need to dedicate a lot of time to it. You need good grades and to be excellent in the field, which takes up a lot of your day. If you played a sport in high school, your daily routine would be waking up, going to school for 7 hours, and then going to a 3-hour practice. You would also have to give up having fun with your friends, which doesn't help you achieve your dreams. In sports, you always need to work hard to achieve your dream.\n\nSchool is another reason why Jefferson was right. School requires time and attention to pass. School is important for getting a good job and succeeding in the future. If you pay attention to your teacher, do your homework, and class work, you will likely pass the class. In school, you need to manage your time and do all your work to pass.\n\nJefferson said that if you always do something, you will achieve more, which is true. All the reasons I mentioned are why it's true. Nothing in life is free; you need to work for it. You need to make sacrifices to achieve your goals, whatever they may be."}
{"text_id_kaggle": "90E603794946", "output_essay": "I believe that doing something every day helps us achieve more. The more we do, the more we gain. Being active gives us an advantage and keeps us healthy. People who work hard every day earn a lot of money. This is because when we work more hours and do our job well, we get paid. On the other hand, if we don't do anything, we won't earn any money.\n\nLet me give you an example. Imagine you and your friend are building a tool shed. You work hard on it for weeks and make a big, strong shed. Your friend, however, takes only two days to build a shed, but it's not finished. This shows that hard work pays off.\n\nBeing active also gives us a head start. For instance, if we have a project due next week, most people will wait until the last day to do it. But if we start early, we can finish it quickly and have the rest of the week free. If we work on paperwork, the more we do, the less we'll have to do later. If we put in extra time after work, we'll be ready for the next day.\n\nBeing active also means we can be fit and healthy. If we go to the gym every day and exercise, we'll see a big difference. We'll be strong and healthy. But if we're inactive, we might get sick or gain weight. We might spend all day playing video games and eating junk food. We won't go to the gym, and we won't see sunlight. In conclusion, I believe that doing something every day is better because it helps us achieve more, prepares us for the future, and keeps our bodies fit and strong."}

You can check out books, shop, and play games without talking to anyone. It was a good idea to develop technology because you can stay home and buy clothes, kids can play online, and you can talk to others.\n\nYou can shop online without leaving your house. For example, you can buy food, shoes, and clothes. When you buy shoes, you can pick your size. If you buy clothes, you can choose the one you like best. You can see many clothes on the page, but you pick only the one you like best. It's easier with technology.\n\nKids can play online with friends. For example, if you have a game and you want to play online with friends or cousins. When you're online and play with friends, you can talk with a microphone. There are many benefits to these online games. Technology has changed a lot.\n\nYou can talk to others with technology. For example, if you live here and your family lives in another country, you can call them. You can text people sometimes when you can't travel and see your family, but you can text them every day. Or you can use technology for work; many people use technology for their jobs. Technology changes every day, and if you want to talk to your family or friends, you can just call them.\n\nI think technology is helpful because you can use it for everything: you can shop online, play games, and talk to others.

That's why I want to tell you about the benefits of working in a group. Working in a group is better than working alone because students can improve their social skills, have more ideas, and work faster together.\n\nTalking to people helps you work on your social skills. When you work in a group, you can learn how to work as a team and cooperate with others. You can ask your teacher or group members for help, which teaches you how to ask questions and talk to others. Socializing is important because we use it every day, not just in school. When you practice your social skills in school projects, it can help you in the future. For example, it can help you in job interviews and when meeting new people. Good communication skills are important in any relationship, whether it's with friends, family, or a partner.\n\nWhen you work alone, it's hard to come up with ideas. But when you work in a group, each person can add their ideas, making it easier and faster. I know it's hard to brainstorm alone, but when you talk to others, you can come up with more ideas. This skill can help you in the future, whether you want to start a business or create something new.\n\nIn a group project, everyone has a job to do. I remember working on a project in middle school where we had to make a poster for history class. We each had a task, and we chose the person best suited for each job. This made the work easy and fast. It's beneficial because it helps everyone and teaches us new skills.\n\nIn conclusion, working in a group is better than working alone. It helps students improve their social skills, come up with more ideas, and work faster together. That's why I prefer to work with a partner or in a group - it helps me in many ways, and it can help you too."}

Most people prefer to make their own decisions because they know what's best for their lives. They make the best choice to solve their problem. Sometimes, people have tough problems, but they try to solve them even if it means making a hard decision. For example, in families, people often disagree, but everyone has the right to decide what's best.\n\nAnother reason is that it keeps others out of their business.

Track helps me focus and relax because I forget about everything else except running. I have track practices on Sundays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays at Fairfax High School. On Sundays, I'm there from 12 to 3, and on other days, I'm there from 6 to 9. My friends usually give me a ride to and from practice. There's only one track season, and it costs about 75 dollars. Track is a great way to meet new friends because there are many people who do it, and everyone is really nice. Although track is fun, it's also hard because we have to do tough drills and warm-ups, especially in the hot sun. Warm-ups take over 30 minutes, and then we choose what type of track event we want to do, like long-distance running or sprinting. We're divided into groups by age, so 13-14 and 15-16. Practices are the worst part because everyone gets tired and can barely breathe. The best part is the track meets, where we have real competitions. Track is also a great way to stay active, which is why my friends and I like it. We're in our second year of doing it. The coaches are tough but nice, depending on how well we're doing. We don't need much to bring to practice - just a water bottle and running shoes. Some advanced runners wear special shoes and compression shorts to make running more comfortable and faster. Track season starts in March and ends in June, so it's a big commitment. Doing track helps prepare us for other sports that involve running, like football, basketball, and baseball. I prefer practicing on a real track field because it's more exciting and feels more professional. Sometimes we practice on grass, but that's harder because it's uneven and can cause ankle injuries. Overall, these are the reasons why my friends and I enjoy track so much - it's easy, and it helps us with other sports."}

I want to visit old homes from the 1900s, like the ones I see in historical movies. They look cool, and I like the way people dress up for them.\n\nThat's what I would do if I went to South Korea. Have you thought about where you want to go with your family or friends? If you have, do what you want to do when you get there. If not, it's a waste of time.

We used to have big, bulky computers that looked like TVs. Now we have small computers that can turn into tablets. Phones used to be big and bulky, then small and sleek, and now they're big again. It's amazing how things can change and then go back to the way they were.\n\nOur music has changed from songs with meaning to songs that repeat the same word. Some new music still has meaning, but it's not as heartfelt as old songs. I love 60's music, but we've come a long way from it. Some people still listen to 60's music, but most young people don't like it. Now, 80's music is funky and fun - like Whitney Houston's \"I Wanna Dance with Somebody\" and \"Funky Town\".\n\nLet's talk about hairstyles. From the 60's to now, a lot has changed. Today, people often wear their hair in a ponytail or bun. Some people just wash their hair and go to work. In the 80's, people used a lot of hairspray and took a lot of time to style their hair. In the 60's, there were beehives and victory rolls, which I love. But it would be weird if everyone wore these hairstyles every day.\n\nClothing styles have also changed. We thought mom jeans were old news, but they're back in style. Vans used to be made fun of, but now everyone wears them. Dresses have changed from big Victorian dresses to tight bodycon dresses. Our style has changed a lot.\n\nIn conclusion, I agree with Ralph Waldo Emerson's quote, \"Unless you try to do something beyond what you already mastered, you will never grow.\""}

Each group member can do a different task. For example, one person can find information, while another person finds images or videos.\n\nYou can also make new friends and feel comfortable in the group. This helps you share your ideas with others. Sometimes, people don't share their ideas because they're not comfortable. I remember in 7th grade, my History teacher made us work in groups. I wanted to work with my friends, but she put me in a different group. I was quiet at first, but a girl in the group introduced me to everyone, and they were all nice.

Many people believe that setting a good example is the only way to influence others. A good attitude and behavior can influence others in different situations, such as sports and school.\n\nA good attitude can influence others in different situations. For example, in sports, if a team loses a game, they will feel sad and angry. But if one player has a good attitude, it will influence the other team members. This player will know how to lose and win, and they will talk to the team about it. It doesn't matter if you win or lose; you should always have a good attitude.\n\nIn school, your attitude and behavior can also influence others. If you go to school with a bad attitude, it will affect your grades because a bad attitude makes you lazy. But if you see a student who is not lazy, has good grades, and helps others, it's because of their good attitude. If you have a good attitude in school, it will influence others because they will see that you're doing well in your classes and helping others.

{"text_id_kaggle": "003969F4EDB6", "output_essay": "Albert Schweitzer, a famous philosopher, said, \"Example is not the main thing in influencing others; it is the only thing.\" I believe that setting a good example through our actions is the best way to influence others.\n\nI think this because people look up to others, actions are more powerful than words, and examples are always present in our lives.\n\nLet me explain why I believe this.\n\nFirst, people look up to others. Both kids and adults are influenced by what others do every day. We all have someone we admire and want to be like. What our role models do affects what we do. For example, if an actor on a kids' TV show is kind and respectful, kids who watch the show will likely be kind and respectful too.\n\nSecond, actions are more powerful than words. This old saying is true. Actions show more feeling and emotion than words. Since actions are visible, they inspire and influence others more. For example, giving a high five shows you're a good sport better than saying \"Good job.\"\n\nThird, examples are always present in our lives. We learn by copying others. Kids grow up following their parents' examples. Words don't mean much to them at first. As we grow up, our ideas change because of the people around us. We're more affected by what others do than what they say.\n\nSome people think physical action is a better way to influence others. But I think they're wrong. Physical action can actually make people want to do the opposite. Setting good examples works better because it can inspire people from far away.\n\nIn conclusion, because people look up to others, actions are more powerful than words, and examples are always present in our lives, I believe setting a good example is the best way to influence others. So, go out and set a good example for your kids or friends \u2013 it's the only way to influence others."}
{"text_id_kaggle": "902459E92932", "output_essay": "We get more done when we're always doing something.\n\nHave you ever thought about what you could achieve if you were always doing something? Being active is a big part of life and has many benefits. People who are always doing something tend to have a good lifestyle. Being active helps you stay healthy, be successful, and learn new things. Not being active can have bad effects on your health, behavior, and abilities.\n\nFirst, being active helps you stay healthy. Many active people live healthy lives, but not all. Some active people are not healthy because of their living conditions. Many people complain about being overweight and unhappy. Being overweight can be stressful and lead to depression. This affects your overall health. Being active helps your body fight diseases. If you're not active and your health is poor, your body won't have the energy to fight off diseases, which can lead to serious health problems.\n\nAlso, not being active reduces your chances of being successful. People who are always active are the ones who reach their goals and become successful. Being active teaches you to work hard and be independent. My father once told me, 'If you work hard, are dedicated, and responsible, you'll be successful in the future.' Success comes from hard work. To be successful, you need to put in all your effort and dedicate yourself to your work. Even though some active people don't achieve their goals because they're satisfied with what they've done, that's not the right way to be successful. To be successful, you need to keep doing something or trying something new.\n\nIn conclusion, people who are always doing something are the ones who always learn something new. Being active teaches you new skills and how to do things differently. People learn from their mistakes because they're always trying something. For example, I once wanted to learn how to play the drums. I was always trying to find a rhythm by using buckets and cans to make noise. As time passed, I developed some skills. I didn't give up but instead kept learning. I took a drum class, and that's when I developed all my skills and learned what I wanted to achieve. Being active teaches you to be confident, patient, and eager to learn new things. People who are not active sometimes don't care about learning new things, and most of them are not patient. Learning new things is a way to be successful and helps you open your mind.\n\nNot being active won't help you in life; it will bring depression, lack of understanding, and irresponsibility. Being healthy, successful, and learning new things all come from being active and doing something. We get more done when we're always doing something. Think about it: what will you learn, what goals will you achieve, or how will your health be if you're not active? With this, I leave you today: being inactive is not good, but always doing something will benefit you in one way or another."}
{"text_id_kaggle": "0DA397621836", "output_essay": "Trying new things every day can bring good opportunities. On the other hand, doing the same routine won't help you learn something new. The author Ralph Waldo Emerson said, 'You will never grow unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered.' I agree with this statement for a few reasons.\n\nFirst, trying new things helps you learn and grow as a person. You make mistakes, but you learn from them and won't do it again. This helps you become a better person, and others can admire you.\n\nSecond, if you don't try new things, you won't grow, and you won't be a good model for your kids. Your kids might do the same things as you and won't move forward. They might live an unhappy life. Learning from mistakes can be good because you learn, but it can also be bad if you don't move on.\n\nLastly, trying new things helps you live a better life and be happy. Happy people can influence others to do the same. When you learn from your mistakes, you can prevent others from making the same mistakes. For example, I once fell down at a slippery spot on my way to the bus stop. I warned my sister not to step on that spot, so she wouldn't make the same mistake. Helping others can make you feel better about your mistakes.\n\nIn conclusion, people who try new things are more successful than those who don't. People who learn new things in a subject they like know more about it than those who just do the same thing every day. Not learning new things can lead to an unhappy and boring life."}

For example, I go to soccer practice and do my chores after school. If the school day gets longer, I won't be able to do these things.\n\nNext, a longer school day will take away time with family. Some students only see their parents in the afternoon. My cousin, for example, only sees her mom for two hours in the afternoon because her mom works at night. If the school day gets longer, my cousin will have even less time with her mom. This would make her sad and maybe even depressed.\n\nSome people think a longer school day will help students get better grades. But this is not true. The Health Department of Virginia did a test and found that 89% of students got lower grades when the school day was longer. They were also very stressed. The Health Department said it's a bad idea to add time to school because it will harm students. Many students get headaches in school, which makes it hard to focus. If the school day gets longer, the headaches will get worse, and grades will suffer.\n\nIn conclusion, adding time to school will hurt students in many ways.

These results include students skipping school, a bad environment, and mental exhaustion.\n\nThe main problem is that students might stop coming to school. Many students already think school is too long. Adding more time could make them want to avoid school even more. They might stay home to sleep in, be late, or start working early. If we add an hour and a half to the school day, it could stop them from getting to work on time. The more time we spend at school, the less time they have for work.\n\nAnother problem is that extra time at school would create a bad environment. We might look like we come to school to learn, but some students come for social time with friends. If we add more time, they will have more time to socialize. Every school has some troublemakers, and more time means more trouble. Students who don't like school might protest.\n\nThe final problem is that extra time could mentally exhaust us. As a student, I get tired in my second class. We do things that need a lot of thinking, like math. More time in class means more mental work, which can make us frustrated.

The key is to find something everyone will enjoy. Kids should join school plays and other after-school activities. Being in a play helps kids feel confident. It helps them speak in front of a crowd. Kids will want to do something other than watch TV. Those who don't want to act can help backstage, making costumes and writing scripts. There will be some bad days, but something good will come out of it. Trying something new in daily life creates interest. Sharing ideas and working together brings people together. People can create their own plays by coming up with ideas and brainstorming. Scriptwriters, actors, and the backstage crew can work together to make a play. This part is educational because everyone is sharing ideas and thinking constructively. To make the play interesting, writers need to add creativity, mystery, and drama to keep the audience engaged. Sharing ideas brings everyone's thinking together, which is teamwork. Competing with each other makes people work hard. They want to win, so they will work hard and pay attention. Sometimes people are nervous about speaking in front of a crowd, but participating in plays helps build confidence. If someone acts in a play, they won't feel scared or nervous again.

This makes it hard for them to do it or understand it like their classmates do. If the school has a homework club, students can get help with their homework or subject, and they will understand it better.\n\nAnother reason a homework club is a great idea is that students often fail their grade because of standardized tests. They also fail their school year because of these tests, making the rest of the year difficult. This happens because they don't understand or ask for help with the subject, which makes them even more worried about it.\n\nWhat if the student's class is a problem?

Without technology, I would be bored because I wouldn't know what's happening in the world. In my country, I couldn't even talk to my family. With technology, I can play video games, have fun watching TV or movies, but there are bad effects too.\n\nFor example, technology lets us have fun, and people can use it to find new ways to cure illnesses.\n\nThere are many things we can do with technology. For example, without technology, we couldn't travel around the world quickly; without technology, life would be very boring."}

When I need to know something, I can look it up online. If I don't know a word, I can check it in an online dictionary. Technology also helps me talk to my family, especially since I moved to the United States from Generic City three years ago. Without technology, I wouldn't be able to stay in touch with my brothers who still live in Generic City.\n\nOn the other hand, I think using technology can be bad. For example, when I'm in school, I shouldn't use my phone because it's a distraction. If I use my phone in class, I won't listen to the teacher, and this can cause problems. Too much technology use can also make me lose touch with friends and family. If I spend too much time on my phone, my friends might think I don't care about our friendship, and my family might feel ignored. Also, using technology too much can stop me from doing things I really like, such as playing with friends or reading books.\n\nI know people who spend a lot of time on social media like Facebook and WhatsApp. In my opinion, using technology every day can be a waste of time because it takes away from more important things.\n\nI remember when I first came to this school, I spent most of my time on my phone because I didn't have friends. But over time, I made some good friends, and now I spend more time with them and my family, using my phone only when I need to.\n\nIn conclusion, I think using technology has both good and bad effects."}

Their advice can be very helpful, but sometimes people's minds wander.

We saw the last gas station, but I thought I had enough gas. My father told me to fill up, but I didn't listen. When we ran out of gas, my father reminded me that I should have listened. I learned a lesson that day. I also learned that older people have more experience.\n\nSometimes we have trouble paying our bills. We don't know what to do, so we ask our friends, parents, and family. We look at our debts with our parents, and they help us find the problem. They tell us how to fix it. They advise us to save our leftover money. People who have trouble have parents or friends who know what to do.\n\nWhen we buy a used car, we might not ask enough questions. We might think we know a lot about cars. But then the car starts to break down. I remember I have an uncle who is a mechanic. I go to his workshop, and my dad is there.

People who think they know what to do can make mistakes.\n\nIn conclusion, people think asking for help is bad. But asking for help is not bad; taking advantage of it is.

We can talk to someone about how we feel, but if we're always on our phone, we won't have someone to talk to.\n\nPhones can be a big problem when we're at school, driving, or at work.

If you can't find an answer from someone, you can always find it with technology. You don't need to talk to anyone to find an answer anymore. It has changed our lives for the better. I'm excited to see how much more it will grow and improve."}

It's unfair when people buy things online instead of going to the store. Everyone has their own opinion about which company has the best online deals. The problem is that technology reduces human contact. We can improve by talking to each other. We need to stop relying too much on technology because it's getting out of control. Every year, technology improves a lot. New inventions like fast cars, TVs, cameras, microwaves, and cell phones help spread technology.\n\nWhen computers don't work, it's frustrating. For example, I lost my research paper when my computer crashed. Technology helps people who need it. But it distracts us from our work. Technology has changed and improved electronic devices over time.\n\nNow, people rely on technology to do everything. For example, I can text people to communicate. But sometimes, Wi-Fi doesn't work where I live. Long-distance calls can also disconnect. We should focus on ourselves and not use our phones so much.\n\nSome people think technology has affected us over time. We should change something to avoid letting technology control us. For example, I spent all day watching movies on my phone. The best way to avoid technology is to do things on our own. Some people think phones are a distraction when they make noise in class. Technology can cause problems, but it also helps.\n\nWhen computers stop working, it's infuriating. Now, people care too much about technology, and it's causing problems.

However, this can be too much pressure for 14-year-old students who are not sure what they want to do. Schools should focus on basic classes, and if a student wants to take a class that helps them with their career, they can. High school students should not be forced to take classes that lead to a specific career because they are not sure what they want to do, and these classes can be too stressful.\n\nStudents should not be forced to choose a career in eighth grade. The school should not expect freshmen to know what they want to do in the future and take classes that lead to that career. Students can change their minds anytime during high school. When we are kids, we may want to be singers, doctors, astronauts, or race car drivers. But as we grow up, we may change our minds and find new interests. For example, a student may want to be a writer and then decide they want to be a teacher after a year. Many things can affect our career choices, like teachers, parents, role models, and ourselves. Most students do not know what they want to do until junior or senior year; it's a choice we make as we grow up.\n\nTaking specific classes can be very stressful for young minds. Going to school every day to study for a specific career can be overwhelming. Many students also have special needs and may need extra time with schoolwork. Some students also participate in after-school activities, which can add more stress. For certain careers, students may need to take advanced math or AP classes. For example, if a student wants to be an electric engineer, they may need to take calculus and an engineering class, on top of their basic classes. These classes can be very stressful, depending on the student, as everyone learns differently.\n\nIn conclusion, high schools should not expect young students to know what career they want and take specific classes. This can cause students to feel forced to choose a career and be overly stressed. However, these classes can prepare students for college and their future careers. They can also help students understand their career choices better. These classes can lead to a bright future. Schools that require students to choose a career are just helping young minds go in the right direction."}

Some people might say you shouldn't choose me because I'm lazy. But I'm only lazy when I don't like the work or find it boring. \n\nPeople think I'm lazy because I don't show excitement when I do something.

I don't pretend to be excited about something I don't really care about. \n\nI think you should choose me because I learn quickly. When I find something I like, I try to learn it as fast as I can so I can do it on my own. For example, in gym class, I didn't know how to play basketball, but I liked watching others play. So, I learned how to play quickly, and now I know how to play. When I got my first job, I didn't know how to cook, but a friend taught me, and I learned fast. \n\nI think you should choose me because I'm very interested in the work your company does.

Today, we mainly use technology to communicate with others. We can't change the past, when we had to send letters or meet in person to talk. Who would have thought it would be so easy now? This situation has its good and bad points.\n\nFor example, some good points are online shopping, playing video games, and talking to others. But it also has bad points, like the big problem of cyberbullying. Over the years, things have changed, causing both good and bad effects in people's lives. In my opinion, the bad effects are more significant, and I'll tell you why.\n\nDo you remember when you would go outside, meet friends, and there was no social media or technology? It was just you and your friends having a great time! Technology wasn't a problem then. I wish we could go back to those times! Today, the main problem we face is cyberbullying. For those who don't know, it's when someone bullies another person nonstop using technology. They make the victims' lives miserable. They even get to the point where they want to harm themselves or others. That's one bad effect of technology.\n\nHave you ever felt too lazy to get up and buy food, clothes, or even read a book? Now you can do all that online. They call it online shopping. You can buy anything you want from anywhere. I think this is a bad effect. Why? Because you don't get to interact with others like humans should. We always look for the easy way out instead of getting up, meeting others, and seeing people! Believe it or not, taking a break from your phone is a good thing!\n\nThe lack of human contact due to technology has had both good and bad effects. I think it has mainly had a bad effect due to cyberbullying and not being able to interact with others. Doing online shopping instead of going to a store is another example. There are many reasons why technology has had a bad effect, but those are my reasons. I just hope people can change their mindset and not think it's always about technology."}

We must think about the consequences of our actions. Being a teenager is exciting, but we'll make mistakes. That's how we learn and grow. We'll also make good choices, like going to college or buying our first car.\n\nSetting boundaries is important. If we don't set limits, our lives can get out of control.

It's good to learn from our mistakes and do research before making a choice.\n\nSelf-respect and self-reliance are key. We must respect ourselves and others.

Everyone rushes to the halls to catch their bus and head home. They think about all the fun things they can do, like flying a kite or playing football, without thinking about school at all. But what if we took one and a half hours away from their free time? This could happen if the school board gets its way.\n\nIf I asked students if they wanted to add one and a half hours to their school day, most would say no. People have different opinions on this topic. I would only agree to add one and a half hours if school started later. As a student, I think exercise is very important, but longer school days would take away from that time. Most high schools end at 3:00 p.m.; if the board adds one and a half hours, schools would end at 4:30 p.m.\n\nThis could be good because students would have more time to learn instead of doing nothing. Some kids are worse off than others; some are homeless, and some don't have parents. This would be a good time to learn and improve their lives. Parents with 9-to-5 jobs wouldn't have to worry about leaving their child alone. They would see improvements in work ethic and discipline. Less homework would be assigned because students would have more class time.\n\nHowever, I disagree because this would hurt not only students but also the local government's economy and taxpayers. If teachers work more hours, they need to be paid more. If the local government pays them more, they'll tax people more. That means higher income tax. Taxpayers would refuse to pay the extra tax that comes with the one-and-a-half-hour change.\n\nThis is why adding one and a half hours would hurt students, the local government's economy, and taxpayers. The board should come up with a plan that works for everyone. There are some good points to this plan, but mostly bad ones. I hope the board members think carefully before making a decision.

I think spring break and the week off in spring and fall should stay the same. It doesn't make sense to change it because students will have days off in winter when it snows.

They expect the government to help them with everything. But it's not good for someone who is capable of working.

Some people disagree with me because they think their kids are too young to think about a career. They worry that their kids will get stressed out thinking about what career to choose. But I believe students should start planning for a career when they start high school.\n\nOne reason is that students can learn about different careers. Many students don't know much about careers, and high school is a good time to learn about them.\n\nAnother reason is that students can focus on one or two careers they like. If they focus on one or two careers, they'll learn more about them.\n\nThe last reason is that when students go to college, it will be easier for them to understand their chosen career. For example, a student who wants to study Criminal Justice can learn the basics in high school.

Trying new things will show us what we're good at and what we're not. Failing isn't the end. We need to learn from it and move on. If we do the same things every day, we'll never know what we can do. We need to go out and try new things. If we fail, we need to try again."}

Yes, you should know what you want to be by the time you get to high school. This is because you will know what classes to take, plan how to start your career, and work hard for it.\n\nTo begin with, knowing what career you want helps you choose the right classes.

I will list some reasons why I agree, and I hope to convince the school board to accept my view.\n\nOne reason is that students who need extra help or don't pay attention in class can use the extra hour to catch up. They can focus during that time and understand what they learned that day. Many students don't like staying after school, but with an extra hour, they won't have to.\n\nAnother reason is that on days when we don't feel like working or have missing assignments, we can make them up during the extra hour. We can also do extra work to improve our grades.\n\nAdding an extra hour will help students learn more and get a better education. When we have tests, quizzes, or final exams, the extra hour will help us do better. More students will pass, and fewer will fail.\n\nThis reason is about the staff.

There are many reasons why I think this is a good idea.\n\nFirst, it would help me and other students in many ways. It would help us get good grades on our tests and homework, which would make us happy and love school more. Our parents would also be happy because they want us to do well. Additionally, we could talk to our friends while we work on our homework, and we could stay after school to discuss our projects if needed.

If you don't use what you've learned to improve yourself, you won't grow.\n\nFirst, if you don't use what you've learned, you won't grow because you need to know what you want in life. For example, a 25-year-old woman thinks she's an adult just because of her age. But her parents think she's wrong because she still lives with them, doesn't pay bills, and doesn't study. This shows that age doesn't mean you're grown up.\n\nSecond, if you don't use what you've learned, you won't grow because you need to know how to take care of yourself. For example, a man has a good job and can afford a house and things, but he doesn't know how to manage his money.\n\nSome people think that growing up is just about getting older.

I don't think it's good for kids to stay home all day and not go outside.\n\nWhen I was little, there weren't many parks in my country. So, I would just go outside and play.

When my mom asks them to go outside, they don't want to. They want to play games on their phones, which is not good for them. My mom always tries to get my brothers to go outside, but they don't listen.\n\nWhen I was little, we didn't have phones, so we would always go outside. We would come home in the evening when it got dark. Now, I barely go outside. I go to school and then stay on my phone.

You can play on the swings, run around, and explore. Staying home all day can make you feel sick, uncomfortable, and lazy. On weekends, when I'm on my phone all day, I feel like the day went by too fast. But when I go outside with my family, I enjoy it. I like being outside, but only if someone is with me.\n\nLast summer, my aunts and mom would go outside and walk to the park. We would enjoy life, but now we mostly stay home.

The more degrees someone has, the more money they'll get.\n\nThe second reason is that people can gain more knowledge. Sometimes, people need help at work because they don't know how to do something.

If we have no one to help us, we can go to this club to finish our homework or practice a subject we're struggling with. This club can help us learn more about the subjects we find hard.\n\nWith this club, students can finish their homework and turn it in complete to their teachers. This is a great activity for all students because they can ask questions or ask how to do something if they don't know how. They can ask the teachers at the club instead of using their phones.\n\nThis club can help students stop spending too much time on their phones. They can go there to read, which will help them be more expressive and smarter instead of using their phones.\n\nSome students look for easy answers on websites instead of asking. This is bad because they'll only know the answer, not how they got it. Or, they use websites to find out how to do something, like a project, or they watch YouTube videos, send messages, or play video games instead of doing their homework.\n\nThis club is better for students and parents. Parents won't have to worry if their kids did their homework, and students won't have to worry about their grades. The club can be in the library or cafeteria, and you can go anytime in the afternoon. They'll offer snacks, and the most important thing is you'll have fun.\n\nI completely agree with this idea of making a club after school.

They might have sports practice or a school play to attend. They also want to spend time with their family. If they stay in school longer, they might come home tired or feel too much stress. This is why the school board should not add 30 minutes to our school days.\n\nBefore making this change, the school board should think about what students do outside of school that is important to them. Many students play sports or participate in school plays. For example, John plays football for his middle school team. If the school day is longer, he will have to stay at practice longer and come home late. Many students might give up because they can't handle too much work in one day.\n\nInstead of staying in school longer, students want to see their friends and family. But if they come home late, they won't have time to see their parents before they go to work or hang out with friends. Students need time to relax and have fun after school. Adding 30 minutes means more homework and less time to relax, which can affect their sleep. Sleep is very important for students. If they don't get enough sleep, they might come to school tired and struggle to focus.\n\nStress is a big problem for students, even at a young age. Stress can cause us to do things we wouldn't normally do. For example, Sarah has a lot on her mind about school. She has a lot of work to finish and is struggling in her reading class. She gets frustrated with herself and has family problems too. Stress can cause many bad things for our minds, even for teenagers. Sometimes she stays up all night to do her school work and doesn't get enough sleep. This causes her to fall asleep in class and get in trouble.\n\nI think the school board should not add 30 minutes to our school days. Less time with family and friends, no relaxation, and less sleep can affect us badly. We shouldn't have to deal with so much stress, and we need more time to have fun outside of school."}

These companies offer a lot to learn about the products they sell.\n\nFirst, big companies teach you about business. For example, Nike shows you how they make shoes and what materials they use. You can learn how to work with them and follow their steps to succeed.\n\nSecond, Walmart is a busy store where many people shop every day. You can learn a lot there because they have many products. The employees learn how to order and arrange products, and help customers find what they need quickly. Even as a cashier, you can learn new things.\n\nOn the other hand, small companies often don't need many employees, so there's less to learn. They may not make many products, so you might not learn much new information.\n\nFinally, no matter what company you work for, you'll always learn something. But it's often a good idea to work with a well-known company because they know what they're doing and are always trying to improve. This means you'll keep learning new things."}

Sitting at home all day doing nothing is bad for us. If we focus too much on technology and don't talk to anyone, it can affect us. I think technology is useful when I need to do my school work. I use my computer for that. But other than that, technology is not good for us. It takes away time we could spend with our families.

On the other hand, working alone is harder and more challenging.\n\nFirst, working in a team is better because it makes you feel more confident and relaxed. For example, in a restaurant, completing a big order is hard to do alone, but it's easy when you work with others. The customers are happy, and you feel relaxed too. When you work in a team, you feel more positive and confident. You can also make friends and hang out with them.\n\nI remember when I traveled alone to the United States for the first time. It was a difficult experience. I didn't know what to do at the airport, and I wasn't good at speaking English. I had to ask for help. After that, I realized that working alone or traveling alone is not easy.\n\nWorking alone is harder because it takes more time to finish a task. When you work in a team, it's faster and easier. I work in a restaurant, and I remember when we were very busy and short-staffed. I had to finish a big catering order alone, and it took an hour. The customer was angry because he had to wait a long time. I was embarrassed and anxious. Then, I realized that working alone is not easy and takes more time.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that working in a team is better. It's more convenient, reliable, and fun.

This means that if we do nothing, we won't get anywhere. We need to take action to achieve something, no matter what it is. Some people think that doing nothing is okay because their family can do everything for them, but they're wrong. We achieve more when we take action because we become successful, and if not, we become lazy.\n\nFirstly, to be successful, we need to work hard to reach our goal. One reason is that when we get more things done, we don't have to worry about what we've done and what we haven't done. For example, to become a doctor, we need to study hard and work hard. As a result, hard work pays off. We need to put effort into achieving things in life. We have to stay on top of things so we can be successful. Another reason is that some people give up easily, saying they've tried and failed. But not everyone is like that; some people get stronger from trying. For example, a 17-year-old girl was looking for a career, but she didn't find anything until she saw a sign that interested her and went for it. As a result, never giving up is the key to achieving a goal. This shows that even when life is tough, it can also bring surprises.\n\nSecondly, doing nothing gets us nowhere and makes us lazy. One reason is that laziness is a big problem. For example, a classmate didn't clean the house before inviting friends over, and it smelled bad. As a result, they got in trouble and were embarrassed. Another reason is that if we do nothing, life becomes complicated and messy. For example, a child grew up with everything given to them and didn't learn to work hard. When they grew up, they couldn't get a job because they had no experience. As a result, the child didn't achieve anything in life. We can end up in the same situation, or we can do something about it by trying new things.\n\nIn conclusion, when we take action to achieve something, it's like taking another step forward. This is important because we'll look back and see how far we've come, and that will boost our confidence. We should all help each other to do better. The more we achieve, the better we'll do in life."}

Many people get tired at school and want to go home. When they hear that school hours might be extended, they get upset, and I would too.\n\nI ask myself, do I want school hours to extend? I would say no. First, I try to make my parents proud, and it's hard. I do it for them because I love them, and it makes me tired. Another reason I disagree is that I get tired easily. It's hard to stay awake for 7 hours and use all my brain energy. I don't want to stay in school for another hour.\n\nSome people think it's okay to have more school hours because it can help them learn more. But they can fall asleep at any moment, and we need time to rest. We also need time to do our homework. If we have too much homework, we need the whole day to do it. It's not fair to add more school hours and make us suffer. We need time to do our homework and get a good night's sleep.\n\nMany students come in late because of after-school activities. Without the extra school hour, students come home earlier. Finally, I don't think we need more school hours because we already have enough time for teachers to teach. If we add more hours, we're just wasting time, not only for students but also for teachers. It's a waste of time to have another hour for nothing. We, as young children, need to rest to have energy.

Technology has given us phones, computers, and other devices. Imagine living in another city or country without knowing how your parents are doing for weeks.\n\nWe care about the people around us and want to know if our family is healthy. Technology makes it easy to communicate and feel close to them, even if we're far away. We can express our feelings like happiness or sadness. We can see them on a screen and tell them how much we love them. This is important because technology helps us stay close to people who are far away.\n\nTechnology also helps people find jobs. Some people have illnesses that prevent them from working in restaurants, stores, or jobs that require physical strength.\n\nNow they can find online jobs. All they need is a phone and the ability to talk. This is not only for people with illnesses but also for anyone who cannot travel to work due to lack of transportation or money.\n\nPeople can even have two jobs, one online and one offline. For example, they can work part-time in a restaurant and also work online. This is important because having a job helps us become independent.\n\nTechnology gave us computers, which we use to learn more and get a better education. Children can play games that help develop their brains, like learning to pronounce words and relaxing their minds. Parents need to control how many hours their children use the internet and what they use it for, as it can cause problems if not balanced. Schools use computers for students, and students use them to create projects or search for information. Teachers can teach students by watching educational videos or searching for information about current events. We can also work from home. This is important because we can study at home without being in school all the time.\n\nSome people may think technology has a negative effect on people's lives, but I believe it has good effects.

Has technology's effect on human contact been good or bad for people?\n\nTechnology has been very helpful to many people over the years. Many people, like students and business leaders, use technology to work or study. Technology has both good and bad effects, depending on how we use it. We can talk to family and friends who are far away. We can also buy things from our phone or computer without leaving home. But there's a problem: if people don't know how to use technology.\n\nTechnology helps us communicate with others, like family or friends. There are many apps we can use to make video calls or send texts. For example, I'm from Generic City, and I moved to Virginia when I was 15. I really missed my grandmother, but I always called her on WhatsApp. It helped me text her and have video chats with her when I wanted to see her. Technology helped me a lot to talk with my family, friends, and buy from my favorite store in Generic City.\n\nTechnology is amazing when you know how to use it. We can find many things on the internet, like apps for shopping or searching for information we need for homework. Even if the store is in Generic City, we can buy clothes from there, and they'll send them to us. It doesn't matter where the store is; we can buy anything we want. Also, when we need to search for information, we can find everything on Google. For example, I had a homework assignment last week. It was a summary of an artist, and I didn't even know who that person was. I took my computer and typed the artist's name in the search bar. Then I found all the information about her. However, I saw many ads on pages that I didn't like.\n\nWhen people use too much technology, they can become addicted. They use the internet to do bad things, and they have a problem. If we don't know how to use it, we can get hurt or hurt someone. There are many cases where people got killed just because of a post. Also, there are people who search for videos they shouldn't see. They get mentally sick. For example, many people got raped because they posted a picture where they looked indecent. People accept friend requests from people they don't know. They have to take care of their profile and not give information about themselves to anyone. They have to be careful what they do with technology.\n\nIn conclusion, technology is a great tool to communicate with people. It's also a way to shop on our phone without going out and wasting gas, but we have to be sure of what we're doing. We have to respect ourselves on the internet because it's really dangerous. We have to make sure what we're doing is correct, so no one gets hurt."}
{"text_id_kaggle": "5D0E66357C33", "output_essay": "Recently, the Generic_School school board is thinking about adding one and a half hours to the school day. They think students need more time to study at school. However, many students and parents do not agree with this idea. Adding more time has many drawbacks instead of benefits.\n\nFor example, students at Generic_School will have less time for school clubs and activities. They might be too tired to study effectively. They will also lose their free time after school. I strongly disagree with extending the school day.\n\nFirstly, students at Generic_School have limited time at school because they need to go home early for safety and privacy reasons. Most of them join clubs or do activities after school. If the school adds more time, they will not have enough time for these activities. Joining clubs and doing sports are good for school life, so students should not quit them. Adding more time could ruin these activities.\n\nAdditionally, adding more time to school may cause students to lose focus in class. Studying for a long time makes students tired. When students are tired, they cannot focus and may not understand their lessons. They may not do their homework or prepare for the next class. This will affect their grades. If this problem continues, studying will be stressful for teenagers.\n\nAnother reason is that extending the school day takes away students' free time. Students only have six hours after school to sleep, which is not a lot of time. After the change, they will only have four hours. This will take away their time for hobbies, family, and relaxation. With four hours, students can only have dinner, do their homework, and prepare for tests. They will not have time for anything else.\n\nIn conclusion, the lack of time for after-school programs, lack of focus in class, and less free time are good reasons to disagree with extending the school day. This change will make school life more stressful and cause many problems. Studying should be enjoyable, not a burden for teenagers."}

When people make decisions, they often disagree with each other.

For example, if you had eye surgery and need to miss school, it's better to stay home and rest. This is a good decision because it's hard to deal with pain.\n\nHowever, people often make bad decisions that can cause problems. This is why it's a good idea to get advice from experts and authorities. For instance, sleeping in and missing a test at school is a bad decision. Many people do this because they stay up late on their phones. This can lead to bad consequences, such as poor attendance, trouble with parents, and failing a grade.\n\nIn conclusion, people should be allowed to make their own decisions, but they should also be careful. Making good decisions is important for a happy life. Bad decisions can cause many problems, such as not getting a job or a place to live.

We should have year-round schools because students will learn more, have more time with teachers to get help, and they won't forget as much.\n\nIn a year-round school, students have more time to focus on each topic, so they won't worry about forgetting what they learned. They also have extra time to learn new things and prepare for the future. Students in year-round schools tend to score higher on standardized tests because they have more time to learn and understand the material. Even students who have trouble remembering things will have enough time to prepare.\n\nMany students forget a lot during the summer break. With a year-round school, students can retain information better. This is why many educators want year-round schools - what's the point of learning if you're just going to forget it? If students forget what they learned, it will be hard for them in the future because everything they learn comes back later in life.\n\nStudents will have more time with teachers to discuss what they need help with and what they're struggling with. This is especially helpful before tests or quizzes. It's also helpful for students who have trouble remembering things. Many students trust their teachers with personal issues, like what's going on in their lives. Having more time with teachers can also help students get to know them better.\n\nSome people don't think year-round schools are a good idea, but they are because of the many benefits.

It also helps people communicate with others without meeting in person.\n\nFirst, technology provides safety for those who don't like to go out. Some people prefer shopping online because they feel safer at home. For example, a college student named Sarah was assaulted in the library many times. She decided to buy her materials online because she feels safer at home. By staying at home, Sarah won't get assaulted again.\n\nSo, technology can provide safety, and it makes online stores a safe place to shop.\n\nSecondly, technology helps people communicate with others who are far away. This is a big advantage for those who are away from their families.\n\nFor example, a Dominican immigrant named Maria has been in the U.S. for 4 years. The only way she can talk to her family is with her cell phone. Maria's cell phone helps her talk to her family without going to her hometown. So, technology plays a good role in people's lives.\n\nSome people may say that technology has a negative effect on people's lives because it makes people too dependent on it.\n\nFor example, a student named John uses his phone to cheat in math class.

This is possible when people work together. For example, a team of builders can build a house quickly if they work together. They can do this because they are working as a team. Additionally, working in a group makes the work easier because people can share information and have time to work on other projects.\n\nSome people may think that working in a group is not the best way, but it allows people to communicate well. For instance, John and Michael are working on a science project, but they cannot work on the same days. When John works on the project, he tells Michael what he did and what he plans to do, so Michael knows what to do. Without this information, they would not know what the other is doing. In a group, people need to communicate their ideas to each other.\n\nIn conclusion, people who work in a group are more creative because they learn how to work with others. Working in a group is the best way to learn because it helps people learn from their partner's experiences.

This is true because when you keep doing something, you can improve yourself, inspire others, and gain experiences that lead to success.\n\nWhen you keep doing something, you get better at it. We see many successful people in different careers, like famous soccer players, actors, musicians, and investors. When we see their achievements, we might think it's easy for them, but we know they worked hard to become excellent. For example, Cristiano Ronaldo, the world's most famous soccer player, didn't start out well, but he loved playing soccer with friends. When he decided to become a soccer player, he practiced for many hours every day. Today, he plays for Juventus, Italy's top soccer team. So, doing something is the way to become better, stronger, and smarter.\n\nWhen we see someone succeed, it makes us want to succeed too. For example, the movie 'The Social Network' is about Mark Zuckerberg, the youngest billionaire who created Facebook. When we watch this movie, we learn about Mark and how Facebook began, which inspires many people to succeed like him. Today, when we use the internet, we see many websites and apps that started because they were inspired by him. So, if you do something, you can inspire others.\n\nExperience is what you get when you do an activity, like playing games, reading a book, or listening to music, which can help you succeed in the future. For example, many famous people have failed in their jobs or careers, but they can start again and make it better. They use their experiences to solve problems or find what they need. Sometimes, we see these people feel hopeless and tired, but they don't give up. Finally, they succeed. So, when you do something, even if you fail, you gain experience that can help you succeed in the future.\n\nSome people think that doing nothing is good because they don't want to join many activities, but it can succeed. However, in real life, if you do nothing, you won't achieve anything except failure.

I don't want an after-school program because it takes time away from me and my family. We only have a few hours together after school.\n\nOne reason we shouldn't have after-school programs is that our days are already busy. We're in school for eight hours, and staying after school adds another hour. That's a long time. Another reason is that we have to wake up early for school, and not everyone gets enough sleep. My last reason is that kids want to spend time with their families and friends, but after-school programs take that time away.\n\nIn conclusion, I think we shouldn't have an after-school program because it takes away our free time. We can't get back the time we lose, so we should be able to spend it with our families and friends. That's why I don't think we should add an after-school program."}

They think that if they choose a career too early, they might disappoint their parents or make a bad decision. They also don't want to feel pressure from society, which can form opinions about them.\n\nSociety and school are important, and each part of life can relate to a career. People care about what others think, so a student might feel embarrassed if they don't choose a good career. Each family member wants respect, and family and society might judge someone's job choice.\n\nIn high school, students make friends and decide what to study. Classes teach them about different careers, and they can try them out. The classes give students confidence, and they use what they learn to choose a career. The goal of high school classes is to help students choose a career. If a student doesn't choose a career, teachers or parents might make fun of them. Each person should be able to choose a career without pressure.\n\nChoosing a career can be hard for students. When someone asks, \"What will you study after high school?\", they need to take classes and check the credits required. But parents think of high school as a step towards what students decide to study. Classes are important, but students should think about their career later, when they know more about life and its expenses. Each company or university wants new employees, and workers who get fired say that universities don't teach people how to be managers, just how to do a job. Some people think that companies need workers who can work hard. A specific career is important for a job.\n\nTeachers should make sure classes are good and explain what students need to know when they choose a career. Parents want a good future, so they don't want to be disappointed. Each student has their own ideas about the future, and society can be cruel. Students in high school work hard every day, so teachers can see their effort and grade it. Students shouldn't be expected to choose a career when they enter high school."}

Making decisions is a part of our daily life. Everyone has their own way of making a good decision. I want to discuss three key points: believing in yourself, making decisions when you're not angry, and not relying on others.\n\nFirst, believing in yourself is crucial when making a decision. It's not easy to make a decision, especially in tough situations. You should believe that your choice is right. Many people don't think before they make a decision, and they don't consider the consequences. Sometimes, it works out, but sometimes it affects their life if they don't think it through. People should think about the consequences before making a decision. I always think twice before doing something.\n\nAnother reason is making decisions when you're not angry. People often make bad decisions when they're angry. So, I think people should make their own decisions when they're calm. If you don't feel good about a choice, don't do it. There's always a right time. It can also affect the people around you. Many people have had a hard time because they're not patient. It's good if we help someone think clearly in a situation. Some people have learned to be patient and trust themselves.\n\nLastly, I want to talk about not relying on others. Making your own choice makes you feel good, no matter what happens. You make your own decision, and it gives you peace of mind. Many people rely on others or wait for someone to tell them what to do. I think that's not the best way. You should believe in yourself and not rely on others. Many experiences have shown that relying on others can end badly. People will learn from their experiences and think more clearly in each situation.\n\nIn conclusion, people make decisions every day. Some are good, and some are not. People should think before making a decision and make sure everything will be alright. We all make mistakes, but we learn from them."}

The teacher counts the votes and decides what to do. If it's a tie, the teacher asks students who don't want a club why they don't want one.\n\nAfter-school clubs are good for students because they can study, do homework, or play games there. One reason is that if you make a mistake, the teacher or volunteers can help you. They can explain what to do, so you can do it right next time. Another reason is that you can study for tests or quizzes, which gives you time to do other things when you get home.\n\nHaving an after-school club can also improve your grades, which can help you achieve your dreams. Some workplaces look at your school grades when hiring. If you want to be a doctor, teacher, or singer, you need good grades. Studying is the best way to get good grades and do what you want.\n\nYou can also make new friends at the club. You can talk to them, help them with things they don't know, and play games together. You can even help students who don't have friends.

For example, my little brothers used to ask me for help with their homework, and I would help them. But since we started using technology, they don't ask me for help anymore. It's like technology has replaced me.\n\nSecond, technology has taken away time with family and friends. It has also changed people's minds, making them want to be alone all day. For example, my brothers spend all day in their room playing games on their phones. They don't pay attention to what's happening to their friends and family. In many homes, technology has taken away the connection between family members. It has also taken away the strong bond between friends because they don't communicate anymore.\n\nIn addition, technology has made people lazy. They don't have to go to the library or go shopping to interact with others. Technology has also taken away people's ability to exercise.\n\nTechnology has also made people selfish because they spend all day talking to their phones and playing games. They don't know how to start a conversation anymore. They don't even ask for help when they're in trouble.\n\nTechnology has taken away people's ability to notice when their families and friends are in trouble. They can't help them because they're not paying attention.\n\nFinally, the lack of human contact due to technology has had a bad impact on people's lives. It has changed the way people think, taken away time with family and friends, and made people lazy and selfish. Although many people think technology is helpful, it's not. It's taking away the special time people used to have with their family and friends. So, I'm asking technology experts to find a way for people to use technology without being selfish to their family members and friends."}
{"text_id_kaggle": "2EA04AF8AF20", "output_essay": "I believe that doing something is better than doing nothing. When we do something, it keeps us active, helps us stay positive, and lets us help others.\n\nFirst, our bodies stay healthy when we move around and do things. Our muscles work and stretch, even when we don't notice. For example, when we drop something, we have to bend down and pick it up, which exercises our legs. If we don't move around, we can become lazy and idle.\n\nSecond, when we're active, our brains stay busy and focused. This helps us forget about problems that can hurt us. For instance, someone might want to run away from their problems, but if they have to go to work, they'll focus on their tasks instead. This helps them stop thinking about running away. We need to face our problems and find ways to stay safe.\n\nThird, doing things also helps others. We can support people when they need it. We need to be helpful, show we care, and want to assist. When we help, people thank us, and that feels good. It shows we like to do things and make a difference.\n\nOverall, I think Thomas Jefferson meant for us to think about this and do something. It's great when we're active, and being idle is boring. We need to change that and try to do more."}

They have many things to do outside. You can go down the slides, swing on the swings, or take a nap. Parks also host events like fundraisers, fairs, birthday parties, and picnics with family and friends.\n\nI also enjoy fishing. Fishing doesn't require skill, but it does need patience. When you put your bait in the water, you won't catch a fish right away. There might not even be fish in the water. If you don't like boats or get seasick, you can fish at a dock. Docks are where boats park, but there usually aren't many fish because the boats scare them away. Fishing is another fun outdoor activity.\n\nHaving a cookout or party is also fun. Summer parties are great because you can play games or have a sports competition. When we have a party or cookout, I love playing soccer with friends and taking a walk around town. I also like the smell of food and meat cooking on the grill, which makes me want to eat it."}

Experts were once like us, and we can learn what they know. If we try hard, we can even become experts ourselves. For example, when I got my driver's license, I thought people who could drive were experts. But after I learned to drive, it wasn't a big deal anymore. If you learn something well, you can find more details than others and prove your skills.\n\nSome people like to lie and pretend to be experts. But if you can do things yourself, you can figure out what's true or false. For example, if you get hurt, you need to make sure you're treating yourself correctly. You can find the right solution online or go to the hospital. If you know how to treat yourself, you don't need to ask experts for help, and you can stop fake experts from lying.\n\nSometimes, you should try things yourself, even if you fail. You can learn from your mistakes and do better next time. For example, I like to sing, and I taught myself how to do it over two years. It wasn't easy, but I didn't give up, and now I'm a good singer. I don't sing to make money, but it makes me happy. Doing things yourself is better than getting help from others.\n\nSome people think we should ask experts for help with important decisions, but we can't always get help. We need to be able to solve our own problems, even if we make mistakes. We can try again and do better next time."}

Your knowledge should never stop growing.\n\nIf we keep learning, we can be more than a master. If you're a master of something, you might be the most intelligent person in that field. But if you keep studying, you can learn even more.\n\nMy conclusion is, don't stop learning just because you think you know everything about your job.

If you want something, you need to go for it. For example, if you want to lose weight, become a professional athlete, or pass a hard test, you need to take the necessary steps.\n\nIf you're lazy and don't want to do anything, you'll likely fail. For instance, if you have a big test coming up and you don't study, you'll probably fail. But if you study hard, you'll likely pass. If you don't do anything to achieve your goals, you won't get any results.\n\nTake losing weight, for example. You need to exercise. Sure, you could get surgery, but that's expensive and has its own problems. It's better to exercise, which is good for your health and makes you feel proud of yourself. You'll feel like you earned your weight loss.\n\nIf you want to be a professional athlete, you need to train, stay healthy, eat well, and be ambitious. You won't get anywhere if you just sit around wishing you were a pro athlete. Life doesn't work that way. Doing nothing gets you nowhere. You can't expect results if you don't do anything.\n\nIn conclusion, I think you won't achieve anything if you don't do anything. Whatever your goal is, you need to take the necessary steps.

For example, my mom's and dad's families live in Generic City, which is far away. Without technology, it would be hard to talk to them. My parents use WhatsApp and Messenger to talk to their families. If we didn't have technology, it would take a long time to reach them.

We can even buy things without going to the store. This is why technology is good for us. Some people think technology is bad because we don't see each other in person. But they should think about all the good things technology does for us. Without technology, we wouldn't have online school, and some people need that to learn.\n\nTechnology is also a great way to meet new people. Instagram and Snapchat exist because of technology. These apps are good for people who are shy or quiet. For example, I met my best friend on Snapchat, and we became close by talking every day. I met other friends on Instagram. I've met many people through Instagram. Without technology, I wouldn't have met people from other countries or even from my own state.\n\nIn conclusion, technology lets us do things without seeing each other.

Math helps you with everyday tasks like being a cashier or understanding interest rates when buying a car. You use Math everywhere. English is also crucial because you need to speak English to succeed in America. My aunt moved to America from Africa, where they didn't teach English. She struggled to find a job because she didn't know English. Every country should teach good English grammar. When I was in 3rd grade, my school had a short day, and we didn't have time for PE or recess. This led to stress. Later, I tried to buy a car, but I couldn't because I didn't understand percentages.

For instance, I sometimes struggle to push myself to do something. Others are afraid of failing, which stops them from trying to improve.\n\nDespite what others say, I think challenging oneself is better. It makes you determined to do something. I believe everyone should challenge themselves like I do. When I first came to America four years ago, everything was new to me. I'm not a great learner, but I still try to learn new things. When you challenge yourself, you'll feel proud of yourself if you achieve something on your own.\n\nChallenging yourself also makes you more confident. You'll feel more confident because you've accomplished something. For example, President Trump is confident in his actions. Even though many Americans didn't support him, he didn't care what they thought. He built a wall to protect America.

They can stay after school to get help from their teacher. Teachers can volunteer to stay after school and help their students with their subjects or homework. When students stay after school, they learn more because the teacher explains slowly, so they can understand. They are more likely to pass their tests and SOLs. However, the homework club shouldn't just be for doing work. We should make it a little fun and have activities, like playing games or using computers, for half an hour or an hour. This way, more students will want to stay and get extra help, and it won't be boring. Students can stay after school if they need help and show improvement in their subjects. They learn more, and when they get older, it will help them get a good job. To get a good job, they need to go to college and get a diploma in what they want to be. It's good to learn more when you're young. The homework club can help you with your subjects and what you don't understand.

You can also do your homework at home if you prefer. Teachers think it's a good idea to have an extra hour to teach, but students and teachers can get tired. Many students fail their classes because they don't finish their homework. That's why it's a good idea to stay after school with teachers and friends to finish homework and get good grades. Students can also finish their homework at home if their parents check their backpack for assignments. What would you do if your school added an extra hour?"}

I strongly disagree with this idea because it will take away time from family and make school exhausting.\n\nFirst, students will have less time with their families. With a longer school day, they will see their mom, dad, brother, and sister less often. This can make them sick and unhappy. It can even cause problems at home because students are too busy with school.\n\nNext, school will get very tiring. Adding one and a half hours to the day means longer classes.

{"text_id_kaggle": "744C96D9BE0B", "output_essay": "Active or Inactive?\n\nAs individuals or as a community, we have a choice: to do something or do nothing. If we're always active and doing things, we're more likely to achieve our goals. Some people think that taking breaks and doing nothing sometimes is okay and can reduce stress. I believe that if we set a goal, we need to take action to achieve it.\n\nThe first reason being active helps us achieve more is that when we set a goal, we try to reach it and find ways to make it happen. Once we set a goal, we just need to figure out how to achieve it. For example, if we want to become the President of the United States, we'll work hard to get into college, study, and be productive. Or if someone wants to lose weight, they'll do some activity to reach their goal. Everyone has a goal or purpose in life, and by doing small things, we can achieve a lot.\n\nAnother reason being active helps is that it can improve our mental and physical health. For example, if someone is struggling with negative thoughts, doing something active can help take their mind off those thoughts. Being active can also improve our physical appearance. Even small tasks like walking can make a difference. It's not about doing huge tasks, but about feeling good about what we've accomplished.\n\nLastly, as people living in this country, we know that nothing is free, and we have to work hard to achieve our goals. Everyone has to put in effort to get things done. If we have to go to school, work, or pay bills, we have to take action because no one else will do it for us. People who do nothing most likely won't get far in life and will only build up tasks that won't go away. I believe everyone should be active, even if it's just a small task.\n\nFurthermore, being active helps us achieve something, even if it's a small task. Life is full of challenges, but we have to overcome them. We can take breaks when we're not feeling well or stressed, but most of the time, we should try to be active. Life is about doing something all the time and not just sitting around expecting everything to be done for us. We all face tough times, but that's just another problem we have to face. If we're active, we can achieve our goals and feel proud of ourselves."}

If you look around my neighborhood, you won't see anyone outside. In my opinion, staying indoors isn't a big problem for most people. However, spending time outdoors can be more exciting and beneficial for teens. There are many activities to do, and it's a lot of fun.\n\nTrying new things can be really fun, and you might discover you're good at it. For example, you can try new sports or practice outdoors if you already play a sport. Community parks are great because they're often close by. You can work out and take care of yourself there too.\n\nState parks are very popular among teens. They have carnivals where you can hang out with friends and family. Carnivals usually happen during spring break, so instead of staying home bored, you can have a great time. Waterparks are also fun, especially in the summer. There are many state parks where you can have a good time, like Kid's Choice or any outdoor place.\n\nNational Parks can be even more exciting, but they can be expensive for some people. One of my favorite national parks is Disney World. You can have a great time at Disney World. There are many options, like going on rides, visiting the zoo, or shopping. You can spend time with friends and family, and even have a meal together. Sometimes, having a great time with your family can make you happy and change your mood.\n\nGoing out isn't just about leaving your house. It can also affect how you live your life. It's about how much fun you want to have and what activities you can do. It can also affect your health and mental well-being. Sometimes, you need to find something you like to do, so you don't just stay at home and have more fun outdoors at parks.

When many smart people work together towards a single goal, they bring different ideas to the table. If someone makes a mistake, their teammates can help fix it. When you work alone, you don't have anyone to check your work for errors. Working in a group can also help you finish a job or project faster. Most of the time, a group of people can do a better job than one person.\n\nHowever, working in a group can be challenging. People have different ways of thinking and working, and it can be hard to adjust to a new way of doing things. But with the right teammates, a group can do a great job. In universities, many projects are done in groups, and some of these projects can become famous and helpful to the world.\n\nGood communication is key when working in a group. Everyone should share their ideas, and the group can pick the best ones. Having patience is also important, especially when working with someone who disagrees with you. Most problems arise from disagreements, which is why communication is crucial. Groups with good communication and patience always do great work.\n\nFrom my personal experience, working in a group has helped me develop my teamwork skills. I've learned to appreciate others' ideas and ways of working. Working in a group is like playing soccer - everyone has a role to play, and the team leader decides who does what.\n\nWorking alone is different and easier because you're in charge. You can have any idea you want, and you won't have anyone disagreeing with you. However, working alone requires hard work and careful planning. You'll have to do everything step by step, and it may take longer to finish. Many famous creations were made by people who worked alone and did a great job.\n\nWorking in a group is easier and has many benefits. It helps you finish a job faster and with good results because many people work together to achieve a common goal. Having everyone agree on something can be difficult, but with patience and good communication, great results are possible. Most of the time, working in a group is like being in a relationship - you need communication, patience, and a willingness to listen and try different approaches."}
{"text_id_kaggle": "5BD60D0345BE", "output_essay": "Where does self-esteem come from? Does it come from praise or from what we achieve? I think self-esteem should come from what we achieve. Some people believe that praising a student's work, even if it's not their best, will make them feel more confident. But I don't agree. Students shouldn't be praised for doing something wrong just to make them feel good about themselves. This won't help them grow.\n\nIf a student is praised for doing something wrong, they won't learn from their mistakes. Self-esteem should come from working hard and doing a good job. For example, my nine-year-old cousin was always confident because her parents praised her work. But when she showed her teacher her work, the teacher told her it was wrong. My cousin felt embarrassed and her self-esteem went down. If her parents had told her the truth, she could have improved before showing her teacher.\n\nWhen students achieve something, it not only makes them feel good about themselves but also shows them what they can do. If a student's self-esteem comes from someone praising their bad work, they'll never know if they can do better. My parents always tell me to try harder because they know I can do better. This makes me feel more confident because I know I can improve. If they praised me for doing something wrong, I wouldn't have the confidence I have now.\n\nWhen students know they can do more, it makes them want to keep learning. If a student gets something right, they feel more confident and want to learn more. But if a teacher praises them for doing something wrong, they'll never learn.\n\nI wouldn't want to be praised for doing something wrong because it wouldn't help me. I wouldn't want to keep making the same mistake in class.\n\nA student's self-esteem should come from what they achieve, not from people praising their bad work. Students who build their self-esteem from their achievements will improve, know what they can do, and be more confident in learning.

It also helps them discover new things, prepare, and not waste time in high school.

{"text_id_kaggle": "0FA0B0078686", "output_essay": "Is it better to work in a group or alone? Because:\n\nWorking in a group is easier because each student has a different opinion and perspective on the topic. This makes the group more efficient. The response is also better when the teacher grades it.\n\nFor example, a history teacher gives a project to the class. The project is to research the seven wonders of the world. The teacher divides the class into groups of seven students. One student decides to work alone, and the teacher agrees. The group of seven students divides the work among themselves. Each student picks one of the seven wonders and researches it. They then make a PowerPoint and present it in class.\n\nIt takes less time to finish the project because the work is divided among the group members.\n\nFor example, using the same project, the student who works alone takes more time than the group. This is because he has to do all the work himself and can't share the workload.\n\nIt's also easier for the teacher to grade. The teacher spends less time grading group projects than individual projects. This gives the teacher more time to teach other topics.\n\nIn conclusion, it's better to work in a group because students share ideas, are more creative, and it's easier for the teacher to grade."}

Some people are also missing out on important things like eating, job interviews, exams, and school. Furthermore, they're becoming overweight. Technology can also damage your personality, so be careful what you post online.\n\nIn today's world, most people don't talk in person because of technology. They're no longer reading newspapers, books, and many stores are closing because people are buying things online. Technology is also causing people to not pay attention to what's going on around them. For instance, I was texting and driving, got pulled over, and got a ticket. The judge told me not to let technology control my brain or I'd always be in trouble. I'm writing about this to learn from my mistake and pay attention to the world around me.\n\nIn addition to my experience, many stores are closing. Technology is also causing people to miss meals, which can lead to health problems. It can also drive people crazy, like my friend who got into a fight because of a video game.

This can make everyone in the group angry. For example, in my math class, we were allowed to work in groups. But some of my friends just talked and didn't do any work. When I finished, they asked me for the answers. I got angry, and this can happen in any group.\n\nSecond, when you work alone, you can do things your way.

For example, you can take care of others, like your family and friends, because they trust you. You can also pay attention in school and not joke around. It feels great when people trust you.

For example, if you want to become a professional soccer player, your coach can't just show you what to do; they need to teach you and prove to you that you can do it. It's like studying for a test; if you don't study, you won't pass.\n\nIf I were an influencer, I would say that the most important thing is to believe in yourself. If you don't believe in yourself, you won't get very far in life. You'll always have negative thoughts and feelings.

When you make a decision and it doesn't work out, you have to take responsibility for it. For example, if you studied for a test and someone else tells you your answer is wrong, but you know you're right, you have to trust yourself. You're in charge of your life, so don't let others control it.\n\nConfidence is another reason. People who don't make their own decisions often don't trust themselves. But when you make your own decisions, you have more confidence, feel more relaxed, and have more ideas. People who ask for help can't do amazing things, but people who make their own decisions can because they trust themselves. When you feel confident, you gain experience and learn from your mistakes. Making your own decisions makes you feel more confident.\n\nFinally, being yourself is one of the most beautiful things in life. Many people hide their true identity. Sometimes people do things they don't want to do because they're following someone else's advice. When you make your own decisions, you stay true to yourself, which helps your self-esteem and happiness. With high self-esteem, you can make good choices on your own. You don't need experts to help you because you can help yourself. Some people are scared to be themselves because they're afraid of failure. But if you fail, try again. That's the best way to learn and grow. People who don't take risks don't know how to get back up.\n\nIn conclusion, people should make their own decisions. When you make your own decisions, you take responsibility, build confidence, and stay true to yourself. For these three reasons, people should make their own decisions."}
{"text_id_kaggle": "AE96820CDAA2", "output_essay": "Can we get more things done by working on them all the time? Working on a goal takes time. I know that achieving a goal is one of the best things we can do for ourselves. However, working on a goal every day is not the best idea. We need time for ourselves to rest and recharge our minds. If we don't, stress will come into our lives.\n\nFirstly, to be successful, we need a routine that includes productive things and time for ourselves. We need time to relax and enjoy life. I remember when my parents were too busy to take a day off and spend time with me during the school year. They were always working or studying. We didn't have time to talk and have fun together. We needed a break, and when we got one, we were happy and refreshed. Having a break helps us restart our minds.\n\nSecondly, humans can achieve great things, but we need time. In middle school, my teacher gave us time to relax in class. She said that taking a break gives us energy and helps us focus. This helped me concentrate on my schoolwork. My friends and I needed time to interact with others and clear our minds from worries.\n\nWe need time not only for activities and responsibilities but also for rest. When I meet new people, it makes me feel important. We need time to stop worrying about work and recharge our minds to be successful.\n\nFinally, too much stress can lead to depression. It's hard to imagine how hard life can be. If we focus too much on work and not enough on fun, it can have negative effects. Some people might give up on their goals because they don't have time for themselves. For example, my brother went to college and had to work to pay for it. He was exhausted, stressed, and quiet. He felt he couldn't finish college, so he quit. He could have reached his goal, but too much stress led him to depression. Breaks are important in our lives.\n\nSome people think that the more you work, the more you can get done. But taking breaks is important. It gives you time to recharge your mind, relax, and reduce stress. Life is short; don't let work lead you to depression. Take a break and start again."}

It has helped people become smarter and live safer lives. Without technology, life would be very hard. We use technology for many things, not just school or work. We use it to talk to others and find information.\n\nMost people use technology in good ways. We use it in school to research and write papers. Some people use technology for work, especially in offices. Technology can be very helpful. For example, if I need to write about someone, I can search for their name and find a lot of information. But sometimes, there's too much information, and it's hard to find what I need.\n\nTechnology can also affect people's lives in bad ways. We might not know how to use it correctly or set limits for ourselves. Sometimes, we make mistakes. For example, high school students might not use their phones correctly in class. Phones can be a distraction.\n\nTechnology can also have negative effects. Phones and other devices can distract people from their work. If someone is trying to finish a job on time but can't because their phone is bothering them, that's not good.\n\nIn conclusion, I think technology can be bad for some people and cause problems. But if people can control their use of technology, that's good. As long as they don't get distracted, technology can be helpful."}

I think having a great imagination is better than just knowing a lot of things. I have three reasons why I think imagination is more important.\n\nFirst, imagination helps our minds grow. Knowledge helps too, but imagination is more effective. Without it, our brains would be full of words and numbers. We would only think about facts and figures. With imagination, our minds can explore new things and think about things we never thought about before.\n\nSecond, imagination gives us more personality. Without it, we would be boring and lack feelings. With imagination, we can express ourselves better. We can feel however we want and are not stuck with one feeling.\n\nThird, imagination helps us be more creative. Creativity is important for growing our minds. Imagination helps us think creatively and feel creative. If we didn't have creativity, many things we use today, like phones and the internet, wouldn't exist.\n\nIn conclusion, I think imagination is more important because it helps our minds grow, gives us more personality, and helps us be more creative. This is just my opinion, and it's okay if you think knowledge is more important. I can understand why someone would think that. But if someone asked me, I would say imagination is more important."}

They admit they don't know everything and need help. This doesn't mean they're dependent on others.\n\nIn conclusion, there are two types of people who seek guidance from experts and authorities. We can learn from others who are more mature, like adults. This is how we become emotionally developed and start making our own decisions. It's not wrong to seek guidance to make better decisions.

When we only use technology, we don't know if it will have bad consequences, and we can become addicted to it. However, not everyone agrees with this; some people think technology is a good way to find information or spend time.\n\nFirstly, technology has both good and bad things; it depends on how we use it. When we open a webpage, we are responsible for what we see. We can also meet strangers who want to do bad things. We don't know if we can trust them or if we'll be their victim. It's not a good idea to spend too much time using technology; we need to spend time with our family, take breaks, do other things with friends, visit new places, and learn about real life.\n\nAfter that, technology can help us with projects, find information, and ask for help from others. But when we use technology too much, we forget about other things that can help us become better people. For example, in the past, people used books to find information and wrote letters to communicate. Today, we mostly use technology to communicate and do almost everything.\n\nSome people have different opinions about technology. They think it's a good way to meet new people, read books, shop, or work online. Children use technology to play games, watch videos, and do other things.

For example, I want to learn how to fix cars. When you know how to do something, you can start working and get what you want. At 18, you can buy a car and have the things you want.

{"text_id_kaggle": "2488814B8440", "output_essay": "Everyone has different goals in life. Students work hard to achieve their goals and don't give up when they face obstacles. Why is this important? Because they want to make their parents proud, or maybe they want to escape poverty and become wealthy. If you don't have a goal or are lazy, you will struggle in life. You might have to work hard when you're old because you didn't save enough money to pay your bills.\n\nFirst, you need to know what your goals are and write them down. It's important to know how long it will take to achieve them and when you can start. Ask yourself, and let's do it now. If you fail four or five times, don't get angry because you will learn from your mistakes. Stay focused and try again. If you're going the wrong way, ask your parents for help; they are the best teachers who can guide you. If you're lazy, you won't know what you want, and your life will be stagnant.\n\nDoing something means you're taking action. Exercise is good for everyone; if you don't exercise, you'll just sit around and watch TV all day. After a year, you'll gain weight, and your heart will be weak. You'll go to the doctor, and they'll tell you to eat healthy and exercise daily. You know that's not good for you, but you're still lazy and enjoy doing nothing. You need to change your mind and do something for yourself.\n\nWe need to keep doing something because when you learn new things, your brain grows. If you haven't done math or therapy in a long time, your brain will be slow when you start again. If you love science, you can discover something new; maybe you can create something on your own. Like Newton, who discovered gravity when an apple fell on his head. Don't be afraid to think you can't do it; just believe in yourself. If you don't try, you won't know what you're capable of.\n\nSomeday, if you don't know what to do, read some books because they can help you think about life better and give you great ideas. Someone says, 'You should read books every day; if you don't, you'll go the wrong way.' I saw pictures of Bill Gates always holding a book. Books are your best friends and show you where you are. If you want to be a surgeon, read books about surgeons or search online. If you don't understand, ask your teacher. Someday you'll become a doctor, and good luck will follow you.\n\nWhen you achieve your goals, not only will you be happy, but your parents, sister, and friends will be happy too. Don't be afraid to make mistakes; just be afraid of not trying. Life is exciting and gives you many choices. If you never give up, you'll become a good person.

At first, I didn't pay attention, but then I realized that they do and say what I do.

We can divide the work and get more ideas than one person could. However, it also has some problems. If one person doesn't do their work, the whole group's work is incomplete. A group is like a building with pillars - if one pillar falls, the building falls down. So, it's important to choose the right team members. If we choose the wrong partners, we can waste time and get distracted.\n\nThere are many stories, movies, and books that show working in a group is helpful. Some people like to do things alone, but there are limits to what we can do alone. We may need help one day, and working in a group can provide that help. This doesn't mean that working alone is bad. Some students prefer to work alone because they can focus better without distractions.\n\nIn conclusion, working in a group is better than working alone because it helps us gain experience, communicate better, and build friendships. These are important skills to have when working with others, whether it's with new friends or old ones."}

When we're doing something, we can get a lot done.\n\nFirst, when we're busy, we have less free time. For example, when we get home from school, we often do nothing. But we could be doing homework or studying. If everyone did something every day, I think there would be fewer problems in the world.\n\nNext, I think it's better to be active than to do nothing. Doing something can change your life or someone else's life. Having things to do also helps you prepare for the future. If you're not doing anything, you're wasting your time. You could be helping someone or yourself instead.\n\nSome people might say, 'Doing nothing is better than doing something.' But I don't think that's true. How can doing nothing be better? Some people might say that doing nothing has its purpose, but I think being active is much better. Most people are not active, and that's sad. This is why I think people should be more active.\n\nThis is my response to Thomas Jefferson's words. I think he was right. You can accomplish a lot when you're doing something rather than doing nothing."}

At 15 or 16, they'll start looking for a job, which means they'll get busier with daily activities. It's essential to think about our career goals early on. Some students plan to attend college, while others don't think about it and just start working after graduation.\n\nThinking about careers at a young age can be tough. After graduating or leaving college, you might not like your chosen career or it might not turn out as expected. You might need to change careers and find a better fit. You also need to think about how to manage your money. At a young age, you're focused on part-time jobs, school, spending money, and socializing with friends. As a result, many students don't focus on their career goals.\n\nKnowing your career path early on can be a double-edged sword. You might focus all your effort and money, only to find out you don't enjoy it. You can explore many careers, but not all of them might be right for you. Many students today think about dropping out of school or giving up on their career because it's too stressful or they don't like studying.\n\nA lot of students struggle in school and give up on their education and career. Half of them don't graduate and end up in low-skilled jobs with no career prospects. The other half who take their education seriously do well in their careers and might even advance further.\n\nIn my opinion, thinking about your career too early can be bad because it puts too much pressure on yourself. It's better to explore different options - sports, cooking, technology, and more - to find your career path and end up with a good job."}

Meanwhile, the students working in groups finished quickly.\n\nTeachers should make students work in groups because it helps them share ideas. Some students prefer to work alone because they think groups can be distracting. I understand that, but the point is that in a group, you can gather information and come to one conclusion. It's common for groups to have side conversations, but that's why we have administrators to monitor the class and fix problems. I believe students should work in groups because together, they can come up with a big topic with many ideas. It's also a better way to learn because studies show that high school students are more open when talking with their peers. Students work together and learn from each other."}

I thought about what I could do there, and here's what I want to do. I want to learn Japanese, meet a famous soccer player, watch a game, try sushi, and watch anime. For all these reasons, I want to visit Japan.\n\nThe first reason I want to visit Japan is to learn Japanese. I want to learn Japanese so I can communicate with people. I'll learn from a translator, and then I'll teach my family. When they learn from me, we can spend time together. After they learn, we can travel to Japan for a vacation, and it will be easy because they'll know Japanese.\n\nThe second reason I want to visit Japan is to see the city from a high place. When you're on the ground, you can only see buildings and colors. At night, there are sometimes fireworks, and the sky looks nice. I'll see anime things around the city because that's where anime comes from. I heard there's a Goku statue, and I want to see it.\n\nThe third reason I want to visit Japan is to visit a soccer team and ask if I can train with them. I want to know how it feels to train with professionals. After I train, I'll watch their next game and get their autographs.\n\nThe final reason I want to visit Japan is to try sushi because I've always wanted to try it. I want to try it where it comes from because they know how to make it right. In the US, they might make it wrong or add something that makes it taste bad. If you get sick, you might not like it.\n\nIn conclusion, trying sushi, playing and watching soccer, learning Japanese, and watching the city and anime are all great things to do in Japan. Now you know why I chose Japan; I can enjoy it more than any other place I visit. I hope I can convince some people to visit Japan, and if they like the same things, we can hang out there."}

I agree with him; I think that by setting a good example, you can inspire and change someone else.\n\nWhen you set a good example, you can inspire young people to change. Some people pay more attention to what you do than what you say. Broken promises are common, but actions stay with people. For instance, a hypocrite is someone who says one thing but does another. This shows that actions are more important than words.\n\nBy setting a good example, you can also change people's behavior. When people are around others who behave badly, they often start to behave badly too. On the other hand, if you grow up around people with good behavior, you are likely to become a respectful person. It's not what people say that matters, but what they do.\n\nMany people are more influenced by actions than words. Sometimes, when people are told not to do something, they do it anyway. Giving good advice doesn't always work. That's why I think actions are stronger than words.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that setting a good example is a great way to inspire others.

For example, most students don't attend summer school every year. Maybe some of them take a few classes, but not all of them, because they don't care about school. My reason is that summer vacation is too long, and I think it should be three weeks. This way, when we go back to school, we can remember what we learned before summer vacation.\n\nWhen we get fall break, we have too many breaks in the fall.

I felt very lonely because I didn't have friends, and my parents were always working. All I could do was sit on the couch alone, and it was sad. Then I started going to school, and it was hard to talk to people. This experience made me work hard to learn English. I also tried to get a job, and I told my mom, 'I'm going to apply to these restaurants.' My mom said not to work there because the employees get fired easily. I told her it was because they didn't follow the rules. I said, 'I get paid well, and my job is not that hard.' Two years ago, I was afraid to take a trip to Generic City, but it was the best decision I made. I tried new foods, drinks, and hobbies, and it was fun. I really enjoyed that month. It was the best. Since I tried new things, my life has changed.\n\nI agree with Ralph Waldo Emerson that if you don't try new things, you'll never know if they'll work for you. You might find something you love and want to do it for the rest of your life. You should always be positive and try new things. You won't lose anything by trying. Every new thing has its risks.\n\nTrying new things is very emotional because it helps you grow as a person. I enjoy trying new things, and it has changed my life. I've learned from my mistakes and try not to make them again. For example, if you try something new and think it won't work, you might miss a great opportunity. You can't just try something once and give up.\n\nSome people think trying new things is a waste of time, but they're wrong. If you don't try new things, you'll never know what you might miss.

{"text_id_kaggle": "2D328F280E25", "output_essay": "Technology allows people to do many things without interacting with others. Every day, technology is getting better, and some people like that. However, many things have changed since technology existed, and it keeps surprising people with what it can do.\n\nToday, many people think technology is a good way to buy things without leaving their homes. For example, it's easy to buy what we need, and it only takes a few minutes. Also, buying things on our phones reduces the amount of gas we use in our cars. Technology also helps people with disabilities who can't hear, talk, or are sick, and it helps busy people who don't have time to go out to stores. Most importantly, technology makes it easy to buy what we need.\n\nFirstly, many people like how technology has improved because we can buy things quickly and easily from home. Instead of going out, we can use our phones to buy what we need. Sometimes, people who work get tired and don't want to talk to anyone. So, for people who work, it's comfortable to stay in bed, buy things, read, and play at home. For example, when my parents work, they try to sleep and relax, and they don't like it when my brother and I bother them. They try to find a day off to buy what we need because they come home tired and prefer to be quiet.\n\nSecondly, some people like how technology has become because it helps people who are sick or have disabilities. They can't talk or hear, and they don't have a way to move around. It's easy to shop on the phone, but some people don't have access to a car. Sometimes, they need to pay someone to help them, and that can be expensive. With technology, they can do everything without moving or interacting with others. For example, when I first came to the United States, I didn't know how to speak English, and my dad didn't have a car. It was difficult to go out, but when my dad finally bought a car, and I learned English, it became easier to go to stores.\n\nEven though some people think technology has had a positive effect on people's lives, others think it has had a negative effect. In the past, people only bought things at stores, and it was a special time to share and talk with family. But today, things have changed. Instead of going to the store or playing outside with friends, kids only want to stay inside and play with their iPads. Today, people start buying what they need on their phones, and some people, especially kids, don't go out anymore. Technology is changing the world, and it's winning because we're letting it happen.\n\nIn conclusion, the limitation of human contact due to technology should have a positive effect on people's lives because people can stay at home and buy things at the same time. It's easy to do things from home, and sometimes people are in a bad mood, and it's better to be at home without bothering others."}

When students compete, they work harder to achieve their dreams and prove themselves. This makes them successful.\n\nSecondly, the program helps students learn from each other. For example, if I work with someone three years older than me on an assignment, we can complete it easily. We come from different backgrounds and have different ways of doing things. This helps us learn from each other and understand each other better.\n\nLastly, the program helps students achieve their goals if they work together. As the saying goes, 'Two heads are better than one.' If one person can carry twenty books, two people can carry all fifty books or more. Students have goals and dreams they want to achieve. If they work together, they can help each other reach their goals.\n\nIn conclusion, both older and younger students benefit from this program.

Giving up won't help you achieve your goals.\n\nNext, schools should offer classes for the students' career choice. These choices can range from high-paying jobs to low-paying jobs. For example, being a doctor is a high-paying job, so schools should have the resources and classes to become a doctor. Schools should also give students a chance to win scholarship money for college. This can help pay for college and pursue their career after high school.\n\nHowever, students might want to change their career choice after starting classes. Some schools might not have the classes or resources for certain careers. For instance, some schools don't have enough resources or classes to become a professor. Sometimes they don't even have enough teachers to teach the class. These are some of the downsides to having students pick their classes by the time they enter high school.\n\nAfter trying out your career choice for a year, you can change it. Some schools might not have the classes, but you can transfer to schools that do.

Learning new things helps build self-esteem because you're willing to try new things and do them correctly.

When you're not doing anything, you tend to be lazy and don't get things done. Always stay active in life, and if you're not, you won't achieve anything.\n\nThomas Jefferson once said, \"Never be idle... You can do a lot if you're always working.\" I agree with him; if you're lazy and stubborn, you won't get far in life. Not doing anything stops people from achieving their goals. In life, people set goals, and you have to push yourself to achieve them. Many people today put off tasks because they don't have to be done now. But I think you should do all the tasks that need to be done as soon as possible, so you can have free time later.\n\nWhen you're always working, you don't think about taking a break. But when you're doing nothing, you get tired, sleepy, or drowsy; this is why not doing anything is bad for you. For example, Thomas Jefferson became president because he worked hard and pushed himself to achieve his goals. Being active or inactive can take you to two different places in life - it's either good or bad. If you're active, you can go far in life and achieve many things. But if you're inactive, you may fail and not achieve what you want.\n\nBy finishing all your tasks, you've achieved a lot. It's very important to finish what you need to do on time or even earlier. Why? Because finishing everything on time can make you feel proud of yourself. Feeling proud can help your confidence grow and make you a better person. You have to be determined in life; you can't just put everything off and say you'll do it later, because if you do, you'll never finish that task or project.\n\nIn conclusion, in life, we have to do many things. Doing something all the time keeps your mind working. We all have lazy days when we don't want to do anything, but you have to always push yourself to do more in life. Many things can be done when we're busy. I agree with Thomas Jefferson; we do achieve many things when we're always doing something."}

However, if you think they didn't try their best, but you praise them anyway, they might not try to do better. Some people think praising students' work is the right thing to do, but not praising them can actually lead to more achievements because they work harder and become more confident.\n\nPraising students' work is okay if they did a good job, but not their best. For example, let's say your art teacher asks you to draw a portrait. You finish it quickly, and she praises you. But if you didn't try your best, she shouldn't just praise you. How can she give you a good grade if you didn't work hard?\n\nNot praising students' work can lead to more achievements because they try harder. If you think your work isn't good enough, start over and keep trying. Don't just do what others do. People who work hard can do much better and achieve more.\n\nNot praising students' work can also make them more confident. When you try and believe in yourself, that's confidence. You have to be positive about what you want to do in life. I have a friend who isn't confident because she always asks if her work is correct or not, even when it is.\n\nIn conclusion, praising students' work isn't always a good idea because it can make them stop trying. Instead, tell them to work hard and explain things to them. They will achieve more and become more confident. That's why it's important to keep trying and never give up. Self-esteem comes from achieving things through hard work, not from praise."}

When I go to a store, I get very nervous when I talk to the cashier. Some people think it's good to talk to others because it helps build confidence.\n\nFor some people, talking to others is hard. Learning to make eye contact can be difficult too. With new technology, you can order books, shop, play games, and even take online classes. I wish I could stay home and do everything online. Some people think it's good to do things on your own, but I prefer doing them online.\n\nSome people are good at talking to others. I know people who don't like talking much. When people meet me, they ask why I don't talk much. I tell them I don't like people. Technology helps people because it has many new features. You can do almost anything online. It's a big help for people who need it.\n\nIn my opinion, it's great that we can do things online. I don't like talking to people. They make me very nervous. When I get nervous, I turn red, talk fast, and my hands shake. My friends tell me I need to talk to more people to help myself, but I say no. I wish I could take online classes or be homeschooled because public schools have too many people.\n\nIn conclusion, technology has improved a lot over time. I think it's a good idea to have many things online for people who don't like talking to others. I don't like talking to people; it makes me feel uncomfortable.

Some people think that praising a student's work, even if it's not their best, is a good idea. Others think that praising bad work makes learning worse by lowering standards. Some people say that self-esteem comes from achieving things.\n\nWe should try harder; students can become experts and master their self-esteem. Sometimes students don't want to succeed in life, so they don't try new things. They think it's not important to be confident in things they're not good at. Life is not easy, and that's why people should try hard things. When they face hard times, they'll know how to be confident and prepare for it.\n\nI've had an experience where life was tough because it pushes everyone to succeed. Life makes everyone face the hard part. For example, looking for a job can be hard if you don't have experience or confidence. That's why people should show you how to do it first, and then let you do it on your own. If students are not happy with doing the right thing, it doesn't matter because we're trying to help them succeed.\n\nNot everyone is ready to face life or its challenges, but they have to try. They know that the best way to succeed and be confident is to put in effort.\n\nI think students should try harder and not be afraid or shy. Even if students are not trying their best, others who have faced the same problem say it's a challenge for everyone, and it's not easy. Some students had an idea to start a club where students can participate. It was a good idea for students to open the club.\n\nStudents should do something to overcome their fears and be confident. They should join a club or talk to their parents. Sometimes students think we're trying to bother them, but it's not true. We're doing it for a reason, not to be mean. In conclusion, we should all try hard because it's very important to be careful in what we do, so we can say we did it, I lost my fears, and now I'm more confident."}

Most people prefer doing nothing and being lazy. Sometimes there's nothing to do, but we need to go out more and play sports or do a hobby we enjoy.\n\nI think fast food is a problem! It takes up a lot of our time; people buy food, go home, eat, and lie down. That's why some people aren't active.\n\nSome people are different, and I understand that.

Many people agree that we can do many things by taking action.\n\nWhen we're idle, we can't achieve anything. We miss out on opportunities. For example, some kids get the chance to come to the United States for a better life, but they don't take advantage of it. Others would love to have that chance and make the most of it. People don't understand that if they don't try, they won't achieve anything. As a saying goes, 'If you don't move, time will run out.' Anything is possible if you take action.\n\nMy dad's stepdad is a good example. He was very lazy and idle. He would stay home watching TV all day.\n\nAmazing opportunities come to those who take advantage of them. This life is for people who make the most of every chance they get.\n\nFor instance, I had the chance to come to the United States and have a better life. My mom told me I had two choices: stay in my country and not achieve my dreams or come to the US and succeed. Now I'm going to succeed because I want to, and because it's always better to do something than nothing.\n\nMany people, about 90%, think that we achieve more by always doing something. These are the people who become professionals. Around the world, about 10% don't graduate because they don't want to work hard. By being active, we can achieve our goals. We can breathe and live while others just sit around thinking about what they could do, but they don't take action. I think that's pointless because we have a long life ahead of us, and life can end at any time if we don't stay awake and active.\n\nThere are many examples of people who succeed because they work hard. They are professionals, rich, and successful. It's because they put in the effort. If we keep trying, we can achieve anything! On the other hand, those who take the easy path don't achieve anything because they don't work hard.\n\nThomas Jefferson believed that by doing more and more, we can achieve more. If people want to succeed, they should learn from Thomas Jefferson. He can inspire and teach us many things, and then we can keep moving forward and making progress."}

If you start relying on yourself from a young age, your life will change for the better.

They said she was ugly and had bad grades. She felt like the worst person in the world. But one day, she got tired of it and realized it was her fault for letting others treat her that way. So, she started working hard, paying attention in school, and got good grades. Now, those who made fun of her see how she overcame many things on her own.

{"text_id_kaggle": "15874CE3A0EC", "output_essay": "Many schools work with companies to give students a chance to try out different jobs through internships. This helps students find what they like and work with it. It's a good thing for schools and students to have this option.\n\nWhen schools partner with companies, both sides benefit. Students get to work with a business they like, and the company gets to reach more people. When students work with their dream companies, they learn more and share it with friends, which is free advertising. It's a chance for students to explore and see what's out there. I think it's a good idea for schools and students to consider this, no matter how big or small the company is. It helps students find what they want and helps businesses get more customers.\n\nAnother reason schools should partner with companies is that it lets students talk to people in the business world and set goals for themselves. It's important for students to have this chance to pursue their dreams and work with people who can help them. This lets students explore their interests and get hands-on experience with companies. Whether it's a business that helps animals or a clothing brand, it's a way for students and schools to be more active and aware of what's out there. It gives kids a chance to think about running a business and gets them experiences they haven't had before. They'll have a better understanding of the job they want to do.\n\nIn conclusion, I think school-company partnerships are a good thing for everyone. Students get to learn about what they like, and businesses get the attention they want. This is a great chance for our society to grow and for our future to be bright. We have this opportunity, so we should take it."}

When we set goals, we need to stick to them. For example, my friend set a goal to lose 50 pounds, so he goes to the gym every day. I've seen a big improvement. Some people think true self-esteem comes from praise, but it actually comes from achieving our goals.\n\nHaving self-esteem means being strong, confident, and brave. True self-esteem comes from what we achieve. To get it, we need to work hard and believe in each other. Strength is important; it helps us achieve anything in life. My mother is a strong person; she's been through a lot and still stays positive. She tells me to be strong like her.\n\nConfidence is important too. It helps us try our best and show what we can do. For example, Lionel Messi is a great soccer player. He never gives up and always tries his best. He inspires me to work hard and become a great soccer player too. Anyone can achieve their goals if they have a positive mindset.\n\nBeing brave is also important. It means being confident and strong. We need to be brave even when our goals seem scary or hard. Everyone is afraid of something, but we need to push ourselves to achieve our goals. I was brave when I went to military camp and had to swim to a raft. I didn't know how to swim, but I tried and made it.\n\nIn conclusion, true self-esteem comes from achieving our goals. We need to work hard and stay focused. We need to believe in ourselves and others. We need to get rid of negative thoughts and think positively. Anyone can achieve anything if they challenge themselves."}

They should ask for help to learn from others. Also, many people are too afraid to talk about their problems, and asking for help can save lives.\n\nFirst, people have different views, and listening to them can help. When we listen, we can combine our ideas and make better decisions. For example, in a school project, students work together to make it the best.\n\nSecond, many people are too scared to talk about their problems. They think others won't care or will think they're a bother. For example, my friend never talked about his problems until he saw me stressed. After talking, we both felt better and now trust each other.\n\nThird, asking for help can save people from making bad choices. Some people hurt themselves, and getting help can stop this. For example, I met someone who hurt themselves, but I didn't know until I saw their scars. I offered help, and now they're doing better.\n\nFinally, these are my reasons why I think people should ask for help when they need it."}

I was lazy and didn't study. I would sleep in class and not take notes. After school, I wouldn't do my homework. As a result, my grade kept going down. I was shocked when I got an F, but not surprised. Doing nothing wasn't going to get me anywhere. I had to improve my grade. My teacher, Generic_Name, advised me to practice and study. Her advice helped me. Weeks later, my grade went up to a B, and I was very happy.\n\nSometimes, people who don't do much can still achieve something. But that doesn't mean we shouldn't try to be active. For example, my 16-year-old cousin, Generic_Name, was on the basketball team in high school. He would often miss practice and not work out, but his team would still win games. Even though doing nothing can lead to success, being active will get you further because you can do more tasks, stay motivated, and have more opportunities.\n\nWhen you get a job, your boss won't hire you if you seem lazy. Someone who doesn't do much will be seen as unmotivated and won't take the job seriously. For instance, my mom, a former cook, once came home very tired. She told me that her coworkers didn't do their job, and she had to do extra work. She advised me to stay on task when I get a job, or I would get fired. It's not hard to complete tasks; the more you do, the better your chances of success.\n\nBy trying and doing something, we learn more than those who give up. Sometimes we have to push ourselves to do more than we think we can. We can achieve great things, but we need to make an effort. There's no point in achieving something without doing something to get there. Staying active is important for our whole lives. Doing nothing never helps us achieve great things.\n\nAlthough some people get away with being lazy and still succeed, it doesn't mean anything. Should we just not try and expect to succeed? No; never listen to those who say that, because it will make you lose motivation. Overall, we can achieve more by doing something than those who don't, because we'll have a better chance of getting our work done, we won't get lazy, and we'll have more job opportunities."}

They can share ideas, give feedback, and save time.\n\nWhen students work together, they can give each other feedback and ideas. This helps them understand the assignment better. I remember working on a group assignment in my English class. We had to write a two-paragraph essay about summer vacation. We decided to write our own ideas and then share them with each other. It was helpful to get different ideas from my classmates, which made me understand the prompt better.\n\nGetting feedback and ideas from others can also save time. When I work alone, it takes me at least an hour and a half to write about a prompt. But when I work with a group, it usually takes 45 minutes. Working in a group helps make the assignment better, and it doesn't take as long. Students can work together to come up with more ideas, which is helpful for anyone who needs extra help.\n\nSome students might think working alone is better. But I don't agree. When students work together, they can combine their ideas to make the assignment better. Without my classmates' thoughts and ideas, I wouldn't have much inspiration to make my assignment better. Teachers often want students to work independently, but students might actually learn better in a group. Everyone can help each other, and feedback and ideas can make anyone's work better. With everyone's help, they can agree on the final product without rushing. So, it's simpler to work in a group, where everyone can get feedback, ideas, and save time."}

People can't get better unless they try to do more than they've learned. For example, I'm taking a Spanish class, and I already know how to speak and write. I thought I wouldn't learn anything new, but I was wrong. Every time I go to class, I learn small things that help me get better at Spanish. I've also gotten better at math. I know how to solve problems in many ways, but I'm still learning new ways. Pushing myself to do more has helped me get better than I thought.\n\nRalph Waldo Emerson said, 'If you don't try to do more than you're good at, you won't get better.' I've found this to be true. Even though I take Spanish classes, which I'm good at, I've still learned new things. I thought I knew Spanish well, but I was surprised to learn more. People won't get better unless they try to do more than they've learned. Learning new things or trying new things can help people get better at what they know.

These people may have a high level of education, but what's more important is that they didn't learn how to be a good person when they were young.\n\nHigh school students are too young to think about their careers. High school life is a time for students to develop their abilities. There are many things they need to learn, which are more important than their careers. Students should know what their parents hope for them.\n\nHigh school students should develop their own abilities, including physical, thinking, and other skills. If a student is interested in sports, they can practice like an athlete, but it doesn't mean they have to work hard and become an athlete. Everyone has their own interesting activities, and it's not necessary to think about what job they will have in the future. An art student needs to exercise, and a sports student needs to learn some singing. It's not for their future careers, but for a healthier life.\n\nHigh school students need to learn other things that are more important than their careers. Students need to learn how to communicate with others. They should also learn how to become a friendly person who makes others feel nice. For example, a person who has enough money to spend their whole life, but has no one to talk to. It doesn't matter how big their house is or how many houses they have; their life will be boring and lonely. Learning how to live and be a nice person is more important than learning how to find a job.\n\nStudents should not think about how to find a job in high school. Parents provide money and food for their children to learn, because they hope their children have good education and a wonderful life. Parents never hope their children become a machine that does anything for the money.\n\nFor example, most parents will never tell their children to earn money and give it back to them. They will tell their children to be happy and learn whatever they want at school. High school students are too young to think about earning money and repaying their parents.\n\nHigh school students are too young to think about what job they will take in the future. They should learn and know what they can do and what they can't, and they should think about how to become a good person who can live in this society.

They prefer to stick with what they know, but this can hold them back from improving in their jobs. Setting a goal helps because it gives people steps to follow, and once they reach it, they can do even more and be better. This can lead to a better life and a sense of accomplishment.\n\nI agree with Ralph Waldo Emerson that it's important to do more than what you're good at. This helps people believe in themselves and do better. For example, my aunt used to work at a grocery store but wanted her own business. She went to school and started a daycare in her basement.

The most important thing is to have the motivation to keep trying. This is how we learn and gain experience. Experience leads to success. For example, a salesman needs to have sold something before to be good at his job.

For example, my cousin works as a secretary in a hospital and speaks both English and Spanish. She was afraid to take the job because she thought people would laugh at her accent. But she did it, and now she earns a good salary and is paying for college.\n\nThe point is that she tried, and now she's achieving her goals.\n\nSecond, trying a new job can teach you new things. For instance, I worked as a chef in a restaurant last summer and learned a lot. Then, I got a job as a cashier, which was scary at first, but I learned to do many new things. Being a cashier is easier than being a chef, and I get paid more. Learning new things can make life easier and bring better opportunities. When I moved to this country, I felt like I didn't belong. But I came here for a better life, and over time, I started to feel like I fit in. I learned about the culture, and now I have better opportunities for education. I'm going to college next year, which wouldn't have been possible in my old country.\n\nOn the other hand, if you're already good at a job, it might not be a good idea to try something completely new. For example, if you've been a teacher for years, it might not be a good idea to try to become a veterinarian. You know how to work with students, not animals. And if you try to switch jobs and get fired, you might lose everything you've worked for.\n\nIn conclusion, trying new things can bring better opportunities and make life easier. It's hard to try something new, but if you don't try, you'll stay in the same place and never achieve your goals. So, if you start trying new things, it can lead you to success."}

It's helpful, easy, and makes students smarter. Deciding on a career early shows that students are ready for the future and its challenges. I had a similar experience.\n\nWhen I entered high school, I wanted to study many things, like becoming a pilot, engineer, and football player. But I realized I needed to focus on one thing to prepare for the future. So, I talked to my parents about how to achieve my goal. I discovered I was good at math, and I decided to study mechanical engineering. I spoke to a college counselor to learn what classes to take to prepare for mechanical engineering. He advised me to take STEM engineering, which is similar to what I want to study. Taking that class helped me a lot, and now I know the basics of engineering.\n\nDeciding on a career early really helps and prepares students, making them less stressed about the future.

This is clear in the problems teenagers have with their parents, people becoming antisocial, and the struggle to talk to others. As a teenager, I see these issues in my daily life at home, school, and work.\n\nTeenagers have a big problem with technology. We spend most of our time using it, and it often causes fights with our parents. Families try to limit our phone use, but we often get in trouble for using it in school or to bully others. Technology also affects our mental health. Some of us would rather stay up all night on our phones than get a good night's sleep. This affects how we think, communicate, and react to things. For example, I spend around eight hours a day on my phone, and I have trouble focusing and get anxious sometimes. A psychologist told me that I need to stop using my phone before bed to solve these problems.\n\nMany people are becoming antisocial. Online games and social media make people prefer their own virtual world to interacting with others. They spend most of their time playing games or watching videos instead of going out with friends and family. We see this in kids who prefer playing games at home to going out with their parents.\n\nPeople also struggle to communicate with others. Some people spend so much time using technology that they don't know how to talk to others when they need to. I experienced this at work when a customer came in using his phone. He didn't even look up when I asked him what he wanted to order. He just kept using his phone and eventually left without ordering anything. It's true that technology can be helpful, but it also has many negative effects. It affects our relationships, our thinking, and our mental health.

In my opinion, limiting how much we use technology has a good effect because it helps us avoid big problems.\n\nFirst, limiting technology makes life easier for everyone. Not everyone has a good education, so limiting technology won't hurt many people. This means many people will keep their jobs. And since it's limited, everyone gets to use technology to communicate and work with others without getting into debt.\n\nNext, for people's safety, we should keep self-driving cars away from humans. For example, Tesla's self-driving cars are a worry. Researchers say that these cars can catch fire easily, and it's hard to escape if that happens. There's also a higher chance of having a bad accident with these cars because they're made by humans, and humans make mistakes.\n\nSome people say that technology helps us live longer because it helps us grow food faster and communicate with other countries to trade. But humans lived for many years without technology. For example, people used to walk or ride horses to travel and trade before technology came along. So, technology isn't something we need to depend on.\n\nIn conclusion, to protect the earth and make it easier to live, we should limit technology before it creates problems and makes our lives harder."}

When I was younger, I wanted to be a doctor, but as I grew older, I wanted to do performing arts or become a registered nurse. Some people want to be a firefighter at a young age and later become one. That's why I don't think it's a good idea to learn something you wanted to be when you were younger and then change your mind. Students should be asked if this is what they really want to do in the future; they should have time to make a decision before taking classes that won't be useful. As I said before, everyone has their own opinions and thoughts about committing to a career at a young age; everyone's different, and they can decide what's best for them."}

This helps them figure out if they want to pursue that type of work or not. Our school got a great opportunity from the local hospital, but they would only take two students. I have a 73.54 percent in my anatomy class, and I want to learn more about the human body. Like my mom, I want to follow my dreams and help people around the world. But to do that, I need to know more about what being a doctor really means.\n\nAnatomy is the hardest class I've taken in high school, but that won't stop me from pursuing my dreams. The human body is very complicated. I want to learn more about what happens inside a hospital or how to help someone who comes in with serious injuries. I want to learn about cancer and how it starts in one part of the body but spreads to other parts. I have many unanswered questions, and that's why I think you should choose me.\n\nMy mom is a nurse, and she's had many chances to help people in Generic City. I remember when I was little, my mom would visit people's homes at any time to help them. I could see how tired she was, but she never stopped helping. Being a doctor is not easy, but I still want to help people. A doctor is not just someone who helps you when you're sick or someone who has a lot of money. They're someone who works in a hospital almost every day, and I want to learn more about what it means to be a doctor.\n\nMy dream is to become a Gynecologist. My sister once made a joke about Gynecologists having long fingers, but I didn't get it. For a minute, I thought my dreams were over. I want to make sure I'm choosing the right career. Colleges and universities are expensive, and I think being one of the students you choose could help me understand if being a Gynecologist is right for me.\n\nIn conclusion, I think I should be one of the two students accepted for an internship or shadowing experience at the local hospital. I want to learn more about the human body, I want to help people around the world, and I want to make sure I'm not making a mistake by choosing the wrong career."}

I think setting a good example is the most important way to influence others. However, there are other ways to influence people too, such as explaining why they should do something, motivating them, and giving them a small reward.\n\nFirst, setting a good example is a key way to influence others. But sometimes people don't understand why they should do something or what the point is. For example, some people try to raise money for a good cause and need help from others. But have you ever wondered if people understand what they're doing and why? Setting a good example is not enough. We should also explain why we're doing something so that others can understand and follow.\n\nSecond, sometimes people know what they need to do to get a good result, but they're just not motivated. That's where inspiring them comes in. For instance, some people start doing something good, but then they give up. In this case, inspiring them can make a big difference. We should encourage them to reach their goal, and then they can share their experience with others and explain the benefits. After that, we should thank them for their effort with a small reward, like a certificate or a gift.\n\nIn conclusion, setting a good example is important for influencing others, and it's a topic that people often discuss. But it's not the only way to influence others. Explaining why, inspiring, and rewarding can also be effective ways to influence others."}

He means that we can do more if we keep working. Many people agree with him: we can do more if we stay focused and keep working.\n\nFor example, when I'm in school and the teacher gives me time to do my homework, I can choose to use that time wisely. If I focus and do my homework, I can finish it in class and not have to do it at home. This shows the difference between doing something and doing nothing.\n\nAnother example is construction workers. If they don't want to work hard, it will take them a long time to finish their project. But if they work hard, they can finish it quickly. It may take a year or two to build a building, but if they finish on time, it means they were productive and got things done.\n\nIn conclusion, Thomas Jefferson was right: it's amazing how much we can do when we keep working. I can relate to this quote; it's true - the more we work, the more we get done. This quote is very relatable and many people would agree with Thomas Jefferson. It's a good reminder to think about how much work we need to do today whenever we feel like we're not doing anything."}

I believe they deserve to have the whole summer to themselves and take a break. So, I strongly disagree that students should have a shorter break.\n\nOne main reason students need the whole summer break is to have more time for fun. School is not everything, and kids need this break to spend time with their family and enjoy their long vacation. For example, I lived in Generic City for 13 years, and our break time was different. We had many days off during the school year, but only two weeks of summer break. Students were unhappy about this. I couldn't have fun even on my days off because I always had homework, assignments, or tests to do.\n\nAnother reason students need the whole summer break is that they work hard and feel stressed during the school year. For example, my cousin Generic Name lives in Generic City, where breaks are very short. He can't go on vacation with his parents or hang out with friends to play basketball. The only time he has fun is when friends come over to study with him. Generic Name used to be very active, but since he moved to Generic City, he has become depressed and doesn't feel like doing anything. I feel bad for him, and I hope he gets better. I don't want to be like him; I want to travel, go on vacation with friends, and enjoy life.\n\nSome people may have a different opinion, and that's okay. They might think students can have a longer spring break and some weeks off during fall and winter. This way, they can take breaks while studying and still have four weeks of summer break. They can also learn more about their subjects and classes, and teachers can prepare them for college.\n\nHowever, in my opinion, these small breaks are not helpful. Schools always give students work to do, even during breaks. I know how kids my age feel when they have a short break and then have to go back to school and turn in their homework.\n\nIn conclusion, I think we should not take away students' summer break or make it shorter. It's one of their hopes, and we don't want to take that away. We want students to be successful, but studying without a long break is like exercising without enough sleep."}

We often don't know what we're capable of until we try. For example, my friend was good at basketball, but she was afraid to play in a big game. Our coach told her that we'll never know what we can do unless we try. My friend's sister is a great artist, but she didn't think anyone would buy her work. Then she put her art online, and it sold. She even got a job because of it.\n\nWhen we're kids, we learn to never give up. We're told to follow our dreams and do what we love. I love to draw, but I wasn't good at it at first. I wanted to quit, but my teacher told me to focus on my own progress, not compare myself to others. In gym class, I couldn't run for more than five minutes. But my teacher told me to try running for ten minutes without stopping. It was hard, but I practiced every day, and I did it. My teacher said that if we try our best, we can achieve anything.\n\nSome people think that taking small steps towards our goals is a waste of time.

They always told me to stay positive, no matter what problems I faced. Some people think students need to be confident to learn, while others believe praising students even when their work is not good helps them feel better about themselves. But I think true self-esteem comes from achieving something.\n\nWhen teachers give students work, they expect them to do their best. Teachers are there to help and answer questions. For example, if students are unsure about an assignment, teachers will explain it and show them they can do it. In my junior year, I had a tough project. When I finished, my teacher told me I could have done better. This encouraged me to work harder and do more research, so I wouldn't make the same mistake again.\n\nHigh schools prepare students for college and university, where they'll have to work independently. Teachers should tell students when their work is not good enough, so they can improve. It's like soccer players who need to work hard to be good. Coaches don't give them a break; they train and practice, and when they make a mistake, coaches tell them what went wrong, so they can do better next time. This teaches them that their self-esteem comes from their achievements.\n\nSome people think praising students' work helps them feel better about themselves. But if teachers praise work that's not good, students will think they can get good grades without trying hard. They won't learn from their mistakes.\n\nIn conclusion, students learn from their mistakes and should know that it's okay when teachers tell them their work needs improvement. This helps them do better in school and in their future careers. I believe there's nothing better than feeling proud of what you've achieved through hard work.\n\nIn today's society, it's good to help students by showing them they can achieve something they can be proud of, through their own hard work."}

According to the New York Times, people who take breaks are confident and motivated to achieve their goals.\n\nHowever, I think we accomplish more when we are always doing something. We have more time to work on our goals and achieve them faster. A study by the Generic School shows that successful people always work towards their goals and never stop.

But later, it might not work out. After high school, we might want to change, but it's too late. We start thinking about the choices we made and wish we had never made them.

It's important to listen, speak when necessary, and always be respectful.\n\nWhen you join a group, everyone gets a task to do. You can ask questions and get help from your peers. Working together is very helpful, and you can finish your work faster. One person can write down ideas, while others research the topic.\n\nYou have to be responsible with your work when you're working on a project.

You can also split a presentation between two people.\n\nThe third reason I think working in a group is better is that it's more fun. You can talk to each other while you work.

You also need to pay attention to your organization, sentence structure, tone, and word choice.\n\nYour teacher always reminds you to provide examples for your reasons, but have you ever wondered why? One reason is that examples help people believe you. You need to provide facts that readers can relate to. Examples help readers understand your writing better and imagine it in their minds. They also make your essay easy to read and more convincing. Since you know the details of your thoughts, feelings, and actions, readers can feel them too, making your essay more real.\n\nAnother reason to use examples is that they grab the reader's interest. Examples make your essay more engaging, and readers want to know what happens next. You can use a fitting tone to tell your story, making it more lively. After reading your examples, people may look up to you and decide to trust you. That's when you succeed in influencing your reader.\n\nSome people think there are better ways to influence others, such as using a nice introduction or conclusion.

If you want readers to believe you, give them real examples.\n\nThroughout your life, you will experience different things, meet different people, and have different thoughts. Each experience can become a good example to persuade others. Using good examples also helps you get a better score on your writing. So, when you write, use good examples to influence people better. Good examples will gain the reader's trust and interest in your writing, help you get a better score, and make your essay more effective."}

But some just prefer to do nothing and rely on luck. They prefer to be lazy. These people don't achieve anything successful because they don't work hard. Lazy people can have big problems in the future, such as being homeless, having a bad lifestyle, or having trouble with their family.\n\nEveryone works differently. When you work hard, you can see the results. Your body can also feel it. You need some time to rest and realize your activities to give your best. Because if you work hard without rest, it can be a problem. But if you're lazy for a long time and don't work hard, you won't achieve your goal. The more you work, the more successful you'll be in life.\n\nIn my opinion, you always need to do something. If you have a goal but prefer not to work hard and be lazy, it will be hard to achieve the goal. You always need to work towards what you want. Having some time to rest is not bad and helps to relax. But it shouldn't be for a long time. It's good to take a break and clear your mind. But after that, go back to your routine and keep working hard. You need to be determined and plan your future.

However, I think setting a good example is not the only way to influence others. You need to think about whether you're a good or bad example, because people can follow bad examples too.

As kids, we often dream of being doctors, firefighters, or other exciting careers without realizing how much work they require. Sometimes, we feel pressured to follow in our parents' footsteps, even if it's not what we want. How often do you hear someone say, 'I want to work in marketing' or 'I want to start my own business'? Some students take the easy route, but those who know what they want are more likely to succeed and find their dream job.\n\nImagine working in a big office with many desks, answering calls from angry customers all day. It's not a pleasant thought, so you might aim for a more exciting career. However, this might require many more years of school, and before you know it, you've spent most of your life studying and not enjoying it. I was always told that your career should be something you love doing. Photographers, artists, and dancers are great examples of people who turned their passions into careers.\n\nMany college students either graduate late or drop out. This shows that people often lose interest in their chosen careers. Not everyone gets their dream job, but it takes commitment and desire to achieve it. I think students should be guided towards a career, but not too early. Seniors or juniors in high school are the best age to prepare them for college and future careers. If you ask a teacher if they always wanted to be a teacher, most would say no. That's because choosing a career is a big decision that affects the rest of your life.\n\nA 14-year-old in middle school shouldn't have to choose a career. Being stuck in an office all day is not the way to spend your life. Maybe you'll have your own business or become a lawyer because you truly want to, not because your parents were.

But I don't agree with this quote because you need to keep practicing to get good at something.\n\nFor example, if you want to play basketball, you need to practice shooting every day. If you want to do well on a history test, you need to make flashcards and study them before the test. Learning to drive is another example.

Similarly, having more experience in a job or sport can help you get a better job or a higher position. So, people who push themselves to do more end up with more.\n\nIt's important to look at your goals and feel proud of what you've achieved. For instance, in high school, if you take your first three years seriously, you won't struggle in your last year. You'll be proud and surprised by how much free time you have to take classes you want. When people get older, they often realize they could have done more. So, it's important to go after what you want in life, so you won't regret it later.\n\nSome people think that reaching a goal is enough because of the time and effort they put in. But I believe that people who push themselves to learn more are the ones who will be successful in many ways. For example, in my 10th-grade year, I passed a class with a D, but I knew I could do better. So, I took the class again in summer school and passed with a B. I realized that if I could pass one class with a B, I could pass all my classes with A's and B's.

For example, writing books used to take a long time. People had to write by hand, and it would take months to finish a book. Now, with typing programs, people can finish a book in a day or two. This shows that technology can help us finish tasks faster and easier.\n\nOn the other hand, some people think technology is bad. It can cause problems.

It's important to go out and exercise rather than stay in one place. Everyone needs to exercise to be healthy. Exercise is a big issue today because we can do everything at home, like playing games or talking on social media. If people keep doing this, more people will die every day from high blood pressure. Also, many people have a hard time moving and don't feel confident. So, you should go exercise now before it's too late. In my opinion, I think soccer is the best sport because you don't have to be tall or know how to jump high; all you have to do is kick the ball. Playing a sport is great for exercise because we all want to be healthy. Sometimes, take time to play a sport you like to make life better. You should go out sometimes to relax because everyone is busy every day and gets a lot of stress.\n\nAnother reason is that it's fun to play with family members or friends. Think about how many times you've had fun with them? Some might say they can't count because it's too much, but some might not. For example, maybe people go abroad to study, learn, or work. They don't have time to spend with their family because they're too busy. My sister was like that once. She only cared about studying and had many books. I remember she fainted because she studied too much. She was frustrated with her work and looked like a dead zombie. She forgot things and even forgot to eat. I heard it was the time she had to get ready for her exams. If I were her, I would rather die than study for 20 subjects and take many exams in one day. Before her exams, I asked my parents if we could go somewhere for fun, and they agreed. The next morning, I got ready and packed our stuff. I woke my sister up, but she didn't know where we were going. I told her we were going to buy breakfast, so she said \"sure\". When we got out of the house, my dad and mom were already in the car, so my sister was suspicious. After a while, she fell asleep until we got to the beach. It was beautiful in the early morning when the sun rose. I opened the door, ran around, and my sister woke up. She asked \"Where are we? I thought we were going to get breakfast!\" Then I said \"Well, we can have breakfast here.\" We had so much fun playing together. I remember when I kicked the ball and it hit my sister's head. It was so funny. Anyway, spending time with your family is a good option. It can be an activity many people want to do. Family is the most important to everyone, so it's fun when we spend time together.\n\nYou never know how much fun it is if you never try. Doing an activity can make you feel relaxed after a long day of studying and learning. You can also make new friends. There are many benefits. Don't always force yourself to study in a room. Why don't you try to go out and play for fun? You can ask your friends and family to go to a place and play a sport together. It would be so much fun. At the park, there are many interesting activities, or you can just walk and talk with others. Therefore, let's go and play your favorite sport and get rid of everything that worries you. Let's start a healthy and fun day together."}

I don't agree with Emerson's statement because you can master anything, but you'll always learn something new and keep growing. Growing is part of life, and you don't need to try new things to keep learning and growing.\n\nMy first reason is that you can master something, but you'll always learn more. From my experience, I know that no matter how good you are at something, there's always something to learn. Everything that has happened to me has taught me a lesson, and I've learned from it. For example, I work at a fast-food restaurant. I know my job, and I'm always learning and growing. You don't need to try new things to grow.\n\nMy second reason is that you'll always learn to be better, even if you do the same thing. Growing is part of life, and you don't need to try new things to keep learning and growing. Growth is important in life, and you'll do it forever, no matter what you do. For example, teachers learn new things to teach, and they don't need to try new things because they're doing what they love and growing every day.\n\nFinally, you never know if trying new things will be good for you or help you grow. But there are always ways to grow with what you do. I think it's good to try new things in life that can teach you to be a better person, and you'll grow more every time. For example, I tried to do better in school, and I've learned to appreciate education more. I've grown a lot since then.\n\nIn conclusion, I don't agree with Emerson's statement because every day, you learn, practice, and grow to be better. I think it's more important to enjoy what you love, learn, and grow from it. Growing is part of life, and you don't need to try new things to keep learning and growing."}

Why would they want to make it 8 hours and 30 minutes? In my opinion, we already have enough school hours. I don't agree with making the school day longer because some students have after-school activities and some want more time with their families.\n\nMy first reason is that some students have activities after school that start soon after school ends and go late. We will probably get more homework, so if we have activities, we will be too tired or won't have time to do our homework. I know how it feels because I go to church class every Tuesday after school, and I get stressed when I'm late. Students can get stressed easily when they're late to class, sports, or homework. Too much stress can be bad for our health.\n\nMy second reason is that people need time with their families and friends. Spending too much time in school can make students depressed and distant from their loved ones. They might stop trying in school just so they can fail. I think family and friends are important for having fun, relaxing, and spending time together. For some people, family and friends are what make them happy and focused in life. Imagine having less time with the people you love; it would be hard. I love spending time with my family and friends, and I hope I still get to do that.\n\nIn conclusion, I understand what the school board is trying to do, but I think family and friends are just as important.

Inactivity doesn't make life easier. In fact, it makes life harder. We should do as much as we can and not put off today's work for tomorrow.\n\nOur bodies need to use the energy we get from food. If we eat and sit all day, our bodies will use what they need, and extra energy can cause problems like being overweight. Being overweight can lead to many health problems, such as diabetes, heart attacks, and digestion issues. Moreover, inactive people often have fewer friends and may experience depression.\n\nA scientist named Loqman Hakim said, 'Don't be inactive; there's always something to do.' Inactivity doesn't make life easier. We should do as much as we can and not put off today's work for tomorrow. If we want to change the world, we should start today.\n\nEveryone has goals and things they want to achieve in life. To get what we want, we need to work for it. We can't just sit and think about it all day. We need to take action and do what we have to do. The more we work, the closer we get to our goals. The more we're active, the more confident we become.\n\nSome people think that inactivity is good as a break after working hard, but they're wrong. A break is about doing what we want and having fun, not being inactive. Inactivity is never fun or relaxing.

{"text_id_kaggle": "02EFED8BB1F3", "output_essay": "Did you know that school boards are planning to add one and a half hours to school days? Adding more time to school days is a bad idea because students won't like it, they'll get more anxious, and the day will be longer.\n\nFirst, students won't like it because they'll have more work to do. This means they'll have less time for activities that are good for their health. They might even get into fights, which will make the school's reputation worse. As a result, people won't want to send their kids to those schools.\n\nNext, students will get more anxious. Anxious kids are more likely to make bad choices and get into trouble. They might even skip school, which will hurt their future. Anxious kids are also more likely to get bullied, which can lead to serious problems.\n\nFinally, the day will be longer. This is bad for students because they'll have to work more. They'll have to work as hard as before, but they won't have enough time to sleep. This means they'll be tired in class, and teachers will have to wake them up.\n\nIn conclusion, most students will disagree with the idea and cause problems. They'll get anxious and might even start using drugs. Lastly, the day will feel longer, and students will go home and stay up late to study. This means they won't get the sleep they need to stay healthy."}

Some people believe that schools should be open all year with shorter summer breaks and longer breaks in winter, spring, and fall. However, teachers should keep summer vacation as it is because kids deserve a break, need a normal childhood, and should focus on setting goals for the new school year.\n\nKids deserve a break because they work hard in school. They put in effort to learn and should get a reward. They can use what they learn in their daily life, which is what teachers hope for. They get up early to go to school and work hard to plan their future. They learn something new every day. It's like having a job - you get days off because you work hard and get tired. Kids should get breaks too.\n\nKids should have a normal childhood. They should be able to try new things and have their own adventures. They can't just go to school all the time - they have a life to live too. It's important for young kids to have experiences outside of school. School isn't for everyone, and if it was year-round, they would barely have free time.\n\nKids should focus on setting goals for the new school year. They can learn something new about themselves and prove themselves wrong. They can work on fixing mistakes from the previous year and feel confident that they can do anything. It helps boost their self-esteem and makes them feel good about themselves.\n\nI don't think shortening breaks is a good idea. It would take away kids' freedom to have fun and make them not take education seriously. Others might say it's hard to remember things after a long break, but having breaks helps kids focus more. They know when to be serious and can use the breaks to relax."}

I also think it's a good idea to have three or more weeks off in the summer. This gives us time to relax and have fun. I like this time because I can play soccer with my team. However, some people don't like summer because of the weather. They prefer fall. Everyone has their own opinion.\n\nSome students use their break time to find a job and earn money. They can buy things they want, like clothes.\n\nThere are reasons why teachers don't want summer break to be too long. First, students often forget what they learned before the break. Second, it's hard for them to learn it again. Third, teachers waste time explaining it again. Fourth, students need to refresh their memories.\n\nOn the other hand, having a longer break is a good idea because students can relax, have fun, and reduce their stress.\n\nFor example, students and teachers enjoy summer vacation, but it's hard for students to remember what they learned.\n\nIn conclusion, I think this is a good idea, and many students will agree.

This is a good thing, but should people make their own decisions or seek help from experts and authorities on important life matters? Most people think you should follow your own instincts because it's your life. However, smart people would agree and also seek help from experts to improve themselves. There's nothing wrong with getting help; it can put you in a better position. With expert help, you can learn a lot. For example, you'll make better decisions as you get older, learn how to do things the right way, and become more responsible and mature.\n\nSeeking help will help you make better decisions in life. For example, it can help you get a better job by knowing things you didn't know from experts. Knowing specific information can help you understand jobs and career goals. Say you work as a cashier and a customer is yelling at you because they didn't have their favorite cereal. You might want to yell back, but if you had help on how to react to angry customers, you would stay calm and be respectful. Many people have lost their jobs for not reacting the right way to customers. When you react the right way and are respectful, you can get promoted or a raise.\n\nGetting help from experts and authorities on important life matters will show you how to do things the right way. For example, you're in a relationship and you're having an argument with your partner. Your instinct might be to win the argument, but that can make things worse. If you had help from experts, you would let the argument go and talk to your partner to fix the situation. Many relationships are violent because of arguments, and if people knew how to handle them, the number would decrease.\n\nSeeking help from experts will make you more responsible and mature about many things. For example, you buy a house and your partner moves in with you. You might want to go out with friends every Friday, but you know you have bills to pay. If you had help from experts, you wouldn't waste money and would pay your bills on time. You wouldn't care about what your friends say because you're mature. You wouldn't get evicted from your house or have bad credit.\n\nIn conclusion, people would live a better life by seeking help from experts and authorities on important life matters. You would be more responsible and mature, make better decisions, and do things the right way. People who believe in self-reliance are on the right track, but it's also good to seek help from experts and authorities."}

For example, if you don't have a job or go to school, you'll just sit on the couch and do nothing. You won't exercise, and you'll eat a lot of junk food and gain weight. Scientists have shown that if you don't move around for at least 7 hours, your muscles will get weak and your immune system will suffer. So, keep moving and don't be lazy.\n\nSecond, it helps us finish tasks. For example, doing chores like cleaning your room, washing your clothes, or taking out the trash. If you do nothing, everything will be dirty and messy. But if you have the courage to do the chore, you'll have a clean and nice-looking home. This helps teens be responsible and finish their tasks on time.\n\nFinally, it keeps us busy. For example, you don't want to be bored doing nothing; you want to be excited doing something.

{"text_id_kaggle": "643EF7B3B591", "output_essay": "I believe that working in groups in a classroom is more helpful than working alone. It's good practice for when you have a job and need to work with others. When students work in groups, they can finish their work faster. It also helps students who are struggling by asking their group members for help.\n\nIn most jobs, you will have to work with someone else. My dad's friend, for example, was a car mechanic who liked working alone. But when he got too many cars to fix, he had to hire someone to help him. At first, they didn't work well together, but they soon learned that working in a group was faster. Now, he has a successful company and knows the value of teamwork.\n\nI had a similar experience when I worked at Adidas. I had to work with someone I didn't like, and we argued a lot. But after a group-building exercise, we became friends and worked well together. Now, when I work in groups in school, I'm the first one to start talking and getting the group working.\n\nWhen students work in groups, they can finish their work faster. I know that when I work with a group, I can finish a project faster than if I worked alone. If I don't know something, someone in the group probably will. For example, my group mate and I finished a math project in two hours, but my friend who worked alone took five hours.\n\nPeople who work at NASA and in professional sports teams like the NBA and NFL work in groups and get their work done fast. If you're struggling, you can ask a group member for help. I did this when my teacher gave us a project that I didn't understand well. I chose to work in a group because I knew I needed extra help. After one of my group members explained the material to me, I was ready to start working. We finished the project quickly and got a good grade.\n\nSome people think that working alone is better because you can focus more. But I think it's always better to work in a group because it prepares you for the future. You can always ask your group member for help if you don't know something. You also get work done faster when you work in a group.\n\nIn conclusion, you will likely work in a group when you're older, and there are many benefits to working in groups. Groups can accomplish more than individuals, and they are often called teams, like in the NBA and NFL. Working in groups is the fastest way to get work done, and it's used by people with important jobs, like NASA and the army."}

We use it at work, home, school, and anywhere we can use our phones. Students can use their phones in school to learn, read online textbooks, or study for a test. People use their phones at home to set reminders, which helps them remember tasks. Some people use their phones a lot at work to get calls, texts, or messages from their supervisor.\n\nPeople also use their phones to shop online instead of going to a store. This is helpful for those who can't go out, like people who are hurt, disabled, or shy. When shopping, you can make a list on your phone instead of on paper. You can then go to the store and find what you need.\n\nYou can also play video games on your phone. You can buy games or download free ones. You can play alone or with others. These games have tasks to finish, and each game has a story. Finishing tasks gives you rewards, like in-game money or items.\n\nTechnology has positive effects on us because it helps many people.

In fact, research shows that cell phones are the main cause of car accidents for teenagers.\n\nMost technology can have a bad effect.

Work hard, and at the end of the day, you'll see what you've done. I have friends who are too scared to try because they think it's too late or they won't succeed. Sometimes, you need to ask for help or talk to someone to find a solution; there's always a way out.\n\nI want to share how my life connects to what the author wrote. I grew up in a city where gangs recruited kids to commit crimes. When I was 10, gangs started asking kids to join. I was in the 5th grade, and I had many friends. We played and studied together. As time passed, some friends joined the gang, and I tried to stay away from them. I knew having friends like that wasn't good for me. By the time I was 12, most of my friends were in the gang. They wanted me to join, but I said no. They were upset because they thought being in the gang made them strong and protected their families.\n\nAfter I said no, my grandmother got a letter saying a gang member died, and they needed money for the family. I told her not to give money, but she was scared, so she gave it. The next month, they called again, asking for more money, and my grandmother gave in again. When I was in 7th grade, my friends told me to join or something bad would happen to me. I was scared, so I said I'd think about it. I tried to avoid them, but two weeks later, three guys followed me at the mall. They asked me to join, and I said no. They hit me, and then they ran. My grandmother told my parents, and they told me to come to the USA. At first, I didn't want to because I didn't know English, but I also thought I could have a peaceful life and study to be someone.\n\nI was scared to start over with no friends, new schools, and nervous to see my parents after 7 years. But I feel connected to what the author said because I could have stayed in my country and not taken the opportunity to be here. Instead, I took it, and now I'm here.

Jefferson wanted people to be more active in life, whether it's physical or mental. Being active means taking part in activities or helping a good cause. It doesn't take much to be active in society; we can pick up trash, participate in marches, or protest for human rights. By taking part in active events, people can show that they care about making their community better. It's better to be active to get the most out of life.\n\nFirst, being active has many benefits. It helps people reach their goals, helps society, and makes them feel good. To reach our goals, we need to work for them. Small actions like recycling and community service make a big difference. Being active helps people live life to the fullest and use their time wisely. It also makes them feel useful and not bored. \n\nSecond, even though being active is a good choice, it's also possible to be idle and not work. This can be bad because less work gets done, and it can lead to bad habits like procrastination. Working allows us to complete tasks, which is important when we have many assignments to finish. However, procrastination can become a habit and hurt our work habits and life.\n\nSome people may argue that being too active can cause health problems and that being idle is better. They may say that being active can lead to mental disorders. However, it's clear that without activity, our minds are not stimulated enough. Being idle has its benefits, like giving our minds and bodies time to rest. But being idle all the time is not good.\n\nIn conclusion, being idle can be good for a short break, but staying idle leads to less productivity. While working all the time can't be healthy or fun, it's more beneficial than staying idle. Through working, we accomplish more, and society moves forward. For most people, working is necessary to succeed and gain respect in life. Therefore, between being active and being idle, activity is the better choice."}

Don't always listen to what others think, because in the end, it's up to you. Setting a goal can lead you to do bigger things. Doing bigger tasks makes you better at what you're good at.\n\nYour attitude also matters. Keeping a positive attitude takes you far. When you're trying to complete a task, keep your head up and avoid negativity. Failing is not an option when growing. If you want to grow and have a positive attitude, you'll have more accomplishments. Your attitude depends on how you take things.\n\nTrying new things is also important. It won't hurt you; it will only show you what's good for you and what's not. You might master something bigger than what you've already done. I think everyone should try something new instead of not growing.\n\nIn conclusion, these are my reasons why you should master more than what you've already done.

I disagree with Emerson's statement.\n\nMany people have hobbies they love, like sports or music. They can enjoy these hobbies their whole life and even make a career out of them.

It's not common for coaches to teach students outside of school.\n\nPeople who want to be musicians, like pianists or guitarists, can take lessons or classes in school. Guitarists can learn the basics, like open notes and chords, in school. They can also teach themselves. To be in a band, you don't need a college degree, but it can be helpful. For pianists, it takes a lot of time and work to perform at a big concert.

It takes a lot of work to achieve this. People love sports, and it's entertaining to watch on TV. You can start playing sports when you're young, and then try out for teams in school. There are different seasons for trying out, and you have to wait for the right season. Sports can be important for students who want to apply to college and earn scholarships.

When I was in my first year, I knew I wanted to be a lawyer. I even knew it in middle school. I didn't choose it randomly. My family had a bad experience in court, and I saw how important lawyers are. I hated that my family was accused of something they didn't do. I want to help people who are in the same situation.\n\nIn conclusion, I think students should decide on a career early because it helps them make plans for their future. It helps them choose the right college and make a financial plan. I know it will help me achieve my goals. I believe it's very important for students to think about their careers early to guide them on a better path."}

Everyone has different ideas, views, and opinions.\n\nIf the teacher gives us too much work, we can share it in a group. This way, everyone can add their ideas and do the part they want.\n\nThe main reason to work in a group is to help each other, be friendly, have fun with friends, share new ideas, and show different views. We meet new people and work together to achieve our goal.\n\nAs a group, we work together to be the best and achieve our goal. We can be the best in our class.\n\nHowever, working in a group has its downsides. You can get distracted by others, or get annoyed if someone makes too much noise while working.\n\nOn the other hand, working alone has its own problems. You might not have different ideas or views, and the work might be too much for you. You might get bored or sick of working too much.\n\nThe good thing about working alone is that you don't get distracted, and you don't have to go to your friends' houses to work.\n\nFor example, a soccer team is a group of people working together to win a tournament. A drill team is a group that trains together to be the best.\n\nI think it's better to work in a group. You can make new friends, get new ideas, and see things from a different perspective.

Many people have made mistakes in their lives. An expert can give you good advice. For example, if you want to go to college, an expert like your mom or dad can help you choose a good one. They can also help you with sports or college applications.\n\nYou should always ask people for help because they have more information than you do. They have experienced things before you did. So, they can give you ideas before you make a mistake. Most experts are doctors or people like your parents or grandparents who have a lot of information.\n\nFor myself, I always like to ask people for advice about my future. For example, my friend wanted to be a soccer coach, so he asked his parents and people who had experience. You can also ask your doctor if you're not feeling well, because they know more than you do.

When I was in a bad relationship with a toxic person, I was very depressed and disappointed. I thought I might not get out of that stressful situation, but an expert helped me. Experienced people can also help us with life's important matters. For example, my mom and my best friend helped me with my insomnia.\n\nFirstly, asking an expert for help is necessary during difficult times. An expert won't harm you, but they can heal your heart. I was in a long-distance relationship with a guy from another city. He was a very nice person at first. He tried hard to make me fall in love with him because I wasn't into long-distance relationships. He loved me through my social media videos and pictures. He said he would do anything for me if I accepted him as my boyfriend. He even came to the U.S. from his city to meet me.\n\nI met him because he insisted a lot. He rented a sports car and booked a room in a fancy hotel to get my attention. However, I wasn't a materialistic girl who loved someone for their money. When I met him for the first time, I started liking him, and after that, I thought about him a lot. Suddenly, his behavior changed, and I went through depression. I was very disappointed. I had no idea what to do. One day, I asked my teacher, who was an expert, for help. She advised me to focus on my studies until I got a university degree. She encouraged me to forget him. She was very helpful to me in that hard situation, in fact, in my life's important decisions.\n\nSecondly, experienced people can be very helpful in life's important matters. I had insomnia for several months. I didn't like to share my problems with my family or friends. One day, my friend asked me what was wrong, as I seemed so exhausted. I told her that I had insomnia. She was experienced and showed me some methods and remedies. When I followed her instructions, my insomnia was cured.\n\nIn addition, older people are capable of guiding in a great way, like parents, older siblings, and teachers. Older people have lived for a long time in this world and should be informed of the hard circumstances for assistance. They have seen many people's experiences and real-life stories. Older people have gone through a lot in their lives.\n\nFinally, I highly recommend people to visit an expert, experienced people, and an older person during difficult times. Like my situation, I was lost and didn't know what to do. I asked for help from my counselor. My counselor advised me about the relationship, and she changed my life since that day. I concentrated on my studies. People should get experienced people's opinions on their problems. Actually, older people play a huge role in solving life's important matters as well. No one is perfect enough to solve a hard situation by themselves. Always, one should ask for help."}

National parks have fun activities and sometimes special holiday events.\n\nI believe community parks, state parks, and national parks can offer a range of fun activities. For example, national parks have activities for kids and families. State parks might have activities like fishing or boat-building competitions. Community parks may have summer activities like mud runs.\n\nMy first reason is that some parks have activities, while others don't.

She said becoming a kindergarten teacher was the best decision she ever made on her own. This made me think - is it better to make all our life decisions by ourselves, or should we also listen to what others have to say?\n\nSome people believe in being self-reliant, which means making our own choices based on our own thoughts and feelings. I agree with this idea because the decisions we make in life are very important. \n\nFirst, we have to make big decisions about our education. We have to choose which school to attend and what to study. For example, my friend recently had to decide which college to attend. Many teachers think this is one of the toughest decisions students have to make. The school we choose can greatly affect our future academic career.\n\nSecond, our social life is also a big part of our decisions. The choices we make can affect how we feel and what we experience in life. For example, my friend had to decide which parent to live with after their parents got divorced. This was a tough decision for him because he loves both parents. Many teenagers struggle with making decisions, especially when it comes to their family. Life decisions can be hard, but it's important to believe in ourselves and make the right choice.\n\nThird, our career choices are important because they show what we want to become in the future. For example, my sister recently saved a patient's life during surgery and was very happy with her decision to become a surgeon. Some people think choosing the right career helps them succeed in their job. Career choices are important because we have to choose a job we love and enjoy doing. This will help us be more successful in the future.\n\nIn conclusion, my friend's story made me think about how important it is to make our own decisions in life. We have to be careful and listen to ourselves about what we want and need. I believe it's best to make our own decisions, but also consider what others have to say."}

For example, if a principal says a certain career won't make much money, it can influence their choice. The main point is not that some teenagers can't decide on a career, but that they don't want a lot of pressure from others.\n\nWhy do people think being a musician or dancer is a \"poor\" profession? Society plays a big role in making us think we need a \"safe\" job, like engineering, before pursuing our dreams. I call these \"first goals\" - things we want to achieve in life, but often put on hold as we grow up. As we mature, we realize our goals may change, and that's okay.\n\nAs we grow older, we may realize that being an astronaut or doctor is possible, but it takes a lot of time and effort. We may change our minds, and that's not a bad thing - it means we're thinking more clearly. I believe that as we spend more time in school, we gain maturity and life experience, and eventually discover our strengths.\n\nI've talked about the benefits of not forcing a career choice at a young age. However, some students do have a clear idea of what they want to do. They can take specific courses in high school to prepare for college, which can save time and money. If you're sure about your future, go for it. But if you're unsure due to pressure from others, don't feel forced to choose a specific career path."}
{"text_id_kaggle": "97E0749970A6", "output_essay": "The author Emerson said, 'Unless you try to do something beyond what you have mastered, you will never grow.' I agree with Emerson because if people keep doing what they already know, they won't learn new things. If they do, they will fall behind and struggle to understand new ideas.\n\nFor example, in a History class, let's say we're learning about the 1860s and you like that topic. After a month, the teacher starts teaching about the 1920s. If you don't try to learn about the 1920s, you'll have trouble understanding it.\n\nIf a teacher gives a test and it has some questions you like, but some you don't understand because you didn't pay attention to the new topic, you'll do poorly. This is because you didn't try to learn the new topic.\n\nIf you don't understand something from last month, and the teacher is teaching something new, it will be even harder to understand. But if your classmates did understand, they can learn something new.\n\nIn conclusion, Emerson's quote is mostly true.

Although students may be too young, it has many benefits to choose a career early.\n\nChoosing a career early helps students save time. They can finish their education quickly and have more free time. For example, when I don't have homework, I hang out with friends or family. We have fun together. If students finish their career early, they can spend more time with family and friends.\n\nChoosing a career early also lets students study for something else. If they finish early, they can start working or study for another career. For example, I want to be a computer engineer. If I finish early, I can study to be an electrician too. Electricians make good money.\n\nChoosing a career early also helps students get a job. I want to finish school quickly so I can work and earn money. If people start working young, they can retire early. They can also save money and buy what they want, like a house or car.\n\nIn conclusion, choosing a career at a young age is great. It helps students in the future. They can start their own business and make a difference. It's a good idea for students to choose a career early so they can start working and make their own choices."}
{"text_id_kaggle": "2D07CFE4B821", "output_essay": "People who value self-reliance like to do things on their own and don't need to ask others for help. They think nature is a beautiful place to live, so they don't trust others. Self-reliance means you can do everything by yourself, which helps people who work alone and don't ask for help. They might learn from their experiences and understand life better.\n\nFirst, people who value self-reliance do things by themselves, not just to be happy. They learn from their mistakes and do what they think is right. Nature is a happy place where people can be happy all the time, and they don't worry because they think they're doing the right thing. Self-reliance is for people who want to do everything on their own.\n\nSecond, self-reliance is for people who want to do things by themselves. They feel confident about what they can do, and they don't trust others because they think others might give them bad advice. These people believe in themselves, so nobody can distract them. They are individual because that's the best way to be happy - to do what you like, not what others like.\n\nThird, I think these people should be right in what they do, but they learn from their mistakes. They try to be better by learning from what went wrong. Self-reliance is about people who always do things on their own and feel confident about what they can do. But if they visit an expert before doing something, it will be better for them because they get another's ideas, and it will be more helpful. People can do things more perfectly when they visit an expert because they get guidance on what to prepare for.\n\nIf people don't visit experts, that's fine because they just want to be happy doing what they like. But visiting an expert is important because they can tell you what to do in a difficult situation. If you don't visit, that's okay because you just want to be happy and feel confident, and you don't trust others because they might guide you wrong.\n\nFinally, self-reliance is about nature and being individual. Some people think that if they do things by themselves, it will be easier for them because they want to live and be happy. Self-reliance includes nature, where people who value self-reliance can be happy. They can find what they want to be the happiest people in the world because nature is a beautiful place.\n\nMany people think that self-reliance is important because you have the option to be yourself in this world. That's the choice for you to do what makes you happy and be individual, and others can't guide you wrong. That's why you should do what's good for you and for others. In conclusion, people who value self-reliance and like to be individuals have a good opportunity to practice because they can share their ideas and wishes to be the happiest person in the world. People believe in self-reliance that nature is a beautiful place to visit to be happy, and you can find God there. You don't have to go to church to find God because He is everywhere, and you just have to do the right thing and not hurt others, so they can't hurt you too. I think if people who like to depend on themselves visit an expert, it could be better for them to do better things. If they visit an expert before doing something, it will help them to be more prepared and ready to do what they like, and also help them to be more prepared for any situation that comes up. Visiting an expert will be the best thing for them because they can do everything right and get guidance from an expert."}

According to Ralph Waldo Emerson, 'Unless you try to do something beyond what you have mastered, you will never grow.' This means people need to try new things to grow. I believe people can grow by achieving new things, like having a good work ethic and overcoming challenges. Some people think you can't grow in areas you're not familiar with.\n\nOne reason people can grow is by having a good work ethic. A good work ethic helps people succeed.

These examples show how a good work ethic helps people achieve and grow.\n\nAnother reason people can grow is by overcoming challenges. Challenges can be tough, but you can handle them if you do it right. For example, breaking down big tasks into small steps helps you succeed. When you complete the steps, you learn how to solve challenges. Taking notes or memorizing helps you solve challenges too.\n\nThese examples show how overcoming challenges helps you achieve new things and grow.\n\nSome people think you can't grow in areas you're not familiar with. For example, making mistakes wastes time. Mistakes can also distract you and make you lose focus. However, people should learn from their mistakes. For example, you'll know what to do better next time.\n\nIn summary, people can grow by achieving new things, like having a good work ethic and overcoming challenges. Having confidence motivates you to achieve goals. Overcoming challenges helps you achieve new things too.

We will discuss if this is a good idea or a bad idea. If students don't choose a career early, they will focus more on their studies. But it's a good idea for students to choose a career early because it will make their future work easier, help them do what they want, and make them smarter.\n\nFirst, choosing a career early makes future work easier. Everyone decides what they want to be and practices for their job. For example, my friend wants to be a doctor. She studies hard for that. She watches YouTube videos to learn how doctors work. I think when she becomes a doctor, her work will be easier. So, it's very useful for students to think about their careers early.\n\nNext, choosing a career early helps students do what they want. I believe that when people are young, they are more interested in their future and have many dreams. For example, I want to be a teacher, and sometimes I want to be a manager. So, I have time to decide what's best for me. Thinking hard and long helps people choose the best.\n\nThird, choosing a career early makes students smarter. When students think about their career, they have a big responsibility, and that's good for their minds. This makes them smart and responsible. I think there's no difference between them and an older person. So, that makes students very smart. Students need to think and study hard for their future. It's very helpful if schools have classes for career development.\n\nIn conclusion, it's a good idea for students to choose a career early because it makes future work easier, helps them do what they want, and makes them smarter. It's very important for students to think about their future and practice for it. They can take their time to think and choose what they really like to do in the future.

We need this process to figure out what we really want. Students who think about a career at 15 or 16 should have better opportunities, but they also need to start high school to learn and grow.\n\nWe don't think about our future. We don't make lists of different careers; we make lists of what new things we want or what we're going to do tomorrow with friends. We don't think, 'If I'm doing something wrong in class,' until it's already happened. We're not thinking about our career choices.\n\nWe don't look for career options. For example, I don't research careers when I'm worried about homework in 11th grade. Society thinks that when we start high school, we already know how to choose a career. But choosing a career is a big decision that can change our whole life. We're not ready for that decision yet. We're focused on simple things.\n\nWe don't always make good decisions.

{"text_id_kaggle": "23773CCA244E", "output_essay": "In my opinion, what we do or don't do has a big impact on our lives. When we're in high school, we wonder if we want to make a difference or if doing nothing will get us somewhere. But that's not true. We're here to be happy, even though we don't always behave the way we should. We're all good, but we're also ignorant and don't look for God's guidance. We need to realize we need Him. He wants us to be good people, but we failed. I think heaven is beautiful, and we all want to go there, but we don't deserve it. We have to fight for what we want. We should be thankful to God for waking us up every day. Sometimes we feel like nobody loves us, but that's not true. God always loves us, no matter what. He wants the best for us, and all we have to do is serve Him.\n\nMy first reason for being active is that it helps us achieve more. If we're active, we'll always get results, and if we do good things, God will bless us even more. We need to think positively and aim high because nothing is free. We have to believe in ourselves and know what we want.\n\nMy second reason is that being active helps us decide our own lives. We have the power to make our own choices, and we need to have faith in God. Some people think life is hard, but it's only hard when we think we can't do something. We need to pray to God and never give up. Sometimes people are lazy, and that's why they don't do anything, which is not a good idea.\n\nMy third reason is that being active helps us use our time wisely. I've seen people make a good income by doing what they love, like playing video games. Being inactive won't get us what we want. We need to do what makes us happy because that's what matters. I want to be a professional soccer player, and I've realized that staying at home all day doesn't help. So I'm trying to practice every day, and it's making me a better player.\n\nIn conclusion, we all have chances in life, and we can either use them or let them go. Some people let go of opportunities that others would want. We need to fight for what we want and never give up. We should always try our best, even if we think we can't. We need to believe in ourselves and have a purpose in life. We should surround ourselves with good friends who encourage us to do the right thing. Never give up on life, and always work hard for what you want. Remember, money isn't everything, and we all need God. We should look for Him before it's too late. Being inactive won't help us, so we need to use our time wisely and not waste it."}

There's always something you want to achieve, whether it's something you've been putting off or something you're interested in, like art. I believe we get more done when we're doing something because it's like hard work - it always pays off in the end.

You shouldn't give up; you should just go for it, because it keeps you busy, and you never know what will happen. By the end, you'll realize, 'Wow, time goes by so fast.'\n\nBut there's one thing that can ruin everything: procrastination. You'll be motivated one minute, and then you'll decide to put things off.

So, in my case, I say that if you don't do anything, you won't see results.

My sister achieved her goal; she knew she struggled with history, but she tried by studying and getting help. If we want something achieved, then we should make it happen, even if we struggle; trying will help us achieve something.\n\nMany people believe that doing nothing serves a purpose; it doesn't. By doing nothing, we won't get anywhere in life. Laziness is a decision we make. If we want something done and we're lazy about doing the work, then we won't complete it, and we'll have to worry about getting it done. For example, my brother had a lot of missing assignments to do, and it was due the next day. He told himself he would complete all his missing work once he got home. But when he got home, he ended up playing Xbox instead of getting his work done. The next day, the assignments were due, and he got in trouble for not doing his missing work, so he got a bad grade. It was his punishment for being lazy and not doing his work. If we want something done, then we should actually do it. Don't say we will do something if we're not going to do it.\n\nLastly, achieving something will give us more opportunities in life. If we keep following our dreams and goals, it can lead us to have many chances in life. The more we work hard for our future, the less we have to worry about. We will fail at some point, but it's normal because everyone fails. But if we put a lot of effort into something we want or desire, then we will get it. If we want to be successful in life, then we will have to achieve by doing an assignment or anything that we want to be for our future career and life. For example, my cousin was a good student; she always had all A's and studied for her quizzes and tests and also did her homework. Her dream school was to go to Generic_School, and in order to go to that school, she had to work hard and achieve her goals. It was a hard school to get into, but she put so much effort into trying to get into her dream school. The next thing you know, she ended up getting into Generic_School, and she was crying in tears. My cousin achieved her dream, and she was so happy because she worked so hard in school, willing to get into a good university for the best of her future and herself.\n\nAfter all, anything is possible in life; it's just the decision we make, and it's based on our future and ourselves. What Thomas Jefferson said was correctly true because achieving something will make people happy, getting their work done or things they have to do, and won't have to worry about anything. It's a better feeling doing something at least doing nothing. Achieving something equals happiness and success. It's committed to doing hard work and achievement. Not doing anything won't help us, and complaining about it won't help us either. It will make it worse by not doing anything."}

They might have a career in mind based on their hobbies, but they should consider college or university to find the best fit job and get financial help.\n\nHigh school years are important, and most students need to take the next step after graduation. They can choose any career they want, and it's their decision. No one can force them to pick a certain career.\n\nTeachers, administrators, and even students can help someone find a good career idea. They will ask about their interests and help them decide on a college or university. Often, the best option is a college in their state because it's cheaper. If they go out of state, it might cost more than they expect.\n\nMoney can be a problem, but family members can help by sending them money. After they finish college, they can get a job and pay back what they borrowed. They just need to focus on their future and not worry about the past or their family.\n\nSome people don't want to attend college because it's too expensive. However, college is a crucial part of their life. If they don't go, it's their decision, but if they do, it's good for them.\n\nCollege is important, and parents often want their kids to attend. However, if their family can't afford it, they don't need to go. There are many jobs that only require a high school diploma. If they don't have one, they can start over."}

They would read to us or teach us how to read.\n\nThe program helps students improve their reading skills by having older students read to younger ones. This helps the older students too. It's like when we take the reading SOL test. There are similar programs outside of school, like at my church, where we read to younger kids about good manners and respect.\n\nListening is another way students get involved.

{"text_id_kaggle": "24BBFA26D076", "output_essay": "In today's world, many people use technology to make their lives easier. I believe that using technology instead of human contact has a good effect on people's lives. This is because technology helps us find a lot of useful information, learn about the world, and learn new things that will be helpful in the future. Technology also provides students and adults with good resources to study, create projects, and learn about any topic.\n\nFirstly, many people use technology to find useful information to learn about the world and new things. Sometimes, people have trouble understanding what teachers teach, so they look it up to learn more. Modern technology has a lot of information that helps us become better learners. For example, as a student who speaks two languages, I often misunderstand words and look them up to know what they mean. I also look for topics that help me with projects or homework to get good grades and become a better student. The internet has a lot of useful information that helps anyone at any time with projects, homework, work, or other events.\n\nSecondly, technology gives students and adults good resources to study, create projects, and learn about any topic. For example, many adults and students used to go to the library to find good information, but it was difficult for those who lived far away. Now, the internet brings great resources that can be easily accessed at home, even on a smartphone. Smart devices have apps that find amazing information, and you can even find interesting articles that help you. Many people need to find new ways to get good information, and the internet is a great place to do that.\n\nOn the other hand, some people disagree and think technology has a bad effect because they think it can harm your brain and eyes. But this is not true because many people find technology fascinating, and it has created many good things in life. Some parents think people can lose their sight from using smart devices too much, but this is not true because taking a break can help your eyes. Many people who think it's bad are not familiar with new technology and don't know that everything around them is built because of technology. In my opinion, technology is a great place to start, whether you're stuck or don't know something. The new generation is surrounded by new ideas, and technology is the biggest resource we have to learn from.\n\nIn conclusion, technology is a great tool that has a positive effect on people's lives. Technology brings out many ideas that can develop new ones and will be helpful for new information in the future. Many people prefer the internet for better resources to shop online, find books, and even play games without interrupting others and having their own space."}

People won't have to rely on others who might give them bad advice.\n\nIt's not a good idea to let others influence you because they might tell you to do bad things and make you worse.

Others believe that true self-esteem comes from achieving something. I personally think that students get true self-esteem from achieving things.\n\nWhen students don't get praised, they want to do better in school. They study more and complete their homework. If they get a good grade, they feel proud of themselves. They didn't need someone to praise them to work hard. So, if they feel good about achieving a good grade, they will keep working hard in all their classes.\n\nLet's be honest, students who get praised for not trying their best don't deserve it. This makes them think they don't need to try hard, and they will do badly in school. They might even tell their friends, \"I didn't try, and the teacher said I did well.\" This can affect other students too, making them think they don't need to try hard.\n\nStudents who achieve things and work well in school feel better than those who just get praised. The ones who didn't try hard might feel good, but the ones who achieved something feel even better because they worked hard. I think self-esteem comes from achievements because many successful people didn't finish college, but they felt proud of what they achieved.\n\nSome people think students need to be confident to learn. I don't agree. Students learn if they want to, and they need to listen to the teacher. Being confident is good, but it's not necessary to learn. Overall, I believe that true self-esteem comes from achievements, and students will keep trying their best in all their classes."}

People who are always active can finish a lot of work, but being inactive also has its benefits. Sometimes, being inactive is good for people because they need to rest their minds, bodies, and stay healthy.\n\nFirst, people need a mental break. When they take a break, they can think of new ideas. If they always work, they might not be able to think of new things. Always working can also make people serious and unhappy. It can even cause depression. So, taking a break is good for people's minds.\n\nSecond, people need a physical break. If they always work, they won't have time for their families, which is very important. They also won't have time for their friends. If they don't spend time with friends, their relationships will be weak. Always working means they can't enjoy life or do things they love. So, taking a break is good for people's physical health.\n\nThird, people need to stay healthy. Working too much can cause health problems. One big problem is heart disease. Working too much can cause stress, which is bad for the heart. Stress can even cause heart attacks, which can be deadly. Working also takes a lot of energy, making people tired. Taking a break helps people get their energy back.

{"text_id_kaggle": "B6FECA77D415", "output_essay": "Many teachers think students forget too much during long breaks. They believe students spend too much time away from school, which makes them forget what they learned. I agree with them. When students have too much time off, they can get tired of school and forget things. As a result, they would remember more, and teachers would feel better about their students.\n\nSome people think there should be a shorter summer break, a longer winter break, and a week off in the spring and fall. I know people who do well in school, but when they take a long break, they start doing poorly. This happens because they get tired after a long break. For example, I had a friend who always did well until the first long break. After the break, his grades went down. The same thing happens to me. When I take a break, I do even worse.\n\nIf breaks were shorter, students would remember more. They would have a fresh mind because they didn't have as much time off. My brother is a good student, but when he takes a long break, his grades go down. He wishes he had shorter breaks. He thinks his classmates don't like him because he wants shorter breaks.\n\nTeachers would feel better about their students if they had shorter breaks. Students would remember more, so teachers wouldn't have to repeat old lessons. This would be good for students too, because they could move on to new lessons quickly.\n\nSchools should let students take more classes in a shorter time if they do well. For example, if a class moves quickly and students do well, they could take that class in just two quarters or one semester.\n\nIn conclusion, I agree with most teachers that students should have shorter breaks to remember more, be more active, and make teachers feel better about them.

I believe kids need time to spend with their families and rest their minds for the next day.\n\nKids have other activities they need to do and they need to spend time with their families. Rest is important for our bodies.\n\nAdding time to school would make teachers and staff even more tired. They already wake up early, and leaving later would make them even more exhausted. Instead, I think the school should let kids stay after school for extra help if they need it. If school gets longer, people with jobs should get an extra hour too, to be fair.\n\nKids shouldn't have to stay in school longer if they don't want to. They might have better things to do than stay in school for another half hour.\n\nThese are my reasons for not wanting the school to add another half hour."}
{"text_id_kaggle": "33B5A70B7B4B", "output_essay": "Some people think that true self-esteem comes from praise, while others believe it comes from achieving something. I think it comes from achieving something, and I will explain why.\n\nWhen someone does something that not many people can do, they feel confident and proud of themselves. They know they did something special, and that makes them feel good about themselves. True self-esteem is not something you are born with. Many people think it comes from achieving something and winning.\n\nFor example, imagine two people trying to climb the highest mountain in the world. One person gives up halfway, while the other person keeps going and reaches the top. The person who gave up will feel bad about themselves, but the person who reached the top will feel proud and confident. They will walk around feeling good about what they achieved.\n\nI also think that students don't have to be confident to learn. They just need to be interested in what they are learning. If students are interested, they will learn faster and more. If the teacher makes the subject boring, students will not pay attention and will not learn.\n\nThis is related to my point that true self-esteem comes from achieving something. If a teacher makes a subject fun, students will pay attention and learn. They will do well on the test, feel happy, and become more confident. Their true self-esteem will grow stronger.\n\nSome people think true self-esteem comes from praise, but I think it comes from achieving something. I have given you examples of why I think this.

On the good side, it helps us communicate with others, makes work easier, and teaches us new skills.\n\nFirst, technology helps us communicate with others. For example, I use technology to talk to my family who live far away. Some people use social media to share important news with their family and friends. We can also use technology in emergencies. If someone needs to go to the hospital, they can call for help using a phone. Technology helps us share important information with each other.\n\nNext, technology makes work easier. I think technology is very important for big companies like Amazon, Target, or Walmart to sell their products. For example, if they have a sale, they use social media to advertise their products. Technology also helps people work from home. If I'm sick, I can use my computer to work from home. Technology helps people in offices talk to their clients over the phone. Some people prefer to make appointments with their doctors over the phone. Technology has a big impact on our workplaces.\n\nFinally, technology teaches us new skills. For example, using technology can help students get a good job in the future. I think learning to use PowerPoint will help me in the future because I want to be a teacher and it will help me present new ideas to my students. Learning to use electronic devices also helps people teach others. Having good technology skills is important because employers look for people with these skills. Technology is another way to learn.\n\nIn conclusion, technology has a good impact on people's lives because it helps us communicate, makes work easier, and teaches us new skills. Technology helps people talk to each other all around the world. It helps people contact their clients. Learning technology skills can also help students in their future jobs. Technology is a great way to share ideas and motivate students to learn new things every day. It's also a great way to share new ideas with others."}
{"text_id_kaggle": "A29A9D973316", "output_essay": "Many people think that working with a group or working alone has its advantages, but I also believe it has its disadvantages. In my opinion, both ways of working have benefits and drawbacks. When you work with a group, you bond with your teammates and become more social. For example, you discuss the topic, share ideas, and come to a conclusion. You finish your work quickly and easily. Working with a group helps you listen to others, be cooperative, and prepares you for your future job.\n\nHowever, working in a group can have its downsides. You may feel like you're doing all the work and your teammates don't deserve the credit. You may also get into arguments or feel left out. You can get distracted and lose focus, which makes you not care. For instance, if a friend is in the group, you may start talking about unrelated things and lose track of your work.\n\nWorking alone can be boring, but it helps you be independent and focused. You get the credit you earn, and you avoid problems with teammates. Working alone can help you learn to deal with situations on your own. However, the downside of working alone is that you can get frustrated when you need help. For me, working alone is challenging because I like to be involved in many things and communicate a lot. Working alone feels like being trapped without anyone to help.\n\nIn conclusion, I think working with a group or working alone are both beneficial, despite their disadvantages. They both help you learn to be responsible, cooperative, friendly, and creative, and help you become more social. They also help you learn to put in effort and help others in different situations. The most important thing is learning about teamwork and independence. Everyone works differently, but in my opinion, working in a group or alone are both helpful and beneficial."}

Some people think working alone is better, but I disagree.\n\nWorking in a team has many benefits. When you work with others, you get to hear their opinions and ideas. You can share your thoughts and learn from each other. It's also easier to finish the work because you have more help. Additionally, working in a team helps you interact with others and learn about their cultures. It makes you more social.\n\nOn the other hand, working alone has some disadvantages. You don't get any help, and if you're unsure about something, nobody can give you advice. It's also harder to learn new things because you don't have others to teach you. When you work alone, you have to do all the work yourself, which can be difficult. You also miss out on interacting with others and getting their input.\n\nSome people prefer working alone because they don't like to work with others or share their opinions. Sometimes, working with others can be a problem if you have different opinions. However, I think working in a team is always better because you get more help.\n\nGetting more help is always better. When you have more help, you can finish your work more easily. Working alone is harder. Working alone has its good and bad points, but working in a team always helps you achieve your goals."}
{"text_id_kaggle": "2D48DB7BFE46", "output_essay": "Do you like running? Do you enjoy running track? I do! This year, I've been interested in track. In my opinion, running track is a fun and educational activity. Track is fun because it helps you get faster, makes you want to stay healthy, makes you think about supporting your teammates, and makes you listen to your coach. Especially during meets, track becomes more enjoyable.\n\nI think track makes you faster because when your coach tells you to stretch, do warm-ups, and use your arms when running, you see improvement every day. This makes you happy and enjoy track more. Did you know that when you run, work out, and stretch, your muscles get stronger? When you stretch and work out, your muscles get stronger, and that's why you feel sore the next day. That's why it's important to stretch every day and take your coach's warm-up seriously.\n\nTrack is also fun because it makes you want to stay healthy and eat well. You don't want to eat junk food and get slow. Keeping fit and healthy are very important. For example, one time I ate hot Cheetos before practice, and I regretted it because I got heartburn while running. Now I eat healthier because of that experience. You enjoy track more when you feel ready and healthy.\n\nYou also enjoy track better when you listen to your coach. Listening to your coach is very important, especially during meets. If you miss something because you weren't listening, you can get frustrated, and you can't enjoy things when you're frustrated. Plus, during meets, it's very loud, so listening to your coach is key. You wouldn't want to miss out or sit out because of not listening.\n\nTrack is also fun when you have supporting teammates. You feel more confident in yourself, and you don't have doubts. When you don't have a supporting team, you might feel down. That's why I think having everyone be nice to each other and encourage one another is more enjoyable.\n\nIn conclusion, track is a lot of fun. But to enjoy something, you have to have a positive attitude, which you also need for track. Track is fun because you feel like you achieve goals. Even though track sounds hard, it's not once you put your mind to it. You don't regret doing it later. That's why many people, including me, enjoy track. As long as you take it seriously, you'll do just fine."}

They believe people can get hurt, hurt others, or get too attached to their phones and avoid socializing. Others think it's good because it can help them. \n\nTechnology can help people do more things. For example, people can pay their bills on their phone instead of driving far and wasting time and money. Some people prefer going out, but others like using their phone. Another example is that some people have a hard time finding a babysitter. They can go online, find one, and go to work feeling happy with their choice.\n\nPeople can also use technology to connect with their siblings who live far away. They can talk, hang out, and get to know each other better again. Some people prefer talking online instead of traveling. This way, they don't have to worry about getting into a car accident or getting lost. People can connect better even if they live far apart.\n\nWhat if you're a new driver and don't know where to go to meet your friends out of town? You can use your phone to get to your destination. People can use a map or their phone to get where they want to go, which is very helpful.

{"text_id_kaggle": "38FD642A3223", "output_essay": "I believe that working in a group is better than working alone. There are many advantages to group work, and I have several reasons to support my idea. \n\nFirst, group work helps us manage our time more efficiently. When we work together, we can complete tasks faster because we can share ideas and help each other. We can also solve problems more quickly because we have more people thinking about the solution.\n\nMy second reason is that group work helps us solve problems in a better way. When we work together, we bring different ideas and perspectives to the table. By combining our ideas, we can come up with a better solution. We can also learn from each other and see our weaknesses, which helps us improve.\n\nThird, group work helps us connect with others and improve our social skills. We can ask each other questions and learn from each other's strengths. We can also improve our communication skills by talking to each other. When we work together, we are more motivated to complete our tasks because we have someone to encourage us.\n\nIn conclusion, I think group work is very important. We can accomplish more when we work together than when we work alone. For example, one person cannot clean a whole football field, but a group of people can do it quickly. So, I highly recommend that we work together to achieve our goals."}

Let's think about it. If we just sit around doing nothing, we'll never get what we want. We need to set goals and work hard to achieve them. For example, my goal is to pass my SOLs. If I don't study, I won't pass. Students want to graduate, but they need to work hard to make it happen. If we don't try, things won't happen the way we want them to.\n\nWhat will you do in life if you don't achieve your goals? Won't you even try? Everyone has something they want to achieve. It takes time, but the more we achieve, the more successful we can be.\n\nI still think it's a good idea to keep doing things. It can help us when we're older. It's amazing how much we can do if we're always doing something - it can make us happy. Thomas Jefferson wrote about how great it is to achieve a lot if we're always doing something.

{"text_id_kaggle": "707127A44212", "output_essay": "The school board wants to add an hour and a half to each school day, but I strongly disagree. There are three main reasons why.\n\nFirst, adding extra time would make everyone stressed. Teachers and students just want to go home after a long day. If they can't go home at the usual time, they'll feel anxious. Even parents might feel stressed because their kids are still at school and not at home with them.\n\nSecond, what would teachers do with the extra time? They plan their work for the regular class period, but adding more time is hard. They won't know what to do with the extra time. A regular school day is better because it's already planned out.\n\nThird, everyone would be very tired after a long school day. Students with homework might forget because they'll be too tired to do it. This could cause good students to do poorly and even fail classes. A regular school day is better because it doesn't make people too tired.\n\nOverall, a short but educational school day is better than a longer one. Students and teachers would lose time with their families and have stressed minds instead of calm ones. Regular school days are better than longer ones."}

Some think being true to oneself is key, while others believe people need help making decisions. Those who make their own decisions are ready for life and know what it means to them because they're strong, independent, and confident.\n\nFirst, people who make their own decisions can shape their future and make it happen. For example, when I came to America, my mom told me I needed to work hard to succeed and help my family back in Africa. Being strong is tough, especially with social media where people can hurt others without realizing the impact.\n\nSecond, when you make your own decisions, you're independent and make choices on your own every day. Not everyone can do this. Independent people know how hard they need to work to be better every day. For me, being independent isn't easy, and I work hard at it every day. My dad always said I need to be independent because nobody will always be there to help or advise me.\n\nThird, to be strong and independent, you need to be confident first. You can't do it without believing in yourself. Confidence isn't easy to find, but it's key. For example, back in my country, I was a top student because I was confident and worked hard. My parents wanted to see my good grades.\n\nSome people think being strong, independent, and confident is easy, but it's not. Many people don't value self-reliance, which means being strong, independent, and confident is really hard work. People should think about their future and work hard on their own so they can be strong, independent, and confident in the future."}

No matter how hard we try, we can't avoid working with others or alone. Working in a group helps us step out of our comfort zone, improves our communication skills, and teaches us about teamwork.\n\nWhen we work with others, we can overcome our fears and try new things. Not everyone is outgoing, and some people don't like trying new things. But when we work with a group, we have to step out of our comfort zone. Our teammates can help us feel comfortable by being friendly and respectful. We can learn a lot about ourselves and others when we work together.\n\nWorking in a group also improves our communication skills. Communication is essential in life, whether it's face-to-face or online. When we work in a group, we have to talk to each other to get things done. This can be hard at first, but it gets easier with practice. We can learn a lot about others when we talk to them.\n\nFinally, working in a group teaches us about teamwork. When we work together, we share the workload and help each other out. This can be hard for people who are used to working alone, but it's important to remember that we're not alone. We have to consider others' feelings and opinions too. Teamwork teaches us to be patient and sacrifice for the good of the group.\n\nSome people think that working alone is better because it makes us independent. But being independent doesn't mean we can't work with others. We can still have our own thoughts and feelings while working with a group. Working with others doesn't mean we're not independent; it means we're willing to learn from others and work together.\n\nIn conclusion, working in a group is beneficial because it helps us improve our communication skills, step out of our comfort zone, and learn about teamwork.

Yes, there are other ways, such as telling people to do good things and guiding them towards a better future. For example, if I care about my friend, I will not let her do bad things or be a bad influence on others. By doing this, I am being a good influence on her and others.\n\nSome people do not care about being a good influence. They only care about looking good for themselves, not for others. They do not care if they are being a bad influence on others, including kids.\n\nMany people in this generation do not care about being a good influence. We can find bad influences everywhere.

People are usually active because they work or do activities. It's popular to move around because we learn new things and do new things. More people are learning by traveling and joining activities.\n\nWhen people travel, they learn about animals, food, culture, and more. It's good to move around because we understand the world better and learn how it works. Many people have gardens and need to be active to take care of them.

For example, I decide to play soccer with friends or go for a walk to clear my head. Sometimes, I even help my little brother make decisions, like telling him to stop playing video games and do his homework.\n\nSecond, being self-reliant means relying on your own judgment to solve problems and make decisions. It helps you know what to do in any situation. You can solve problems easily because you trust yourself to think carefully. For example, I studied hard for a math test and didn't ask my friends for help. I believed in myself, and I passed the test with a great score.\n\nLastly, people who rely on themselves make good life choices and work hard for their goals. They don't let others make decisions for them. It's good to make your own decisions because you follow your own plan, not someone else's. For example, I was told to write a story, but someone offered to do it for me. I said no and did it myself. I followed my own plan and finished my story.

Inactivity is not always good for people.\n\nOn the other hand, sometimes not doing anything can make us feel more relaxed, with less pressure, and more free.\n\nFirst, if we don't take responsibilities, we'll never learn new things. For example, if you like feeling free without responsibilities, and someone needs your help with something important, you might not be able to help because you don't know what to do. You might feel bad, and the other person might feel bad too. Not knowing what to do is your mistake because you never took responsibilities. If we do things in life, we'll learn to do new things and be more responsible. Doing things is always good for everyone. In the end, everything we've learned will help us.\n\nSecond, it's always good for us to do good things that help others and make us feel satisfied. Inactivity doesn't help us much, and it can't make others happy. There are many reasons why it's good for ourselves and others to do good things. One reason is that when you help or give something, you also give a smile. Another reason is that when you help your family or do something for them, you make them happy. You can make them happy by doing small or big things. For example, helping at home, helping your children with homework, or doing other things. Doing something always makes you and others happy. One last reason is that when you help people who need it, you fill them with happiness as you fill yourself too. These little things can fill your life with satisfaction as you fill others.\n\nAlthough being active is good, sometimes we also need our time to feel free, feel at peace, without responsibilities. This happens with everyone - all people sometimes want to have their days out of the routine. Inactivity can also be good for people. For example, we all sometimes want to feel free, but because of our responsibilities, we can't always have time for ourselves. This leads us to feel stressed and sometimes annoyed at everything. Not doing anything can also help us feel good.\n\nBased on this, I believe that both doing things and being inactive can be good for us. I might prefer doing something, but we also have to know how to handle it. No matter what we do, we can never forget about ourselves. We always have to find a balance between doing things and taking time for ourselves to make others happy, help them, and feel free and happy.

This is not good for kids.\n\nI think technology is bad for kids. They need to read books or play with toys that don't hurt their eyes. Now, many kids need glasses to see clearly every day because they use technology too much.\n\nOne reason is that kids need to play outside because they're young and can't spend too much time on phones.

We need less technology because it affects our brains and eyes. This affects people's ability to talk to each other, as they prefer to text or watch videos instead of talking face-to-face. For example, my aunt has no time for her son because she's always on her phone, working and talking to others.\n\nSome people say that technology is bad because it affects many people, making them achieve nothing in life. They have nothing to do, no work, and only have their phones, which affect their relationships with family and friends. Technology is affecting people; it's not good. You have technology, but it affects your dreams and makes you lose friends who don't want to go to the store.\n\nThe question is whether people's use of technology is bad for kids, making them play games more and go outside less. This is not good for kids. They need to achieve their goals in life, and you need to know that technology affects many people. You need time for your work, and you need to limit your technology use to one hour a day, which is good. This affects all people in different countries, and students are not paying attention in classes because of too much technology use, which affects their lives. They no longer want to achieve their dreams, and later they regret not achieving their goals."}

Exploring new interests, like a specific career, at a young age and putting all my ideas together is important. If we don't think about what we want, it won't work out. If we don't think about a career at a young age, it might not work out. If students don't take advantage of the opportunities high school offers, they'll never start a professional career and won't get what they want.\n\nChoosing a specific career at a young age is a good idea. It helps develop interest and makes students work hard to achieve their goals. This can make students successful in the future. Students who take advantage of opportunities, no matter how young they are, will be better prepared for the future. Thinking about a career at a young age doesn't hurt; it's a chance for students to create a good life for themselves and their families.\n\nPutting ideas together is important. First, students should think about their own security and the families who need help. Working hard to make parents happy doesn't mean parents think they're wasting time on education. Making good plans helps people think more clearly and make good decisions about their career. Planning ahead helps make good decisions. Giving families a good life helps them have access to basic needs like medicine, food, and education.\n\nHaving a professional job makes families feel safe. Students with good jobs can provide for their families and ensure they have a place to live, medicine, and education. A career can also inspire our children to pursue higher education and make them safe. For these reasons, we should talk about careers at a young age and not let opportunities slip away.\n\nThinking ahead is the key to success.

One reason is that they would have more time to finish their work without feeling rushed. With an extra hour, they can complete their assignments without pressure. Another reason is that they can finish their homework in class and have free time at home. Sometimes, teachers give a lot of homework, and students spend the whole day doing it. They can't relax or do other things. Adding an hour to school would give them more free time. Some students don't like being at home because it's boring. If the school day is longer, they can do things they enjoy and feel happier. They can just go home to sleep and get ready for the next day. I think adding an hour to school would be good for students. They might not like being in school, but they don't like being at home either. If school can be made fun and beneficial, students will be okay with it, even if the day is longer. School is for work, but if teachers make it fun, students will love being there every day, even with a longer day. They will love being in class every day, and that's why I think adding hours to school would benefit students a lot."}

As humans, we have the ability to learn from our experiences, both good and bad. We can learn from our mistakes, like getting in trouble for stealing or breaking the law, and use those experiences to become better people.\n\nSchools should take students on field trips to poor neighborhoods where there is crime, trash, and homelessness. This can show students what can happen if they don't take their education seriously. By seeing people living in bad conditions, students will understand that their lives can change for the worse at any moment. This can motivate them to study hard and prepare for a better future.\n\nI believe people can change their lives in many ways. For example, being in prison can be a wake-up call. Prison can be a place where people can learn and make positive changes. Many prisons offer education programs that can help people prepare for life after release. Prison can teach people that committing crimes is not worth it and that they should make better choices.\n\nAnother way to influence people is by showing them examples of people who are disabled but still live fulfilling lives. This can teach people to appreciate what they have and not complain about their circumstances. It can also show them that they can still achieve their goals even with disabilities.\n\nExamples of life behavior are not the only way to influence people.

Those who make their own decisions learn from their experiences. However, seeking guidance from experts helps many people avoid wrong choices. Talking to someone with experience helps people understand if their choice is good or not.\n\nIt's better to seek guidance than to follow your own instincts. Experts have similar experiences and can share their knowledge. They can help you see the advantages and disadvantages of your choice. This can prevent you from making a decision you're not sure about.\n\nSeeking guidance from an expert can prevent wrong decisions. People often don't know what they want to do, so they act on impulse. For example, a friend of mine wanted to drop out of high school. She was unsure, so I told her to talk to a guidance counselor. The counselor helped her see that dropping out wouldn't be good for her future. Just talking to someone with experience can help prevent a wrong decision.\n\nSome people prefer to make their own choices. They want to learn from their experiences, whether good or bad. They believe that every experience is unique and won't always turn out the same. Another friend of mine dropped out of high school without seeking guidance. She learned from her choice and eventually started her own business. She's happy with her decision.\n\nIn conclusion, whether you make your own choice or seek guidance, you'll learn and benefit from your decision.

However, I think it's a bad idea.\n\nAs a student, I change my mind almost every day. For example, when I'm in the cafeteria, it's hard to choose what I want to eat.

Without it, we wouldn't have things like shoes, clothes, and homes. Everything would be the same, and people would probably dress alike. For example, designers use their imagination to create different types of clothes and shoes. Imagination is especially important today because it helps us come up with new ideas when we're unsure. If you have a project to do and don't know what to write, you need to use your imagination. If teachers don't know what to teach, they need to use their imagination too.\n\nIn conclusion, I think imagination is more important than knowledge because it helps us in many ways. When we use our imagination, we can learn more and come up with new ideas when we're stuck. That's why I believe imagination is more important than knowledge. It's also important for our future because it can help us when we need it."}

When you want something, it doesn't matter how old you are or what you look like. What matters is what you want in your life. For example, I want to be a businesswoman in the future, but my family doesn't want me to. However, I chose to follow my dream because it's my life. \n\nWhen you want something, the best way to get it is to try hard and do everything to get it. Trying is the key to success. If you don't try, you can't say you can do it because you didn't even try. \n\nIn my country, I used to think that people are born with what they have and that's it. I thought men were the only ones who could work and do what they want. Women were limited to staying at home, cleaning, and taking care of children. But when I came to the US, I realized that women can do what they want too. Now, I'm trying to achieve everything I want in my life, including the job I want and the life I want. \n\nIf I were still in my country, I know I wouldn't be able to do what I want because I don't have the same freedom. I believe that being born poor is not your fault, but dying poor is because you didn't try to change your life. You have to try in life to get what you want and need. You should never give up. When you fail, try again because you'll learn something new each time. Life is hard if you don't try to get what you want. \n\nTrying is like taking a test in school. If you study, you'll get good grades. If you don't, you won't. It's all about making choices. If you want good grades, you study. If you don't, you don't. Life is the same. If you try, you'll get what you want. If you don't, you won't. \n\nLife is about trying and being happy. Every time, try to be happy and do things that make you happy. When you're happy, you can do everything in a good way. So, the first thing I try to do in my life is to be happy.

{"text_id_kaggle": "AF7DB5739529", "output_essay": "Technology Reality\n\nTechnology helps us a lot. It makes things easier, but is it really helping or hurting us? Technology helps us in many ways, but it's also keeping us apart from each other.\n\nIt's separating us from our family, friends, and even nature. The benefits of technology are huge. We can play video games, buy things online, and more. However, it's keeping us away from each other. Technology affects us in many ways.\n\nSometimes, people separate themselves from their family because of technology. For example, I have a cousin who played video games all the time. His family was worried about him, but he never tried to talk to them. One time, his family wasn't at home. He called them and found out they were at the hospital. His grandmother was dying, but he didn't even notice because he was playing video games all day. There's another similar case. A friend of mine was always locked in his bedroom. His family thought he was just on his computer. He committed suicide at 16 after being bullied at school. Technology keeps us away from our own family.\n\nFriends are a big part of our lives, but technology isn't helping us get closer to them. For example, I used to play a game called Call of Duty. I played with people online, whom I called friends, even though I had never seen them in real life. I was isolating myself from my friends at school. When I had to sell my computer, I looked for my friends at school, but some weren't there for me anymore because I kept myself away from them. Another example is when my friends and I were on a soccer team. We started playing a new video game, and we all started missing practice because of it. Our families were expecting us to win the tournament, but we couldn't because we missed practice. Video games can ruin friendships and even a person's life.\n\nWe're not paying attention to other people and our planet. We're not taking care of the earth because of technology. For example, ocean animals are dying because we're not recycling and we're throwing trash into the ocean. Many animals are dying because we don't focus on talking to each other and going out to see what's happening. As long as we're good at home with our computers or cellphones, we don't care about anything else. Another example is new food industries. They process our food and make it easier to buy, but they don't care about nature. They just want to have the best technology, even if it hurts the earth. Nature is being affected the most, and we don't pay attention to it.\n\nIn fact, technology helps us in many ways, but it's keeping us apart from each other, isolating us from our family, friends, and even nature. Families are being broken up because children isolate from their parents because they're focused on video games and other things. Friendships are being destroyed because kids don't go out and play with their friends. The earth is being damaged, and we're not paying attention to it. All this technology is isolating us from each other and the outside world, and it's not affecting us in a good way. We should make a change."}
{"text_id_kaggle": "01732789E9C5", "output_essay": "Technology is like a magnet to humans. Many people think that doing things online is the best way to feel grown up. In my opinion, using technology to meet our needs stops us from showing our personal skills to the world. There are three ways technology affects people's lives: mentally, financially, and by stopping us from exploring our environment.\n\nNot shopping in person is hurting the economy. People are using online shopping sites like Amazon, eBay, and Wish. This is taking business away from malls and small shopping centers. Today, most people shop online, which means fewer people are getting jobs in stores. For example, I used to work at a Nike store, but the business slowed down because Amazon was taking over. This also affects the store owners who are losing their jobs, which they worked hard to get. So, people should shop at stores.\n\nNot talking to people can affect us mentally. Playing video games too much can cause brain damage. Video games are a way technology is expanding, and it can hurt people's mental health. Using too much technology can even cause cancer. Also, video games can hurt our eyes. For instance, I'm addicted to games that made my eyes weak. When I went to the doctor, he prescribed glasses for me. On the other hand, we should play sports like soccer, basketball, and football to avoid these problems.\n\nNot going to the library and checking out books online stops us from exploring. Libraries are good for the environment, and they provide a space to communicate and share ideas. For example, I work at a library, and people check out books online, but they don't see the events we have. It's not just libraries; people also don't visit museums and instead use technology to learn about history. People should visit museums because seeing historic places in person is more realistic and better.\n\nOverall, technology stops us from using our skills, being strong, and helping our society. Online stores like Amazon are taking over the economy that malls have. Not talking to people can cause problems like weak eyes, cancer, and other diseases. Electronics can't replace real museums or tours, so we need to go out and explore. That's why we need human contact throughout our lives, because technology is taking over."}

{"text_id_kaggle": "D2BBB58DE3A4", "output_essay": "When you face trouble or something bad happens, you often look for help from someone far away. But if you stop and look back, you'll see someone special behind you. That someone is your parent, teacher, sister, brother, or friend, always ready to help when you need them. So, when making important decisions, you should ask experts and authorities for guidance. They have a lot of experience and knowledge that can help you succeed.\n\nFirstly, experts and authorities have more experience than you. They've lived longer and done many things before you were born. They've gone through good and bad times, and what they've done is often worse than what you've done. For example, if you burn French toast and set the kitchen on fire, you might not know how to put it out. But someone with experience, like a parent or the fire department, can help you fix it. Even if you know how to fix it, you can still make mistakes and make things worse. Solving problems requires experience, not just knowledge.\n\nNext, experts and authorities have steady knowledge. They've studied and done many things you don't know. For example, if you have English homework and don't know how to do it, you can ask your parent or teacher for help. They've studied and have knowledge about it, so they can explain and teach you how to do it. If you try to do it alone, it might take longer and you might make mistakes.\n\nAnother reason to seek guidance is that working with others can help you succeed. In class, you often work with a partner or in a group. If you notice, you'll see that working with others is better than working alone. When you work alone, your answers are just your opinion, which might be wrong or right. But when you work with others, you get more opinions and can make better decisions.\n\nIn conclusion, people should ask experts and authorities for guidance on important matters. They can give you the best advice to make decisions. They've made mistakes and fixed them, so they know how to help you. They have steady knowledge, and working with them can make you stronger and better. Don't be afraid to ask for help when you need it. It can help you make good decisions and overcome life's challenges."}

I heard about your plan to extend the school day, and I'm concerned about how students will react. I understand you want to add one and a half hours to school each day, but I think this will have a bad effect on students. Many students who participate in after-school activities will have less time to do their homework and catch up on missing assignments. They may feel pressured to learn a lot of material every day, which could make them fall behind. Students will also struggle to balance school work and other daily activities.\n\nStudents who play sports or join clubs will have a hard time finishing their homework because they'll have less time. They'll attend school for more than eight hours, then go to sports or clubs, and this could cause problems. They won't have as much time as others to finish their homework, which could lower their grades. Students also want free time to spend with their families or friends, but this might be hard to find with their busy schedules. Not having enough free time could make students rush to finish their assignments, leading to sleep deprivation. This could cause concentration problems and make it hard for them to stay awake during school. Students shouldn't have to deal with stress or struggle to make time for other activities.\n\nSimilarly, students may feel pressured to learn too much material, which could lower their grades. Research at Generic_School shows that longer school days mean more lessons are added daily. Teachers might add an extra lesson every day, making the course too fast for students to keep up. If students learn too much in one day, they might struggle to understand what's being taught and fall behind. If they fall behind, they might struggle to catch up on new material, leading to stress. Teachers could also be affected by students struggling to catch up, slowing down their lesson plans. This would mean students and teachers aren't covering material at the right time.\n\nLikewise, students and teachers will feel more pressure balancing work and daily activities. Teachers might struggle to create lesson plans, update grades, and have personal free time. Students might struggle to make plans with their families, finish school work on time, and attend extracurricular activities. This could put students in a stressful position, making them think about quitting a sport or activity. Teachers could also be negatively affected, having to continue lessons without time to help struggling students. Students and teachers shouldn't have to choose between helping or continuing with their work, which could lead to lower grades and struggling teachers.\n\nIn conclusion, adding one and a half hours to the school day will negatively affect students and teachers. Students who participate in sports or clubs will have less time to do their work, students will feel pressured to learn too much material, and students and teachers will feel more pressure balancing school work and free time. All these factors will create a negative environment for everyone in the school. I hope you'll consider my views for the benefit of the students.\n\nSincerely,\n\nGeneric_Name\n\nGeneric_School"}

It could be the key to making all students do better!\n\nI think having a homework club after school is a great idea. It can help anyone who needs it, and I'm sure students will take advantage of it. Homework can be hard and takes a lot of time. Having teachers and students willing to help would make everything more comfortable. Students could ask for help when they need it, and teachers would be there to teach them. I think every school should have this.\n\nThere are many ways to make students enjoy the club. First, teachers could teach students subjects they didn't understand and help them with their homework. Sometimes students don't turn in their homework because they didn't understand the subject. Having teachers teach them patiently could make a big difference. Another way is to provide snacks. Students get hungry after school, so having snacks would be a nice reward.\n\nHomework can be tiring. Some students get a lot of homework every day, and they need a break. The club could plan activities like doing homework at the park, where students can feel more peaceful. Students will appreciate it if they can sometimes get out of the school environment. Doing homework in a new place could make it more fun. Having motivation and students sharing ideas could make the club more open to new things.\n\nThere are many ways to get people to do their homework. Having teachers and students helping will make a big difference. With a lot of homework, but also having fun activities, everything will be easier.

It can also help them find out which subject they need help with. Whatever they need to work on, it will help them overall.\n\nMy first reason is that students can get ahead of others. Students who don't stay after school will fall behind because they don't make an effort to get help or finish their work. If students don't do well in class or turn in their work on time, they will fail. But if they stay after school, they will be okay.\n\nMy second reason is that it can help students get better grades. It doesn't matter which class, as long as they do their work, they can get good grades. If they don't turn in their homework or class work, they will fail. But if they stay after school, they will be fine.\n\nMy third reason is that it can help students feel confident about their work. When they fail a test or need help, staying after school is a good way to boost their confidence.\n\nIn conclusion, having students stay after school for help or to finish their work is a good idea. They can feel fresh and ready to go. They don't need to worry about getting help as long as they don't need it, and they will be fine. Those are my three reasons, and if I were you, I would stay after school."}

Technology makes phones, computers, and tablets, among other things. It even lets people know the news without watching TV.

Emerson thinks that growing comes from doing the same thing or experiencing it again. \n\nLearning from the same experiences can help you become better. Being in the same situation again can make you see things differently and learn from it. But it depends on the person and how they act. \n\nSome people think Emerson's statement is not 100% effective. They think doing the same thing over and over is a waste of time. But Emerson's message is to tell people that if they're strong and can control themselves, they can become better and grow. \n\nMastering an experience can help people solve problems easier and help others. It's not always about wasting time. Becoming a better person is about learning from the same experiences over and over. \n\nMany people don't care about what they're going through. They ignore their experiences, but not everyone does this. For example, I've been in hard situations twice, and it made me better.

Not everyone thinks the same way, but Emerson's statement is like a motivation to keep going and be strong. \n\nSome people think it's nice to repeat the same experience because it makes them feel they can get better. Going beyond what you know can make you grow more. \n\nSome people take situations better than others because they know how things work. Changing by small things makes some people become different and more reasonable. \n\nThe disagreement is that some people don't know what they can become. They think going beyond their experiences is a waste of time. They have no idea how good they can become by just going beyond. \n\nEmerson's point was to show people how to change and how good it is to go beyond the same experience. Many people have changed because of this statement. They've learned many things from going beyond and seen how better they've become. \n\nMy agreement is that doing things beyond what you know can make you a better person, no matter what situation you're in.

Self-esteem is what gives us the energy and confidence to do better. But where does it come from? Some people think praise can build self-esteem. However, the only way to get true self-esteem is by achieving something because it shows us what we can do and makes us want to work harder.\n\nTrue self-esteem comes from achieving something because it shows us what we can do. For example, my younger sister loves science and participated in her school's science fair two years ago. She came in fifth place and was very upset. She didn't listen to her teachers who tried to comfort her. The next year, she worked hard and prepared well. She did a project on volcanoes, researched a lot, and even made a model of a volcano. She came in second place and went to the regional level. After she proved herself, she wanted to try even harder topics the next year. A study by students at the University of Virginia showed that when students achieve something they want, they become more confident and try harder.\n\nTrue self-esteem comes from achieving something because it makes us want to work harder. For example, in chemistry class, we played a game to prepare for a big test. I was leading the game, and my teacher and friends were praising me. I got too confident and started to slack off. I eventually fell behind and came in ninth place. In the next round, I focused on getting the answers right and didn't listen to anyone. I came in first place again with a new high score. In 2014, some students from UCLA did an experiment. They took a test with easy questions and were divided into two groups. One group was praised for their good work, while the other group wasn't. The next week, they took a harder test. The results showed that the group that wasn't praised did 40% better, while the praised group did 30% worse. The group that was praised got too confident and slacked off, while the other group worked harder. Our achievements give us a boost in self-esteem and make us want to work harder.\n\nAchievement is the only way to get true self-esteem. It shows us what we can do and makes us want to work harder. Some people think praising our work can build self-esteem, even if it's not our best effort. However, praising bad work makes us lazy and lowers our standards.

Keep it up, and you'll be a better person in the future.\n\nThe first reason I think it's important to never give up is the future. You'll be able to say, 'It wasn't easy, but I did it.' In the future, you'll need a diploma to get a good job. I'll do everything to graduate and make my family proud. I learn every day to be a better person and get what I want. I'm someone who loves life and thinks that keeping going is better than giving up. I learned that if you work for what you want, you'll get it no matter what others say.\n\nThe second reason is family. I'll do everything to get a good job to help my family. My family works hard every day to give me a better life. Family is always there for you when you need them. They'll say, 'It was hard, right?' but now look at you. Now you're a professional doctor. I'm glad to have you as my daughter. My life wasn't easy in my country, but now look at me - I'm here in the U.S., preparing myself for a better future.\n\nThe third reason is money. Money is important for buying what you want, but for me, it's important because many people in the world don't have money to buy food, clothes, or pay rent. When I came to the U.S., I didn't have any clothes. My life was hard because everyone looked at me. When I went to middle school, they bullied me because I didn't understand what they were saying. Then I focused on learning the language, and every day I watched English videos. Then I got a diploma for learning the language in three months.\n\nIn conclusion, these are my plans for my future. I shared some parts of my life with you. Those are some lessons I learned. So, please, never give up - keep it simple. Life will teach you a lot. Life is good; don't let anyone tell you what to do. Don't be lazy; work harder because someone else will work harder than you. Keep it up - you can do it. If you're not, remember my lessons."}

They would have time to do their school work and wouldn't worry about turning it in late.\n\nAnother reason is that students would have more free time. Who doesn't like free time? With free time, you can get more things done. You could do extra work for extra credit or go on an adventure. You could spend time with family or friends, or go to a school event. You wouldn't have to worry about getting things done because you would already have done them.\n\nOverall, I believe Thomas Jefferson was right.

They can also prepare for upcoming tests.\n\nFirst, students can get extra help from teachers. If some students can't focus in class, they can work alone with teachers after school without distractions.

The club welcomes all students who need help with homework or understanding a subject, like Math, Science, Language Arts, or History. The club helps with these classes.\n\nSome students don't pay attention in class. They get distracted by their friends or toys they bring to school. These distractions make it hard for them to focus and can also disturb other students. The after-school homework club helps these students catch up on missing homework and turn it in on time.\n\nIf students attend the club regularly to get help with their homework, they might start to like it. They'll see their grades going up, and they'll get better at a subject they didn't like at first. They might say that the subject was hard for them before, but now it's not. They might even say that they thought it was hard because they didn't listen to the teacher.\n\nI think all schools should have an after-school homework club. Many students need help understanding something in class or need help with homework. The club helps students with missing homework or understanding a subject. It also helps students be more organized with their homework and other things, like getting ready for class and bringing a pencil.\n\nHaving an after-school homework club in schools prepares students for anything that comes their way. It helps them turn in homework on time and like a subject they didn't like before. The club helps students enjoy learning new things in every class. It's a great way to help students get good grades and like every class they have. If they have good grades, they can become important people in the world."}
{"text_id_kaggle": "D4B9293426B6", "output_essay": "Have you ever wondered what's next in life? At some point, we all think about it. Growing up, kids without plans get confused about their future. To avoid this, schools offer opportunities for students to explore careers while they're still young. Some people might think it's a bad idea to guide students towards a specific career at a young age, but it's actually better for them to commit to a career early on.\n\nOne reason is that students have a fresh idea of what their future career will be like. For example, my dad was passionate about engineering in high school. He took an engineering course and learned to build robots, program them, and make them work. Later, he went to college and became an expert in engineering and robotics. He had a better understanding of his subject than his classmates because of his early experience.\n\nAnother reason is that students learn the basics of their career early on. For instance, Will Smith took a cinematography class in middle school and high school, where he played different roles. This helped him when he attended acting school later. He already knew how to handle certain roles, which made it easier for him.\n\nWhen students commit to a career early, they also learn what to do and what not to do in their profession. For example, I want to be a writer, so I took a creative writing class. I learned about formal and informal letters and how to write a book. This experience has already shown me the basics of writing. Similarly, Cristiano Ronaldo started playing soccer in school and learned the basics, which helped him become one of the best soccer players in the world.\n\nSome people might argue that students are not mature enough to commit to a career at a young age, but it's better for them to start early because they gain more experience. For example, Frida Kahlo started taking art classes at the age of ten and learned about color combination and how to express her emotions through painting. This early experience helped her become one of the best artists in the world.\n\nIn conclusion, it's better for students to explore careers while they're still young and open to learning. It helps them have a clear idea of their future and gain more experience than others. So, let's focus on what we need to do to achieve our goals and not worry about what's next."}

Some people don't use their phones because they're busy with work and family. They're not on their phones much. But some people don't have phones or can't use them.

But this doesn't solve anything. The person will get mad and fight back. It makes things worse.\n\nPeople should not use technology too much. It causes problems and fights. People can say mean things to make others angry. Some people get jealous when others are happy. They want to make them sad because it makes them happy.\n\nTechnology affects people's lives a lot. It's everywhere, and it makes us focus on our phones instead of what's around us. This is bad because we need to focus on what's in front of us, not our phones.

Some people travel to other countries or states in the US because they don't like the cold and prefer hot places. I disagree with teachers who think there should be year-round schools with short breaks. We already study for 8-9 months, so why do they want more time to study?\n\nIf they want a longer winter, how can we enjoy it? In winter, there's snow, it's too cold, and we just stay at home and get stressed. I prefer a longer summer break because we can play sports, go to the beach, and have barbecues.\n\nPlaying sports is good for our bodies, and we can do it in summer. We can play soccer, baseball, and run with our friends. Soccer is a sport we can play in summer, and we can even make a team and compete with others. If you like soccer, you might even get to play for a big team like Barcelona or Real Madrid. Playing sports is also good for our health because we're not stuck to our phones, and we can make new friends.\n\nAnother good thing about summer is going to the beach with our families. We can enjoy the sun, sand, and even watch sharks swim in the sea. If we have money, we can travel to other countries and find coconuts or palm trees. We can relax and forget our problems for a while. That's why I want a longer summer - I want to forget my worries and come back to school feeling fresh.\n\nI also love cooking outside in summer. We call it Carne Asada, or barbecue. We need a clear sky to cook, so it's hard to do in winter when it's cold. I prefer a longer summer so I can cook with my friends and family. We can even go to the park and cook there. It's beautiful when we do this because we can share stories and dance to music we like.\n\nSummer is a time when most people can do many things and enjoy their families and friends. In winter, we're stuck at home watching TV or playing video games. I don't like that. I like to make the most of my youth, explore, and make new friends. That's why I prefer a longer summer. If we only get 3-4 weeks, I won't be able to do anything, and I'll be bored. Summer is important because it's when we can have fun and prepare for winter."}

He meant that you don't have to be a genius to know everything. Imagination helps you think differently and come up with new ideas. Without imagination, knowing everything would be boring and uncreative.\n\nImagination lets you think outside the box. For example, if you're struggling to remember a formula for homework, you can use your imagination to think of a way to remember it, like making a song out of it. Knowledge has its good and bad points. On the good side, it helps you answer questions quickly. On the bad side, it can make you overthink and get a headache. Steve Jobs, the founder of Apple, is a great example of someone who used both knowledge and imagination to succeed.\n\nAlbert Einstein wasn't a good student when he was young, but he didn't let that stop him. He became a great scientist and got a Ph.D. in Physics. Imagination can help you in many ways, like when you're stressed out and need to think of something else to calm down.\n\nIn conclusion, imagination is important to think differently and come up with new ideas. I agree with Albert Einstein that imagination is more important than knowledge. We all think differently, but we need both knowledge and imagination to think positively and solve problems. Imagination is the key to success in life."}

They can come after school and get help from teachers or volunteers. This would be a great way for students to do well in school.\n\nThe program would work because students would come to learn what they don't know. They would get help and finish their homework. To make students feel comfortable, we can use big bean bags instead of chairs. This would make them want to come to the program. They sit on hard chairs all day, so they would like the bean bags. To keep students coming, we can give out small gifts and prizes.\n\nIn conclusion, this after-school program is a great idea. It offers a lot of help, and students can win prizes. Students can improve a lot and make their parents proud. They would feel comfortable in the program because of the bean bags. The program can make a big difference."}

{"text_id_kaggle": "CDDE5EFE4F60", "output_essay": "People who value independence think it means relying on themselves and making their own decisions.\n\nFirst, independence means using your own skills and making your own choices. You should trust your own feelings and make decisions based on them. Many people offer advice, and most of it is good. If you listen to good advice, you can avoid problems. It's helpful to have someone you can trust, like an older person who can give you advice or warn you about bad choices. Everyone thinks differently, and not everyone takes advice. Some people don't want to listen to good advice.\n\nSecond, I need people I can trust, and I like to talk to them about what I've done or what I think. Not all friends are good friends. Some friends might want to see you fail. That's why I don't trust some people - they might want to do bad things. So, I often walk to school or go out alone. Having many friends is not the same as having someone who can give you good advice. Some advice I've received has been helpful, and that's why I'm where I am today. But it's not always good to rely on others; some people might not want what's best for you.\n\nLastly, what you think and what others do matters. Some people take advice, while others don't and just do what they want. Good advice is important for your life. You need to make the most of your life. Why is it good to take advice? Because it can help you make good choices. If I see someone younger than me, I can give them advice, but if they're older than me, I can't, because they have more experience than me."}

But is everything you've done in the past good? Is your way of living the best way? What if everyone could do whatever they want? Or should people ask for help with important decisions?\n\nI think people should be able to do what they like, but they need to do it in a good way. People are free to hang out with friends, play sports, play music, and choose their career. For example, they can go to parties, play soccer or basketball, listen to their favorite music, and dance to it. They can also choose their job.\n\nHave you ever thought about your past actions? Have you ever fought with someone or taken something that doesn't belong to you? Should people be allowed to do those things? I think it's good that we have laws because they help us live better. Imagine if there were no laws; people would do whatever they want, and nobody would care.\n\nSo I think people should ask experts and authorities for help with important decisions because they can help us see if we're doing things right.

{"text_id_kaggle": "44FD30777ED7", "output_essay": "There are many ways to influence people around you. Everyone has their own way to do it. Some people influence others through their competitive actions, and some through their good behavior. But not all of these influences are effective. As Albert Schweitzer said, \"Example is not the main thing in influencing others; it is the only thing.\" The best way to inspire someone is to set a good example with your own behavior. You don't have to change who you are to be inspiring; you just need to behave with a positive attitude and feelings. This way, people can easily trust you.\n\nThe power to affect others lies in how you behave. Your behavior is your power, and it doesn't cost you anything to change a bad attitude to a good one. Behaving well can make your days more enjoyable. For example, simply saying \"Good morning\" to your classmates can help you make friends. On my first day in geometry class, I waved to someone I didn't know. The next day, she asked me some questions, and I tried to help her. As time passed, we became friends. Now she is my best friend. My cousin also saved someone's life by inspiring him. His classmate, who was addicted to cigarettes, became friends with him and learned from him. Eventually, he quit smoking and thanked my cousin for being a good friend.\n\nSome people think they can inspire others by changing their looks, but that's not true. If you have a good attitude, you can influence people and maybe even change their minds. Nowadays, plastic surgeries are very common. People think they can inspire others without knowing that being good has nothing to do with how you look. Only your heart can express itself through your behavior. For example, social media can inspire people quickly. Celebrities can post photos of themselves getting surgery, which can be appealing to their fans. But if they have someone with good behavior, they'll never think about that kind of thing.\n\nHaving good behavior can also help others trust you. Who can't trust someone who behaves well and has a positive attitude? As an inspiring person, you are in a position of trust. For example, it can be challenging for business owners to hire someone who doesn't behave well with staff or customers. It doesn't depend on how you look; it's just how you behave. If they find someone who inspires others, they'll hire them as soon as possible. People who inspire others are trustworthy. They don't do anything bad to others, they want the best for others, they don't lie, and they try to help people around them all the time. Anyone around you can believe in you.\n\nIn conclusion, the best way to inspire someone is by your own good behavior. You can influence people with your positive attitude and feelings, and people can trust you. Although others might argue that there are better ways to influence people, I still believe that your own behavior is the most important thing. You have a special attitude and feelings, and you are trustworthy. It's very important to understand how our own behaviors can impact people's lives around us."}

For example, if you don't like to work and are lazy, you won't have a job. If you don't work, you won't earn money to buy food. On the other hand, if you achieve recognition, you'll have more job opportunities and earn more money.

For example, McDonald's now has a machine that lets you order food yourself. Some people think this makes life easier, but it takes away opportunities for people to learn how to communicate with others. Jobs are meant to teach people how to interact with each other.

If we're not idle, we can become better people and have better jobs or even start our own businesses. But we need to work hard.\n\nSome people think that if you're idle, you'll never get anything. Others don't want to work with idle people because they're lazy and waste time.\n\nI think working with idle people is a problem because they don't do their work, and I have to do it for them.\n\nFor example, if I work in a restaurant and I'm idle, my coworkers won't want to work with me because I'm lazy and don't do my job.\n\nIf I'm not idle, I'll have more job opportunities and can become a better person.\n\nFor example, if I work as a bartender and I'm not lazy, I can become a manager if I work hard and focus on my job.\n\nIn conclusion, we don't have to be idle to get a good job and have better opportunities.

{"text_id_kaggle": "6E451C099E41", "output_essay": "Do people know what they want to be when they grow up at a young age? Do they know by the time they enter high school? Some people think kids should know what they want to be when they grow up at a young age. However, kids should not have that stress or pressure on them when entering high school. They should have the chance to play sports, do activities, or join clubs they like, instead of worrying about what classes to take for their career goals.\n\nIn some places, people think kids should know what career they want by the time they enter high school. But more people believe kids should not know until they are in high school. Kids are too young and immature to think about what they want to be when they grow up. They are not ready to make those decisions on their own. They should not have to worry about what they want to be at such a young age.\n\nSometimes, kids decide on one thing, but then they change their minds and choose something different. Some kids are indecisive and change their choices. Students should be able to pick many classes, not knowing what they want to be when they grow up. They should have the freedom to choose what they want to do in high school, without picking specific classes for their career goals. When choosing a career goal, it should be when they have time to think about it and are not stressed.\n\nSome kids have already decided on what they want to be when they grow up, but it's best if they don't decide yet. It limits their choices and options for careers. Having many options is better when they are in high school because students can explore what they want to pursue after. Choosing more than one is better, and narrowing down the options later. Pursuing a career goal is tough, but it's good to have time to decide what fits best.\n\nIn conclusion, some people believe kids should not know what they want to be when they grow up when they start high school. It limits their choices, limits career options, and makes students stressed about choosing a career at a young age. There is too much pressure in too little time. Students are indecisive when making tough decisions. Kids' minds are not yet developed at a young age.

This is because students can learn things like how to cook specific foods, how to keep their area clean, and find out if that's the job they really want.\n\nOne reason companies let students visit is to teach them how to cook specific foods. Some foods are hard to make, but students can start learning the basics at a young age. For example, when you cook something, you need to follow rules, like how much spice to add or how long to cook it.\n\nAnother reason is to help students learn how to keep their area clean. When students think about being a chef, they often forget to clean up. Local companies can teach them how to clean the kitchen, what clothes to wear, and what to bring to work.\n\nThe last reason is to help students find out if they really want to do a certain job. Students need to know all about a job and try it out to see if they like it. If they don't like parts of the job, like cleaning, they can change their mind and find a new job.\n\nIn conclusion, I think local companies should let students visit because it's good for kids to think about their future from a young age.

Active people do more because they work hard, reach their goals, and help others.\n\nSome people think it's okay to do nothing because they can rest. But active people get things done faster. It's clear that active people do more.\n\nFirst, people who work hard are important. They put effort into their work. For example, a person named John works at Sephora and wants to be a manager. He goes to work every day and never misses a day. One day, he got a promotion to be a manager. Another example is a person who wants to be an artist. He posted a video online and got a million views. Someone saw the video and asked him to be an artist. It's clear that people who work hard achieve more.\n\nNext, people who reach their goals are important. They work hard to get what they want. For example, a person has been going to the gym and eating healthy for a year to lose weight. One day, she reached her goal. Another example is a person who had bad grades but decided to study and do his work. He stayed after school every day and reached his goal. It's clear that people who want to achieve their goals must work hard.\n\nMost importantly, people who help others are important. Helping others can achieve more. For example, a person was walking home with food and saw a homeless family who hadn't eaten in days. He gave them his food. Another example is a person who saw kids bullying a little girl. She helped the little girl. It's clear that helping others can achieve more.\n\nIn conclusion, active people do more because they work hard, reach their goals, and help others.

And if we're not in school, we can go to the movies or do whatever we want. But when we're in school, we need to be serious and do our work. For example, we can do a science experiment together and talk about it. And if we could, I would want the whole gym to ourselves and just play all day. We can eat lots of snacks and just stay home and relax all day. Maybe we can also start a band and perform for people on the street, and maybe they can tip us some money. But we don't know how to play an instrument, so we need to practice a lot if we want to perform in front of people. We never know; we can become a famous band.\n\nI want friends who have my back, who don't judge me, and who are loyal. If I have those friends, I would live a perfect life and not have to look for people to meet because I already have the people I need.

You never know how someone might be until you meet them; they can be nice or mean. Sometimes friends can use you, maybe for your money or something else.

But something that would be really fun is to start a YouTube channel; I don't know what I would talk about, but if I do a good job, I can get money just by filming.

If we continue this trend, there will be more health problems than ever before. There are many ways to have fun outdoors, like hanging out with friends and playing games.\n\nFirst, hanging out with friends indoors can be fun, but it's even more fun outdoors. You can play games like Four Squares, Jump Ropes, and Twenty-Four Circles in parks or open spaces. These games are not only fun but also good for your mental and physical health. You get to breathe fresh air, think clearly, and exercise your body.\n\nSecondly, have you ever played games outdoors or visited a community park? Playing outdoor games like Steal the Flag, Soccer, and Football is more fun than playing them indoors. You need space to run around and enjoy the fresh air.\n\nIn conclusion, there are many fun activities you can do outdoors, like hanging out with friends and playing games.

I believe that getting advice from experts, people in charge, and wise individuals can help us make better decisions in life.\n\nOthers think we should rely on ourselves and trust our instincts. If we make a mistake, we can learn from it. However, people who only follow their instincts are often very stubborn and don't know much. If they make a mistake, they might make many more.\n\nExperts are very helpful, especially when we're new at something. For example, if a new employee named John is having trouble with the printer, he should ask his manager for help. The manager has a lot of experience and knows what to do. Another example is if John wants to play football, he should ask the coach to teach him. The coach is the best person to ask because he has played and taught football for a long time. So, we can trust experts when we need help because they have a lot of knowledge.\n\nPeople in charge, like parents or teachers, also play a big role in our lives. They can teach us how to be good people. For example, if John's dad is kind to everyone, John will learn to be kind too. On the other hand, if John's mom is a bad influence, John might become a bad person too. Our role models can teach us and guide us to be the best we can be.\n\nWise people can also guide us to make smart choices. For example, some people got tricked into sending money to a fake prince who promised to give them millions back. Wise people knew it was a scam and didn't fall for it. Another example is if John's grandma can tell when someone is lying, because she has a lot of common sense. Wisdom is something that should be passed down from generation to generation, so we can learn what's good and what's bad.\n\nIn conclusion, it's better to ask for help than to try to do everything on our own. Experts, people in charge, and wise individuals can teach us important things in life and help us become better people."}

I don't think the school board's plan to add an hour and a half to the school day is a good idea. It will make it hard for students to do things they want to do after school.\n\nThe first reason I don't like this plan is that it will affect students who do things after school, like sports or clubs. For example, some students have practice every day, while others have it twice a week. If school is longer, they will get home late and might be tired the next day. They might not have time to finish their homework because they have to go to bed early. Another example is when students work on group projects. They need to meet up after school, but if one student has practice and another has a club, it will be hard to find a time that works.\n\nThe second reason I don't agree with the plan is that some students have other things to do after school. For example, some students take care of their younger brothers or sisters. They need to pick them up from school on time. If school is longer, it will be hard for them to do this. Some students also have pets that need to be taken care of. They need to feed and play with them when they get home. If they get home late, it will be hard to do this.\n\nIn conclusion, I think adding an hour and a half to the school day is a bad idea.

Many people think it's okay to do their work at the last minute, but it's not a good idea. If you finish your work early, you'll be less stressed. I used to do my homework at the last minute, and I didn't like it. I turned in my work late and didn't get good grades. So, I started doing my homework early, and it got easier.

However, this was said a long time ago, and things have changed since then. Nowadays, people think differently, and many believe that taking breaks is essential.\n\nWe live in a society that values productivity. Countries like China and India are always producing goods. This can be both good and bad for consumers and employers. On the one hand, consumers can get what they want anytime. On the other hand, workers are often stressed, and employers are under pressure. Many people think that taking breaks is necessary to be more productive and produce high-quality work. For example, if you work for 10 hours without a break, you may produce more, but the quality will be low. If you take short breaks, you may produce less, but the quality will be better.\n\nWe believe that taking breaks at the right time can be more productive than working non-stop. Being inactive for a short time can improve the quality of your work.\n\nMany people think that only workers get stressed and need breaks. However, this is not true. Students can also get stressed, and taking breaks can help them. For students, taking breaks can mean using their imagination and dreaming. This can help them plan their day, week, or life. It may seem like they're wasting time, but they're actually being productive.\n\nAnother good time to take a break is during a test or quiz. You don't need to focus all the time. Taking a short break can help you clear your mind and be more accurate when you go back to the test.\n\nIn conclusion, if you want to be productive and produce high-quality work, you should try taking breaks.

Some think working alone is better because we can be in charge and feel confident. However, I believe working in a team is more helpful because we can finish our work fast and learn more.\n\nThe first reason I think working in a team is better is that we can finish our work quickly. For example, in my history class, some students worked alone, while others worked in teams. The teams finished earlier and won a prize. If we hadn't worked in teams, we wouldn't have finished early and won the prize. Similarly, a man had to fix many cars in two days to pay his rent. He couldn't do it alone, so he asked his friends to help him. They worked together and finished the work quickly, so he could pay his rent.\n\nThe second reason is that working in a team helps us learn new things. For example, I didn't know how to make a chart for my chemistry project, so I asked my friends to help me. They suggested we teach each other in a team, and I learned how to do it. I got a perfect score on my project. If I hadn't worked in a team, I would have gotten a zero, but because I worked in a team, I learned and got a perfect score. Similarly, a girl didn't know how to swim, and her siblings taught her how to swim in different ways in a team. If she hadn't learned how to swim, she could have gotten hurt, but because she worked in a team, she learned how to swim.\n\nSome people might say working alone is better because we can be in charge and confident. However, I believe we can be more responsible and confident if we work together in a team. For example, a boy was learning how to ride a bike, but he was too confident and didn't want to learn with others. He fell and hurt his leg because he wasn't in a team to learn how to ride a bike. If he had learned how to ride a bike in a team, he wouldn't have fallen and hurt his leg.\n\nAlthough some people might argue that working alone is better, I believe working in a team is more helpful because we can finish our work quickly and learn more. Working in a team is better than working alone because when we work together, we will be safer, accomplish things easily, finish quickly, and learn new things. It's better to work in a team to succeed."}

Parks offer many activities, such as bike trails, picnic areas, and sports courts.\n\nParks usually have trails for biking, walking, and running. These trails are nice because you don't have to walk or ride on dirt or grass. You can see kids playing and enjoy the beautiful surroundings with tall trees. Some trails even have benches to rest on. Many people enjoy these activities, so having trails in parks is a great idea.\n\nParks also have open spaces for picnics. When people visit the park, they often bring a blanket and food to eat with family or friends. The surroundings are pretty, with tall trees everywhere. On nice days, the park is usually crowded. Having extra space is convenient for a relaxing picnic away from the playground noise.\n\nSome parks have sports courts for games like basketball, football, or soccer. Not everyone likes just playing on the playground or trail. Many people enjoy playing sports, either alone or with friends. Having sports courts in the park is a great idea because many people prefer sports over other activities.\n\nIn conclusion, spending time outdoors, like at the park, is a great way to do many activities with friends, family, or alone. Parks offer many activities, such as bike trails, picnic areas, and sports courts. These are all great ways to have fun outdoors."}

I spent a month with them in Generic_City, and it was amazing to be with them again. We had fun chasing chickens around the house, and my mom made my favorite food, tacos de lengua. I can't wait to see them again next summer. Summer break is the best! I think there shouldn't be year-round schools because of summer school, family trips, and summer events.\n\nFirst, summer school is important for students who didn't pass a class and need to retake it. They give up part of their summer to attend summer school. But since we have a long summer break, they still get to enjoy some summer time after summer school. For example, I had to take summer school for chemistry last year, and I ended up passing! I also got to visit my mom in Generic_City. Many people, especially teachers, think summer breaks are bad for students, but they're wrong. Some students need a longer summer for summer school to retake a subject they didn't pass.\n\nSecond, family trips are important. My friend Generic_Name only gets to travel and spend time with her family during summer. Her parents are very busy and work every day, even on holidays! That's why Generic_Name loves summer breaks; she and her family always visit her oldest brother in Generic_City, and they have a great time together. Another example, my friend Generic_Name's parents were deported three years ago. Every summer, she visits them. She shows me on FaceTime how much fun she's having, and it makes me happy to see her happy.\n\nSummer school and family trips are important. That's why there shouldn't be year-round schools. We need these long summer breaks. Help me convince others that year-round schools are not a good idea. Longer summer breaks give us the chance to catch up and spend more time with family members."}

I have three reasons why people enjoy camping.\n\nFirst, you learn new things. When you camp, you can discover things about nature you never knew existed. For example, I learned that birds eat worms when I went camping. You can also explore old caves and learn about animal life cycles. If you like science, you'll love this.\n\nSecond, you make friends. If you already have friends, you'll make more. If you don't have friends, you'll meet new people who are camping near you. You can share what you've learned and explore together. Even animals might become your friends.\n\nThird, you can relax. If you live in a busy city, it's hard to sleep and relax because of all the noise. But when you camp, all you hear is nature. You don't have to wake up early, and you can do what you want without worrying about what others think. That's real relaxation.\n\nIn conclusion, I think camping is the best activity because you learn, make friends, and relax. Some people might not like the outdoors, but they should try camping.

Some people believe there should be year-round schools with shorter breaks.\n\nI agree that the summer can be too long because some students forget things. When they come back to school, it's hard to remember what they learned the previous year. For example, last year I learned many new things in freshman year, and when I came back to school this year, it was hard to remember the difficult things.\n\nAnother thing I agree with is that we can have a shorter summer. During that time, we can learn more things in spring break, like other schools or countries that have math, history, English clubs.\n\nDuring spring break, 11th and 12th graders can think about going to university or getting an advanced diploma. If they need to learn something or improve their grades, they can come to school during summer and get help.\n\nI'm not saying we need to be at school all year, but students who need help can come to learn. For example, 9th and 10th graders who need help in some classes can come to school and learn. Freshmen are new and learn new things, like math and algebra, which can be difficult. If they get help, they can do well in 10th grade.\n\nWhat they can do is open the school for students who need help. For example, a student who has bad grades can come to school. My sister needed help with English last year, and she couldn't get it because the school was closed. If the school was open, she could have learned English and other subjects."}

My 8th-grade teacher used to say, 'Walk alone and you'll go faster, walk with a group and you'll go farther.' I believe that working with a group has more advantages than working alone.\n\nFirst, working alone can make you feel left out. You might think others don't want to work or talk with you. On the other hand, working with a group gives you the confidence to share your ideas. You know others will do the same, and together you can improve your ideas and get great results. Plus, it's good for your mental health to interact with others.\n\nSecond, working with a group has many benefits. You can learn new things, share the workload, and get more information. When you work with others, you can learn from them and make your ideas better. It's true that 'two heads are better than one.' It also helps you feel more confident and improves your public speaking skills.\n\nI used to prefer working alone, but I realized that working with a group is better in many ways.

Many people think this is important for life. Students often dream of a specific career, like being a doctor, police officer, or teacher. To achieve this, students need to be organized and manage their time, activities, and discipline. They can do this by joining student organizations in school or college. Choosing a career is crucial because it's important for one's own life. In some places, students are expected to choose a career by the time they enter high school. However, this is not always possible due to financial problems or lack of interest in school. Some people have the chance to study and eventually have a career. Some students think they should not be forced to choose a career early, but others disagree. In some cases, societies do not expect students to choose a career by the time they enter high school, and people agree that guidance is needed. Sometimes, students change careers, like from being a doctor to a police officer. Many people like to have two or more career options when they find something they like.

Technology has hurt human contact because when we connect with others online, we disconnect from people around us. The way we act online can also make it hard to talk to people in person.\n\nFirst, most people use technology every day. Many people use social media to meet new people and talk to them. They spend a lot of time with these online friends and ignore the people they know in real life. If someone focuses on people who are not really there, they will ignore the people who are actually around them. This creates problems in all their relationships. When someone can text someone, they usually prefer that to talking to the person next to them. People choose to connect online instead of having a real conversation in person.\n\nSecond, using technology too much can also affect how we think and talk to people in person. When we're online, we can say things we wouldn't say in real life. This freedom can help us create a second personality. It can also affect our social skills because we get used to the freedom of the internet. As a result, we may act more like our online self than our real self.\n\nIn conclusion, in daily life, people are always on their phones. The limitations phones have created in human contact are huge.

We can all learn from each other. This helps us get better scores. We can improve our reading, writing, and speaking skills.

For people who want an easier way to move forward, technology is the best choice. Some people like to get things done quickly because they have a lot to do every day. This has a positive impact on what people can achieve. For example, cell phones have become the most used technology over time. It took a lot of knowledge and time for people to realize that a phone is a reliable tool. Another benefit is that we don't have to rely on others to do things anymore. Our phones and devices can help us get through the day.\n\nIf technology keeps improving, everything might become even easier. People enjoy staying updated on what's happening around the world. Social media is popular and widely used today. It's easy to post updates and share important information quickly. When it comes to school work or events, it's easy to stay in touch with someone who's missing out. You can simply email or text them.\n\nAs an individual, being able to plan ahead is a valuable trait. Being prepared for new things makes us alert and ready for what's coming. For example, if you have a relative who lives far away, you can easily talk to them using video calls or phone calls. Shopping online is also common, so we don't waste time driving to the store. As we get older, we understand more about how to use social media and advanced technology.\n\nOverall, technology helps us become better people and think about our future careers.

The best way is through your behavior because it shows what kind of person you are, and people think you are more reliable.\n\nFirst, the way people behave is important. It shows if they are mean or kind. When you are nice to someone, it shows them what kind of person you are. When you respect yourself, you show others how to respect themselves and others too. When you treat people well, it shows them how they want to be treated. As babies, we learn how to behave from our parents. If our parents teach us good behavior, it affects not only them but also others as we grow up. Today, many kids have bad behavior because of how they are raised at home. When they go to school, they want friends, but if their behavior is bad, it affects them too. Raising kids with good behavior affects other kids too. Also, people's behavior can change because of the influence they get from others.\n\nFurthermore, being someone people can depend on is important.

I agree that anyone can achieve their goals because we all have a purpose.\n\nIn my opinion, people all over the world are always doing something. Being successful and completing goals are important to most people, which is why they stay busy. For example, college students write papers to get good grades, so they practice their writing skills. Lower-grade students also accomplish more because of the work they're given, the grades they earn, and the credits they need to move forward. School is very important and can be seen by many people.\n\nThomas Jefferson also reminded us that keeping ourselves active is important. I believe most adults do this because of the many responsibilities they have in life. Adults have jobs, take care of their children, and do many other things. For example, teachers work with younger people and can see the impact of their work. Not only do they work, but they also take care of their children. I believe adults see more accomplishments than younger people because they have to provide for themselves and their children.\n\nLastly, Thomas Jefferson wrote that helping others can make us feel proud of ourselves and others. I think about elderly people who can't do things on their own, but can accomplish things with help from others. They feel proud of themselves, and so do the people helping them.

In my opinion, working in a team has more benefits because everyone brings different ideas and can discuss problems.\n\nI think working in a team is more comfortable because everyone has different ideas. Someone can give you their opinion or correct your mistakes. For example, I like working and making mistakes. Mistakes aren't bad; they help us learn. One day, I was painting a room at work, but I didn't have much experience. I thought I was right, but I was doing it wrong. My coworkers told me I was wrong and showed me how to do it better. That's when I realized I need people to help me improve.\n\nWe always need someone to work with, even the Bible says two heads are better than one. When we have a problem or doubt, we need someone to discuss it with. For instance, in school, we were doing a project about a small town in Sudan, Africa. We didn't know what it looked like, but a classmate from Africa helped us. I think if I had worked alone, I wouldn't have figured it out.\n\nWorking in a team is the best way to work because nobody is perfect. We all make mistakes, and we need someone with different ideas to help us do a better job. It's more beneficial to discuss problems and get a better solution because there are more ideas and opinions."}

Some individuals always want to do something because they dislike being bored and prefer to stay active.\n\nFor instance, my 14-year-old brother loves to play soccer, basketball, and tennis. He hates sitting around doing nothing. He wants to be a professional soccer player because he dislikes being still. On the other hand, some people prefer doing nothing because they don't like being active. However, most people prefer being active because it's good for their health.\n\nMany people like to stay active because they want a healthy body, like a professional wrestler. Almost everyone wants a healthy body. Some people want to look beautiful and pretty, while others want to look good and healthy.\n\nFor example, when I play with my brother, my body gets exercise, and I stay active. Most of my friends go to the gym to have a healthy body. After exercising, we like to go for a run because we want our bodies to look good. When our bodies are active, it's good for our health.\n\nIn conclusion, most people prefer being active because it keeps their bodies healthy, fit, and looking good."}

It's hard, but if you think about what you want, you can do it and work and study at the same time. \n\nSome students need to work because they don't live with their parents.

When we're in college, we have more responsibilities.\n\nSome people think that praising a student's work helps build their confidence, even if the work isn't their best. Praising students is important because we need to talk to them and ask how they're doing. All students want someone to ask them what they want. Students need to be confident in themselves to learn.

You need to make your own decisions and learn from them. Sometimes we ask for advice and make a mistake, and then we blame the other person. So, we need to make our own decisions.\n\nMaking mistakes helps us grow up. Everyone makes mistakes, and it's normal. I made a bad decision once and left school for a year. I learned that school was important for my success.\n\nWe can make bad decisions, but we need to learn from them.\n\nSome people don't agree that we should make our own decisions because they think we'll make more mistakes if we don't ask for help.\n\nIn conclusion, if I make a bad decision and fail, I'll be responsible, not someone else.

When we use technology to talk to people, we don't feel comfortable talking to them in person. If we misuse technology, it can cause big problems we can't control. Another important thing is that older people struggle to use technology. It takes away their comfort. There are people in our lives who need our time and need to talk to us.

We might even get hurt. We'll also have homework, and we'll have to do it quickly. For example, if you play volleyball, you'll get home late. Then you'll need to shower, eat, and do your homework. If school is longer, we won't have time for our hobbies.\n\nNext, longer school hours mean more work and more homework. Students will stay up late to finish their work, and they'll be grumpy because they're tired. This can lead to bad grades and behavior.\n\nLastly, students will have less time with their families. This can cause problems at home. If you're doing homework, you can't spend time with your family. You might not want to do your work, but if you don't, your grades will suffer, and your family will be affected too.\n\nIn conclusion, the school board shouldn't make the school day longer.

Most people don't know how to get what they want. When they grow up, they might not know what decisions to make to have a happy life.

He wanted to be a doctor, so he graduated from high school and was ready to take the next step. My family and I wondered which college he would choose to learn how to be a doctor. But when my mom asked him, he said he wouldn't go to college because he wanted to learn everything on his own.\n\nMy mom was upset, but she let him try. She knew he would soon realize it was a mistake. My brother always tried to do things by himself, following his instincts. But one year went by, and he didn't make any progress.

They told him he needed to go to college, but he didn't listen.\n\nTime passed, and he never became a doctor. His friends graduated, but he didn't change his attitude and decided to do something else.

But they're wrong because students can learn about other careers and what they really want. Clearly, students need to prepare for their future careers.\n\nFirstly, it's a bad idea for students to choose a career too early because they can get confused. For example, my friend was studying science, but he switched to another field because he didn't understand science, and he wasted two years on a career he didn't like. He thought it was easy, but it wasn't what he wanted, and he quit. Clearly, students need to try out a career before they commit.\n\nAdditionally, it's a bad idea for students to choose a career too early because they can't think seriously. For example, my friend chose to study law, but he didn't really know what it was about, and he just wanted to have fun. He didn't want to keep studying, and his mom did, so he picked a career he thought would fail and dropped out. Clearly, students need to think about their future, but they decide to be lazy.\n\nLastly, it's a bad idea for students to choose a career too early because they need to be prepared. For example, my friend is a junior in high school and has already finished all the required credits, but he needs to finish school normally to get the experience colleges want. He moved from a state where the final test didn't matter to a state where it did, but he failed all the tests and had to retake all his classes again. In that state, any college would accept him even if he failed the test and had low grades.\n\nIn conclusion, it's a bad idea for students to choose a career too early because they don't think clearly, they can't be serious, and they're not ready. These three reasons prove that choosing a career too early is a bad idea. People must understand the importance of education and having a career.

This helps me avoid wasting time on technology. When I have homework, I try to use books to find more information.

However, some people prefer to work alone because they don't like working with many people. They think it's a waste of time and that others won't do their work. But some people are good at working alone because they focus on their work and are confident in what they do.\n\nOne advantage of working in a group is that everyone can come up with ideas for the project. On the other hand, working alone means you have to put in more effort and work hard to finish the task.\n\nIn conclusion, working with a group or working alone has its benefits. People who work with a group can do a great job and finish their work easily. Sometimes it's difficult, but they can always find a way to solve the problem. People who work alone may struggle with their work, but some can do it well because they know what they're doing. Teachers often tell you to work with a partner or group because it's helpful and easy to do classwork or projects. You can choose what you're confident in. My recommendation is to work with a group; it makes life and work easier."}
{"text_id_kaggle": "43E2BB02C59D", "output_essay": "People can be influenced by many things. One important way is by seeing examples. When we see someone doing something, we can decide if it's good or bad. This is a powerful way to influence others because they can choose to follow or not. For example, an older sibling can show a younger brother or sister the importance of doing homework. Parents and grandparents can also set good examples by teaching children how to behave. However, examples can be bad too, like stealing. If a child sees their friend steal, they might start doing it too.\n\nAnother big influencer is advertising. Ads can make people buy things or do certain actions because they see them repeatedly. For instance, if you see a car ad many times, you might buy that car instead of another one. Ads can also make people interested in events, like concerts. Sometimes, ads are made by the government or political parties to let people know what they stand for.\n\nThings that happen naturally can also influence us. For example, a hurricane can make people leave an area. Sales at stores can influence people to buy certain products. But the most important natural influencer is life itself. We can't predict what will happen in the future, so life's experiences shape us every day.\n\nIn summary, the three biggest influencers are examples set by others, advertising, and natural events that happen in our daily lives."}

{"text_id_kaggle": "2277064733A4", "output_essay": "Imagine a school with hundreds of unhappy and angry students because they didn't get a long summer break like they used to. They would feel sad, tired, and many parents would complain to the principal because they had already planned a family trip. So, students should have a long summer break instead of just one or two weeks because they will do better in school, summer is a great time to go out, and it's good for their health.\n\nThe first reason students should have a long summer break is that they will do better in school. Many teenagers will use the summer to catch up on their grades because they want to have fun with friends. Most students will get excited for the long break and work harder in school before it starts. If they pass their classes, they won't have to go to summer school. Even if some students don't take advantage of opportunities, they can still retake what they missed during the summer and have time to have fun and travel.\n\nThe second reason students should have a long summer break is that most students prefer it because they can go out, explore, and have new experiences. In summer, they can do many activities like going to the pool or on trips. They can have parties and stay up late. They will appreciate nature's beauty during their summer break, rather than just staying cold in winter. They will learn more about life and cultures during the summer. They might see different lifestyles and understand how school can help them achieve their goals.\n\nThe third reason students should have a long summer break is that it will improve their health, both mentally and physically. Students can reduce stress and forget about school problems during the break. At the end of the school year, many students feel bad, and a good vacation can help them clear their minds. The warm weather can improve their mood, and they will feel more comfortable doing what they like. Students can also improve their physical health by walking, running, riding bikes, and drinking water during the summer. Many places will be open for outdoor activities, and parks will be open for people to enjoy nature.\n\nIn conclusion, students should have a long summer break because it will help them stay motivated to do well in school. Summer is also a great time for them to have a wonderful vacation with their family and friends. Finally, summer will make some students feel healthier by providing them with places to exercise and relax in good weather."}

Construction workers, for instance, are always doing something and they finish their tasks.\n\nWhen we're not working, we're not getting anything done. But if our boss tells us to finish a task by the end of the day and we do what we're supposed to do, then we'll finish it on time. If we're just wasting time, we won't finish it. My mom is a painter and she works with partners. Each of them has a task, but not all of them do their job.

I think technology can make life easier, but it can also have bad effects if we use it wrongly. This can make us antisocial, sick, and behave badly.\n\nFirst, being social is important. It helps us make friends, have good relationships, and earn trust. For example, if you're social, you can have many friends and have fun times when you go to the movies or go shopping.\n\nSecond, using technology for too long can make us sick. For example, we can lose our eyesight or have emotional problems like feeling frustrated and unhappy. This can be dangerous for us. Our eyes are important, and if we lose our sight, it can make life hard. Also, having low emotional feelings can make us make bad choices, like harming ourselves.\n\nThird, technology can cause bad behavior, especially in kids and teenagers. Today, playing games is very popular, and while it can be fun and relaxing, it can also be bad and become a habit. This can be dangerous because some games can make us feel angry, aggressive, and careless, leading to hurting others.\n\nUsing technology can sometimes be good, like reading books online or finding information. But in my opinion, technology has more bad effects than good ones. For example, today, many violent events are happening, like people dressing up as game characters and then hurting others.

For example, I want to be a professional soccer player, so I need to keep practicing. If I stay at home and watch TV, I'll never achieve my goal. But if I keep practicing, I'll get better and become a professional.\n\nSecond, not doing anything doesn't help anyone. People have goals and dreams, but they can't achieve them if they don't take action. For example, my friend wants to have strong abs because he likes working out and wants to look like a model. But he's never gone to the gym, so he can't achieve his goal.

This is a big problem because not everyone is influenced by what we do or say. In this essay, I will discuss how people relate to influence, personality, and perspective.\n\nMany people need help, but we often focus on our own needs and forget about others. We all go through tough times and want to talk about it, but it's hard because we're scared of what others might think. People who help others can feel great knowing they're making a difference. They help people open up and let go of their problems. Sometimes, just talking about our own experiences can help others relate.\n\nA person's personality is important because many people today don't appreciate what others do for them. They forget about those who helped them or those they helped.\n\nKindness is a key part of being an influence because we genuinely want to help others. When we do something, it's because we want to, not because we want to have fun. For example, some YouTubers share their stories to get views, but people might not trust them. However, if we're genuine, people will relate to us and support us.\n\nPeople's perspective is a big issue today because we judge others based on how they look or act. We don't give them a chance to show us who they really are. How can people ask for help when they're struggling if we judge them? We need to put ourselves in their shoes and understand their problems.\n\nIn conclusion, we should influence ourselves first and then help others. We can't expect everyone to follow our example, but we can try to make a difference. In my opinion, I agree with Albert Schweitzer that setting a good example is the best way to influence others."}
{"text_id_kaggle": "CF250284D721", "output_essay": "Thomas Jefferson once said, 'Never be idle...It's amazing how much you can do if you keep doing.' Today, there are many new things waiting to be explored. Some people think that the more they do, the more they achieve. Others disagree. Do people achieve more when they're always doing, or is doing nothing also important? There are two sides to this argument, but one side stands out. People should keep moving to avoid being idle, because it can lead to success and provide many opportunities.\n\nFirst, keeping active shows people the way to be successful. We can see the big difference between the past and now. This is because people who keep doing things and looking for new ways to improve the world every day. For example, Thomas Edison, the inventor of the light bulb, faced many obstacles, but he didn't give up. When a reporter asked him how he felt when he failed, he said, 'I'm not failing, I'm just finding 10,000 ways it doesn't work.' Edison's story shows that keeping active can lead to better results and make people stronger when they face failure. In short, when someone keeps doing something, they can find the key to success.\n\nNext, opportunities are always waiting for those who keep moving. In today's urban life, there are many chances waiting to be explored. Many people compete with each other to get these chances. For instance, the best school in the city only accepts 800 students, but over 1,000 students apply. So, those 800 students need to keep working hard to get in. In short, it's easy to see the opportunities for people who always do their best.\n\nAdditionally, keeping active can make people more active in their daily life. Many people are afraid to try new things and become depressed easily. On the other hand, people who keep a positive attitude and work on their ideas are always happy. For example, a math lover always does her best in class and talks about math with a smile. This shows that having a positive attitude and working on things you love can make you more active in your daily life.\n\nSome people may argue that doing nothing can also be useful, giving people time to relax and recharge. This makes sense, as breaks can provide energy and reduce stress. However, doing nothing can cause health problems and make people miss out on chances to learn and explore. Working on new ideas doesn't mean you don't take breaks. Nothing in life is free, and you need to work for what you want. In summary, people need breaks to restart, but they still need to work towards new opportunities.\n\nIn conclusion, Thomas Jefferson told people not to be idle, but to be active and look for more chances. Although doing nothing can provide a break, it can lead to idleness. Keeping active and working on new things will provide the best results and opportunities. Let's say 'yes' to being ready and going towards a great future."}

It's important to love and share with people who are good examples. Technology is useful, but not when used too much. It's better to have control and learn new things.\n\nBeing positive about this means knowing that only people who use technology for more than just passing time will benefit. Maybe they don't have good benefits in life either.\n\nBefore technology changed people's lives, they were different and had different lives.\n\nNow it's different; people only spend time on technology and don't want to spend time with others.\n\nI recommend using technology only for good things in life. From my experience, it's more efficient when I use technology, and I only use it for my benefit. For example, when I work, I use my computer and phone, which is a good idea.

Later, she started teaching others, and now they're teaching others too.\n\nSome people think they don't need to try new things because they already know how to do them. However, trying new things can change who they are as a person. It can help others find their passions, and it can help people grow.\n\nTrying new things makes people grow. For example, I used to dislike math, but when I got to high school, I started to like it. My teacher taught in a way that made sense to me, and I even helped my friends who didn't understand. Trying something new helped me become more patient and understand how much I could do. It also helped me help others.\n\nTrying new things can help others find their passions too. For example, my brother joined the army for training, and he didn't know it would become his passion. After the training, he decided to stay because he found what he was looking for. When he came back home, he was happy to share his stories, and I was inspired to join the army too. I want to help my country and say thank you for giving me a better life.\n\nIn conclusion, trying new things can help people discover their passions and grow as individuals. It's like trying new food - you might be surprised at what you like. Discovering new passions and growing as a person is the best thing people can do in their lives. Sometimes, people are scared to try, but they should give it a shot."}

I've also noticed that the attitude you give to others comes back to you. If someone gives you a bad attitude at a restaurant, it makes you feel bad, and you might give someone else a bad attitude too.

In school, there's usually a music club or band. If they asked me what activity I'd pick for next year, I'd choose guitar. So I think playing an instrument is a fun and educational activity because it helps students learn to play many instruments, helps them relax with music after a hard day, and helps them find their own talent.\n\nPlaying an instrument helps students learn to play many instruments. There are many instruments to choose from, like guitar, piano, and drum. At first, it's not easy to play an instrument. You need time and patience. For example, I used to get frustrated with guitar because it was hard to play. But now, I can play well and I'm proud of it. When you work hard at something and finally get it, you feel happy.\n\nPlaying an instrument helps students relax with music after a hard day. Every day is a struggle for students. They have to wake up early, do their schoolwork, and fight sleepiness. Most students like to listen to music at the end of the day. I asked some students in my school what they do after class, and they said they listen to music. Music helps people relax better than anything else.\n\nPlaying an instrument helps students find their own talent. Some people love music and want to learn more. Like singers, they can use their own instrument to make a song better. When you know how to play music, you can feel the rhythm and play it like an artist. Each instrument has a different sound, and students will find what they like.\n\nSo I think playing an instrument is a fun and educational activity because it helps students learn to play many instruments, helps them relax with music, and helps them find their own talent. Don't wait, join the instrument club or band and enjoy it. I'm sure you'll have a great time with music or your own instrument."}
{"text_id_kaggle": "C12E3AFD1CB5", "output_essay": "People should make their own decisions. When people make their own decisions, they are more likely to know what they're doing. If others always guide them, they will have trouble deciding what's right or wrong and doing things on their own. They might even lose self-respect.\n\nI think people who rely on others have more trouble. They have trouble because others do things for them, and they never try to do things themselves. Some people have trouble at work because they don't understand it. For example, if someone always helps you out of trouble, you might not care anymore. This means someone is helping you, but they shouldn't because you're not learning from your mistakes.\n\nI also think people don't know what's right or wrong because they've had others help them out many times. They don't know what's right or wrong anymore. Sometimes, the people guiding them might even guide them the wrong way. The person being guided might take wrong turns and get stuck. For example, choosing between going to work or staying home is easy for someone who makes their own decisions, but it's hard for someone who doesn't.\n\nThis is another reason they lose self-respect. When others help them with their problems and do things for them, they start to feel like they need help and can't do it themselves. They start to feel less confident and stop trying because they think someone else can do it for them. For example, if a teacher gives you the answers instead of letting you figure it out, you might not want to try anymore. You might think there's no point in trying. This makes people lazy.\n\nSo, people who make their own decisions won't have to deal with problems like not knowing what they're doing or not understanding what's right or wrong or losing self-respect. They will learn from their mistakes and do better in life. They will gain more from making their own decisions."}

You said that being yourself in a world that tries to change you is the greatest achievement. I agree with this for three reasons: having my own personality, being myself, and having freedom.\n\nFirst, if I have my own personality, I can decide what I want in life. I can choose what makes me happy. Many people try to control our lives, but we should be free to make our own choices.\n\nSecond, if I'm myself, I have the freedom to live my life. I can do good things like finish my education, which is one of my goals. I want to be a better person and help others. Not everyone is kind, so we need to be careful who we trust.\n\nThird, if we have freedom, the world can be a better place. We can make our own decisions and think clearly. We can choose what's best for us and avoid things that can hurt us.\n\nIn conclusion, thank you for your great idea. I believe that being ourselves will help us become amazing people. We'll make good choices and have wonderful lives now and in the future.\n\nSincerely,\n\nGeneric_Name"}

When people work together, they can help each other and learn new things. If someone doesn't understand something, a coworker can explain it to them. For example, in the workplace, when someone is new, they can ask for help and get guidance on what to do.\n\nSome people think working alone is beneficial, and I agree. There are smart people who can do things on their own without asking for help. For example, Bill Gates created a computer by himself. However, working alone can be boring because there's no one to ask for help when you're stuck. And it can take a long time to understand something.\n\nWorking in a group is good because people can have fun, share ideas, and get a lot done. But some people in the group might gossip about others. That's why some people prefer to work alone - they don't want trouble. For example, in a workplace with people from different countries and cultures, language barriers can cause problems.\n\nWorking in a group depends on the person. It's helpful because experienced people can assist, and the work gets done faster. But when a person works alone, it can be good or bad. If a manager needs the work done fast, a person working alone might make mistakes.\n\nBoth ideas are good. In the workplace, people need support and benefits. We should do what makes others happy and avoid what confuses them. We need to be good at our jobs, help each other, and reach our goals. Working alone is also good when someone wants to focus without distractions. They can work in peace and quiet. That's why people like to work alone. I agree with both ideas."}

Some students will be surprised to see their old classmates and teachers again. Others will be excited to go back to school because they miss their friends and favorite subjects.\n\nI don't agree with educators who think we should only have three to four weeks of summer vacation. This would make students feel unhappy and less active in school. Many students would be absent or skip classes because they think it's unfair.\n\nHaving only three to four weeks of summer vacation would cause problems for the education department. But it's not a bad idea to add more breaks during the school year. Some students like to have a long streak of school days, while others have plans to travel, work, or relax at home. If educators want to shorten the summer vacation, they should make school hours shorter. This could be a good deal because students would have more time for activities, family, and jobs after school.\n\nIf educators want to shorten the summer vacation, they should make a deal with us. We could agree to shorter school days, like starting at 7:30 and ending at 2:15. Most students would be happy with this deal. Educators should also focus on making school a happy place. They could provide good food, which would make students excited to come to school. Food can make us feel happy and energized. Some schools give students freedom, which makes them feel more comfortable and satisfied. Educators should think about students' feelings and physical activities, not just teaching. If they make positive changes, they can also make their own rules about summer vacation breaks."}

To build self-esteem, students should try new things and take risks. This will give them new experiences and help them overcome challenges.\n\nFirst, self-esteem helps students learn new things. When students believe in themselves, they can express themselves better and become the best version of themselves. Even if teachers praise them for their weak work, it will boost their confidence. This will help them achieve their dreams and feel proud of themselves. Being unique is also important when students have self-esteem.\n\nSecond, self-esteem builds confidence by teaching students to appreciate what they have.

According to the University of California, most people choose to complete their tasks with others. As humans, we all have different skills and behaviors. Some of us like to work in a team, while others prefer to work alone. It really depends on a person's skills. I prefer to work with a team. Working in a team is more beneficial because it helps people develop communication skills and saves time.\n\nFirst, working with a team has many benefits. One benefit is that it helps people develop their communication skills and builds their confidence. For example, people who work in a team have different knowledge, skills, and ideas. From my experience, I learned that when I worked with a team, I became more confident. My English teacher told me to work with a group of students and share my opinion. I was nervous, but when I shared my ideas, they listened to me carefully, and it made me proud of myself. I also like to work with a team when I do my homework or study for a test. We share our ideas and knowledge, and I learn from others.\n\nSecond, working with a team is important because it saves time and energy. I believe that two people working together can do more than one person working alone. When people work together, they support each other and don't waste their energy. They usually complete their tasks on time, which means they save time. Teamwork is very important in life. For example, at my workplace, Whole Foods Market, we believe that teamwork is essential to complete our tasks. I work as a cashier, and my priority is taking care of customers. When I'm not busy, I help other team members, such as stockers or housekeeping. I love that on busy days, people from other departments come to help us, which allows us to complete our job early and satisfy our customers.\n\nIn conclusion, working in a team is beneficial because it helps people develop communication skills and builds their confidence.

My grandparents always say that life doesn't give you things easily; you have to work for them. It might be hard, but you need to believe in yourself.\n\nSecond, making your own decisions is a good habit. It shows that you're independent and can do things on your own. People like it when you're independent because it shows you're brave. My dad let me help him with things, so I could learn to do them myself one day. Being independent is important because you can't always get help.\n\nNext, being independent and having ideas can really help you in your job. That's what bosses look for. Look at people like Steve Jobs, who took a big risk and became very successful. It's all about trusting yourself and not being too negative.\n\nHowever, making your own decisions can sometimes be bad. You can make mistakes and get into trouble.

I think we're like this because we chose to be. After thousands of years of evolution, we started interacting with each other and were influenced by how we first met. That's where we started to become who we are today as a society.\n\nThe invention of writing brought religion and a way to show the world that humans are different from other species and from each other.

If we didn't care about what others think, we could be ourselves and not be scared of rejection."}

Some people believe being positive can lead to a unique lifestyle.\n\nI think a positive attitude leads to a good life because when bad things happen, you can overcome them and find a way to make them positive.

{"text_id_kaggle": "75EAA709339E", "output_essay": "I believe everyone has the right to make their own decisions in life. The more decisions they make, the wiser they become. They can learn from their mistakes and use that knowledge to become a better person. They don't need to ask for help from others. At the end of the day, it's their life. The more mistakes they make, the more they learn and grow. So, I disagree with the idea that others should make decisions for us. Authorities often try to control our lives instead of helping us. We don't need anyone to control our lives; it's our own life, so we should do what's best for us.\n\nIt's always good to follow our own instincts and ideas. They will never fail us, no matter what we think. We should trust our own judgment. For example, President Obama followed his own ideas and became the President of the United States. He never let others make decisions for him. If he did, he might not have become the 44th President. So, we should be like him. People who make their own decisions are often successful. No matter what problems we face, we should take charge and make our own decisions. We should never let others tell us what we can or can't do. We should remember, 'we are our own boss in life.'\n\nThat's why I think people should make their own decisions about important things. We didn't need others to help us take our first steps, so we shouldn't need them to make decisions for us now. Our parents made decisions for us when we were kids, but when we turn 18, we become adults and start making our own decisions. Making our own decisions boosts our confidence and makes us grateful for our lives.\n\nPersonally, I think we should follow our own path towards our dreams and never let others bring us down. We are in charge of our own lives. Sometimes, getting guidance is okay, but we should never let others make decisions for us. In the long run, we will regret it. So, we should always make our own decisions."}

High school is a serious place and should not be taken lightly. I've seen many students take this program, and it seems they're doing it for the wrong reasons - to finish school earlier than others. I think the main reason for this program is to help people who want to start their own business and know what they want to become.\n\nMany schools use this program to give teenagers a taste of the real world. However, I disagree and think it should be removed. I think it can create a lot of stress, which can lead to depression. When I was a freshman, I heard about this program and wanted to take it, but later I realized that I should take advantage of all the opportunities I had in high school.\n\nThe three-year program wasn't meant to hurt anyone, but it can also have benefits, such as starting your own business early, going to college earlier, or using the fourth year to explore the world. In conclusion, this program has its pros and cons, but it depends on what you want to do with your life. Personally, I would stick to the traditional four-year route, but everyone has their own plan, and what I think shouldn't matter to you."}

This means it's better to always be doing something.\n\nWe live in a time where machines do a lot for us. They make our food, clothes, and transport us. This means we don't have to do much. But even with all these machines, we still need to learn, do things we love, take care of our family, play sports, go for walks, and be with the people we love. We need to do things that make us happy, which machines can't do.\n\nSome people think that doing something means working. They think about jobs, money, and being rich. Yes, we need a job to survive, but to me, doing something means doing what we love. It's not just about working. We should stop thinking about money and focus on what makes us happy. Everyone wants money, but I think success is being alive, having a loving family, and being happy.\n\nDoing something, even if it's small, can help us. But being idle won't help us. Many people love to sleep, watch movies, and play on their phones all day. It might seem okay, but being idle has bad consequences. It can affect our personal life, health, and happiness. It's good to rest sometimes, but being idle every day won't help us find who we are.\n\nSo, my answer is that being idle is not an option. We have a choice. If we're idle, we won't be happy for long. But if we do something, we can be happy. Now you understand both.\n\nBeing idle is not an option. Keep dreaming, don't give up, and do something!"}

Does being active all the time help us achieve more, or is doing nothing also important?\n\nI think being active helps us achieve a lot. We need to set goals and work towards them. If we want to reach our goals, we need to do something every day. Being active every day helps us finish many tasks.\n\nWhen we set a goal, doing nothing won't help us. For example, if you want to be a doctor, you need to study hard, attend school, and focus on your classes. If you sit around all day, you'll waste a day that could've been productive. Most successful people worked hard to get where they are; they study, work, and always do something.\n\nEducation is important. In high school, attending school every day is crucial. You need to try to go to school every day and turn in your assignments on time. If you're active and focused, you'll see your grades improve. You need to study for exams and tests to be ready. If you don't attend school and don't do your work, you won't achieve anything. Working hard and being active helps you reach your goals.\n\nProfessionals like lawyers, teachers, and doctors are always doing something. They're successful because of their daily efforts. If you sit at home watching TV and doing nothing, you won't achieve anything. Attending school or other activities helps you reach your goals; you just need to put in the effort. If you want to lose weight, you need to eat right and exercise; if you eat unhealthy food, you won't reach your goal. Being active every day helps you achieve a lot.\n\nBeing busy every day with tasks that help you achieve something is true. I strongly agree with Thomas Jefferson's quote. Do something every day, and you'll be surprised at what you can achieve in weeks, months, and years. Work hard for your goals; no one can do it for you. You need to put in all your effort and try your best. Being active every day helps you reach your goals. Overall, achieving what we want is in our hands, and we have the power to push ourselves very far."}
{"text_id_kaggle": "3AD64B4E25CD", "output_essay": "As a daughter, sister, cousin, granddaughter, and aunt, I think people should make their own choices. In this paper, I will explain why it's important to make decisions on your own. People should make their own choices because nobody can control them, they can have a better future, and they can trust themselves.\n\nFirst, making your own choices means you're in charge. You decide what to do. I know this because when I turned 18, I thought I could do whatever I wanted. But in my culture, parents still have a lot of control. They say, 'As long as you live with me, you do what I say.' I told my mom that I needed to make my own choices and that if I got into trouble, I would figure out how to get out of it. I wanted to be free to make my own choices and learn from my mistakes. My mom wants to protect me, but I need to learn how to take care of myself.\n\nSecond, having a better future depends on the choices I make. It won't be easy, but if I try hard, nobody can stop me. My grandfather once told me, 'Never give up on what you love, and fight for your future.' He always believed in me, and now I remember his words every day. Making choices for a better future is not bad; it's something to be proud of.\n\nThird, believing in yourself and taking risks is important. Sometimes you'll feel like giving up, but people around you believe in you, and you need to believe in yourself too. I've felt that way before, but I found help from family, friends, and even strangers. They supported me and helped me get out of tough times. You can't do everything alone, and sometimes you need help. But with help, you can become the person you believe in and make better choices.\n\nIn conclusion, I strongly believe that making your own choices is better than following others because it helps you believe in yourself, have a better future, and be in control of your life."}
{"text_id_kaggle": "62A77EDBF3AB", "output_essay": "I agree with Emerson because it's important to be ourselves. In today's world, people often try to change others to fit their ideas. For instance, I might visit a friend who loves soccer, but I don't. To make them happy, I might pretend to like soccer too. This is an example of being someone I'm not. I do it just to make others happy, and that's why I agree with Emerson.\n\nWhen we pretend to be someone we're not, it makes us look bad. Others think we don't have our own life. They think we live to make others happy by being someone we're not. Some people pretend to be someone else because they feel unwanted. They act differently to get others to like them. However, this is not good because it makes them look sad. They live to make others happy by being fake.\n\nThe most important reason I agree with Emerson is that people will always want us to be what they want. They will try to change us, but it's our choice to be someone else or be ourselves. In conclusion, I think people should always be themselves and not worry about what others think. We only have one life, and we should live it the best way we can by being ourselves."}

For example, I worked with my uncle on a roofing job, and he showed me how to do it. I made many mistakes, but he taught me, and now I've improved. Working and improving is better than doing nothing and trying to get better.\n\nTo get better in life, you can ask people for advice and learn more in school. Don't hang out with people who will bring you down. Instead, focus on improving yourself so you can follow your dreams and achieve something in life. This can help others and yourself.

Many schools offer hands-on experience after school or during school. This is a great way to gain experience. You can also visit the college you're interested in during your senior year. This helps you prepare for the future.\n\nSecond, teachers and staff are always available to help you during your four years of high school. If you're struggling with a subject or need help, you can ask a teacher or staff member. Getting help is important because it can affect your future. Teachers can stay after school to help you if you need it.\n\nLastly, joining clubs, activities, and sports teams in high school is beneficial. Joining a club you like can change your interests and help you decide what you want to do with your life. Joining community events and sports teams is a great way to help others and look good on your profile.\n\nIn summary, finishing high school is important because it helps you prepare for the future, get help when you need it, and join activities you enjoy.

Being yourself is the best way to show what you know, express yourself, and be confident.\n\nFirst, when you show what you know at work or school, you have more chances to succeed. For example, students who show they have good potential can get a scholarship. This is important because it motivates them to work hard and can help them get good jobs. People with good knowledge can go far in their careers.\n\nSecond, expressing yourself and giving your opinion can make a difference. For example, when you turn 18, you can vote and make your voice heard. This is important for the future of the United States. You can also help society by doing small things. Many people think the government should change the gun laws to reduce shootings and deaths. This is essential because it can make the country safer.\n\nThird, if you never try, you'll never fail.

To do this, students have to take extra courses during the summer or in their free time. However, graduating in three years is not a good idea because it's stressful and there's no need to rush.\n\nThe first reason is that it's a stressful process. Students have to take extra classes and focus on doing well. They also have to focus on their regular schoolwork and maybe even a job. Adding friends, family, and activities makes it even harder. At sixteen or seventeen, it can be overwhelming. Students shouldn't have to think about college and jobs yet. It's good to set goals, but they shouldn't overwork themselves.\n\nAnother reason is that there's no need to rush. Many students think school is stressful and can't wait to be independent. As a senior, I feel this way too. But high school is a time to grow and have fun. It's a short time when you're not fully responsible for your actions. You should enjoy it.\n\nAlthough graduating early has its pros and cons, completing all four years is worth it. You get to experience high school and make friends with your peers.

{"text_id_kaggle": "2A426B89E8C5", "output_essay": "If we don't try to do more than what we're good at, we'll never improve. Some people don't like that. They think what we're good at is easy and more fun. And they're right - when we do what we're good at, we can be funnier, think faster, and it's easier for us. But we won't grow if we just stick to what we're good at. \n\nLet me explain. If we think about our future, we'll see that we need to be in a better place. To get to a better place, we need to work hard. I prefer to work smart, not hard. Our education needs us. Going to college requires more work. To get a good job, we need to work for it. Even if we decide not to go to college, we'll still need to work hard to pay for our home and car. Work is necessary, but we can work in a better place if we choose to.\n\nTrying is the only way to know what we can do. By trying, we can see if it's hard or easy. We like to do easy things, but I prefer hard things. Easy things make us a little better, but hard things make us much better. We need to face problems and work to overcome them to feel good about ourselves. Every time we do something, we need to do it better the next time. Focusing on ourselves is how we prove ourselves and our nation. I want to have a good life, and I want to pass it on to my son. That's how our nation can be better.\n\nEvery person must do their own work. We're here to make a difference. Our education is how we prove ourselves. When I become a doctor, it means I went through a lot of hard work to get there. I went to four years of high school and eight years of university. That means people can trust me because they know about my background. What about ourselves? I want to be someone who earns everyone's trust. To create a better nation and better people, we need good education. I like education because it makes us better people.\n\nFor those who want to drop out of school, they need to try many times first. Because even when we work at KFC, we need to learn the system. Learning is everything. Even if we drop out of school, we still need it. We need to try things, then we can say if we can do it or not.\n\nI believe we can do a lot of things. No matter where life takes us, we need to move on. If we fail in school, then we need to move on to something new. Maybe we'll start looking for a job or come up with a new idea to make the world a better place. Some people have been in this situation before, and they made good choices. They invented Facebook and many other things. We need to be creative as much as we can. If we fail in a relationship, move on. If we break up with someone we love, move on. We can't stop our lives because of something that happened. We're stronger than we think, and we can do better.\n\nI believe God put each of us in different situations to act differently and to help each other. If all of us were very smart and became doctors, that means no one would work in fast food. No one would clean the streets. Everyone has their own position. We live in a city to help each other. Communication between us makes us better. We're different to get different jobs. If I'm a doctor, and I want to fix my car, I'll go to a mechanic. The same thing for the mechanic; if he gets ill, then he needs to come to me. The man who cleans the streets every morning is the most important man in the city. Because without him, we can't find a clean way to walk. We can do a lot of things, but I believe by working hard and smart, we can do more.\n\nGrowing is very important. I mean by growing is to think in a better way. Try to learn from any situation you've been through, and take a lesson from it to progress your mind. It's very important to sit with yourself and think about what happened to you in the last two weeks or try to think about your whole life. To take the theme from what happened to you since you were young until now. That's one way to make your mind grow. We can also read books. Reading will help us to act like adults, even if we're still teenagers. Teenagers always like to play crazy things. This is our age, but reading can make someone who is 17 years old think like a 30-year-old man. Another way to grow is to ask about what we need to do. Who can we ask? We can ask our father, mother, big brother, or sister. It's very helpful because they always will give us the best solution. They've been through this life before. They know how we can live it, and they love us from the heart. They are our family. We need to see what they're doing and learn from them. If we, in some cases, don't have a family, we can look for someone to help us. There are a lot of wise men in this life. Go and ask them for help. Try to copy them, even to be more than them in the future. The problem is some of us didn't have the good patience to learn from someone else. Because we didn't know what they're thinking about, but we need to be smart and choose who is going to teach us. If I'm going to choose someone, I will choose a rich man or someone who has something no one else has. So we need to be patient until we see a change in our ideas and in our life, and we need to choose the right one to teach us. Growing is a very good thing.\n\nTo do more than what we mastered, that's going to make our nation better. By working smarter, not harder, we can do more. Getting a good education is very helpful to us. We need to try it first, then we can do it. Motivating ourselves will drive us to do more. Learning from others also can make us better people, and all of these by discovering what we can do and believing in ourselves. Because when we believe, we're going to pass all of these good things to our kids in the future. By these things and many more, we need to do what we cannot do to be more than we are now."}

My mom told me to get a job when I turned 17, but I didn't want to. I liked my life just the way it was, because my parents always gave me what I wanted. Back then, I thought achieving something was easy. But when I turned 17, I had to get a job. It was hard and uncomfortable, but if I had quit, my life would have been a mess. That's why I think we achieve more when we work hard, volunteer, and have professions.\n\nFirst, we achieve more because of hard work. If we don't work, we can't pay taxes, take care of ourselves, or eat. These things are impossible without work. Some people think work is easy, but it requires effort and pain. I've seen people struggle in their lives. For example, I saw a man working outside in the rain last week. He was emotional because he had no family or home. If he had given up, he wouldn't have achieved anything. If we keep doing something, the world will be a better place.\n\nSecondly, we can volunteer to achieve something. We don't need to get paid to help others. When my parents or school need help, I volunteer. It doesn't mean I'm useless; it means I'm grateful and willing to help. I think volunteering is a great thing to do. If we stop helping others, we're not good people. We should always do something to achieve more, like helping people, treating them equally, and being positive.\n\nThirdly, some people think having a profession is easy. But it's not; it requires education, a diploma, and skills. Students need to be well-educated, graduate, and have experiences. Professionals work hard to be successful. Some students drop out of school when things get hard. But they shouldn't give up. They can do more than they think. We should fight to be successful and never stop. We should have confidence and hope that tomorrow will be better.\n\nTo be successful, we should always be doing something to achieve more. We shouldn't give up on important things, or we'll regret it. The worst thing we can do is sit back and watch others succeed. That's why I think if we're always doing something, we'll achieve more. The world needs more active people than lazy ones. So let's all come together and do more work to achieve more."}

We can tell our parents or family members where we are and when we'll be back. This way, they won't worry about us.

{"text_id_kaggle": "B16454E74A66", "output_essay": "Is it better to graduate from high school in three years instead of four? In this essay, I will argue that graduating in three years is better and easier because it gives you an extra year to do something that can help your future. We don't have to be the smartest; we just need to try hard and want to succeed.\n\nFirst, having an extra year can help you work harder and save money for college. This way, your parents won't have to worry about how to pay for your education. College is expensive and takes a lot of effort.\n\nSecond, if you start school with good grades, you'll do well in the end. You can join the military or go to college a year early. It's better to do things at a young age because you're focused on your own goals, and you don't have many responsibilities at home.\n\nThird, I knew a boy named Generic_Name in Brazil. He was very poor and sometimes didn't have food for his siblings. But he was smart and had big dreams. He wanted to earn a lot of money and buy a house for his mom, who had cancer and couldn't work. He felt bad that his older brother had to work to support the family instead of their mom. When Generic_Name decided to graduate early, he got motivated and started working hard. Family can make us grateful and motivated.\n\nSome people think that graduating in three years is the same as graduating in four, but they're wrong. If you graduate early, it's because you worked hard to get good grades. It's not the same. In conclusion, try your best, and you'll get better results. Not trying won't make you successful in life."}

You will be treated well, good things will happen, you will get more job opportunities, and you will meet new people.\n\nMy first reason is that people will be kind to you. For example, you can help someone with their shopping or give them a ride home. You can also just be nice to people.\n\nMy second reason is that good things will come to you. You can donate money to charity or speak up when something is not right. This will make you feel good about yourself and bring good things into your life.\n\nMy third reason is that you will get more job opportunities. During an interview, always be positive. This will make the interviewer want to hire you. If you get the job, be nice to customers and they will be nice back.\n\nMy final reason is that a good attitude helps you meet new people. When you meet someone new, be positive and friendly. This will show that you are a nice person and not arrogant. People with bad attitudes usually push others away.\n\nIn conclusion, a good attitude is important because you will be treated well, good things will happen, you will get more job opportunities, and you will meet new people.

You only get one life, and in this country, you either succeed or fail. Some people fail because they don't know how to talk to others properly.\n\nSometimes at school, you're taking a test and you're not confident. You tell your friends and even the teacher that you're going to fail, and then you really do fail. This is because you had negative thoughts that convinced you that you wouldn't pass. Now you're upset, your grade drops, and your parents are upset too.\n\nIn conclusion, you should always have a positive attitude in life. Your character says a lot about who you are, especially when you first meet someone. Always be positive at school and in interviews. Many people struggle every day because they're not successful.

The effort we put in also says a lot about the impression we give, and it's the best way to show we're professional.\n\nThe way we express ourselves to people also makes a difference.

That's when you need support from others. I think many people need help from their family, friends, or someone they trust.\n\nThere are also many people with mental health issues. A positive attitude can really help them. If more people are positive towards each other, there will be more support for everyone.\n\nThe problem is that many people don't want to ask for help. They might feel shy. But if I couldn't get help from someone, I would help myself by being positive and telling myself everything will be okay. Before I can help others, I need to help myself first.\n\nIn conclusion, life has its ups and downs. I believe that having a positive attitude is key to success. I want to spend my life being happy and positive, not negative and upset. I hope this essay will inspire people to be positive."}

It doesn't matter where you're from or where you're going, but what matters is being thankful for what you have now, not what you'll have later. A good attitude not only helps you achieve more, but it also makes you feel better inside, like having better health.

The second reason is that good things happen in life when people think positively. On the other hand, there are two reasons why people disagree. The first reason is that when they think positively, something bad happens. The second reason is that when people think positively, they don't get what they want. For example, many people were waiting for the new Fortnite season to come out. They were all thinking positively, expecting the season to start on July 13, 2019. On July 12, many people were happy, waiting for the new season to come out the next day. However, the day people were waiting for the new Fortnite season, it didn't come out. It took more than five days to come out, so people started thinking negatively. They got mad, quit the game, and hated the game because of the delay. Another example is my grandfather, who always tells me about his past. He talks to us about his past, to me and my cousins. My grandfather is a good person who always worries about others. He is one of those good people who like to help others and is not selfish. In the past, he worked hard for his parents and had to do two things: school and work. He didn't have much time to do his homework, but he always had a positive attitude. Now, he is a nice person who did better because he had a good attitude. He didn't disrespect people or family members. Now, he is living his best life. He has two daughters and three sons who help him. They are not rich, but they have good things because they work hard. People should have a positive attitude in life because good things will come to them. Good things happen to those who wait. The reason why good things happen to those who wait is that they always have a positive attitude. Many people disagree because they always think negatively. In the past, they had a positive attitude, but they may have learned a lesson. They probably waited for better things in life, but they never waited long enough. They just gave up, and now they disagree. They don't think the same because they got a lesson and gave up easily. People never get what they want, and they always have a bad feeling. Maybe they have been through a lot, and their life was not the best. But people should always wait. Even if you don't get what you want, you just have to wait. Maybe life doesn't give you what you want for something better. You just have to wait for it and have a positive attitude. For example, people have been through a lot. They lose their parents and have to live by themselves, which is hard. But they keep going with life, knowing they can do better. They keep a positive attitude.

I think this because it takes a lot of time, people lose confidence, and we tend to stick with our first impression.\n\nLet's start with time. It takes more than twenty times meeting someone to change your mind after their first impression. This can take more than a month. For example, when you approach someone you like, your first impression is important. If you make a bad impression, you'll have to meet them many times to change their mind. This can take a lot of time and effort.\n\nNext, people tend to lose confidence after a bad first impression. They start to doubt themselves and think they're not good enough. For example, when I tried out for my school soccer team, I had a bad start. Even though I worked hard, I still thought I wasn't good enough, so I didn't try out again.\n\nLastly, people tend to stick with their first impression. This happens every day when we meet someone new or go to an interview. For example, if someone shows up late to an interview, the interviewer might think they're not responsible.

It's essential to have a goal.\n\nTo succeed, start working towards your goals and think about what you want to achieve. Be yourself, because no one can change who you are. If something is bad, just ignore it. The main idea is to keep moving forward.\n\nPeople have different views on individuality, which is about being different from others. We need to learn to be ourselves and not compare ourselves to others. If we're surrounded by people who support us, we can do it.\n\nEven if we know what we want to achieve, we might not be sure how to get there.

Many people get nervous and answer incorrectly, which is bad for them. In the end, they lose their chance.\n\nMany students, for instance, get stressed about presentations. It's hard for them to express themselves in front of others because they think their friends will think badly of them. This doesn't motivate them.\n\nGoals are important, especially for young people.

My counselor showed me my classes, and I tried to remember the class number and how to get there. It was lunchtime, and everyone was going to the cafeteria. I was lost. I asked a classmate to show me the way, but she didn't answer. Instead, she started using her phone. I didn't like what she did. I thought she was mean, and I went to find the way myself.

If you meet someone for the first time and don't like them, your opinion will change as you talk to them. Sometimes the person will prove you right, but I believe first impressions will change.\n\nWe live in a society where we judge people by their race, religion, gender, and appearance. We shouldn't judge people by how they look or react. I remember my first day of school in America three years ago. I was the only Hijabi in my class, and everyone stared at me. Some asked me questions, and some gave me a weird look.\n\nSome people lack confidence and find it hard to talk to others. Being shy is one reason for not making a good first impression. They don't know how to start a conversation or speak loudly.\n\nWe all make an image of someone we meet for the first time in our minds before knowing them. The image can be good or bad.

So, what is a first impression? It's the feeling we get when we meet someone or something for the first time, and it's hard to change.\n\nFirst, our feelings about a first impression can be good or bad. They create a memory in our minds, like \"that guy is bad\" or \"she is nice\". For example, I saw a boy helping an old lady cross the street in the park. Right then, I thought he was a good person. The next day, when I saw him again, I remembered that he was good. That impression is hard to change.\n\nAnother reason is that when we hear something bad, we get a bad first impression. We try to avoid it, and that makes it hard to understand the other person's side. For example, in middle school, I had a classmate who always looked sad. Nobody knew why, and nobody was friends with her. If someone had asked her why she was sad, they might have felt sorry for her and changed their mind about her.\n\nWhen we misunderstand someone, it can cause a lot of problems.

For example, my friend was going to try to graduate early, but she changed her mind. She knew it was better to take hard classes in high school where she had more help.\n\nStudents who stay in school for four years also have more fun.

{"text_id_kaggle": "44C1C893E1F4", "output_essay": "One topic that people often discuss is whether having a good attitude is important for success. Some people think it's not necessary. They believe that just doing their job is enough to achieve their goals. I think a good attitude is important for success because it can bring more opportunities, more trust, and a willingness to learn.\n\nOne reason a good attitude is important is that it makes you enjoy your work. When you go to work with a smile and greet everyone, it shows you want to be there and work with them. If your boss calls you in one day and you show up with a good attitude, they will think you like your job and want to do better. Your boss may even consider promoting you to a higher level, where you can learn more and take on new challenges.\n\nAnother reason is that a good attitude can inspire others. When you have a good attitude, people are more likely to open up to you and share their problems. You can help them by suggesting ways to change their negative attitude. For example, if your friend tells you they have a negative attitude, you can suggest doing something fun together or trying meditation.\n\nFinally, a good attitude can help you think of new ideas. You can share these ideas with your boss or use them to make your work more enjoyable. For example, during a meeting, if you have an idea that can improve a proposed concept, you can discuss it with your boss and suggest alternative solutions. This may lead to your idea being accepted, or even prompt your boss to ask you to come up with another innovative idea.\n\nAs you can see, a good attitude is important for success because it can lead to a willingness to learn, more opportunities, and greater trust. If we have a good attitude, we will have a better life. One day, society will thrive with good attitudes and succeed in their endeavors."}
{"text_id_kaggle": "2A6C395EAC9A", "output_essay": "Schools that let students graduate early might not be as great as they seem. In fact, they can cause problems for students after they graduate. You might think that graduating early means you're more likely to succeed, but that's not always true. I think students should think carefully before choosing to graduate early. For me, four years of high school are always the best because of three reasons: choosing electives, having less work, and having more time to think about the future.\n\nFirst, choosing an elective is a fun process where you pick a class you're interested in. This is great for finding something you enjoy or want to learn more about. You can take the class for free in high school, which is better than paying for it in college. Some people might say you can teach yourself or go to college for a better education, but I disagree. You might not have the time, resources, or money, and you'll have to pay for the class in college. So, having an extra year can save you from making a mistake.\n\nThe second reason four years of high school are important is that it's less work. Why would you take extra classes or spend your summer taking a class? You could work, study, or enjoy your free time instead. Taking too many classes can lead to stress and failure.\n\nThe last reason is that you have time to think about your future before entering the real world. I've seen students who didn't think about their future and ended up stuck or ruined. Some students who take the three-year route don't know what they want to do in life, if they're financially stable, or if they have opportunities. There are jobs that require you to be at least 18 years old, and some students are only 16. Colleges are expensive, and families can't always afford it, so students might have to go into debt or drop out. If you don't know what you want to do, you might end up doing nothing for a year or two and giving up on a better future.\n\nIn conclusion, if you have the option to graduate early, don't rush into it. Think carefully about what you want and make sure you have a clear plan after high school. The four years you get are important and should be used to take free courses, have less work, and think about your future. That's why I support four years instead of three."}

Making your own strong decisions shows people that you're not listening to them.\n\nI know that everyone's future will be brighter because I saw a girl who never listened to others trying to bring her down. She was focused on what she wanted to do and showed others that she could do it on her own. She was happy in the end. If you be yourself and don't worry about what others think, your future will be big and successful. People will try to influence you to do bad things, but you have to be strong enough to say, 'I'm going on my own.'

We create an image in our mind based on what we've seen before.\n\nWhen we're impressed by someone, it's because they remind us of someone or something we've seen before. Our mind is like a photo album, and it helps us remember things we've seen before. Depending on how we react to someone, we can't change how we feel about them later.\n\nIn conclusion, I think we should think before we act. Our brain helps us remember things we've done before, and it creates images in our mind. How we react to someone depends on how our body and mind work together. So, I think first impressions are hard to change because we can't go back in time and fix them."}

I think being myself in a world that tries to make me someone else is the greatest accomplishment.\n\nFirst, being myself helps me be honest. Honesty is good because people trust what I say. If I do something good, people will do it too. Some people lie to impress others, but lying is not good. It can hurt my life. I think if people really like me, they will accept my mistakes. It's like when you start to know someone and you tell them about yourself.\n\nSecond, being myself makes me feel secure. Some people think changing who they are will change their past or how they looked before. They think changing their appearance will change how they treat people, but many change because someone hurt them. They don't want to go back to bad memories. Others love who they are and don't want to change because they feel secure.\n\nLastly, when I'm myself, people will love me because I'm not trying to be someone else. People treat me the way I show them I am. If I show them my true self, they won't doubt me. People love people who are true to themselves. When I'm not true to myself, people think I'm lying, even if I'm telling the truth. But when I'm myself and tell the truth, they trust me more.\n\nAs you've read, I agree with the quote.

I think we should always be ourselves and not change for someone else.\n\nI don't agree with Ralph Waldo Emerson's quote that says to be yourself, you have to do something great.

Some people think it's not a good idea because students won't get the full high school education. But the program is for dedicated students who want to move forward. They can graduate early if they meet the requirements.\n\nThe program gives students a year to focus on their future goals. For example, they can do internships in jobs they're interested in. They can try out different jobs to see what they like best. They can also start college right away if they know what they want to study. If they don't like the course, they can try something else. They won't feel like they wasted a year.\n\nThis program is good for students who need to save money for college. They can take another year to work and save.

{"text_id_kaggle": "A111AFDA609A", "output_essay": "Some school districts offer programs that let high school students graduate in three years instead of four. This is a good idea because students get a year to earn money for college, take a break, and learn to manage their time.\n\nOne reason is that students can work and save money for college. Some students want to pay for their own education, not their parents'. By graduating early, they can work and save for a year. For example, if you want to be a teacher but can't afford it, you can finish high school in three years, work and save, and then start your career.\n\nAnother reason is that students can take a break after graduating. Some students think four years of high school is too much. By doing only three years, they can take a break from waking up early, taking tests, and worrying about grades. For example, a friend did high school in three years and then took a year-long trip. She said it was amazing because she didn't have to worry about school. After the trip, she went to college.\n\nA final reason is that students learn to manage their time. With only three years of high school, students have to deal with projects, tests, homework, and courses. They learn to prioritize tasks, like deciding when to do a project and when to study. This skill helps them in the future, whether at college or a job.\n\nIn summary, doing three years of high school helps students earn money for college, take a break, and become organized.

{"text_id_kaggle": "00E3943E1CBC", "output_essay": "One topic that is often discussed today is whether schools should offer programs that let students graduate in three years instead of the usual four years. Some people think this program is a new and better way to finish high school. They believe it can give students an advantage in life, prepare them for the world outside of high school, and give them time to plan their future careers. I think students should graduate from high school in three years instead of four because it gives them more time to plan their careers, makes them work harder, and reduces their stress.\n\nOne reason students should consider graduating in three years is the extra time it gives them. Planning a career takes a lot of time. You need to find out how much it costs, which schools are best for your chosen career, and more. Having an extra year can be helpful, but it's up to the student to make the most of it. If you can't afford college, this extra year can give you time to work and save money. You can also use this time to decide if college is right for you or if you want to start working.\n\nThe second reason students should graduate in three years is that it challenges them. To graduate early, students need to take extra classes, either in the summer or after school. This helps them prepare for the real world, where things aren't always easy. It takes willpower to overcome obstacles, and graduating in three years shows that you can do it.\n\nThe third reason to graduate in three years is that it reduces stress. Stress is a big problem for teenagers, and it can cause them to make bad decisions, like dropping out of school. According to a study, 2 out of 10 students drop out every year. As you can see, graduating in three years is better for students because it helps them prepare for the future and reduces their stress.

They might take longer to finish college, and they might have trouble reaching their career goals.\n\nIn conclusion, I don't think it's a good idea for students to finish high school in three years and go to college.

If you get nervous, it's okay, but don't give up. If we believe we can do it, then we can. Always do your best and don't be nervous.\n\nFirst impressions are hard to change because some of us feel awkward talking to people.

This program lets students go to college one year early or start working.\n\nGetting a head start is a big advantage in achieving their goals. It's a good idea for students to finish high school in three years and enter college or the workforce one year early. This way, students who moved from another country can catch up.\n\nFor example, let's say a student named Generic_Name came to the US from Mexico. She's supposed to be in 10th grade, but since she doesn't speak English, she's in 9th grade. Generic_Name can join a program to finish high school in three years. This way, she can catch up and won't have to do an extra year. Finishing high school early also helps her get to college on time.\n\nFinishing high school early is also good because it gives students a head start in college or the workforce. For example, Generic_Name wants to work for a year and then go to college. Finishing high school early helps him achieve his goals without wasting time. It's a big advantage for students who want to do two careers in college.\n\nSome people might say that students should attend all four years of high school because they'll learn more without too much pressure. This makes sense, since students would feel a lot of pressure taking many classes and spending a lot of time on school. However, finishing school early can be helpful to students who don't want to be in school for too long. For example, Generic_Name doesn't like school and just wants to finish. He can join the program and finish school early, so he won't be in school for long.\n\nIn summary, the program helps students finish high school early, which benefits them. Students will be more successful, having one year ahead to enter college or start working. Giving students from another country the opportunity to attend this program makes it easier for them to catch up and graduate on time. Even though some people might say it's not a good idea to finish high school in three years due to the pressure, finishing high school early is a big advantage for those who want to go to college and for those who moved from another country."}

Two big achievements are graduating from high school or college, and starting your own business or career.\n\nGraduating from high school is a great achievement because it can lead to a good job that pays well. You can also start your own business, which can make you more money and allow you to choose who works for you. The more people you hire, the more your business will grow.\n\nBut no matter what, just be yourself. Don't let others control your life or decisions. If you do, you won't be successful and won't get your dream job, house, or car. So, don't let anyone control you.\n\nThe most important thing is to succeed and achieve what you want in life."}

For example, when I introduce myself and someone ignores me, I get a bad impression. We all get first impressions every day. We can't change how others think or feel about someone they've just met.\n\nI don't think we can change first impressions easily. We can't tell someone what to think when they first meet someone. The only way to change their mind is to talk to them for a while. First impressions happen quickly, and we can't control how others think. People ask why we get first impressions. It's because we don't know much about someone at first. First impressions shouldn't hurt our feelings because they're just someone's thoughts and actions.\n\nFirst impressions can help us make friends and try new things. People can be nice, rude, talkative, or sweet. They might give us a good or bad impression. We shouldn't always expect a good impression from someone. But most people try to make a good impression."}
{"text_id_kaggle": "BCD439F8FE86", "output_essay": "I'm excited to share my thoughts on high school students attending high school for three or four years before college.\n\nFirst, let's talk about the four-year option. \n\nMost high school students, about 80%, struggle with the four-year term. High school courses are flexible, so most students can finish their courses in three years and still have time to take extra classes. \n\nI think it's better for high school students to attend for three years instead of four. They can use the extra year to work and save money for college. They can get full-time jobs to support themselves.\n\nNot all parents can help their kids after high school. Many students, about 70%, have to work hard to support themselves. Most students work after school, which helps. Some students need extra time to catch up on what they don't understand. If they attend high school for four years, it will be tough for them to balance work and school. They might fall behind in school, which is sad.\n\nBut if they attend for three years, most students will realize they don't have much time left. So, if they work, they'll limit their work hours and focus on school. They'll know they have one more year to work full-time after high school.\n\nI'm sure that if the authorities take this seriously, it will help high school students a lot.\n\nAdditionally, I want to talk about summer school. During summer break, not all students stay in the state. Some travel with their families, about 70%. The rest might not, so if the school board offers summer classes, it helps students finish their courses early or retake failed classes. But they should understand that not all students will stay; most will travel. They should consider this when planning summer classes, even if students attend high school for three years."}

Students should take this chance and take required courses during the summer and evening instead of electives. This way, they can graduate early. Once they graduate, they can start college early. Many students want to start college early because it can help them in life. They can get a career and start working sooner. Starting college a year early is a big relief for students. They finish college sooner and don't have to worry about another year of school. Not all students want to go to college, though. Those who don't can go straight to work. In that extra year, they can think about what they want to do or try new things. It's okay if students don't want to go to college. They don't have to. But they should take the chance to graduate early. In conclusion, graduating early is a great idea. It gets students out of high school a year early, and it's worth it. If students take the three-year program, they won't have time for selective classes, but they'll have more free time in the summer and afternoons. In the end, it's all worth it."}

Most people in the world do not have a positive attitude, so I agree with those who do. It's better to have many people with a positive attitude.\n\nSome people are always angry for no reason. They don't know that they come across as bad people and affect those around them. They need to change because people don't like to be around those with a bad attitude.\n\nFor example, I went to a restaurant with my family, and the manager was very rude. But another manager was nice and said he never gets angry with customers. He always has a positive attitude. Everyone in the restaurant said they would be happy to go back if all managers were like him. My family agreed that happy people are successful.\n\nHaving a positive attitude means being happy and smiling when you meet people. When someone talks to you, be nice and respectful. People who are always unhappy are not good to be around. That's why it's important to have a positive attitude.\n\nYou should also help others, including your family, to have a positive attitude. Sometimes, your sister or cousin might not know that a positive attitude is key to success. You should be a good example to others. A positive attitude is very important in life, and it can help you become a better person with a better future.\n\nI hope most people have a positive attitude because it's the key to success.

{"text_id_kaggle": "9D7C27E25723", "output_essay": "People with negative personalities often let their negativity affect their whole lives. Negative thoughts fill their minds and stop them from being motivated. Positivity is key to making an effort to get things done. If someone starts a task thinking it will fail, that thought will affect their work. A product is more likely to be successful if the creator believes it will do well. Someone who expects a project to fail will not put in much effort. They think that no matter how hard they try, the outcome will be the same. This mindset hurts productivity because negativity lowers the quality of the final product. Positivity is very important for completing a task successfully.\n\nAnother reason positivity is important is that it makes people more willing to take risks. Positivity inspires people to take on new challenges because they expect good things to come out of it. People grow by trying new things with a positive attitude, and they succeed when they keep that attitude. \n\nSome people think positivity does not help someone become successful. They think being positive is fake motivation. They think positivity does not affect achieving goals. People who do not care and are not willing to try are likely to agree. Others make decisions based on facts. Some people think things through logically. It is better to think positively because it encourages people to succeed. Not caring does not help anyone because they are not willing to take risks. Realistic people focus on facts, but they ignore encouragement.\n\nA realistic view of life can be helpful, but positivity is still better. This is because positive people work harder, resulting in higher productivity, and people want to work with someone who is positive. It may be easy to give up and think the future is out of control, but this view is very negative. This negativity makes it impossible to succeed because success needs motivation and a positive vision for the future. Expecting good things can encourage someone to work hard and stay determined. Therefore, the importance of thinking positively cannot be ignored. A positive attitude can easily lead to success in life because positivity makes life more enjoyable and easier."}

Imagine staying at school until late to take extra classes instead of doing activities or joining clubs. Imagine spending all your time in high school just studying and doing homework. Is that really good for students?\n\nFirst, everyone knows high school is a special time. Students go to school to learn, but also to have fun, make friends, and enjoy themselves. Even adults wish they could go back to high school. So, how can students enjoy high school if they have to study all the time? Just to finish one year early?\n\nSecond, finishing high school in three years sounds easy, but it's not. There's no shortcut to success. We all know we need to pass twenty-two classes to graduate. Some high schools also require elective courses. If you try to finish in three years, you'll have a lot of work. You'll get more homework, and less time for yourself. You'll even have to work during summer. I don't think students won't be stressed after that!\n\nThird, we need to understand what 'learn' means. Learn means we understand lessons, questions, or problems by working, practicing, and getting used to them over time. But students are taking too many classes at the same time; they're just studying, not learning. They're trying to pass the class to get credit. How can students learn with ten hours at school, and the rest of the time doing homework at home? There's no point in finishing one year early.\n\nIn the end, the idea of finishing high school in three years and entering college or the workforce one year early is not good. The special time of high school should not be wasted. Do things for yourself, don't let anyone force you. It's very stressful to finish high school in three years. And the most important thing is learning naturally, letting knowledge flow into your brain, and not rushing it. Be a regular high school student, and enjoy the special time."}

There's a debate about whether schools should let students study for three years in high school instead of four. Some people think it's better for students to study for just three years because they can finish college and start working earlier. However, I think students should finish high school in the usual four years because of the knowledge, saving money, and time to think about their career.\n\nOne reason I think students should study for four years is because of the knowledge. Students who study for four years may have better knowledge and more chances to get into their preferred university. People who study for four years may be more prepared in college than those who studied for just three. My brother studied for just three years in high school and struggled in college; he had to stay after school to study more because he didn't understand everything in class. To pass my exams, I have to study for weeks, and students who follow this program may have to study during summer or evenings, which can be stressful.\n\nAnother reason I think students should study for four years is because it helps them save money. When you study for four years, you can take more classes and earn credits. Some students know what career they want, so they can start taking classes they'll need in college. During their last year, they can work and save money without worrying about losing a year of school. Their student loan may be smaller if they take important classes in high school that they'll need in college. College is often expensive, and not everyone can afford it, but taking important classes in high school can save money.\n\nThe final reason I think students should study for four years is because they have more time to think about their future career. Choosing a career has been the hardest thing for me, but my fourth year in high school gave me more time to think about my options. This year, I have more classes that interest me, like art or music, which gave me an idea of what I can do in the future since I love painting. Many students discover their talent in their last year. I think the last year gives you time to earn more credits and figure out what you want to study in the future.\n\nAs you've read, studying four years may be the best option if you're a high school student. You can think about how much money you can save by taking classes in high school. You can have better knowledge and more advantages. Students can benefit if they study for four years. That's why I think students should study the traditional four years."}

This helps you focus on your own thoughts without confusion. Next, people who rely on themselves do a better job on their own. They usually do a great job on a project instead of working in a group. This is because they know what is right, but in a group, people often get input from everyone. Furthermore, being independent helps you achieve your goals quickly. Without doubts or misunderstandings, you are in charge, and that's what makes you successful. Lastly, independent people are often surprising. They do unexpected things, and that's why they can achieve their goals quickly.\n\nIn conclusion, being an individual means relying only on yourself. You know what you can and can't do.

Good first impressions are great, but bad ones are not. They can affect people's lives and careers. It's essential to make a good first impression on others and get a good impression of them too.\n\nFor example, if you go to a job interview wearing a bad-looking suit, the manager will think you're not responsible and won't care about the job. But you might have a reason, like being sick and waking up late, so you didn't have time to dress up. The manager won't hire you because of the bad first impression. Similarly, if you talk rudely during the interview, the manager will think you're not a good communicator and won't hire you. You might have had a bad day, but the manager's first impression was bad.\n\nIn my freshman year of high school, a new student joined our school. He was good-looking and seemed nice. I became friends with him, but as I got to know him better, I realized he wasn't a good person. He would talk behind my back and say bad things. I decided not to be friends with him anymore. My first impression of him changed. Sometimes, first impressions can be wrong.\n\nIn my junior year, I met a girl I liked. She was beautiful and had a great style. At first, she didn't like me; she thought I was annoying. But as she got to know me better, she started to like me, and her first impression changed. I asked her out, and she said yes. We've been dating for almost two years now.\n\nFirst impressions matter, but they might not always be accurate. They can stay with you forever, but sometimes they don't show the real person. I'm sure they're important, but as you get to know people better, your first impression will change. Always try to make a good first impression and be yourself, so others can see the real you from the start."}

For example, you go on a date with a girl you met on the phone. You plan a perfect date, but something goes wrong. You get nervous and say something stupid, and she gets mad and leaves. You think it's over, but it's not. You can text her and say sorry, explain that you were nervous, and ask to start over. If she agrees, you change your first impression. I've done it before.

In my view, first impressions are hard to change because they are based on emotions, experiences, and memories. They are shaped by how we express our feelings.\n\nWe all go through emotional ups and downs every day. We react differently to situations, like taking a test. I might be scared, but you might be calm. I think everyone has their own way of thinking and being reasonable.\n\nMany people have had different experiences when they were young. Some have good memories of their childhood, while others don't remember much. For example, I grew up with my older sister, who was like a mother to me. I'm grateful to her because she took good care of me. Compared to others who were abandoned by their families, I think we share a similarity in not growing up with our parents. However, there's a difference in who took care of us. I grew up in a good environment, but not everyone did. That's why I think our impressions can't be changed.\n\nMemories are like a shared experience with family and friends. They can make us kinder depending on how we shared those moments. People think bad things can be changed over time, but I believe our feelings can't be changed. We might change our thoughts, but not how we feel. For instance, if the smartest student in class got an A+ and I got an F, I might think they're smart, but I'd still feel bad because I could've done better.\n\nThere are many ways to understand conflicts in the world.

Even though my mom doesn't like my choice, I will still pursue it and try to convince her. I don't see the point of trying to please people if I'm not happy with myself.

As the Spanish saying goes, 'Don't judge a book by its cover without knowing what's inside.'\n\nCan we really change our first impressions? I think we can. There are many things that influence how others see us, like how we look, act, and dress. I've seen people change their first impression with time. For example, when people first meet me, they think I'm rude because I don't talk much. But that's not true.

Everyone can change their first impression with a little time. We can also change how we look, but we need help and time to do it. If others don't help us see that we need to change, we won't. It also depends on the people around us. If I'm in a group where everyone talks and I don't, it's hard for me to change their impression.\n\nBut if I want to change, I need to try harder and get out of my comfort zone.

{"text_id_kaggle": "AE31275EE38F", "output_essay": "It's often said that first impressions are hard to change. This is because they stay with us until we move to a new place. Some people think that first impressions show how we behave. When we experience something, it's hard to change because it becomes a part of us. First impressions are hard to change because they are inside us, they shape us, and we create them.\n\nFirst, our surroundings shape our first impressions. For example, if we grow up in a good community, we'll become a good person, and that goodness will stay with us. Our behavior is a result of our first impressions. Another example is if we grow up in a family that values peace and calm discussions, we'll develop good behavior and earn respect.\n\nAdditionally, our first impressions grow with us. If we experience something from a young age, it's hard to let go or change it. It's difficult to change something we've known our whole life and have a strong connection with. For instance, if we grow up with a pet from childhood, it's hard to give it up or replace it because of our strong bond.\n\nThe most important thing is that we create our own first impressions. If we create a special impression inside ourselves, it's hard to change because it's deep in our hearts. When we create something, it's hard to change or remove, just like first impressions.\n\nSome people argue that first impressions can change. They say that if we move to a new place and have new experiences, our impressions will change. This might be true, but only if we move to a new place. If we stay in one place, our first impressions will remain the same.

However, I don't think it's a good idea for students to finish school early because their brains are still developing and they might not know what to do after graduation.\n\nOne reason is that graduating early can be disappointing. Students who graduate early miss out on experiences that help them focus on their future. They work hard to graduate early, but then they don't know what to do next. As a result, they might waste a year partying and lose focus sooner.\n\nAnother reason is that spending more time in high school makes students more experienced and understanding. High school teaches us about life after graduation and the real world. We learn more by finishing four years than by graduating early.\n\nGraduating early can also hurt students' self-esteem. They might struggle to decide what to do next. Summer courses are meant to help students catch up, not to let them graduate early without a plan.\n\nFor example, imagine a 17-year-old student who graduates early without knowing what to do. She might party and do whatever she wants, but she won't have the same experiences as an 18-year-old student who graduates later. The 18-year-old student has more experiences and knows what to do next.\n\nBoth students learn the same things in school, but they have different experiences.

I think people can't hide who they are, and sometimes bad behavior can lead to a bad opinion. However, showing how you've grown from a bad experience can help you build a good relationship with someone. This helps you see what you can improve on.\n\nFirst, I believe impressions are just a small part of how others see us. They're based on how we acted in the past. If people get to know us better, they might change their minds. For example, when someone gets a new job, they might seem happy and talkative at first, but later they might become quiet and unhappy.\n\nSecond, people often make judgments about each other based on a few characteristics. For instance, when I think of a police officer, I might think they'll arrest me or give me a ticket. But that's not always true. My impression was wrong because I got a ticket for breaking the rules.\n\nAlso, first impressions don't always show who we really are. When we meet someone, we don't know their personality. We can only judge based on what we see. Speaking from experience, I used to greet my teachers with a simple 'hi' or 'what's up.' But I learned to be more respectful and use the right words. Now my teachers are proud of me because they've seen how I've changed.\n\nIn conclusion, impressions are not just what we see; they're also a judgment.

Your first impression reveals how you were raised, the time you spend with family and friends, and your job.\n\nWhen people meet for the first time, they often notice a person's character. This shows how your parents raised you and the kind of friends you have. Older people can usually tell a person's character right away because they have met many people and gained experience. Your friends also play a big role in shaping your impression. They reflect on your impression, and you reflect on theirs.\n\nYour impression shows how you interact with the world. This includes your beliefs, time with family and friends, and activities. If you engage in good activities, spend time with family and friends, and help others, it becomes part of your impression. It shows how you live your life and how you are respected in society.\n\nSometimes, your impression can even help you get a job. It depends on the impression you make on others. If you meet someone with a positive attitude and respect, it can help you get a job. It creates a good impression and reminds others that you are a potential job candidate.

The way someone looks doesn't mean they act a certain way. The more you're around someone, the more you get to know them.\n\nYour first impression is probably going to be your worst impression. It shouldn't be that important because people can always change. I'm a shy person, and one day my friend asked me if I needed a ride home.\n\nI almost said no because meeting new people stresses me out. But I got in the car, and her mom asked where I lived. I forgot and struggled to give her directions. She might have thought I was stupid, but now she thinks of me like one of her own sons.\n\nMany people judge others based on their past. Maybe someone has gotten into trouble before and does bad things, and you don't know them. You might think they still do, but that's not always true. People change, and when you meet them, you'll probably think differently about them. The way someone looks doesn't mean they act a certain way.\n\nYou shouldn't judge people based on how they look. In middle school, I had a class with a boy from Africa. He wore big, dusty clothes every day. My friends didn't talk to him because they thought he was in a gang and didn't speak good English. At the end of the year, we had to write about ourselves without describing how we look. We had to write about what we like to do and why. Nobody could find the boy who liked soccer and writing poems. Maybe it would have been easier if my friends had talked to him. He was a cool and interesting person.\n\nFirst impressions are hard to make, but they should be easier knowing they will change. It may be harder for some people and easier for others. The past is not the present, and people change over time. Also, you shouldn't judge people by how they look. When you really get to know someone, that's when you find out who they really are."}

Being yourself is the best way to grow as a person, because you can be whoever you want, enjoy fun activities, and show the world you don't need others to make your dreams come true.\n\nOne good thing about being yourself is that you show the world who you really are. We live in a world where famous people influence us, but just because you like a character in a movie doesn't mean you have to be like them. Remember, they show us how our choices can affect others, including our family and friends. Another good thing about being yourself is that you show others what you think, what you're good at, and how you handle situations.\n\nThe second good thing about being yourself is that you get to choose what you like. For example, you can play a sport you want, wear clothes that make you feel comfortable, and do things that reflect your personality. When you do things on your own, you don't need others' opinions, which is good because it shows you can make a difference in the world based on your own thoughts. Once you do things that interest you, you'll see how happy life can be.\n\nThe third good thing about being yourself is that you can pursue your dreams no matter how hard it is. Anything is possible when you want something badly. A great example is the person who started Kentucky Fried Chicken. He had many failures before becoming famous for his chicken. He lost loved ones and tried different jobs, but he always failed. One day, he decided to sell chicken on a bridge without asking for help. He became very popular, and his restaurants are now all around the world.\n\nOverall, we realize that you can be anything in this world without following others. When you know what makes you happy, you'll know what fun activities to do, and you'll remember that no matter how many times you fall, you'll always get back up, and that will make you stronger and smarter to achieve your goals."}

If you just show up like you would at home, they might think differently of you and not hire you.\n\nWhen I looked for a job, I told them I was a hard worker with some experience and that I wanted to work for their company. During the conversation, the interviewer said I was good at everything they needed for the job, and they asked when I could start. I said I could start as soon as possible. Even though it was my first job, my good first impression helped me get a good job. The words I said showed them I was ready and willing to work hard.\n\nIf I had shown up with a bad impression, like being dirty and not dressed up, they would have thought differently of me. If I had said I wasn't ready for the job and needed two weeks to prepare, they wouldn't have wanted me to work for their company. They would have thought I wasn't ready for the job, didn't dress properly, and didn't want to work. I would still be looking for a job.\n\nSo, do I think first impressions are impossible to change?

First impressions matter in many situations, like job interviews, meeting new people, and first dates.\n\nIn a job interview, making a good first impression is crucial. The way someone dresses can show how serious they are about the job. If they wear dirty clothes and have a bad attitude, the interviewers will think they're not serious about the job. Some people might think, 'What if they can't afford nice clothes?' But if they're really serious, they'll try their best to impress.\n\nWhen meeting new people, a simple action can say a lot about them. For example, a big hug can show they're friendly and outgoing. On the other hand, a mean look or comment can show they're sometimes rude. Some people might be friendly at first but turn out to be rude later. But many people are nice from the start and stay that way.\n\nOn a first date, people try to make a good impression. They might tell jokes to seem funny or be polite to seem interesting. Some people might think, 'What if they're lying and trying to be someone they're not?'

For example, I played football with a group in the park, and we would say hi to each other. One day, I noticed a kid had no friends, so I invited him to dinner at my home. Later, I found out he stole $20 from my wallet. I caught him and asked, 'Why did you steal from me?' He said, 'I'm sorry, I need money for my brother's lunch; my family is poor.' I apologized and gave him $40 because I saw he was telling the truth. Three days later, he paid me back, saying, 'I got a job; the extra $20 helped me get a haircut and look better, and it helped me feel better about myself.' After that, we became best friends, even though he tried to steal from me, because he did it for a good reason.

When you try to change for someone else, you won't have as many friends as someone who is being themselves.

For example, I know someone who used to be very nice and kind. But when he started high school, he changed his attitude and behavior to fit in with his new friends. I think his new friends changed him because he started acting differently around them.\n\nAnother reason I agree with Emerson is that people will pressure you to become someone you're not. They change to fit in with other groups. For example, I knew someone who wanted to be friends with a certain group, but she wasn't sure she'd fit in. So she tried to talk to them, but they ignored her. After a while, she stopped talking to our friend group, and we didn't know why until I found out that the other group told her to stop talking to us to fit in. So she stopped talking to us and joined the other group.\n\nI think that if you're not yourself and people change you, it's not good, and nothing good comes from it.

So, look for the positive side of things and don't stress.\n\nLive each day as if it's your last, because you never know what will happen. When things get tough, think positively. Your attitude is key to how you live your life. I've met people who disagree with me, and that's okay. But I won't change my mind just because of them. We need people who bring us peace and good attitudes.\n\nWhen you have many problems, think positively and find a way out. Nothing is easy, but a positive attitude makes it more manageable. You won't think about bad things that can happen. Just be positive, and your life will be better."}

They make sacrifices, but they get to graduate early. Once they're in college, they can work at a slower pace, knowing they finished high school quickly.\n\nPeople who graduate early have an advantage when applying to college. Colleges see that they graduated early with good grades. They can also apply faster than others in their high school. This gives them a good chance of getting in.\n\nThat's why I think it's good that people finish high school in three years. They have more time to think about their future.

Many people think that first impressions are the most important because they reveal who you are. I don't agree that first impressions are hard to change.\n\nNothing is impossible to change. Sometimes it takes time to see if our first impression was right or not. For example, I met someone at school two years ago. We spoke the same language, and I was excited to meet her. But she didn't seem interested and just stared at me. I thought she was unfriendly and not calm. The next day, she invited me to sit with her, and later she helped me understand the school system. Now she's one of my best friends. My first impression was wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, my first impression of an old friend was great. I thought she was smart, nice, and helpful. But one time, she ruined my artwork because she was jealous. This made me realize that judging people based on first impressions isn't fair.\n\nFirst impressions aren't just about people; they can be about places, animals, or countries. For instance, I had to leave my old job for a new one. My first day was difficult, and I thought the job was too hard. But I remembered that my first impression could be wrong. I needed to understand the job better and practice. Now I realize that the employees are very supportive, and it's not that hard to learn.\n\nSome people think that first impressions are the image you want to present to others. While it's true that first impressions can be hard to change, people can change their minds over time. If someone wants to change their first impression, they need to change themselves.\n\nIn conclusion, it's never impossible to change a first impression. If someone is trying to change others' minds, they need to be patient and prove themselves. Believing in ourselves and trying our best is the key to changing bad first impressions."}

If they graduate in three years, they might not be able to get into college.

I only knew three words: 'Hi,' 'Bye,' and that's it. Now, when I think about those three words, I laugh. But look at me now - I've learned a lot of words, conversations, and more.

It leaves them unprepared when they enter the real world. Students who take this path spend less time on extracurricular activities because they're only focused on studying. Students should take the normal route and graduate high school or college in the standard four years.\n\nStudents who choose this program are not doing themselves any favors. It might work for some, but for most, it's not beneficial. Instead, it increases the chances of not having a successful future. There's a set process for everyone to graduate, and there shouldn't be any shortcuts. It should be a gradual process that helps students develop naturally. We shouldn't rush through school just to be quicker than others. Going to school every day and following a routine teaches discipline, time management, and patience.\n\nA student who rushes through school is not ready for the real world. By graduating early, they're not prepared for the challenges they'll face. Students should enter their professional life through a proper path.

They could use that extra year in college or take a gap year to figure out what they want to do. This could be helpful, but I still believe students should finish high school in the usual four years. The system is designed this way for a reason, and it's necessary for students to transition from high school to college and their professional lives.

From my experience, I think that if you do things with a positive attitude, you will get a good result. The problem is that it's hard to stay positive because there's always something that makes us feel bad, like taking a hard class in school and worrying about the consequences. So, most people are actually making themselves fail. They think negatively, saying things like, 'If I don't pass the class, I'll have to repeat the year,' or 'I'll lose my chance to go to college.' I think we're just wasting our time thinking like that instead of studying and making good use of our time. But I also think that if we fail, it's okay because that's how we learn.

Later, I needed to get another job, so I used Google to fill out applications. I got an interview, and I was praying that my coworkers would speak Spanish. But when I arrived, I was shocked because no one spoke Spanish. I was more scared than before and thought I wouldn't get the job. I was about to leave, but then I called my father. He told me, 'Son, I know you're alone, but if you never try, you'll never know what's waiting for you.' He reminded me of my accomplishments, like winning a drawing contest at school. I realized that my father was right. If you do things with a positive attitude, you'll get a good result, and if you do things with a negative attitude, you'll fail.\n\n\"I think we always need to experience failure to learn from it. Everyone has something they're not confident about, like sports or solving problems. So, I stood up, smiled, and went to the manager's office for the interview.

It's important to be honest and say what we feel.\n\nWhen we first meet someone, we get a first impression. But we can't judge someone based on that. We need to get to know them better. We've all had friends who seem serious or don't like certain things, and we think we'll never be friends. But if we spend time with them and share things, our thoughts about them can change. We can become good friends.\n\nIn conclusion, living in a world that tries to control who we are is the worst thing that can happen. We'll never know the real people, their feelings, thoughts, and wishes. That's why we need to be free to be ourselves. We'll never be happy if someone else controls us. The happiness we show won't be ours; it will be theirs. So, everyone needs to be free and be who they want to be with people who make them comfortable."}

Working with a group helps you learn from others and makes things easier. This way, you can achieve your goals and be successful. I think being yourself is not enough to guarantee success, and working with a group is the best way to achieve it.\n\nIf you have a business and you're alone, you can't run it successfully. You won't get work done and will stay in the same place. You won't know who to turn to for help. Being an individual won't take you where you want to go.\n\nGetting things done requires teamwork. It takes time and effort from a group or family members. Some people have tried working alone and failed. Then, they worked with friends and achieved their goals. I think the best way to improve is to work in a team. When we work together, everything gets organized and done on time.\n\nThe greatest achievement is when a team works together. If team members need help, working together helps them achieve their goals and be successful. Most people work in teams. Few people don't want to work in teams, and they hurt themselves by not doing so. I want to work in a team because we can get things done easily with each other's help.\n\nI don't like working alone because if I don't know something, I can ask my team members for help. I think working in a group is a good idea. If you fail when working alone, it can cause big problems that you can't fix. But with teamwork, it's easier to get things done safely."}

You can create opportunities to earn money, change your lifestyle, or improve your situation. For instance, if I win the lottery again, I can change my lifestyle or do better things.\n\nIn my opinion, a positive attitude can change how you carry yourself, especially when interacting with others. It's the ability to do difficult things and get results.

For example, I knew a coworker who never smiled or talked to anyone. Nobody wanted to be around him because of his bad attitude. But one day, he started being friendly and asking about others. Everyone was surprised because he had never been like that before. Having a positive attitude can make a big difference in your life.\n\nA positive attitude can make you a better person. Many of us forget to be positive, whether at work, on the street, at home, or at school. We all know someone who never looks on the bright side of life. For example, one of my family members had financial problems and had to take care of a sick mother. But he never gave up. He worked hard, took care of his family, and even went to school. What everyone loved about him was his amazing attitude. He always smiled, helped others, and made sure his family was happy. We can all learn from him that having a positive attitude is key to success.\n\nWe've all heard that we should stay positive, even when things are tough. Some people ask, \"Why should we stay positive when nothing goes our way?\" But the truth is, we all make mistakes and fall down sometimes. What's important is what we do after that. Do we learn from our mistakes and try to do better? My family went through tough times, and I lost hope. But my family never gave up, and they always stayed positive. My dad always told me, \"Never lose hope because everything you work for will pay off one day.\"\n\nSometimes, things happen for a reason. So, never give up and keep a positive attitude.\n\nTo stay positive, we should focus on the good things in life. Some people say, \"When there's a will, there's a way.\" For example, a guy named John was very rude and disrespectful to others. But when his parents got sick and lost their business, John had to take care of them. He struggled at first, but eventually, he got his life together. John's attitude changed, and he became a better person. He learned to work hard, help others, and even started his own business. The lesson here is that having a positive attitude can change your life.\n\nIn conclusion, the key to keeping your mind and soul positive is to focus on the good things in life. By having positive thoughts and a positive attitude, you can become successful. So, remember to always stay positive, never give up, and don't lose hope. Try to be the best version of yourself by having a positive attitude and doing good things for others."}

You won't get to choose your classes, and you might have to stay after school.\n\nIn conclusion, if your school offers a three-year program, I recommend taking the four years.

People with a positive attitude are winners because they make strong, good decisions.\n\nFor example, they can travel to other countries, pursue education for a successful future, and make smart choices. A positive attitude helps people understand their worth and gives them hope to be someone special.\n\nPeople with a positive attitude can also tell right from wrong. If two students fight in front of someone, the person with a positive attitude can figure out what really happened and say who is wrong and who is right. People with a negative attitude don't care about right and wrong.\n\nHaving a positive attitude is like having sunshine in your life - it makes your personality brighter. People with a positive attitude understand the importance of respecting others and themselves.\n\nFor example, a student with a positive attitude can respect everyone, no matter what. They don't compare themselves to others, even if someone is mean to them. They know their own worth.\n\nPeople with a positive attitude also help others. For example, if someone with a positive attitude sees a hungry person on the street, they will ask what's wrong and offer to help. They will buy food for the hungry person and make them happy.\n\nThis is how people with a positive attitude show their kindness to the world. I totally agree with these kind and respectful people."}

They need to talk to their parents about getting financial help. They also need to pay for summer classes. I think students should enjoy high school because life gets harder after graduation.

You can tackle challenges with confidence.\n\nOne important thing is determination. When you have a positive attitude, you can make your goals happen. If you want to achieve something, you can do it. You can inspire others who have problems in school or elsewhere in life, but you need to have determination and a positive attitude to help them. Everything you want is possible if you try.\n\nNever give up. A person with a positive attitude has a positive mind. It doesn't matter if they have many problems - they never give up. You can make your dreams possible if you have a positive attitude and never give up.\n\nMy pastor once told me, 'You are a young leader, you need to preach.' I said, 'No, Pastor, I can't.' My pastor told me, 'You need to have a positive attitude. You are a daughter of God. You need to remove the phrase \"I can't\" from your mind. God gives you the potential to achieve what you want.' This inspired me to take action. Now, I preach every Thursday and Friday, sometimes on Sunday. When I feel nervous, I remember, 'I am a daughter of God, I am a young leader, I can do everything I want because God helps me.'\n\nHappiness comes from having a positive attitude. When you have a positive attitude, your life becomes easier, happier, and less stressful. You have less stress, better health, and a clearer mind because you don't think about bad things. You are less likely to have depression and fewer problems.\n\nWith a positive attitude, the people around you are more confident in you. You are a positive friend who says, 'Don't worry, everything will be fine,' when something goes wrong. This is why the people around you are happier with you.\n\nYou need to have a positive attitude, determination, and the courage to overcome obstacles. Never give up if you want to achieve your goals. Make your dreams a reality; you have the potential to make everything possible. Try, never give up, and remember that everything you do requires a positive attitude. If this is your senior year, you can do it with good grades - just try to do your best. Make the people around you confident in you, make your life easy, happy, and free of sadness.

Most think it's a good idea to take a year off, work hard, and save money for college. However, this is not the best option. Students should not graduate early because it doesn't help them accelerate their life, grow their knowledge, or plan their future.\n\nFirst, students should realize that everything takes time. Why rush their education? I believe students should complete their four years of high school to figure out what they really want to study. Deciding on a college major is not easy. For example, a student might think they want to study engineering, but then discover a new passion. They need these four years to explore their options and make a good decision.\n\nSecond, students will learn new things every day in high school, which will help them in college. College homework is more challenging, so it's good to be prepared. Students use these four years to organize their ideas and get a clear perspective on their future.\n\nFor example, they can look for scholarships, plan their finances, and become more responsible. They learn to prioritize what they need to succeed. In conclusion, students should finish high school without rushing. Learning from teachers is beneficial, and being organized will help them succeed in their chosen career. They will do well if they take their time and make informed decisions."}

That's why it's better to have more time to explore your options.\n\nWith three years of school, you'll have to focus on required classes first. You won't have many elective classes to choose from.

We can do many things we enjoy, like spending time with friends or relaxing. Having an extra year to ourselves would be great. We can do a lot of things in that time.\n\nSecond, finishing school in three years gives us time to work and save money for college. We can also find the right college for ourselves. I think it's better to work for a year and then start college. It's more helpful and cost-effective.\n\nThird, finishing school in three years helps us become more mature and think about what's important. After a year, we'll realize that school is important and useful. Right now, many students are not ready for college or the real world. If you're not sure what to do after high school, it's okay to take your time. You can work or go to college.\n\nIn conclusion, I think all schools should be three years, not four.

Remember what author Ralph Waldo Emerson said, 'Being yourself in a world that wants to change you is the greatest achievement.' This quote is powerful because it can change your life.\n\nThese words make sense because being yourself is a great achievement, everyone would be different, and you'll find happiness.\n\nFirst, being yourself is a great achievement. For example, if someone wants you to go to college but you don't want to, it feels like your choice is wrong and theirs is right. But people will like you for who you are. Pretending to be someone you're not is hard. Being yourself is a big deal when it's tough.\n\nSecond, everyone in the world would be different. For example, if everyone dressed the same, there wouldn't be new fashion styles. If we all talked, acted, and thought the same, there wouldn't be new inventions. The world would be full of the same things. Being different is important, even if it feels and looks weird.\n\nLast, you'll find happiness when you're being yourself. For example, if you follow your dreams and not others' expectations, you'll be happy you did what you wanted. When you like who you are, don't let others tell you you're wrong. You won't give up when you're happy. Even if it's hard, find ways to make yourself happy.\n\nIt's true that someone's choice might help you see things differently.

Nobody wants to be around someone who always thinks negatively and makes them feel bad. But when someone always smiles, tells jokes, and helps us forget our problems, we like to be around them. Being positive helps us make new friends and makes other people's day happy. From my experience, popular people usually have a good attitude, and that makes them successful in their social life.\n\nFinally, our attitude and behavior change our work environment. Most of us don't like going to work because it stresses us out and makes us uncomfortable. But for someone with a good attitude, it's not as bad. We can see this in a simple situation.\n\nLet's think about someone who is always late to work. They might have forgotten to set their alarm or got stuck in traffic. They start the day feeling stressed. But someone who sets their alarm and leaves early can get ready on time. This good attitude also changes how they get along with their coworkers and boss. For example, someone with a good attitude finishes their work on time and works well with others.

While many people think graduating in three years is better, I believe that graduating in the traditional four years is better because students will have more experience and will find out the career they want to pursue in college when they graduate.\n\nFirst, students who stay in high school for four years will have more experience. They will learn the classes they need to graduate and may take their favorite subjects. They can join clubs to learn new skills and develop their ability to talk about themselves. Some students may join a volunteer group to help others, which will help them develop people skills or earn college credits. Students who learn slowly or are in ELL classes will learn more English and understand better before they graduate. Teachers always support students, so they develop quickly.\n\nThe second reason is that students will find out the career they want to pursue. They will take classes related to their career. For example, if they want to pursue a career in Marketing, they will understand their career goals and then take classes like DECA or Introduction to Marketing. The school will also organize meetings for students to talk about careers in some colleges or universities, which may help them choose the right college. In school, students are supported by their counselors, who will talk to them about skills, GPA points, location, tuition, and scholarships for each college, showing them suitable options and helping them choose the right career.\n\nAlthough graduating in three years may seem appealing, students will be pressured by subjects and may not have enough experience. They can enter college early and get used to the new environment, and they can work and earn money to support their life in college and pay part of their tuition. However, they will have less experience and may be confused about their career in college because they do not have a clear idea of what they want to do.\n\nFinally, I believe that students should graduate in the traditional four years. They will be supported by more people in school, learn more through various classes and their favorite subjects, develop their social skills, and acquire other skills that will apply to their career or life. They will not waste time finding a suitable career with the help of their counselors and teachers in school.

I agree with him that individuality is great because I can make my own decisions, nobody can judge me, and I can try my best.\n\nWe live in a world where people want us to be different or better. So, few people wait for us to do something else, even if we can make our own decisions. It's interesting how people always judge others because someone is different or thinks differently. However, I can make my own decisions to be different or better because I can do what I want, and it's my responsibility to deal with the consequences and keep going.\n\nWe know that we have to be careful in situations when we're about to give up. So, we might be smart to make this world different, even if we're having problems being successful. Also, because of the society we know, we have to be better than others.

You can take a break, work, and save money for college. This way, when you start college, you can focus on your studies without working at the same time. You can also use this year to prepare for college and learn what it's about.\n\nSaving time is good for everyone. We all need extra time sometimes, but we don't have it. When you graduate early, you'll have time to do many things like work, save money, study, exercise, travel, or learn something new.\n\nMany people struggle to save money when they graduate in four years. They have to work and study at the same time, which makes them tired and unable to focus. But when you graduate early, you can work, save money, and study without too much stress.\n\nI have a friend who wanted to buy a car, so he graduated early. He used the time to work hard and saved enough money to buy the car he wanted.\n\nI think high school students should graduate early. You can use the time to do something that will help you in the future. It's a good idea for students to graduate early."}

On her first day, she tried to make friends, but rumors spread that she fought with another girl. Then, a boy sat with her at lunch, and they talked a lot, becoming best friends. After that, everyone gave her another chance to fit in.\n\nThis shows that first impressions can change or be forgotten.\n\nPeople should be able to change first impressions by getting to know someone and giving them another chance.\n\nGetting to know someone is very important. Sometimes people judge others by how they look, which is hard to deal with. For example, a girl might be judged at work because she's always late, but nobody knows she has to walk to work every day because she doesn't have a car. If you knew that, you could help her or understand what she's going through. Similarly, in a job interview, people might judge you by how you look, but you might be a hard worker, smart, and passionate. It's sad when they only care about looks, not skills.\n\nGiving second chances is about seeing who someone really is and what they can do. Sometimes people make a bad first impression, but they're not lucky. For instance, if you're on a TV show and you're nervous, you might make a bad impression. But if the judges give you another chance, you can show them what you're really capable of.\n\nSometimes people try to be someone they're not to impress others, but that doesn't always work. Two friends, Generic_Name and Generic_Name, stopped talking because one of them was fake. But when one of them gave the other a second chance, everything worked out well. That's why giving second chances is important, because people can change over time.\n\nI believe that first impressions can be changed and forgotten. People can change their first impression with a second chance by showing who they really are and getting to know them before judging."}

This way, they can focus on their career. It's a good idea for schools to have programs to help students graduate early. This is because it's a waste of time for students who have all their credits to still be in school.\n\nGraduating high school a year early can be great for students. They can use the extra year to earn money or start their career. For example, a student who can't afford college can use the extra year to find a way to earn money. Students will have more time to plan their life. Colleges will see that the student did well in school if they graduated early. Graduating early can be hard and stressful for some students, but I think it's worth trying because you get an extra year to do what you want.\n\nSchools should let students choose how long they want to stay in high school. I don't think it's worth staying for four years if you don't need to. When students have all the classes they need, it's a waste of their time to keep learning things that won't help them in life. Schools should stop making students take extra classes just to graduate with their friends. It's better for students to have an extra year to plan their life than to be in school learning things they don't care about.

We like people who treat others with respect and kindness. Everyone wants to be successful, so I think having a positive attitude is important, along with studying and getting a good education.

When you're yourself in a world that's full of people, you learn new things, discover new traits and personalities, and see how others are different from you. It's a big deal to be yourself and not let others tell you who to be.\n\nImagine a world where everyone and everything is the same. What would happen if everyone was the same?

The other lady had been working there for five years, but she was arrogant and didn't know how to smile at customers. Her coworkers even complained about her.\n\nOne day, the company owner needed someone to replace the manager. Everyone thought the five-year employee would get the job, but the owner chose the kind Generic_Name instead. He heard about how nice she was to customers and coworkers, and he didn't want someone with a bad attitude driving away customers.\n\nThis story shows that a positive attitude is key to success.

Attitude is important because it gives people a good impression, changes lives, and earns respect.\n\nMy uncle is a mechanic. I visit him with my dad on weekends. I see that he always has a positive attitude with his clients. When people go to his shop, they like him because of his good attitude. Even when he's sad, he stays positive. He tells me to always show my best attitude because it's key to success.\n\nI used to think attitude didn't matter. One day, I met a girl at the park who was mean and had a bad attitude. She was rude to her friends, and nobody wanted to be friends with her. Our teacher said that if she didn't change, she wouldn't have a successful life. I felt sorry for her because I used to think like her - that attitude didn't matter. But that day, I realized I was wrong.\n\nMy sister had a bad attitude, even with our parents. She didn't have many friends at school or work. She did bad things to others. Our parents told her to change, but she didn't listen. One day, I saw her crying, and she told me that nobody liked her because of her bad attitude. She wanted to change, like our parents said, to be better and have friends. She told me the same thing my uncle told me: always have a good attitude.\n\nAttitude is important in life. Some people think it doesn't matter, but they're wrong. Attitude is key to success. I hope people realize how important attitude is. It doesn't matter if you have a bad attitude; you can always change and have a successful life."}
{"text_id_kaggle": "58A9AFCBBD39", "output_essay": "Yes, I agree that being a leader means being positive. People look up to you for solutions and guidance. This includes building trust, communicating well, working efficiently, and creating a positive atmosphere in school and daily life.\n\nAsk yourself: How can you find a solution when everyone is upset?\n\nFrom reading 'Leaders Eat Last,' I learned that a leader should create a positive environment. If the company is in trouble, the leader should find a solution and make the workplace positive. This book shares the story of a company that succeeded not just in business but also in helping its employees grow as people.\n\nThe company interviewed its employees to understand why they didn't want to work there. One employee said, 'People are mean to me, and there's too much competition. They only care about getting paid and don't care about others.'\n\nAs a positive leader, you should ask yourself: Do you want a competitive workplace where people leave, or do you want to create a positive environment where employees stay and succeed?\n\nIf I were the leader, I would choose the second option. Why not create a better workplace where employees feel welcome and happy?\n\nThe leader in the book chose the second option, and a few years later, the company became the best in the industry. They were asked how they achieved this, and they said it was because they created a positive environment where employees could grow.\n\nThe employees said they didn't want to leave the company because they found a profession they loved, and they succeeded in their personal lives. They also built strong social connections by creating a positive atmosphere.\n\nBeing positive is not just about being happy all the time. It's about making choices. For example, if you're angry with your boyfriend, you can choose to talk to him instead of listening to others. This is being positive towards each other.\n\nIn school, you can also change your attitude to become a better student and classmate. I used to think people were fake, but now I know that's not true. By changing my attitude, I learned about my strengths and weaknesses, and those of my friends. Now I believe I'm a leader because I create a positive environment in my class and at home.\n\nHaving a positive attitude creates trust, which is key to being a better person. When you're positive, you make others happy, and you create a better place to learn and grow.\n\nIn conclusion, I agree that having a positive attitude increases communication, work efficiency, relationships, trust, and concentration. These are real-life examples that work in our daily lives. Share your positive attitude with others, and you'll see a big change. I recommend reading 'Leaders Eat Last' for more examples and inspiration."}

Our behavior shows that we can have a good attitude towards others, which can be great or good. A positive attitude is true because others see us as special, kind, and normal.\n\nWhen many people think we're special, some people can keep a good attitude for a long time. We make ourselves behave well, but having a good attitude happens for a reason. For example, when our parents tell us to do chores, we can choose to obey or disobey them. If we obey, they will think we're a special person who listens to them. If we disobey, we might argue or yell at them, which is disrespectful.\n\nBeing a kind person means showing respect to others, which helps us understand the difference between good and bad. When we have a bad attitude, we might ignore people who need help. But when we have a good attitude, we will help them and apologize if we make a mistake. We can choose to be a kind person.\n\nTo be a good person, many people can make the right attitude. Some people might not make the right choice, but they can learn to be better. Our attitude can affect our mood and complicate our lives. But we can do things like normal people, like going shopping or watching movies.\n\nIn conclusion, having a positive attitude is important because it helps us learn about our behavior. We know that a positive attitude is the key to success, and it's true because many people can keep a good attitude towards others. In the future, we can live with a positive attitude, just like we learned from successful people in the past."}

When we're young or wake up in the morning, our minds are fresh and open to new ideas. This makes it easy for things to stick in our minds.\n\nThe first thing we hear or experience always gets our attention. Important things usually come first, like in a race where the person who starts fast is likely to win. In my experience on the wrestling team, I saw that my opponents always tried their best in the first round so they could win easily in the second round. If they tired me out in the first round, I wouldn't be strong enough to finish the match.\n\nIn conclusion, first impressions are very important and hard to change.

Some customers can be mean, and the managers can be annoying. They want me to do everything since I know how to do it. But life is hard, and you have to work for it.

I don't even think I'll graduate because of the school I'm in, but I know it's my fault. I need to pass my classes, go to summer school, and finish the last classes during summer school. That's a lot. I have seven classes to pass, and right now, I'm failing half of them.\n\nThe only thing that keeps me going is my girlfriend, Generic_Name. I've known her for two years, and I met her just before I left my old city. She goes to Generic_School, and we keep in touch. I truly love her, and she's been there for me.

You also won't be able to take extra classes that interest you, like plumbing or CIS. And, you'll be so stressed that you won't be able to focus in your morning classes.\n\nWith the traditional Four-Year plan, you can take your classes at a normal pace and have more time to prepare for college or other things you want to do after graduation.

This means that if you try two different approaches or decide to do things differently, you'll gain many experiences, and it will be helpful for you.

They see things on social media and think that's how they should act or dress because they care what others think. This can lead to anxiety. Caring what others think about your individuality can mess with your insecurities. I think teachers should talk about this in school. Nobody should feel bad about their religion, culture, style, or self-expression just because others are selfish. Sometimes you have to be brave and be yourself; it may take time, but people will always say negative things, and you just have to ignore them. Being yourself when others try to change you is a great achievement, and others should feel good about that."}

They think they can learn everything in three years instead of four. I think this is a good idea because it gives students a head start to prepare for college and work. They can get a better job at a younger age.\n\nHowever, I think students who are not native English speakers or come from other countries should take the traditional four years to graduate. This will help them improve their English skills, get better at what they do, and be ready for college and work. After high school, preparing for college is a different path. It's not easy for those who can't afford college because it costs a lot of money. So, the four years can help them become stronger and smarter.\n\nFor example, students can pay for college by getting scholarships for sports they played in high school, like football, soccer, or baseball.\n\nIn conclusion, I think the three-year graduation program is better for American students or those who can learn quickly.

It's like having a goal to pass all classes and tests, then graduate on time.\n\nSome people take summer school or night classes to get the credits they need. I took summer school for algebra when I was a sophomore. It was better because I only had to focus on one class. It was less stressful. My friends took night classes and said it was similar to summer school. It's nice to take summer school or night classes because you have time to pass the class and get the credit.\n\nTaking four years in high school gives you time to experience high school life. You get to go to football games, pep-rallies, homecoming, and prom. You get to feel like you're part of your school's family. After high school, you don't get to have those experiences anymore. You have to become an adult.\n\nSome people think three years is better because it's faster. But honestly, time always goes by fast.

These are common thoughts we've all had.\n\nIn my life, I've met people I didn't want to hang out with at first because of how they looked. I'd judge them in my head, thinking they might not be nice or might not be my type. But after getting to know them, I realized they weren't as bad as I thought. It was me who was confused about how to feel. I learned that first impressions always come up, and they can alert me if someone is good or bad.\n\nMy friends often come to me complaining about someone they just met and don't like because of how they looked at each other or didn't talk. But we should remember that people might be shy or not like to talk much. That doesn't mean they don't like us or don't want to talk. We should understand them before making a judgment. For example, I once found a hair conditioner that smelled bad, but my mom told me not to judge it just because of the smell. I tried it, and it turned out to be the best product for my hair.\n\nFirst impressions can affect us in good or bad ways. They can change for the better or worse. Sometimes, we think we won't like someone, but we find out we have a lot in common. Or we buy a product we don't think will work, but it turns out to be great. On the other hand, first impressions can also be misleading. We might think someone is mean or doesn't want to talk to us, but they might just be quiet or shy.\n\nMost people agree that first impressions are hard to change because we don't know the person well. It's okay to have thoughts about someone we just met, but it doesn't mean we're right. We might think someone is bad, but they might be trying to be our friend.

There are many ways to change the first impression, such as buying new shoes, falling in love, and trying new food.\n\nBuying new shoes is a good example. When we go to the mall and see a beautiful pair of shoes, we like them because they look good. At first, the shoes might look old-fashioned, but if we wear them often, our impression of them will change over time. If we wear them every day or a few times a week, they will not look as good as they did at first. If we buy new shoes after using the old ones for months, our impression of the old shoes will change. They will not be as valuable, and they will not look as good as they did before.\n\nSome people fall in love without knowing each other well. It's best to find out someone's character before falling in love. If someone has a bad character and we fall in love, it might turn into a selfish love. Our impression of the person will change after we get to know them. The love might turn into hate. Not everyone falls in love at first sight, but some people hate others without knowing them. Spending time with each other helps us know each other's characters, and our first impression changes.\n\nWhen we try new food for the first time, it tastes delicious. Some people always look for new food to eat because their impression of food changes. We get tired of eating the same food every day, so we look for something new. At first, we love the food, but after eating it many times, it doesn't taste good anymore. We always love new food, but then we get tired of it and look for something else.\n\nIt's impossible for the first impression to stay the same. Something always changes our first impression. We might like something, but when something new comes, our impression of the first thing changes, and the new thing takes its place.\n\nOur impression changes from one thing to another. Many things grab our attention. Our impression keeps changing because we find new things and forget about the old ones.

I agree with Emerson that the world and people are always changing, trying to be something better.

It doesn't matter what others think of me; it's about what I want to be. If I want to do something to improve my life, I should just do it. I shouldn't wait; I should fight for my goals and not let anyone stop me.\n\nMany people don't care about others; they just want to be better. In this world, people change, some for good, some for bad. Some people do what others tell them to do, not what they want to do. This makes them feel obligated to live a life they don't like.\n\nBeing yourself is important; it's like living a real life where you feel good. Trying your best to achieve your goals can be good for you and your family. Just go ahead and do it.\n\nIn conclusion, everything in this world tries to change you, but you can still be yourself.

Being yourself can be a great achievement in today's world.\n\nOne reason is that the world and people can try to change you. Another reason is that you need to find out who you are and what you want to achieve in life. Finally, when you are yourself, the world supports you, and you can make a difference.\n\nThe world is made up of people, and some can be good or bad influences. They can push us to do things we don't want to do. For example, in the US, there are many school shootings, and most are committed by two or more people. The police often punish the main person responsible. To me, one of them was a bad influence, and they became an obstacle to themselves and others. We need to choose our friends and family carefully because they can influence us.\n\nIt's essential to know who we are and what we want to achieve. Personally, it's hard to know everything about myself. I believe that if you don't know yourself, how can you know others? We often do what we see in the world, like violence and crime. But if we focus on our goals, like becoming a doctor, we can ignore the world's problems and achieve our purpose.\n\nWhen we have a positive personality and a good heart, we can support others, and they can support us. If we know who we are and our purposes, the world will be on our side, and we can make a difference. For example, many people have read about individuals who made a positive impact on the world.\n\nMalala, a young woman, fought for her right to education in a country where women weren't allowed to go to school. She believed in herself and knew her purpose. Over time, Malala achieved her goals, and now women are allowed to get an education. Malala is a great example of how being yourself can lead to great accomplishments.\n\nIn conclusion, the world and people can be obstacles, but we need to know ourselves and find our purpose.

If the world is trying to make you better, then take the opportunity. Don't stay in the same place you are now. As you grow up, you will change and make accomplishments along the way.\n\nWe can't stay the same; we need to change to achieve our goals. Not everything will go as planned, and we will make mistakes. But we can learn from those mistakes. Some people might wonder, \"What should I change or how?\" But when the time comes, you'll realize you need to change to reach your goals. Don't stay stuck; you won't achieve anything.\n\nThis quote reminds me of a job. If you're paid nine dollars an hour and find a new job that pays eleven dollars an hour, you should take it. Don't stay in the same place; move to a better opportunity. Most people do this, and as they move forward, they meet new people who can impact their personality.\n\nFor me, if the world is trying to change me, I will let it happen because sometimes I need to change to achieve my goals.

A positive attitude can help you in many ways, such as getting a job, making friends, and showing others that you're successful. To be successful, you need to have a positive attitude.

If you're rude to them, they might complain to the manager, and you could get fired. But if you're always positive, customers might compliment the manager, and you might get a raise or a promotion. A positive attitude can make you more successful.\n\nYour attitude also depends on your lifestyle. We don't know much about people with bad attitudes, but we can say good things about people with positive attitudes. They're happy with what they have, and they don't worry about things. A positive attitude is good because it can help you stay calm and focused. If you're always worried, it can make your attitude worse.\n\nA positive attitude can also help you in difficult situations, like in school. If someone tries to fight you, but you stay calm and positive, you can avoid trouble. But if you have a bad attitude, you might fight back, and both of you could get in trouble. With a positive attitude, you can be a successful person.\n\nI believe that a positive attitude is the key to success. You can't be successful if you're always worried, stressed, or negative.

High school is a crucial step for students before they enter college. Students need different amounts of time to learn, and some can even enter the workforce a year early. Finishing high school in three years can be beneficial as it helps build knowledge and set goals.\n\nFirstly, finishing high school in three years helps students build their knowledge. For example, some immigrant students who come to the United States don't know how to write their names. But with high school support, they learn to speak and write English well. Many immigrant students think three years of high school is perfect for them and others.\n\nSecondly, finishing high school in three years helps students set their goals. For instance, a student was afraid of not learning the language or graduating on time. But she learned the language in one year and used the remaining two years to prepare for college. She set her goals for the future and thinks three years of high school are very useful.\n\nSome people might think it's a good idea for students to work for a year before college because it gives them extra time to learn. However, not all students need this extra year. Many students have already prepared for college and think three years are enough.\n\nIn conclusion, finishing high school in three years is a good idea.

This option is faster than finishing high school in four years.\n\nIn my opinion, I think graduating from high school in three years is a good idea. This gives me more time to prepare for college and achieve my goals. I will be better prepared to develop my knowledge and skills. This is a good option because we have enough time to prepare, do what we want, and study what we really want.\n\nHowever, having enough time to prepare can be a problem. Some students want to graduate from high school and get their diploma, but they are not sure what to do after that. Some students are ready for college, but they are not prepared for what they have chosen. We need help in high school to know what to do and improve our knowledge.\n\nHaving time to do what we want after graduating from high school is better. We can think about our future and how we want to achieve our goals. Some students don't study and prefer to work. We know what is best for us.\n\nWhat we want to study is important.

Some people don't care what others think, but I do.\n\nBeing independent is also important. It means not relying on others to be who you are. For example, I'm working hard to buy my own car.

Research shows it's almost impossible to forget the first impression of someone or something. Forgetting an important event, like a first job or trip, is like forgetting a first impression. There are two main reasons why people can't forget the first impression and why they might forget it.\n\nFirst, it's hard to forget a strong impression. A memory stays with us and doesn't go away. This happens to everyone, and it depends on how strong the impression is. If the memory is strong, it's hard to forget. Normally, first impressions are hard to forget, but sometimes we might not remember because of how important it is and how it affects our daily life.\n\nSecond, if we forget the first impression, it's because something else is distracting us or a new impression is stronger. For example, a student got a bad grade because a family member was in an accident. She didn't care about the grade; she only cared about her family member. This shows why someone might not remember the first impression if another impression is stronger.\n\nSome people think first impressions are easy to forget. They say it's easy to forget if we stop thinking about it. Some people agree, but others disagree because they know it will stay in their minds if they think about it again. They think stopping thinking is the only way to forget the first impression because it's hard to forget something unexpected.\n\nIn conclusion, having a memory that stays with us can be bad. First impressions are hard to forget, but we can try to not think about them. One way is to have a stronger, better impression that helps us forget the bad one.

She was afraid to say no, so she let them do what they wanted. People made fun of her because of it. This shows why we need to speak up when we need to. It's hard to be in a difficult situation with no help, and it's up to you to make things right. Speak up early, not late.\n\nMany people think making others happy is good. But they're wrong. It's not a good idea to follow others' directions if they're not what you want. In conclusion, try to be happy by being yourself. Don't let others tell you what to do. Otherwise, you won't be happy. Just be yourself, and you'll have a better chance of success in life."}

People often ask why a good attitude is important. Why do we have problems in life?\n\nIf I always have a good attitude, I will find a way to stay positive. If I'm always negative, I won't get far in life and won't grow. If I stay positive, even when faced with a problem, I won't lose my confidence. Because if I lose it, I'll have a problem and won't know what I'm doing.\n\nMy attitude is about how I approach problems and use my strengths. For example, if I want to get a promotion at work, I need to have a good attitude and be ready to work harder to get it. I need to focus on my problems and not let them become bigger issues. If I do, I won't get the job I want. I need to stay focused, and people will say that if I always have a good attitude, it can open more doors for me in life.\n\nIf I have a problem in my life, I need to overcome it and then move on. That problem won't defeat me. I need to have a good attitude and achieve my goals. If I don't overcome the problem, I'll have bigger problems everywhere I go.

Do you remember a time when someone asked you to make a good impression and what happened? Many people say that first impressions are hard to change.

When I went back, they gave me the same impression. You can't go back in time to change the past. \n\nAlso, first impressions can show who you are. If your friend expects you to make a good impression and you don't, it can hurt your relationships. Companies try to make good impressions to sell their products. Making a good impression is important to most people. \n\nMoreover, people will remember you based on their first impression. For example, I visited another place and left with a good impression. That's why I want to go back and see if I can apply. Some people disagree and say that your second impression can be your best. But I believe that you can't change the past.

Some students need to support their families, and finishing early can give them a chance to get a job sooner. It's not a bad idea for those who deserve it. Many smart students at school lack the necessary resources and need to work hard. For example, some students work at McDonald's, but they don't earn much and can't support their families. If they finish high school early, they can get a better job and better pay, leading to a better life and future for their families.\n\nIs it a good idea for students to finish high school in three years and enter college or the workforce one year early? In my opinion, it's a good idea as long as they have the skills to help them in their future life, such as finding a job, managing their money, saving, and being respectful and honest.\n\nLet's look at the benefits of doing four years of high school. When you do four years, you have more time to take the classes you like. Most students would rather go to school for three years instead of four. Why? Because in this world, we have three types of communities: poor, middle class, and rich. The rich will likely do four years, middle-class students have a 50-50 chance of finishing in three years, and poor students often want to finish school as soon as possible to get a better job and support their families.\n\nSome students drop out of high school because they need to help their families. They try their best to make it through school while having a part-time job.\n\nWhat's the difference between three years or four years of high school? The main difference is that if you take three years, you'll need to take more classes in summer school. If you take four years, you'll take regular classes like a normal student.\n\nFor example, I'm a student who's good at math and other subjects, but I'm tired because I have to work after school and wake up early. I'll do my best to graduate early and get a better job. I need to support my family and bring home money.\n\nThe main reason for me is to graduate, get a better job, and support my family. I want to be successful in my future life.\n\nStudents who take four years will have more knowledge because they took the classes they wanted and had more time at school. They can get an advanced diploma, which can help them succeed in life. A person who stays for four years has time to learn, understand, and get more information that can help them in the future.\n\nGraduating early can be stressful because you'll have less time to study, do homework, or attend school."}

I want to be a better person and make my family proud. To be a better person, I need to start from the beginning and work hard to get what I want. I know it won't be easy, but I must fight against obstacles to reach my goals. Not everyone will agree or disagree with me. Some people will be proud of me, but others will be jealous because I will achieve what they couldn't when they were young.

My mom will say, 'Don't waste this opportunity; not everyone gets a second chance.' I believe in myself, and I know I can do my best to achieve my goals.

It's important to think about what happens if you make a bad impression the first time and why it's hard to change.

Traditionally, high school has a four-year program to prepare students for college and their future. This program has always been effective in giving students an idea of what college is like and what they need to know.\n\nFour years are the basic foundation for education and teaching. It's important to take four years to teach students everything they need to know in college and life. For example, my brother took the new system of three years and went to college, but he was not prepared and lost one year in college. Then, he had to go back to high school to finish the last year he needed. This shows how one can be troubled just to spare oneself a year, and afterwards, one will see the consequences.\n\nFour years also benefit students by allowing them to take additional classes and learn more. When students take four years, the last year provides the benefit of getting different types of additional classes. For example, my sister speaks two different languages, but she wanted to learn art and French in her last year of school. This gave her the opportunity to take two selective classes, and she selected art and French. When school ended, she learned how to draw, and she almost spoke French perfectly.\n\nSome people may argue that it's a good idea for students to finish in three years and enter college. They say that taking this program helps students not waste their time and money and get the same results. However, most students who take four years in high school are the ones who graduate with honors and early.\n\nIn conclusion, taking four years to graduate is the best way to learn everything one needs in the future. If one takes three years, one will see the consequences in the future. If one takes the longer way, one will have their reward. The best choice is to take the certain option to not have problems in the future. One can decide what one wants and what one wants to be in the future, but one cannot go back in time to fix their mistakes."}

Finding what makes you happy completes a part of you that no one else should control. Doing something that makes you happy should always be a part of you. Never stop doing it for anyone or anything.

Don't let the world decide what you do; do what you love and what makes you happy. That's what makes you, you.\n\nIn my opinion, you should always have confidence in yourself. Without confidence, someone's words can affect you negatively. You should always believe in yourself; there will always be doubters, but you need to prove you're strong and different. Being humble shows you're unique. Many people are not humble, and that's what the world wants them to be - arrogant and fake. Always remain humble, no matter what.\n\nPeople will try to change you.

They think it's not good because students have to take extra classes during the summer or evenings. But I think it's good because students can gain experience earlier, plan their future better, and study what they want.\n\nFirst, students can gain experience earlier. This is good because they can use that experience to get a job or prepare for their future. For example, when I was a freshman, I helped watch kids at a kindergarten. Later, I had to babysit my little cousin, and I wasn't worried because I had experience taking care of kids. I had a good time with my cousin.\n\nSecond, students can become good at planning because they have to take many classes and make time for study and activities. They have to make a schedule, so they can make time for study and not waste time. They can also figure out what they want to do and not get lost in the future. For example, I was bored during summer vacation, so I started planning my schedule. I kept changing my plan, but I learned how to make a good schedule. I had a good summer and learned good planning skills.\n\nThird, students can study what they want because it's hard to do many things in high school. If they graduate early, they can start studying their dream job earlier and make more time for it. For example, I lived in Japan and finished my homework early, so I had time to study English. When I came to the U.S., I wasn't too stressed about speaking English because I had already studied it a little.\n\nIn conclusion, students can get many good things if they graduate in three years.

When you believe in yourself without listening to others, you feel proud. Being yourself means you can solve problems on your own, and it encourages others to do the same. Being yourself is the biggest achievement in life because it helps you make your own decisions without relying on others, and it makes you work hard to be successful. Listen to yourself when you want to make a decision.\n\nFirst, being yourself is the biggest achievement in life because most people work alone to get better results by using their own minds. For example, a student at school, Sarah, studied for her biology test at home. She studied the cell notes for 30 minutes and practiced the study guide. On Monday, Sarah took her test and passed with 90%. Her teacher praised her because she studied hard to achieve better. By working alone, Sarah learned a lot without her teacher's or friends' help. Being yourself teaches you to know what is right or wrong, and you learn a lot when you are alone.\n\nSecondly, being yourself is the biggest achievement in life because it helps students feel good about themselves and be responsible for their own achievements at school or in their communities. For instance, volleyball players work hard to become better players and get a good score. They manage their time, and some practice twice a week. They push themselves because working alone helps them in the future. The volleyball players achieved their goals, and they got benefits from their hard work. To be successful in life, you need to show how being yourself works.\n\nSome people say that being yourself is not the biggest achievement in life. They think working with others is more important because it helps you connect with different people and get help when you need it. This is true because working with others can make a difference and you can learn from others; however, being yourself helps you stay focused and have strong beliefs. Feel proud to be yourself.\n\nIn conclusion, being yourself makes you feel proud and confident. Overall, being yourself helps you make your own decisions without relying on others. Achieving something in life improves your knowledge. Lastly, people should be themselves because it shows their ability to work alone."}
{"text_id_kaggle": "1DAF72D388B1", "output_essay": "I agree with the idea that being yourself is important. One reason is that you should focus on what you're good at. Another reason is that hard work leads to success. And the third reason is doing a job you love.\n\nWhen I'm good at something, it's just me being myself. I want to do a job I like and focus on it. It helps me find a job I enjoy. When I like my job, I'll earn money and maybe give some to my parents. I'm a respectful, honest, and careful person. For example, when I play basketball, people tell me to be myself and just play, and it works. Being yourself is always positive and helps you achieve your goals.\n\nI want to be successful by working hard to earn money. Even athletes work hard to win big games. They want to succeed and make their fans happy. Everyone earns a lot of money by working hard and being successful. Life is easier when you're yourself, work hard, and stay positive. People want to earn money to buy things for their family. When I work hard, my parents are happy. Being yourself calms you down when you're angry.\n\nDoing a job I like makes it easy to be positive, be myself, and work hard. I can achieve everything by doing what I love. Some people make it simple by being themselves and doing what they love. I like marketing for sports because I watch a lot of sports. I'll be myself by choosing the college and job I want.\n\nIn conclusion, being positive, getting a job, and being yourself helps you earn money and gain respect. Being yourself is like doing your own job, and it looks easier that way. Being yourself helps me choose a job, college, and what I want to do, and stay positive. Some people want to do their job on their own to achieve and earn money. I should always be myself when I'm mad or sad to calm down. It helps, and that's why I agree with Emerson's statement."}
{"text_id_kaggle": "0756ACE551C9", "output_essay": "Have you ever set a goal that was too hard or too easy? Setting a goal that's too hard and missing it means you tried your best. Setting a goal that's too easy means you didn't try hard enough. I think setting high goals makes hard work pay off and helps you achieve more.\n\nMissing a high goal is what makes hard work worth it. For example, I struggled in a math class because I didn't understand the lessons, and my grade went down to an F. But I decided to come to school early to get help, which made me work harder. This taught me to be independent and made me feel proud. Sometimes, you need to look at the big picture to get where you want to be. I raised my grade to an A and felt proud of myself, knowing that even hard things can be done.\n\nAchieving high goals is a big deal. For instance, I had to present a history project in class, and I was very shy. I didn't do well because I spoke too quietly, making it hard for people to hear me. But I learned to be less shy and speak louder so people could hear me better.\n\nIn conclusion, some people might think it's better to set easy goals and achieve them because they're lazy and don't want to challenge themselves. But I think people who try hard and work deserve to achieve something. Never give up on trying your best, even if you fail, because there's always another chance."}

I disagree with the idea that our opinions are based on our own experiences. Instead, I think our opinions are shaped by what others do. You might think something is terrible, but if you learn more about it, you might change your mind.\n\nFirst, it's possible to change our opinions when we see something good or bad. Sometimes we think what we see is true, but we don't really understand what's happening. Our first impression of someone is often not accurate because we don't know them well. We need to get to know them and share experiences before we can judge them. Bad opinions can be unfair because people may have health problems or be going through tough times.\n\nIn life, we have many opinions that can be surprising. When we get a new job, we often have a great impression at first. We see the workplace, meet new people, and share experiences. But our opinion can change over time because things aren't always as they seem. We might have problems with coworkers, and our opinion of them changes.\n\nAt the beginning of the year, I had a friend who I thought was great. But over time, she changed and did some bad things to me. My opinion of her changed quickly because I saw things I didn't like. I was sad because the person I thought was my friend turned out to be someone else. It's strange how our opinions of people can change so much.\n\n"}

A positive attitude makes people hopeful about their future, but it's not enough to guarantee success. You need to put in effort and have some luck to be successful. Success doesn't stop at learning and changing. People who are successful learn to work harder than others and get opportunities.\n\nFor example, I saw a news report about two people, A and B. B helped A when he was sick and A thanked him by giving him a job. B worked hard and eventually started his own business. He was successful because he had a positive attitude and good luck.\n\nOn the other hand, some people with a positive attitude work hard but don't succeed. For instance, a person who works in a restaurant might be happy every day, but they never get promoted or change jobs. They just keep working in the same job until they retire.\n\nAnother example is a person who helps someone and gets a lot of money as a thank you. They spend all the money on things that make them happy, but soon they run out of money. They're still happy because they think life is just about being happy every day.\n\nIn conclusion, no one is born successful. Success comes from working hard and getting opportunities. A positive attitude can make you feel good, but it's not enough to make you successful. It's not the key to success in life."}
{"text_id_kaggle": "A2B64A578852", "output_essay": "Should high schools allow students to graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years? Many students want to graduate early to enter college or the workforce one year early. However, I think graduating early is not a good idea because students would spend too much time studying and not have time for other things.\n\nStudents who study too much cannot join clubs or teams at school. Many students want to join their favorite clubs or teams. This is what makes school fun. Students can show off their skills or talk about their favorite things in the club. Sports are a big part of high school, and many students want to attend school because they can play their favorite sports with friends. In fact, every student has a dream job, and if they study too much, they cannot focus on the subjects that can help them in the future.\n\nStudying too much also means students cannot have a job or spend time with family and friends. In high school, students want to get a job to earn money for college or help their family. Summer and after-school hours are the best times for part-time jobs. Also, students need to spend time with family and friends. Students want to take a break in the summer or hang out with friends after school.\n\nSome parents think students need to study a lot because they want their kids to graduate early. However, I think graduating early is not a good idea because too much studying makes students stressed. Students have many classes and a lot of homework, so they stay up late, sleep less, and cannot focus the next day. Stress makes students angry and can lead to fights in school. Students need to study, but they also need to take breaks and relax.\n\nSchool activities, clubs, and sports are why most students want to attend school. High school students are teenagers, and they think about their future: earning money, spending time with family and friends are important to them. Studying too much can make students learn in a way that is not effective and stressful. Graduating from high school should not be allowed because students need to study and have fun at the same time."}
{"text_id_kaggle": "6133A8065DB0", "output_essay": "I agree with the authors, Ralph and Emerson, who say that being yourself is the best way to do things. They teach us to improve ourselves by trying new things and thinking about what we like to do. If we think something is hard, we should try it anyway. Everyone should try new things to improve themselves.\n\nThe authors' words are helpful because they talk about a big idea that can help all people who want to improve their future. I have many things to do every day, and each day is a new experience. It's like a little story where we can do amazing things if we're patient and think about what we're doing.\n\nThe main point is to not copy others, but to do what we want to do. We shouldn't care about what others say, whether it's good or bad. If we think about ourselves and our future, we'll see that people who give up never try to do their best. They always say it's wrong or that they'll fail. But if they never try, they'll never know if it was the right decision.\n\nFor example, a student who wants to go to college to become a doctor or work for the government might be told it's too hard. But if they don't try, they'll never know if they could have done it. The best thing to do is to ignore negative comments and listen to our heart. If something makes us feel bad, we should stop doing it and think about what makes us happy.\n\nNow is the time to start doing things that will help us in the future. The authors' words make me feel good about doing what I want. I'm in 12th grade, and I want to study nursing and become a doctor to help people with health problems.\n\nThe authors' words make me think differently and give me ideas about how to make a difference in the world. They believe that anything can happen if we want it to. The main point is to understand that we can do it if we try and never give up. Our family will be proud of us too.\n\nI agree with the authors because they teach me to think about my future and do what I want. I should think about how to do things well and learn from my mistakes. The most important thing is to think about my future and do what will help the world's future. I should follow my dreams and put them into practice.\n\nConclusion\n\nI agree with the authors because they teach me to listen to my ideas and do what I want. They make me feel like I should try to do all that I want and never ignore anything. If I ignore something, I'll never know the result. So, I won't ignore my ideas. Their words also help other people who listen and do what they want, like taking classes or preparing for their future."}
{"text_id_kaggle": "BABDE5D92BA6", "output_essay": "Life is difficult, and that's no secret. If life is tough, how can I be successful? Nobody prepares us for the problems and responsibilities that come with age. People always look for ways to make life easier or worry-free. They try to find the good side of bad things. Life gives us both good and bad things, but people find ways to succeed despite the problems.\n\nIn my opinion, having a positive attitude is the key to success. I agree with this idea for many reasons. For example, a positive attitude gives us a good mood. People with a good mood are always smiling and open to listening to others. They have nice relationships with those around them. A positive attitude helps us in our daily lives, especially with our mood. When we're not stressed, we do our best. Doing our best is a way to be successful.\n\nAnother reason I agree with this idea is that people with a positive attitude try to solve problems. They find ways to solve problems quickly, which is a great quality. People who can solve problems easily will likely get better grades or a higher job position, which means they're successful.\n\nHaving a positive attitude also helps us get accepted by society and family. People like to be around positive people. When we're accepted, we're more likely to succeed. Many people's problems come from their relationships with family or society. Being positive helps us have better relationships and achieve our goals. People accepted by society and family don't have self-esteem issues, so they're not afraid to try new things and be successful.\n\nIn conclusion, life is hard without a positive attitude. Every day is a new chance to find ways to achieve our goals. Having a good mood helps us have better days with less stress and health problems. When people think positively, the world will be full of successful people. They'll find better ways to solve problems, do their best work, and get accepted by society and family. Life will still be hard, but not as much, because a positive attitude can make a big difference. Being positive is the key to success."}

We need to chase our dreams and keep going because we can do anything we set our minds to. Life is full of surprises, but we can fight back. We're stronger than we think, especially when we work together.\n\nSome people give up when life gets tough. They don't have the motivation to keep going, or they don't have anyone to support them. That's why we should come together to motivate each other. Motivation is key because it's what keeps us going. It's what makes us do things and behave in certain ways. Everyone has something that motivates them; they just need to find it.\n\nBeing myself, who I am today, is the biggest achievement of my life. I stood my ground and took on life because of my motivations. I wouldn't be where I am today if I didn't have them. I had a tough start in life, but I came back from it. I'm very grateful for that. For those who are still struggling, find your motivation and do what you love. It's never too late to start, and it's worth it.\n\nThe world isn't always easy; it can be mean and nasty. But it's not about how hard life hits you; it's about how you get back up. You need to know your worth and be willing to take the hits to get what you deserve. Don't blame others for who you are; take responsibility and keep moving forward."}
{"text_id_kaggle": "CDE5799DB671", "output_essay": "One topic that is often discussed today is whether some high schools should offer three-year graduation programs instead of the traditional four-year program. Some people think that the three-year program is better because students can finish high school early by taking summer or evening classes. However, I believe that the traditional four-year program is better because students need time to learn, join extra classes, and work after school.\n\nFirst, students need time to understand what they learn in school. If they don't have time to think about it, they might forget it quickly. Also, taking classes during the summer or evening can be confusing because they don't get a break. We can't just think about smart students who can learn quickly; we need to think about all students.\n\nSecond, every student can join extra classes if they choose the traditional four-year program. School can be hard, and students need some fun time. Extra classes like music can be enjoyable, and some students might even become musicians. These classes also help students socialize, work in groups, and communicate with others. This is important for their future because they'll need to work with others to get a job. Additionally, extra classes can help students reduce stress and avoid problems.\n\nThird, some students need to work after school due to their situation. If they choose the three-year program, they might not have time to work because they'll have classes during the summer or evening. However, if they choose the traditional four-year program, they can work after school and complete their assignments. It's also important for parents that their children learn the importance of work and school. The traditional four-year program helps by giving students enough time to do their homework and have a job.\n\nAs you can see, there's a big difference between the three-year program and the traditional four-year program. The three-year program is not good because it doesn't give students enough time, and it's not the right way to prepare them for college or work. On the other hand, the traditional four-year program provides more benefits, such as time to learn, opportunities to join extra classes, and the chance to work after school. If we take action and prepare students gradually, giving them time and helping them in all aspects, the world will be a better place."}

We can share our ideas with others, be unique, and stay happy by doing what we want.\n\nFirst, we can share our ideas with others. There are many people with different ideas, and ours can be helpful in tough situations. Sometimes, people might think our ideas are not good, but if we try, they might work. For example, my 10-year-old sister came up with a solution to open a tightly sealed jam bottle. She suggested using grippy gloves, and it worked! Now we use that method to open sealed bottles.\n\nAlso, being ourselves makes us unique. We think, dress, talk, and express ourselves in our own ways. We can show people how special we are by doing our own thing. Following the crowd is ordinary, but standing out is extraordinary. People might like us for being different and want to imitate us. For example, Rolls-Royce designed a self-driven car that looks like their old cars. They did their own thing, and it's amazing!\n\nLastly, we are happy when we follow our own ways. Sometimes, we feel unhappy because we're not doing what we want. We might be happy, successful, and getting good grades, but something feels off. It's probably because we listened to someone else's idea instead of our own. We should do what makes us happy and not change our minds because of others. For example, I took an art course because my friend suggested it, but I'm not happy with that decision. I learned that I should always do what makes me happy.\n\nIn conclusion, being ourselves has many benefits! Although it can be hard, being ourselves is the key to a happy life.

This will increase their chances of getting the job they want and earning a good income. By studying for a specific job, students can earn more money when they start their career. One of the benefits of graduating early is that students will be young and have their degree, giving them more time to gain experience.\n\nThe job students studied for will finally become a reality as they achieve their goals. They will have put in the hard work and dedication needed to succeed, and they will have the career they always wanted. As adults, they will be proud to start their new career and plan for a better future. The job they have will benefit them in the long run and improve their lifestyle and maybe even their family's.\n\nGraduating high school in three years is a great idea. It allows students to plan their future, make good choices, and get a head start on their goals. Having an extra year to decide what they want to do is a great opportunity, and it's a good way to start life on the right foot. With many job opportunities available, this plan can lead to success, and I would recommend it."}
{"text_id_kaggle": "62A6A91A2C46", "output_essay": "Do you know why honesty is good for us? I believe in the old saying that honesty is the best policy. Some people don't agree because they want to hurt others. But honesty is good because it doesn't hurt people's feelings. When we are honest with each other, people respect us and become our friends. Honesty can take us to a higher level.\n\nHonesty is good because it doesn't break people's hearts. We can make friends by being honest. When we are honest, people like us, and they don't talk bad about us. But some people might get annoyed.\n\nLet me give you an example: if someone hits another student, and you tell an adult, the person who hit the student gets in trouble. You showed your honesty, and the student who got hit becomes your friend. The one who hit the student doesn't become your friend because you told on them.\n\nHere's another example: if someone steals money from someone's pocket, and you catch them, the person who stole the money might not like you. But other people will be your friend because you showed honesty. It's like if you hit your brother, and your mom asks who hit first, and you say, 'Me.' You showed your honesty.\n\nI believe that honesty is the best thing if we want to make our community better. I recommend that we show honesty to each other, so we can make the world a better place."}

Sometimes, we don't have time to dress up for an occasion, or we're not sure what the occasion is. But people need to dress right for the occasion. I learned this when I got my first job and dressed formally.\n\nWhen you get a chance to change your first impression, you can. But it's not just about what you wear; you need to show you're smart and can work with others. That's who you are.\n\nPeople need to dress right for different occasions. When you go to a job interview, you need to dress formally. The first impression is what people remember when they hear your name. It's hard for people not to want to change for a new opportunity in the future. Some people disagree, but in my opinion, what you wear shows who you are and how you feel.\n\nMy life experiences have taught me that when I get up in the morning, I dress right for school because when you want to be a good person and student, your clothes matter. The first impression is like a photo of you; it shows who you are, but you can change it with your actions. My opinion is that you need to be yourself, or if you have a good role model, that's okay. I want to be like my grandfather and mom when I grow up because they have strong opinions about life and work.\n\nBeing smart is more than just how you look. It's not impossible to change. People change things about themselves to prove they can change their first impression. There are many selfish and critical people who judge based on how you look or where you're from. But people have different cultures and habits, and some like their own. People judge books by their covers. Being smart is key to succeeding, but if your first impression was bad, you need to work to make a better one.\n\nIn conclusion, it's a bad idea to think that first impressions can't be changed. It's possible to change. For example, when I started my job, I was nervous, but I wanted to make a good impression on my boss. I work in a restaurant and need to talk to customers; my first impression and verbal skills are important to improve. Your impression makes people judge you as good or bad; it's important for different reasons. In my opinion, I disagree with those who think first impressions can't be changed, and I agree with people who think differently and have more self-esteem."}

There are many keys to success, but a positive attitude is the most important. If I have a negative attitude, I may not succeed. Many successful people say that attitude affects success. I agree because a positive attitude is necessary to overcome problems. A positive attitude means having good thoughts, a good mindset, good problem-solving skills, and a good life.\n\nOne reason I agree is that older people with a lot of experience say that having a positive attitude makes success easier. I also need to work hard to succeed, and a positive attitude is essential. My friend, who is very successful, told me that everyone who wants to succeed needs a positive attitude. It helps to have a good mindset to overcome obstacles.\n\nAnother reason I believe this is because many famous people say it takes effort to have a positive attitude. They also say that having a positive attitude is not easy because life is full of problems, and it's easy to have a negative attitude. But a positive attitude can really help achieve success. For example, if I have a negative attitude, I'll always think negatively, and that won't help me succeed.\n\nSome people think that a positive attitude is not important, and that success is just about working hard and solving problems with a negative attitude. But I think solving problems with a positive attitude is the best way. It helps me stay positive and be ready to face more challenges. In the end, I'll find success, and it will be because of my positive attitude.\n\nEveryone has their own way to succeed, but a positive attitude is very important. It can make everything easier and better. A positive attitude can bring continuous progress and good things to my life, so the best way to succeed is to have a very positive attitude.

They might want to help their family or focus on their own goals. They still need to think about school and buy necessary materials for online learning. By doing things on their own, they can take care of what truly matters.\n\nAnother reason for online classes is spending more time with family and friends. If you go on a trip, you can take your materials and computer with you and work whenever you want. Just don't forget to finish your schoolwork. You can even email your teacher to let them know what's going on.\n\nSome kids prefer to work alone and focus on their own goals. They might feel uncomfortable in crowds or have personal reasons for not wanting to be in a certain place. That's why some kids leave during lunch or other times during the day. They might get in trouble, but online classes could be a better option for them.\n\nI think kids who feel this way should have the chance to take online classes instead of going to school.

Failure helps you succeed.\n\nYou might wonder, \"How does failure help you succeed?\" Well, you learn from your mistakes and do better next time. You get another chance to succeed, and if you use it well, you'll feel proud. If you don't, you might feel sorry. Many people give up after failing because they're afraid of failing again. Later, they wish they had tried harder the second time.\n\nFor example, I failed my biology test the first time, so I gave up. But then I felt sorry, so I tried again. Not only did I pass, but I got a higher score than I needed. Since then, I've been trying harder, even when I fail."}

But the next time you meet, they get a different vibe from you. That's why you should always be yourself. This is how you make a strong connection with someone and they'll remember you.\n\nI once liked a girl, and we talked for a while. We started dating, but I messed up. We were going to break up anyway because she had to go to college. The last time we hung out, I saw another girl earlier that day. I didn't tell her because I was scared. The next day, we broke up. A few months later, I texted her 'I'm sorry' and told her what I did. She was upset and blocked me on social media. A few months later, I asked to meet up and talk. She said okay.

You must be yourself and be polite. Make them want to see you again. You can't disappoint. I've seen people not get a job or a girl because of their first impression. You must be confident and ready to be yourself.\n\nMy best friend liked a girl, and I told him to make a good impression. He got nervous and the girl walked away.

Every day in school is like a treasure, and those memories stay with us. Finishing high school in three years instead of four is not good for students.\n\nFirst, learning can't be rushed. Students need time to remember what they learned, gain experience, and use that knowledge in real life. Some students come from other countries and start with little English, so they need time to learn the language and other subjects. If they're told to rush, they might give up. They also need to adjust to a new country and way of life.\n\nSecond, students under eighteen are still kids, and kids need time to play, study, and rest. They shouldn't be forced to act like adults. In high school, kids make friends, have fun, and trust each other. Using all their free time to study is a bad idea. They also need time for elective classes, like physical education, to learn new skills and stay healthy. Too much study time leads to stress, which can cause mental problems.\n\nFinally, using one year of high school to study or work is a waste. After high school, students go to college and focus on studying, making it hard to make friends. If they get a job, they might make friends with coworkers, but it's different from high school friendships. Adults think differently, making it harder to connect.\n\nWho's better: someone who finished high school in three years and was successful, or someone who took four years and was also successful? When their grandchildren ask about their high school memories, the person who took four years will have more stories to share.\n\nIt's up to us to decide how we want to live. Staying four years in high school is better than rushing out in three years and missing out on rest, play, and learning."}

We need to stay strong and focused on what we want to do and who we want to be. For example, when my brother and I came to America five years ago, our family wanted us to study and become successful. My father gave us the chance to study. However, on the first day of school, my brother started hanging out with bad friends. He began skipping school with them. The school called my father every day about my brother's absence.\n\nMy brother told my father that he was late to class because he went to the bathroom. But he was actually in class. My father didn't believe him and didn't say anything. One day, a teacher called my father to talk about my brother and me because she was confused. She wanted to know why I was in school every day and my brother wasn't.\n\nThe next day, my father went to school. The teacher told him that my brother had six unexcused absences and was worried about him. My father was very angry that my brother was lying and skipping school. The teacher also told my father that I was trying hard in school and had passed a big test.\n\nWhen we got home, my father was very angry with my brother and asked him why he skipped school. My brother didn't say anything and ran to our room, angry. The next day, my brother left the house to go to my aunt's house because he didn't like being told what to do. I stayed in school, trying to be someone in life and get a better job.\n\nI agree with Emerson's statement: being yourself in a world that tries to change you is the greatest achievement. You need to show the world who you are and be proud of it. It's important because it makes you a good person. For example, it can open many doors in your life. If you lose your job, companies may try to help you. They can give you a job or recommend you to a good company. That's why I agree with Emerson."}

I don't think it's a good idea to force someone to join a school activity. Students should be able to decide what's good for them. If someone makes you do it, it's not helpful.\n\nThere are many clubs and sports in school, but the number varies depending on the school. You might not get to join the one you want, and that's okay. If there are no spots left or no activities you like, the school might force you to do something you don't want to do. That's pointless. Many students join outside clubs or sports from the community. The school can't know if you join or not because they don't know what's going on in your life.\n\nTime management is important, but it's hard to balance everything. The school doesn't know how many tests you have to study for or what's going on at home. These things can affect your life a lot. It's unfair to add more work to your plate.\n\nForcing someone to do something never works. My mom used to tell me to clean my room, and I would do it, but I would complain and fight about it. Now that I'm older, I clean my room on my own because it's not a problem. But if my mom told me I had to clean my room, I would think it's unfair and pointless.\n\nMaking someone join an activity is not fair and can harm the student in the future. It can affect their time management, their ability to do sports on their own, and their academics.

In my opinion, it's better to send kids to school. They will benefit from attending classes because it can motivate them. Distance learning is not good because it makes cheating easier, reduces social interaction, and requires high motivation.\n\nOne of the biggest advantages of going to school is improving social skills. Students develop these skills by interacting with teachers and classmates. Since they come from different backgrounds, they learn from each other. For example, they can learn about other religions or moral practices from their peers.\n\nSchools also regularly assess student growth and development through tests and homework. This process prepares students for the competitive world. For example, they can prove their learning, ability, and dedication.\n\nOn the other hand, teaching kids at home has some advantages. With full attention, kids are more likely to understand the subject well. They can also learn in a comfortable way with their family. However, they won't make new friends or socialize with different people. Some parents don't have time to supervise their kids, so it's better for them to go to school.\n\nIn conclusion, both approaches have advantages, but sending kids to school makes them more successful in life.

This shows that some high school students who graduate a year earlier are ready for independence.\n\nSecond, getting into college a year earlier helps students in many ways. For instance, they have more time to build their career. They can also graduate earlier, get a job, and start building their financial life. This means they can start working and earning money sooner.\n\nThird, students who take summer or evening courses show they are responsible and ready for independence. If a student takes responsibility for their life, it shows they are mature and focused.

{"text_id_kaggle": "149AA9153485", "output_essay": "Failure is a big part of success. To be successful, you must try and fail. Failure is one of the steps to achieve your goals.\n\nPeople need to fail a few times to learn how to be successful. For example, I played a game called Dead Ops and got very good at it. I tried to break the solo world record but didn't come close. I learned from my mistakes and tried again. I kept failing, but I got closer to my goal. After almost two years, I finally broke the record. I couldn't have done it without failing over a hundred times and never giving up.\n\nFailure helps people grow and develop. If someone never fails, they won't have what it takes to be successful. People who are naturally good at things often have big egos and are selfish. This mindset won't let them push themselves. Without pushing themselves, they won't fail, and they won't achieve their goals. Failure teaches you to keep trying and what holds you back from success. For example, my sister is very smart and talented, but she never had to work hard to succeed. She got a big attitude and became selfish. Now that she's in harder classes, she struggles to accept bad grades and change to get better.\n\nSuccess is built on many failures. To succeed, you need to fail many times. For example, my friend wanted to get good at resolving, so he kept failing in fights, but he kept trying. One day, he won a match against his coach. He couldn't have done it if he hadn't failed and learned from his mistakes. Failure is not bad; people just think it's bad. In reality, failure is very important. It guides you to success. If you don't fail, you'll never succeed.\n\nFailure and success are two sides of the same coin. Someone who doesn't fail will never build character and gain important life skills. Success is a trophy built on many failures. Failure is simply a step towards your goal, and without it, there would be no goal to push yourself for."}

We all have problems, but we don't show them. We want to be successful in life and in our careers. Just because we take night classes or online courses to finish high school doesn't mean we don't want to come to school. We have responsibilities to take care of. In 2019-2020, some parents are kicking their 17-18-year-old kids out of the house. Some kids are homeless, and some can't even buy food because things are bad at home. I'm an 18-year-old high school senior, but my life isn't fun and happy like others. My family is kicking me out, and I'm working two jobs to pay rent and phone bills. It's not easy living in the world at a young age, thinking my parents want me to go to college or the military. But that changed. I'm one of those kids who goes through this every day. I work hard to be where I am today. We can't change the past, but we can change the future. Kids my age are working one or two jobs. Parents think we want to be part of the real world, so they want us out of the house. But we can't fix anything. If I was a teacher, I would ask, 'Why are you upset?' These kids want to finish school early to do something big with their life, but no one understands our point of view. We come to school with a smile, but life is hard. I tell my friends that even if you don't like what your family is doing, at least they love you and want you to succeed. I'm not here to be sad or make you feel bad; I'm here to tell you to keep an open mind about students like us. We may be late to class, but we push through everything we go through. No matter what happens, we'll find a way to finish high school or take classes. I'm not here to hang out with friends; I'm here for our future and careers. I encourage you to listen to what we have to say. It's easier if you try to understand us instead of putting us down. I want kids to know that life gets better. I'm talking to you, and I want you to have a heart and think about these kids. We don't need any more pain because we couldn't give 10-15 minutes of our time to a student. I always say that it's pain leaving the body, but I'm leaving today with you having a heart. Encourage students to finish high school and join college or the workforce. If we don't, there will be nothing left in this world except kids hurting themselves because of what schools and parents put them through. I'm not here to make you feel bad; I'm here to tell you to listen to our stories. I'm not part of a world that hates; it should be about happiness and kind words.

{"text_id_kaggle": "BD8D21AC238D", "output_essay": "Today, I want to talk about how some schools think it's a good idea for students to attend school online.\n\nThe author asked, 'Do you think students would benefit from attending school from home?' \n\nI believe students will benefit in many ways. For example, if a student is sick, they can attend classes from their bed without going to school and getting others sick.\n\nThis also helps people with disabilities, as they can access classes from home easily.\n\nWatching videos and taking notes at home helps students who live far away or work at night and sleep in late. They can simply access the class from home when they wake up, without rushing.\n\nThis also helps students finish their classes faster than a normal school day.\n\nStudents who travel to visit family during the school season can also access classes from home at any time they are available.\n\nHowever, there are some negative effects to consider. Some students have trouble understanding videos and don't learn anything from the lesson. But there's a solution: hiring online live teachers who can answer questions quickly.\n\nTo reduce the pressure on teachers, they should also create a virtual machine that can answer simple questions from students.\n\nThis way, students will learn better and easier because they can get more information from teachers.\n\nSchools that offer distance learning should also have an online brainstorming session after finishing lessons. This helps students remember and understand more about the lesson.\n\nAnother way schools can help students is to provide extra practice questions after they complete a lesson, like a small quiz. If they do poorly, the result should show them what to focus on more.\n\nWhen the student returns to school, the teacher should ask if they have any questions from the lesson they completed.\n\nSo, what if attending school online is not beneficial for students? What are the negative effects? What should schools do to prevent them?\n\nAttending school online is always beneficial and will lead our society to the future. There will be both positive and negative effects.\n\nTo get rid of the negative effects, schools need to find the cause of the problem and figure out a solution. In a few years, all schools will offer distance learning, and more people will choose it."}

{"text_id_kaggle": "8D9B9718475E", "output_essay": "When I was a kid, I always asked my parents about their character and mine. They always said, 'You will decide what kind of person you want to be.' I didn't really believe it until I grew up. I agree with John Lubbock, a British naturalist and politician, that our character is what we choose to be.\n\nFirst, the neighborhood where you grow up has a big impact on your character. For example, if you grow up in a nice neighborhood, you are likely to be a good citizen, educated, and have good traits. I grew up in a nice neighborhood in Vietnam where there was no lying, arguing, or fighting. This helped me develop honesty and integrity, which helped me a lot in school.\n\nSecond, parents play a big role in shaping your character. How they raise you is important. If they push you to focus on education, you are likely to become successful and influence your own kids later. My parents, like many Asian parents, wanted me to succeed. They made me do my homework quickly and go to bed early, which taught me responsibility.\n\nFinally, how you treat people also affects your character. Asian parents teach their kids to respect the elderly, bow to show respect, and help those in need. My parents taught me to respect everyone, which helped me develop respect for society.\n\nSome people may develop good characters without anyone's help, but this is rare. Forming a good character without the right influences is hard. Missing these key elements makes it difficult to develop good character traits. So, our character is what we choose to make it.\n\nThe three examples I provided show how these factors help shape the person you want to be. Having good character traits can be helpful or important for your future."}

Running is a great way to build leg strength, just like track or cross country. Biking is also good for building strong legs. All sports are good for you, but sometimes you can get hurt, like breaking a bone or spraining an ankle. This can take a long time to heal. But it happens to everyone sometimes. To me, sports make me happy because they're fun. I sweat a lot when I play, but you don't have to play every day. Some people play two times a week, while others play every day. My favorite sport is soccer. In soccer, we need to run a lot to have good endurance. That's why playing sports is my best skill.

They told me about things that happened when they were kids and things that happen now that they're adults. Sharing experiences is good because we can learn from them and do things better.\n\nFor example, my mom told me about something that happened to her when she was a kid. She was playing outside with her brother and sister when a kid threw a big rock that hit her on the head. She started crying, and they went to the hospital to see if she was okay. They didn't find anything broken, but her head hurt a lot. They looked for the kid who threw the rock, but they couldn't find him.\n\nMy teacher told me about a student she had in seventh grade. He didn't want to do his work or study. He just wanted to talk to his friends or play with his phone. The teacher told him that if he didn't do his work, he wouldn't be successful in life. So, the student started doing his work and studying. Now, he's in high school, getting ready for a job.\n\nMy teacher also told me and my classmates about something that happened to her a year ago. She was walking down the street when she found a $50 bill on the floor. She looked around to see if it belonged to someone near her, but she didn't see anyone. So, she picked it up. Then, she saw a homeless person and gave him the $50 bill. She didn't keep it for herself. Sometimes, we need to give to others, not just take from them. The person she gave the money to was very happy.\n\nIn conclusion, it's important to learn from the experiences that people have shared with us.

From that first meeting, we can learn how they handle stress, open up about their past, and more.\n\nThe first impression I got from someone changed my life. Her name was Generic_Name, and she was my guidance counselor in high school. I didn't know much about her, except that she was my assigned counselor. At the time, my home life was tough, and I felt overwhelmed. I needed help, so I went to the guidance counseling center. That's where Generic_Name and I met for the first time. I showed her a struggling kid, and she showed me a beacon of hope.\n\nThe reassurance she gave me was like nothing I'd ever known. I wanted to thank her, so I visited her eight times. But every time, the head of guidance counseling said she was out getting treatment and would be back soon. I kept hoping to see her again, but I didn't know that our first meeting would be our last. The school announced that Generic_Name had passed away from cancer. We all went to her funeral to pay our respects. I heard stories from other students about how she had changed their lives for the better.\n\nThe impression Generic_Name gave me, and everyone else, was that you don't have to go through tough times alone. Taking that small step to meet someone for the first time can leave a lasting impression. I completely agree that first impressions are impossible to change, whether it's helping students escape a bad home life or getting them a full scholarship to their dream college. Everyone can be affected by that special first impression, whether it's a short meeting or a long conversation. One thing is for sure: in those short but powerful 15 minutes, a first impression is something that will never change for me."}

For example, some might have been abused, are homeless, or in foster care. The principal should ask students how they feel about changing school activities. Most students don't like sports because coaches are too hard on them or they're just not interested. When a student is behind in school, they need time to catch up. Some kids don't have time for yearbook or student council. Many don't like yearbook because it takes days to finish a page. Some can't do student council because they can't behave or focus. I have a few more points. Some parents don't let their kids play sports like football because of injuries, concussions, and even deaths. Some students have health problems that prevent them from playing sports, like leukemia or scoliosis. I think students shouldn't have to join at least one after-school activity.

You might need quick information. For example, if you're dating a girl and don't know whether to bring flowers or chocolate, you can ask someone quickly. You can get someone's opinion for the future. Maybe someone tells you what to do or what not to do; you might do it or not. Searching for advice is a good way to get an opinion you might use in the future.\n\nFinally, the last good reason to get many opinions is that your own opinion might not be good, and you might need others' opinions. If you can't think of a good way to give an opinion, a good option is to ask someone. So, you don't have an excuse for something. If you stay at home, pretending to be sick, and the next day you have a big test, there is no excuse; you should have asked for someone's opinion. You can ask for someone's opinion so that nothing bad happens to you. You should ask for a doctor's opinion so that nothing bad happens to you or your family. Lastly, you should ask for people's opinions so that you won't regret anything that happens later on.\n\nMost of the time, people ask for multiple opinions because they want to know what others think. The reasons I wrote are very important to opinions, to use and make, that's why I really think that many opinions are important in life."}
{"text_id_kaggle": "9D3EE733AE65", "output_essay": "Forcing students to stick to one career path is like trying to quiet a whole classroom in one second.\n\nOne reason schools shouldn't make students choose a career too early is that they might change their minds halfway through high school. They won't have another option to fall back on because they focused too much on that one career. Also, making them choose early can be too overwhelming for them. They're too young to make such a big decision. \n\nStudies show that making high schoolers choose early can lead them to pick a career they don't really want. Some people think making students choose early is good because it prepares them for the future. But it's not that simple. At a young age, students need to try out different careers before they make a final choice. They should have a chance to explore many career options and take classes based on those interests. Then, towards the end of high school, they can choose the classes they're good at.\n\nThe choices they make early on can be very stressful and affect their mental health. Some students can't handle the pressure of choosing a career at such a young age. Making big life decisions should take time, not just one year. Although these choices can help in life, it doesn't change the fact that students can change their minds about a career. But by then, it might be too late to change, so they're stuck learning about a career they don't want anymore.\n\nStudies show that young students don't really know what they want to do in life. When asked, they usually hesitate and say whatever comes to mind. Young high schoolers shouldn't be expected to make big life choices because they're not ready. Think about it - when you were younger, did you really know what you wanted to do? Probably not. You might have thought you knew, but then you grew up and realized your choice was silly, so you changed it. Nobody really knows what they want to do until they find their passion, not just by writing it down on paper.\n\nIn conclusion, high school students shouldn't make big choices too early in life because they might change their minds. Even if they have an idea of what they want to do, they can always change their minds. The years they spent learning a skill they might never use again will be wasted. So, students should take their time making their choices."}

He meant that when you have a problem, you should try to solve it and learn from it. Everyone makes mistakes, and nobody is perfect. Remember when you first learned to walk? It was hard at first, but you got up and tried again. The same thing happens when you learn to tie your shoes or drive a car. It's not easy, but you keep trying until you get it right. If you believe in yourself, you should never give up, especially if it's something you really want to do. Think about when you wanted to cook like your parents. You tried, and it didn't work out at first, but you kept trying until you got it right. You felt proud of yourself when you finally did it. The same thing happens when you get a dog. It might make a mess at first, but you can train it and make it listen to you. Going to a new school can be scary, but it's also a chance to meet new people and try new things. Just because something doesn't work out at first doesn't mean it won't work if you keep trying. You will always face obstacles, but if you keep going, you'll get past them. If you fail a test, you can do corrections and get better. When you have a problem, don't be afraid to ask for help. If it's a problem with a friend, talk to them. If it's about school, talk to a teacher. There's no shame in asking for help. Solving the problem is better than letting it get worse. I think Duke Ellington was right. A problem is a chance to do your best. There's always a good side and a bad side, and sometimes you have to make a choice. It's always best to choose what's best for you. If you make a mistake, just remember that things will get better."}

This can change your initial impression of them.\n\nWhen you learn more about someone, you see them from a different perspective. You might like them more or less than you did when you first met them. But the real person is not what you thought they were at first. First impressions don't tell you everything about someone. It's important to get to know people better to really understand them.\n\nSometimes, you can have a bad impression of someone because you met them at the wrong time. But as you get to know them better, you realize they're not like that. On the other hand, you can have a good impression of someone who's not really a good person. It's hard to change your impression of someone if you don't interact with them much.\n\nIn my life, I've had many friends who seemed nice at first but turned out to be different. One example is when you meet someone at a party and they seem cool, but later you see them drunk and acting badly. This happens a lot.\n\nA person's personality is very important. It shows you who they really are and how they treat others. This can change your first impression of someone completely. When I met my best friend, I thought he was a spoiled rich kid. But as I got to know him better, I realized he was a kind and thoughtful person.\n\nIn conclusion, first impressions can change, and it's important to get to know people better to really understand them.

{"text_id_kaggle": "6B9A6E422587", "output_essay": "EARLY GRADUATION\n\nMost people think that graduating early is amazing, but do you know what it really means? Only 5% of students can finish high school in three years instead of four. A survey shows that most students don't know what to do with their lives after graduation. In high school, students are not mature enough to make important decisions, so they don't know what to do. High school is not easy, and students can't finish their education early. They have to do four years' worth of work in three years, which means they have to attend summer school, stay after school, and go to night school. They have a lot of work to do, so they won't have time for other things, like having a job or free time. If students are always under pressure, they will suffer from stress. Stress is a real problem that affects students and their grades, and it stops them from having a relaxed life.\n\nThe normal four years in high school give students the chance to grow up and develop their way of thinking. They can figure out what they want in the future, what's right and wrong, and what their abilities are. After high school, they have to start their real life, be independent, and make important decisions. It's hard to decide what you want to be when you're still young, and it's even harder if you have to make that decision early. The goal of education is to help students discover who they are, and it's up to them to use what they learned in their new life.\n\nMost students don't want to finish high school early because it's too hard. You have to do the same work as the four years, but with less time, and that's more stressful. Students say that if you want to graduate early, you have to work day and night without a break. You have to work on holidays too, and that's not a good idea. If you can finish school in four years, why rush? School is the most important part of each student's life, where you find yourself, and it's not good to be overwhelmed with homework, tests, and projects. Students have to live their moment, enjoy each time of life, learn from mistakes, and live life.\n\nResearchers say that one of the biggest problems teenagers face is stress. Stress can cause many problems, such as health issues, sleep problems, and anger. In extreme cases, stress can even lead to suicide. It's not normal for students to suffer from stress. They should follow the normal process and not have too much work to do. Students have to go at their own pace and learn that it's okay to go slow. School should be interesting and fun, not something that destroys their life.\n\nFor these reasons, it's clear that programs that let high school students graduate early can affect their lives more than improve them. The duty of a high school student is to succeed in their education and develop their skills. But they should also enjoy their youth, have fun, and make memories with the people they love. They don't have to start making important decisions too early, and they don't have to live with stress. School is important, but there has to be a balance. Now you know, life isn't a race, there is time to do everything. You can take your time, make mistakes, start again, and learn many things. You can do whatever you want because you have time, but you only have one life."}

I've had different experiences that make me think some people choose their traits, while others are shaped by their influences. I learned some traits from friends and family. But I also have traits that can't be changed, which make me who I am. I always try to be myself and not pretend to be someone else.\n\nFrom my experience, I think some people's traits are formed by influences. When you spend time with someone, you learn from them. People often repeat what they hear from friends. They see what others do and try to be like them.\n\nIn tenth grade, I had a friend named Generic_Name. He started hanging out with new friends and changed. He began using words he learned from them. He skipped school and did things he learned from them. He stopped listening to teachers. Later, he told me he was doing drugs and drinking with his friends. I stopped talking to him because he changed a lot after hanging out with different people.\n\nHowever, I also think some people choose their traits because they focus on what they're doing and don't care about others. They want to be unique and different. Some people are good and care about others, and they don't change.\n\nIn ninth grade, I met a girl who focused on her work. She wasn't distracted by others. If students were talking or playing, she didn't care; she kept working. She had few friends, so she didn't learn bad things.

Some people have different opinions about this. In my opinion, I think it's a good idea to give some students the chance to finish high school in three years if they've worked hard for it. \n\nSome people might not agree with this because they think students are too young to take on adult responsibilities. However, I think it's a good idea for some students to finish high school in three years. \n\nFirst, students can do something better with their fourth year. I think students could be doing something more important than wasting their time in school. For example, a student could go to college one year early and start their career early. Students could plan their life and do productive things in that fourth year, and that's why they want to graduate early. \n\nNext, some students want to graduate as soon as possible. Some students don't like school and just want to graduate. Some students want to be successful at an early age. We have to understand that some students don't live with their parents and need to work, but they also want to graduate. Giving students the chance to graduate in three years would help them a lot. \n\nFinally, students can learn to be responsible at an early age. I think finishing high school in three years would help students grow mentally. Students would have adult responsibilities early, and I think that's a good thing. Their morale would be stronger, and they would learn to deal with hard things in life. \n\nIn conclusion, is it a good idea to graduate from high school in three years? In my opinion, I think it's a good option for some students. Students who have their credits and are ready to graduate should do so in three years. Students with important goals in life should consider finishing high school in three years. Some people might think that finishing high school in three years is not a good idea, but I think it is because students can do something better, some students want to graduate early, and students can learn to be responsible early."}

If we don't follow the rules, we can get in serious trouble. As teenagers, we have to follow the curfew law, which says we can't drive after 10 p.m. on weekdays. We also can't drive during the midnight curfew because if we're speeding or doing something wrong, the police will stop us. They might be hiding and using their speed cameras. If the police ask for our license or permit and we're driving without an adult, we can get in big trouble. We have to be careful and follow the curfew law to stay out of trouble. Teenagers should keep track of time on their phones to make sure they get home early, no later than 10 p.m.\n\nI remember when I was 10 years old, my 17-year-old cousin had a curfew to be home by 10 p.m. He went out with friends at night, and my aunt was worried because it was getting late and he hadn't come home. At 2 a.m., the police called my aunt to tell her that my cousin was racing with another car and got into a bad accident. He broke his nose and needed stitches on his hand and face. He learned his lesson not to drive or hang out with friends at midnight because it's dangerous.\n\nIn my opinion, parents should track their kids' location to see where they are and call or text them to come home. Parents always want the best for their kids. We teenagers don't like to listen to our parents because they can be overprotective, but that's because they don't want anything bad to happen to us. Parents are right to be mad at their kids because we don't like to listen; we just want to hang out with friends without thinking about the dangers.

If students don't want to participate, it's okay. Some might not want to take an extra class. The principal's choice shouldn't be required. There should be an agreement with students, and if some agree, they should add more options, not just sports. For example, they could work on the yearbook or serve on the Student Council. There are only a few options, and they might not be fun or exciting. That's why they weren't mentioned, and they involve a lot of physical activity. I strongly disagree with the principal's idea of making it required. It could affect attendance. Students might skip class because they hate it, or they might not come to school at all. That's not what the principal wants. The principal wants students to exercise and move, but students don't want to, and they will complain.

I think teenagers should be allowed to be out on the streets at 10 P.M. on weekdays and midnight on weekends. They should be able to go wherever they want at those times. The City Council shouldn't make a new curfew law for all teenagers.\n\nCurfews can't stop teenagers from getting into trouble. Teenagers are like adults; they can make their own decisions about what they want to do. The City Council is just interfering with young people's lives unfairly. My life is a good example. I wake up at 5 a.m. to get ready for school, and after school, I work from 4 P.M. to 11 P.M. I only work 7 hours because I need time to do my homework, use my phone, and read my favorite books.\n\nIf the curfew law is passed and I'm out at 11 P.M., it means I'm breaking the law! Some teenagers don't have parents; they have to work after school and sometimes work extra shifts. That's why I disagree with this curfew law. Not all teenagers who are out on weekdays and weekends are wasting their time; they're working hard for a better future.\n\nThis is a tough debate. The City Council isn't keeping teenagers out of trouble. Teenagers are in charge of their own lives. Some people think adopting the curfew is the best way to keep teenagers safe. But the best way to keep teenagers safe is to teach them not to use drugs and alcohol. If teenagers use drugs and alcohol, they might not listen to their parents.

For example, it took him a long time to do homework, he was very lazy, and he hardly spoke. It was like he didn't learn anything, and the online classes made him feel down. That's why I think students shouldn't take online classes because they need to learn at a normal pace, they can't ask teachers as many questions, and sitting at home alone makes them lazy.\n\nWhen students learn too quickly, it slows down their learning. They just want to finish their work fast and don't care about learning. They also think too quickly and might not understand what they're doing. This can affect their future. Therefore, it can affect how they communicate with others.\n\nAnother reason students shouldn't take online classes is that they can't get help from teachers easily. Yes, there are good online teachers, but they can't help like classroom teachers do. Classroom teachers can stay after school to help students, but online teachers just give lessons and leave. Classroom teachers can also help with other subjects. This helps students understand and learn better than sitting at home alone.\n\nThe biggest problem is that online classes make students lazy. When students take online classes, they just sit and learn with no physical activity, which makes them lazy. It also affects how hard they work and how responsible they are. So, it can really affect students' lives and futures.\n\nSome people might say that online classes can give students a better education and more time with their families.

These problems stop them from eating foods with sugar and grease. If we change the school menu to a healthier one, students will learn how important it is to be healthy.\n\nHealth issues are a big problem worldwide. Some students at school can't stop eating unhealthy food from the cafeteria, which makes their health problems worse. There are many reasons for this. Some students need to eat healthy, but they can't bring their lunch to school because they don't have time or wake up late. Also, some parents can't afford to buy healthy food for their kids. If we have a healthier menu at the cafeteria, it will be easier for students to make good choices.\n\nWhen you eat healthy, you feel more energetic. Imagine if students ate healthier at school; they would have more energy and their brains would work better. Students often say they're tired after lunch because they only have fatty food to eat. I'm not saying we should only have healthy food; a little sugar is okay too. When you have more energy, you can focus better.\n\nWhen you make healthy choices at school, it's easier to stay healthy. You're at school for seven hours every day, so having a healthy menu helps you stay fit and prevents more health problems. By changing the menu, you can improve the lifestyle of most students."}

You can do a lot without someone in your way. It helps you realize that problems don't get you anywhere in life, and it helps you do good things. If you want to achieve something and you have too many problems, you will never achieve good things in life.

In high school, they take classes that will help them get their dream job. After high school, half of the students go to college, and the other half starts working. For those who are working, the boss will check if they have any work experience or volunteering they did in the past. They will also look at the classes they took in high school. This helps them start their career. I don't think it's a good idea for students to start working at a young age.\n\nOne problem with working is getting hired. When you apply for a job, the boss will look at your application and set a date for an interview. But if you don't have any work experience or volunteering, you won't get the job. I think students should volunteer instead of working. This way, they can get experience and help with their graduation requirements.\n\nAnother problem with having a job is being responsible. If you have a job far from your house and no way to get there, you might get fired. Some students work in the afternoon and sleep before going to work. They might oversleep and get fired. I'm not good at turning in my school assignments on time, so I know it's hard to be responsible. I think students should practice being responsible by doing their chores, going to team training, and doing their homework.\n\nThe last problem with starting a career at a young age is taking the right classes. In high school, there are required classes that will help you get into college. If you don't take these classes, you might have to take online classes or summer classes. This will help you get into your dream college and start your career. For example, my cousin went to college for six years and now has her own office and makes good money.\n\nIn conclusion, I think students should finish high school, go to college, get their degree, and then start their career.

For example, you can tell a lot about someone just by looking at them. I'm guilty of this too - I see someone and think, 'I don't like them,' but it's not fair to judge them without knowing them. Maybe they're exactly what I thought, but maybe not. It's my opinion, and I can change it when I get to know them.

People can change, and maybe you can be the one to help them change. We're all human, and we all have the same feelings. It's not right to make people feel bad about themselves. People can change for better or worse, but we all do. We might judge someone who's having a bad day and doesn't have anyone to talk to. Instead, get to know someone before making judgments.

Some people might get the wrong idea and think you don't like them, and then they might think poorly of you too. But can you change your opinion of someone? You never know until you try. I'm trying to open people's eyes and make a change because I've made a change myself. I might look bad to some people, but it's just a bad day, and people are staring at me, making me feel bad.

First, they keep teenagers safe from nighttime robberies. Many robberies happen at night and claim lives, especially those of teenagers.\n\nThe new curfew will help teenagers stay safe from robberies. Second, curfews prevent teenagers from getting into car accidents. Most accidents happen at night because the driver is sleepy or drunk. A government survey shows that over 70% of accidents happen at night due to drunk, sleepy, or distracted driving. These curfews help keep teenagers safe from car accidents that mostly happen at night.\n\nLastly, places that are open at night, like bars and clubs, are risky for teenagers. Some teenagers like to go to these places and have fun, but they don't realize how much they're putting their lives at risk. When teenagers go to these places, they're more likely to drink or smoke.

If you lie to people, they won't trust you. When something serious happens, they won't believe you because they won't know if it's true or not.\n\nBeing nice to people is also important. If you're kind to someone who needs help, it makes you look better as a person. You can even motivate someone to try something new. Another reason to be honest is that if something bad happens, you need to tell the truth, no matter what. You should always be honest, even if it hurts someone's feelings."}

Some people think it's a problem, but others see it as a way for students to get the education they need. Some schools let students take classes at home, where they can learn through online or video conferencing with their teacher. While some people think it's a problem, there are several benefits: students can take their time to get help, focus on their work without distractions, and get the education they need.\n\nOne benefit is that students can take their time to get help when they need it. If a student is struggling with homework or studying for a test, they can ask their teacher for help. The teacher can show them what they're doing wrong and help them until they understand. With many subjects and tasks to finish, students can get stressed. But with their teacher's help, they can take their time to finish their work. This can improve their ability to succeed in class.\n\nAnother benefit is that students can focus on their work without distractions. At home, students have a quiet space to focus on their tasks without other students interrupting them. While they're learning, there's no one to distract them and make them forget what they're doing. Teachers want students to succeed without distractions, so they can understand their lessons and do better on tests and quizzes.\n\nA third benefit is that students get the education they need for their lives. Some students might think what they're learning is pointless, but teachers want them to know that their education will help them in their daily lives. It can be useful when helping others or family and friends. It's a goal to achieve, and it can help them through hard and good times.\n\nSome people think students won't get a good education if they take classes at home, but this isn't true. Students can take their time to get help, focus on their work, and get the education they need. If schools let students take classes at home, it can help them succeed and see how their education can help them teach others."}

We decide who we want to be based on our life experiences. We choose our path in life, and it's up to us to keep our promises to ourselves. Our personalities are our own choice, and it should be that way. No one can tell us what to do or choose our personality for us.\n\nFirst, we choose our personalities because they belong to us, and it's our life. We have the right to make our own decisions. It's our life, so we should choose who we want to be. We have one life, so we should live it the way we want to, not the way others want us to. We have the right to decide what's good or bad for us. We choose our personalities because we have the right to, not others.\n\nSecond, we choose our personalities because we have the right to make our own choices. Everyone has the right to decide for their own life, but no one can decide for others. We have one life, so we should live it the way we want to. We can't turn back time, so we should live life to the fullest. Do what makes you happy, and don't worry about what others think. What matters is what you think and enjoy. We should live our life the way we want to, and choose our personalities because we have the right to.\n\nFinally, we choose our personalities because it's our life. We decide how to live and what to do. It's our decision, not others'. Our personalities are our own, and no one can choose for us. We all have different personalities, and that's okay.

Their courses are chosen to guide them towards a specific career. I think students should keep an open mind about their future and consider different options. In school, we have to take many subjects to graduate, but often, these subjects are not what we're interested in. We learn about history and past events, but why not focus on what we want to do in life?\n\nI believe students should have the freedom to choose what they want to learn. For example, if someone wants to be a lawyer, how does learning about World War I help them? Or how does geometry or history help them become a good lawyer? I think English is important because it teaches us to write and spell properly, which will be useful in the future. Spanish can also be helpful if they have clients who don't speak English.\n\nMy point is, instead of forcing students to take many subjects, schools should let them choose what they want to study based on their career goals. All the subjects teachers teach, how do they really help us in life? It's good to learn about the past, but schools should offer classes that cater to students' interests. If a student is interested in a subject, they should be able to take that class. If not, they should have other options based on their career goals.\n\nStudents should have the opportunity to choose what they think is best for them to learn based on their future careers."}

People will remember how you treat them, so it's always better to be kind.\n\nI remember a time when I was walking with my friends and saw a man asking for help. I gave him some money, and my friends were happy to see me being kind. The man thanked me, and we all smiled. I believe that what you do today will come back to you tomorrow. If you're kind today, someone will be kind to you tomorrow.\n\nKindness is important. You don't have to be a special person to be kind, but it's what makes you a good person. If you're not kind, you're missing something. Try to be good to people, like saying hello or offering to help. For example, if you're eating with your uncle and offer to clean up after him, he'll think you're a kind person. Years later, when you're in a similar situation, someone might return the favor because they saw how kind you were. I learned this from my own experiences, and I know what kindness is all about."}

Boxing helps me in school and daily life by teaching me to work hard for what I want. It gives me the mindset to put in 100% effort in everything I do.\n\nYou might ask, 'How does boxing help you in school and daily life?' Well, it helps me in school by making me hate to lose. When I got bad grades, I would go home and study hard until I understood what I missed. Then, I would retake the test and try to get 100%. Boxing gives me the 'work hard' mindset, so I can tell myself I did my best. It makes me feel proud of myself every time I go to the gym.\n\nBecoming a boxer isn't easy. It takes a lot of work, time, and pain. But it shows that if you want something in life, you have to work for it. We'd rather sleep in, but it's not about what you get at the end; it's about the hard work you put in. For me, boxing has shown that if I put in the time and effort, I can achieve anything.\n\nWhat do I mean by 100% effort? It means you can't just go to the gym and then eat unhealthy food. If you want to achieve something, you have to put in the work every day. Set yourself apart from others; if they get up at 7 am to work out, I'll get up at 6 am every day until I reach my goal.\n\nLastly, that's what I want to achieve in my life. It will take time and work, but I believe it's worth it. That's how boxing helps me in school and daily life, teaching me to work hard and give it my all."}

It means you shouldn't judge someone or something based on how they look. This is important because advice and experience are key to our lives. We learn from each other, and people who share their experiences are trustworthy.\n\nLearning from others helps us avoid making the same mistakes. Older people often give better advice because they've faced more challenges. The person giving advice should have experience in that area and be someone you trust. For example, my dad gives me soccer advice because he's played soccer since he was a kid.

The city should adopt a curfew because it will keep teenagers safe. Here's why: Teenagers won't get involved in drug deals or gun violence. They will be less likely to get kidnapped. They won't get killed or get into car crashes because there are gangs and drunk drivers on the road at night.\n\nIf we didn't have a curfew, teenagers could get into trouble by selling drugs and using guns. They might join a gang and hurt innocent people. They could sell drugs at school or even participate in school shootings. A curfew would keep them out of trouble and make our city safer. This would help many people, especially parents who worry about their kids.\n\nThe second reason we need a curfew is that teenagers could get kidnapped if they're out too late. They could be walking down the street and someone could grab them or hurt them. I've seen people in my neighborhood get kidnapped because they were out too late. Someone might hold a grudge against them and want to hurt them. Teenagers could also get kidnapped when they're out partying with friends. We don't know what could happen to our kids if we don't have a curfew.\n\nMy third reason is that there are gangs and drunk drivers on the road at night. If your son was driving home late and got into a car crash because of a drunk driver, you would regret letting him out. Teenagers could get killed by gangs or get into a car crash. They could even be the ones drinking and driving. There are many things that could go wrong.\n\nIn conclusion, anything could happen to our teenagers. There are many ways they could get into trouble and get hurt. But we can do something to prevent it. Our city can make this law happen, and we need it to happen. I fully agree with this law because it's for the safety of our city and children.

She knew this because it almost happened to her and her friend once. It's important to listen to people's experiences so you don't make the same mistake they did.\n\nThe first reason to share experiences is to avoid making the same mistake as someone else. You can learn from their mistakes and make a better choice. For example, I didn't want to get a flu shot, but my mom told me that she didn't get one once and got sick. So, I decided to get the shot. Listening to people's experiences can help you avoid making the same mistake.\n\nThe second reason is to learn from others. You can learn how to do something better by listening to someone else's experience. Like when my teacher showed me a better way to do something I was doing wrong. It's always better to learn from others and ask for help when you need it. Learning something new is exciting and fun.\n\nThe third reason is that experiences can help you avoid bad things. Bad things never lead to good things. For example, my sister and I got in trouble once for misbehaving. We thought we wouldn't get in trouble, but we did. If we had asked for advice, we could have avoided getting in trouble.

I agree with Emerson. We live in a world that wants us to conform. The internet and media show us ideal images and promote certain ideas. As a result, people often act like what they see online or on TV. Emerson's quote suggests that it's impressive when people remain individual.\n\nIn the past decade, social media has become a major way to communicate and get information. Social media allows people to create their own personality and style, which goes beyond social norms. This has become popular, and many people are inspired to do the same. Social media also lets people share their ideas and interests with the public. It's a great accomplishment to break free from society's expectations and be yourself.\n\nFrom my experience, I enjoy posting pictures on social media that show who I am. However, societal expectations and peer pressure can limit people's ability to express themselves. Social media gives me a voice, but it takes courage to post different ideas for everyone to see. Therefore, I agree with Emerson that being yourself is the greatest accomplishment because it takes bravery to face criticism.\n\nSocial media makes it easy to spread ideas without saying a word. However, it's easy to base a post on someone else's idea rather than being original. I've found that posting a picture in a popular style gets more attention than posting my own thoughts. This shows that social media can actually work against individuality.\n\nSome people who avoid social media often have more life experience and disagree with Emerson. They feel that being themselves is not a big accomplishment compared to other things they've achieved. Others may fit into societal norms, and that's okay for them.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that people should be themselves and have their own individuality. Social media can help people create their own style and speak up for themselves. The internet also supports Emerson's quote. Not caring what others think and being unique is the most important part."}

However, it can also lead to not having time to study, not doing homework, and losing interest in subjects. Schools should only let students join one activity to help them manage their time for studies.\n\nOne reason schools should control extracurricular activities is that some students don't have time for studies because they're involved in too many activities. When students join many activities, they become less interested in studying because they're having fun. For example, I have a friend who struggles in school because he's involved in sports, music, and drama. He spends more time practicing than studying. I once had to choose between practice and a group study, and I chose the study because I know my priorities.\n\nAnother reason schools should control extracurricular activities is that some students don't do their homework because they're too tired from activities. When students come home from school, they're already exhausted from practice. For example, my cousin is a basketball player, and when he comes home, he goes straight to bed without eating because he's too tired. In the morning, he asks for help with his assignment because he didn't do it the night before.\n\nThe last reason schools should control extracurricular activities is that some students lose interest in their subjects because they're involved in too many activities. They have fun in those activities and lose focus on academics. Schools should teach students to make studying their priority before other activities. From my experience, having many activities is not easy, but it's fun and helps you make new friends. However, you can lose interest in subjects if you're not focused.\n\nFor all these reasons, schools should control how much students participate in extracurricular activities, especially for students who want to join many activities. Schools shouldn't just let students do what they want. The school should help students manage their schedule and time. Students should also cooperate with the school because it's for their own good. It depends on the students knowing what their priorities are."}

{"text_id_kaggle": "44A96D63935A", "output_essay": "The world is made up of seven big and amazing continents. Each continent has many different cultures, races, and ethnic groups. Everyone is unique, even if they come from the same country, ethnic group, or family. But one thing that unites us all is our love for food. We may have different food preferences, but we all enjoy eating. This brings me to my topic: even though we love food, there are some types of food we shouldn't eat too often. That's why I think it's a good idea to change the school lunch menu. My reasons are that it's good for our health, it helps us make better choices, and it makes us look fit and good.\n\nFirst, healthy food is good for our bodies. When we eat healthy food most of the time, our bodies work properly. This helps us avoid getting sick often because our bodies can fight off germs and bacteria. Doctors, especially, recommend a healthy diet for teenagers.\n\nSecond, healthy food helps us make better choices. It's not just good for our bodies, but also for our minds. When our bodies are healthy, our brains work better, and we think more clearly. If our school lunches are healthier, I believe students will do better in school. For example, they'll get good grades, participate in class, and ask questions. Students will be more productive, making teachers and families happy, and students will be proud of themselves.\n\nThird, healthy food makes us look physically fit and good. Healthy food like vegetables, eggs, and milk has proteins that our bodies need, especially when we exercise. School lunches are often high in meat and fat, which we need in moderation. If we eat too much of it, it can cause problems. For example, I saw a documentary about people who were overweight and trying to lose weight. They were very sad and disappointed in themselves. They had to work out for hours every day to lose weight. They faced many challenges, and one person even lost his family because of his weight. After a lot of hard work, they lost weight and became healthy again. They all said that an unhealthy diet was the reason they became overweight.\n\nSo, even if it's just school lunch, if it's unhealthy, it can affect us a lot. We have school five days a week, which increases the chances of becoming overweight.\n\nIn conclusion, I think it's a good idea to change the school lunch menu. My three main reasons are that it's good for our health, it helps us make better choices, and it makes us look fit and good. Healthy food helps us physically and mentally, and it helps us think clearly, make good decisions, and be happy. A healthy diet leads to a healthy lifestyle, and we should all consider eating healthy."}

I thought that wasn't fair to him. I knew the girl was having a bad day, so I told her to be kind to the boy. She said sorry to him. Then I told her that when you have a bad day, you should try to stay positive. She agreed with me.\n\nOne time, I had a bad day and was mean to a girl. That made me feel bad too. I told her I was having a bad day, and she said I should stay positive. I thanked her, and she just smiled at me.\n\nIn the end, I think it's a good idea to have a good attitude on a bad day.

The famous artist Michelangelo once said, 'The greater danger for most of us lies not in setting our aim too high and falling short; but in setting our aim too low, and achieving our mark.' I agree with Michelangelo. Today, we often think we're not good enough. We set low standards or easy goals because we don't believe in ourselves. We reach our goal and think that's it. But how do we know that's our limit? We need to be more confident in ourselves. We need to believe we can do the impossible. Even if we fail, we shouldn't be embarrassed. Instead, we should learn from it, move on, and do better next time. We should believe we can do it.\n\nI used to set easy goals because I didn't believe in myself. In middle school, I never took Honors or AP classes because I thought I wasn't smart enough. But how did I know that if I didn't try? Last year, I decided to take an Honors class, Honors English. I asked my teacher if I could take it, and she encouraged me. I was scared on the first day, but as the year went on, I became more confident. The class wasn't as hard as I thought. Now I'm a junior, and I'm planning to take at least two AP classes next year. I totally agree with Michelangelo: don't set easy goals or have low standards. Believe in yourself that you can do more. This is not where you stop. You can do much more."}
{"text_id_kaggle": "B8D4D1B62526", "output_essay": "Some schools offer distance learning, which lets students attend classes from home through online or video conferencing. But does this really help students? I think attending school in person is better because it helps students find their strengths and talents by taking different classes. At school, students can also learn from their teachers and get new skills and experiences. Most importantly, school helps students develop good habits and values that will stay with them for the rest of their lives.\n\nFor example, my high school offers many optional classes like Electricity, Cosmetology, and Floral Design. Last semester, my friend took a Floral Design class and went on exciting field trips. She even helped organize the decoration for Graduation Night. She became very interested in becoming a florist in the future.\n\nStudents who take classes from home don't get to develop these talents and skills. They also miss out on learning from their teachers. My ESL teacher, Ms. Generic_Name, is a great example of this. She is very supportive and helps us with our homework and personal lives. We learn a lot from her and from discussing topics in class. She always says that if we work hard and don't give up, we can achieve our goals.\n\nSchool is very important for students' development. Students who take classes at home often procrastinate because they don't have rules or people to guide them. At school, we can build good habits, values, and skills that will help us in our future jobs and social lives. To succeed in life, we need to go to school, not stay at home.\n\nIn conclusion, attending school in person is better than taking classes from home. It helps students find their strengths, learn from teachers, and develop good habits and values. Let's tell parents and school boards that taking classes at home is not good for students."}

As a friend or family member, they believe you and you start being truthful to them. Honesty helps you be brave, talk openly, and ask for help when needed. Honesty helps us see our mistakes and make our lives better. It also helps us build strong friendships.\n\nBody paragraph 1\n\nIf I show love to people, they will react in a way that shows they trust me. Without honesty, the world would be a bad place. Who would show love to others, and who would show love back to you? When people are honest, they believe me when I tell the truth. Love makes everyone happy and fills their heart. But it's hard to show love when you're not honest, because lying makes us feel guilty and ruins our life.\n\nBody paragraph 2\n\nFriendship is very important. We need friends to be happy. When friends need me, I try to be honest with them. It shows that I care about what they say. I have friends, and when I show them love, I try to be honest. If someone finds out the truth and it's different from what we say, it's a bad decision that hurts people's feelings. Friends are like family, and we take care of them. Friendship is an amazing time that I can spend with honesty.\n\nBody paragraph 3\n\nHelping others when they need us is important. It's a perfect time to learn the meaning of honesty. I think helping others by being honest is very important. Imagine if nobody lied in this world \u2013 we wouldn't need help from others. But some people need honesty, and we need to teach them how to do it. On the other hand, many people lie, including me. I love to help others, and it helps me too.\n\nIn conclusion\n\nTeaching others to be honest is hard, but it's important to me. Loving them is easy, because it's easy to show. Friendship is also important, because we need to show honesty."}

Students who live close to school might also want online classes. Some might want to sleep in later. I've seen students skip school because they oversleep and live far away. Some are late to school because of this.\n\nStudents who live far away are often late to school. Schools should fix their transportation instead of offering online classes. Some students don't have a ride to school, so schools should get better buses. Online classes could be okay for summer school. If kids fail a class during the year, they could retake it online during summer. That's just my opinion about online classes for kids who live far."}

Most people think that every problem has a solution. Maybe that's what inspired Duke Ellington to say that.\n\nWhat did Duke Ellington mean by saying that? Maybe he was going through a tough time in his life. I think he meant that through hard work, he became who he is today. For example, imagine a teenager who gets home from school and has a lot of homework. His mom tells him to do it right away, but he says no and doesn't do it. Later, he will fail his grade. Maybe Duke Ellington worked hard when he was a teenager and saw people who didn't work hard and didn't have good jobs.\n\nWhat inspired him to say that? I think it was his music that made him say that. He is a jazz legend, and his music is very relaxing and smooth. He didn't make it in just one try. He also makes mistakes like everyone else. But he never gives up, and that's what makes him great. Giving up gets you nowhere.

If we achieve them, we'll feel happy, but if we don't, we might feel bad. Some people think it's best to aim high and try, even if we don't succeed. But this isn't always true. It's better to set goals we can achieve and keep going. If we set high goals and fail, we might feel disappointed and sad.\n\nFirst, setting low goals is better because we can set new ones after we finish. This helps us achieve more things faster and feel better about ourselves. For example, if we take two years to achieve a big goal, we could achieve five or six smaller goals in that time. Setting low goals isn't always bad; it can help us achieve small tasks that make us feel good about ourselves and want to do better.\n\nAlso, failing at a goal we've worked on for years can have big consequences. For example, we might feel so disappointed that we stop trying. Let's say someone wants to get into a top college; they work hard, save money, and study, but they're not accepted. They might stop trying and end up with nothing. This happens because high goals are all or nothing; there's no middle ground. Some people think failing isn't always bad because we can learn from it, but this isn't true for everyone. Not everyone can accept losing, and aiming high isn't for everyone.\n\nIn conclusion, setting goals we can achieve and keep going is the best option. We can set new goals after we finish small ones. Setting high goals and failing might lead to disappointment and sadness. Setting low goals helps us achieve things faster and set new ones. On the other hand, setting high goals might make us waste years of effort, and that's not good. That's why setting low goals is the better option."}

It's not about hiding things from friends or family. Honesty helps you get good friends who will be honest with you. The truth might hurt, but they will always forgive you. They will appreciate your honesty.\n\nPeople lie to hide things or avoid hurting others' feelings. But it only makes things worse for everyone. If you lie and your friend finds out, they might not want to be friends with you anymore. People won't trust you, and they won't want to talk to you. If your friend lied to you about something important, how would you feel? That's why I think honesty is best. You're not hiding anything.\n\nBeing honest gets you good friends and success. Would you rather have a friend who always lies or one who always tells the truth? I'd choose the honest friend. Would you rather lie and struggle with money or be honest and live a comfortable life? Honesty brings success and good friends. What more could you want?\n\nIf the truth hurts someone, they will forgive you and still be your friend. But if you lie, they won't talk to you or want to be friends. They won't forgive you either. Honesty is like having a best friend or family.

{"text_id_kaggle": "74E67D57D50A", "output_essay": "Should schools control student involvement in extracurricular activities or should students and their families decide for themselves?\n\nI think students should decide if they want to join an extracurricular activity and plan how to fit it into their schedule.\n\nOne reason I think this is a good idea is that students can make their own schedule. This way, they can fit in schoolwork and homework, and then make time for the activity they choose. They can be more organized and independent without the school's help. For example, if you don't have homework on the days you have an activity, you can attend. If you have homework, you can plan to do it the night before, during school, or in the morning. This way, schoolwork won't interfere with activities, and you can stay caught up.\n\nAnother reason is that if schools make the schedule, it might not work for you. Sometimes a set schedule is helpful, but sometimes it's not. That's why students should make their own decisions about extracurricular activities. Students know how to manage their schoolwork, and they can make their own schedule.\n\nIn conclusion, I think students should make the decisions about extracurricular activities. Students know what schoolwork they need to complete and can set goals. They can also make time for activities after school. Parents can also help plan, so it's up to families to decide together how to plan everything stress-free. These are the reasons I support this idea."}

They teach me important things, and I can learn from them. If we learn from others, we can become great and kind people. We can also show others how to have good experiences.\n\nLearning from others is very important. It helps people who are sad or lonely. When we see good examples, it can change our lives.

Research shows that eating healthy food makes our brains work faster. If more students eat healthy meals, they will learn more, get better grades, and score higher on tests. This will make our school look good too.\n\nEating healthy food at school has many benefits. It helps students stay healthy, gives them the right amount of energy, and teaches them to live healthy lives. On the other hand, eating fast food every day is bad for our health. It affects our diet, wastes our money, and even changes our mood. These problems might not show up right away, but they will add up over time.\n\nI know some students might not like this idea because they're used to eating unhealthy food. But it's better for us to start eating healthy food now so we don't get sick when we're older. If we're healthy, our brains will work better, and school won't be as hard. Healthy food isn't even that expensive compared to fast food. If we eat healthy food at school, we can save money too. I want my school to be healthy and smart. Don't you want that?"}

The government might send officers to get kids who stay home from school. These kids might miss homework and assignments, which would hurt their education.\n\nHowever, students could attend classes online and do video conferencing. This would be a good option. They could tell their teachers which website to use, and then review and learn the topic. This would help their parents by not having issues with their kids staying home. It could also improve their grades by using learning websites and watching helpful videos.

Some students still don't know what they want to do even after high school. Parents also pressure their kids to choose a career they want.\n\nMy first point is that many students are still unsure about their career. They have trouble deciding because they haven't been exposed to many careers before high school. Some students don't want to pursue a career and just want to work as a cashier or store clerk. Others are pressured by their parents to choose a career they don't want. This is what happened to me. My parents wanted me to work in the medical field, so I felt I had to.\n\nMy next point is that parents pressure their kids to choose a career they want. From a young age, parents tell their kids what career to pursue. They want their kids to be successful and fulfill their own dreams. For example, my parents pressured me into a career I didn't want.\n\nSome people think students should know what career they want by the time they enter high school. They think students should already have an idea of what they want to do. High school will then guide them towards that career.\n\nIn conclusion, I don't think students should know what career they want before high school.

I've been going to public school my whole life, and I think it's not nice and not safe. You might wonder, what's the alternative?\n\nWell, that's where homeschooling comes in. Going to homeschool is good for you; you'll be safer, more focused, and more comfortable.\n\nMy first reason why homeschooling is good for you is that you'll be safer. Some people might say some public schools are safe, but most aren't. I remember when I was in elementary school, a kid would bully everyone every day; it was scary. Some kids would rather stay home than come to school, and the school didn't do anything about it.\n\nMy second reason why homeschooling is better for you is that you'll be more focused. Some people might say it's up to the student to focus, but that's not entirely true. Researchers at The University of Utah did an experiment. They tested students in public school and homeschool. They gave them a test on what they learned that week. The results showed that homeschool students did 99.94% better than public school students.\n\nMy final reason why homeschooling is better for you is that you'll be more comfortable. Some students might feel comfortable in public school and think it's like their second home. But most students are more comfortable at home, where they can do things they wouldn't do in school.\n\nIn short, homeschooling is good for you if you want a safe, focused, and comfortable education."}

Some people think it's always best to be honest. Others think it's okay to lie sometimes. I don't agree that honesty is always the best choice, because the truth can spoil fun, put us in danger, and hurt our reputation.\n\nFirst, telling the truth can ruin a surprise. Nobody likes it when someone spoils a surprise. Surprises can make people happy. If you tell someone about a surprise, it can ruin the fun. For example, if it's someone's birthday and they ask what you're doing later, telling them about a surprise party can make them less excited.\n\nAlso, lying can keep us safe. We don't want to give out private information to just anyone. If someone asks for personal information, telling a lie can protect us. For example, if someone asks for your address, telling a lie can keep you safe from danger.\n\nFinally, the truth can hurt our reputation. If we tell someone the truth, they might use it against us. Our friends might not want to talk to us anymore. Some people might not like us anymore. For example, if you have a secret crush on someone and someone mean asks you about it, telling the truth can make things worse.\n\nIn conclusion, I think it's okay to lie in certain situations. Lying can prevent ruining a surprise, keep us safe, and protect our reputation. I'm not saying we should lie all the time, but sometimes it's the best choice.

It looks at major events that changed the country. For example, one big event was the Great Depression. Students should know what happened back then, even though they weren't born yet. They should know what made America what it is today.\n\nThe Great Depression was a very hard time in America. Many banks went out of business, and people couldn't get their money. People were upset, many lost their homes, and the stock market went down. Many people didn't have jobs. When some banks failed, more banks closed. It was a tough time for people who didn't have enough money to pay rent, buy food, or pay for insurance.\n\nBefore we were born, many people didn't know about these big events that changed America. For example, people used to work in coal mines or make steel. There were three big industries competing to make money. They sent people to do dangerous jobs to help their industries grow. Many people bought things from these industries to improve and grow their factories. These things were expensive, which helped the industries grow.\n\nHistory is important to learn about. It talks about the changes that happened in the past, wars, stock markets, and when companies went out of business. For example, during World War II, America had to face many difficult things. Other countries, like Germany and Japan, fought against America, which led to D-Day. The worst part of the war was when America had to drop atomic bombs on Japan. America also tried to catch the enemy leader, but he killed himself when he heard that America's troops were close.\n\nIt's important for students to learn about history because they can learn about what happened before they were born. They might have questions about the past, and learning about history can answer them. This can also make them want to talk about history with others, like family, friends, or neighbors. If students don't learn about history, they might get confused and not know the truth about America's past. History can be interesting to learn about, and it can help students understand the people who lived through these big events and their lives.\n\nIn conclusion, I think it's important to teach students about history so they can learn about what happened in the past and understand America's history."}

They believe this will ensure students follow the same approach. However, I think students should design their own projects. This way, projects will be unique, contain different information, and show students' ability to work independently.\n\nWhen students design their own projects, they can express their individuality. They have different ideas and ways of doing things. Some students are more creative than others, and this will show in their work. By doing their own projects, students will demonstrate whether they are still learning, even when they're not in school.\n\nEach project will have different information because students think differently. They don't have the same thoughts or ideas. Some students like to write from their own experiences, while others prefer to research and gather information. This means some projects will have high-quality information, while others will be more basic.\n\nWhen students design their own projects, they prove they can work independently. It's not just about showing they can do the work; it's about showing they're responsible, organized, and knowledgeable about the topic. Teachers will know who to trust, and students will show how much effort they put into their projects. This can even lead to good grades.\n\nIn conclusion, some people still think teachers should design summer projects.

For example, cardio helps your blood flow and makes you healthier. Being active also helps you run, jump, and do other active things better. P.E. is important for athletes because it helps them get better at sports like basketball. They can improve their shooting, running, and playing defense and offense. P.E. is also important for people who are overweight because it can help them avoid bad health. It can even help older people recover from sickness easily. There's another part of P.E. called FLE that teaches how your body works. The good things about P.E. include being healthier, losing weight, and being more active. The only bad things are getting tired and having small injuries. To do well in P.E., you should go to the gym, run every day, try out sports, and eat healthy food. Things that won't help are playing video games all day, eating unhealthy food, and watching TV. In conclusion, P.E. is a good lesson because it can help you in the future if you're sick, and it can make you strong, active, and fit, and even help you live longer."}

Students and their families should choose which activities to join. If they do, they will have more time to be outdoors, learn new things, and make new friends.\n\nMy first reason is that students will have more time outdoors and learn new things. They should not stay inside all the time. When I was a freshman, I decided to join an extracurricular activity. I was always inside doing nothing, so I looked for something to do. I joined a program that helped me get into good colleges. I worked hard and got some good offers from different colleges. I was excited because I knew I would have a bright future. I showed the UCLA college application to my parents, and they were very happy to see me as a first-generation college student.\n\nMy second reason is that students will make new friends. We all need friends to grow together. When I went to the Boys and Girls Club, I didn't know anyone. But a girl named Sarah came up to me and said hello. Sarah was a sweet girl who liked to talk to many students, but she mostly talked to me. I also made friends with other students, like Alex. He asked me to play soccer with them, so I joined in. After the game, we hung out and went home. Ever since I met Sarah and Alex, everything changed for me. Even though we might not get any school work done, extracurricular activities are important.\n\nStudents should choose which extracurricular activities to join.

A curfew gives teenagers a sense of balance, like having a bedtime and a wake-up time for school. This balance helps them avoid breaking laws.\n\nAs a teenager, you need to be aware of your surroundings. With a curfew, you know when to go home on time. This helps you avoid bad situations that can happen when you're out late. You don't want to get into trouble when you're young and have your whole life ahead of you.\n\nA curfew also keeps you away from people who do bad things like stealing, shooting, and kidnapping. These people often commit crimes at night. By having a curfew, you can avoid getting into bad situations.\n\nIf you drive, you know the police can pull you over for speeding, expired license plates, or breaking the curfew. If you're home on time, you can avoid these problems. Getting pulled over for breaking the curfew can lead to trouble.\n\nHaving a curfew sets boundaries for teenagers who just want to have fun. It helps them avoid going to jail at a young age. As a teenager, you have many responsibilities, and committing crimes can ruin your record for life. If you want to get a job, a clean record is important.\n\nA curfew can help teenagers make better choices. It prevents them from doing reckless things at night.

You need a good plan to help you achieve your goals. Without a plan, you'll fail. It's like trying to study geometry at three years old without knowing anything. Imagine how you'll achieve your goal. It will help you a lot, as Albert Einstein said, 'Imagination is more important than knowledge.' You also need a good foundation to start with. You can't start something you don't know. It's like building a house without a base.\n\nIt doesn't matter what you want or dream about. What matters is taking action. You won't achieve your goals if you wait for opportunities to come to you. You have to go find them. It won't be easy, but you decide how hard you want to make it. You can try your best to achieve it, doing it slowly but surely.\n\nAnalyzing your goals is like doing homework. If you rush through it, you'll do a bad job and get a bad grade. But if you take your time, read, and get information, you'll do an excellent job.\n\nIn conclusion, I agree with Michelangelo: it doesn't matter how hard or easy something looks. The most important thing is to start slow, without pressure, and do it perfectly. You'll make mistakes, but you should learn from them and take experience from them. It doesn't matter how long it takes; do it slow, but always take action, because opportunities won't come to you."}

If you're not treating others well, I'll show you three ways to improve. But first, remember that these tips won't work right away. You need to keep trying.\n\nMy first tip is to show respect to others. This is important because when you're kind to others, they'll be kind to you too. Even if you don't like someone, saying something nice can make a big difference. You don't have to be friends, but being respectful is important.\n\nMy second tip is to think about what you say. Did it work out? What were you thinking when you said something nice? To do this, you need to plan, rethink, try, see the result, and restart. Let me explain what each step means.\n\nWhen you plan, you think about what might happen if you do something. You imagine the result. Next, you rethink and ask yourself if what you're about to do is a good idea. Then, you try it. After that, you see how it went. If it didn't work, you restart and try again.\n\nBefore I share my last tip, remember that if you're feeling sad or need help, talk to someone or call a hotline. Now, my final tip is to be yourself. Being yourself is important because it helps you express your feelings and feel better. Don't try to change who you are to fit in with others. People like it when you're just yourself. Being yourself can make you proud, no matter who you are or what you look like.\n\nThat's it! I hope these three tips, plus the five little steps, help you become a better person. Thanks for reading!"}

Asking for advice is important because it can inspire us, help us make better choices, and we can share it with others.\n\nWhen people get inspired, they can inspire others. Others might share their thoughts on what's the best decision. For example, some words can really help people connect with others' advice. Some people might share how their experience helped them become a better person. This can inspire others.\n\nSharing advice with people can help others around the world. Some people like getting advice from their friends. For example, Sarah asked her friend, Emily, how to become a better person. Emily said, \"Be respectful to everyone, and treat everyone equally.\" Sarah thought Emily spoke wisely. Later that day, Sarah shared Emily's advice on the internet.\n\nGetting advice from others can help us make good choices. Some people want to help the world by making good choices. For example, taking others' advice can help us do something good for the environment.\n\nPeople can share advice they got from others. For example, most people like to share good things with others.

It's only fair that students get to choose. Why make them do something they don't want to do? Many students don't try hard because they don't care. If they don't care about school, why make them join activities they won't take seriously? Students and families should decide because many students have jobs, need time for homework and studying, and should enjoy their school years as they want.\n\nStudents with jobs can't join extracurricular activities because they don't have the time. Most students need their jobs to save for college, a car, and to help their families. Making them join an activity would add too much stress. They already worry about college, a car, and helping their families. Adding activities would be unfair.\n\nMany students get bad grades because they can't do too many things at once. They lose track of time and have no time for homework and studying. Others get tired and procrastinate, which is not good.\n\nWe're only kids and teenagers once. We should enjoy these years as we want. We're not in school forever. If schools controlled our activities, it wouldn't be fun. What if they chose something we hate? We couldn't do anything about it.

You should not rush your dreams, but if you do and it doesn't work out, you must keep trying and never give up. Some people think they can achieve their goals without effort. However, everything in life requires hard work to achieve it, because nothing comes easily.\n\nBeing humble helps a lot because people like humble individuals. If you apply for a job, being humble can help you get it. Humility will also help you in the future with your education and achieving your goals.\n\nRushing to achieve your goals won't help you succeed. For me, life is about time and dedication. When you want to achieve something, it takes time and effort. Life is tough, but that doesn't mean you should give up. Many things in life must be earned.\n\nSome people think they can achieve their goals without trying. However, you must put in effort to earn it. No one will give you a job if you're not trying. Many teenagers think they know what life is about, but they don't. They think life will stay the same after school, but they're wrong.\n\nFor these reasons, I agree with Michelangelo's statement. Life is about how you act. If you're humble, your dreams can come true. But if you're arrogant, it's hard for your dreams to come true. Life is about achieving things, and no one achieves anything without hard work."}

Some people don't think this quote is the best way to describe how to achieve goals. They think there are better ways to say it. I agree with Michelangelo because his quote is very reasonable. It tells us about one of our biggest dangers, how high we should aim, and it makes us think.\n\nThe first reason I agree with Michelangelo is that his quote tells us about a big danger we face. It makes me think about how important it is to be humble when trying to achieve a goal. Humility is important because it makes us more likable and wanted in places like jobs, school, and church.\n\nThe second reason I agree with Michelangelo is that to achieve a goal, we need to try our best and make sacrifices. We should keep our struggles to ourselves because nobody should judge our work or our way of thinking. Some people cheat to achieve their goals, but they might succeed only to face problems later in life.\n\nThe third reason I agree with Michelangelo is that his quote makes us think. Life is about achieving goals and overcoming obstacles. We can win or lose, but we have a better chance of winning if we try our best. If we give up easily, we won't achieve much.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe we should always try our best, never give up, do our own work, and work for what we want. If we fail, we should keep trying because we learn from our mistakes. A little bit of success is always better than nothing."}

It's important to learn from others because it helps us understand how they feel about things. We can also learn by seeing how others act, develop skills, and show emotions. This way, people won't feel upset or depressed.\n\nFor example, if I had a difficult problem to solve, it would have been hard to do it alone. If someone judges you, don't be afraid. Stand up for yourself. If you're still being bullied, tell someone you trust. Don't tell someone who might not be a real friend.\n\nIn my opinion, there's no real friend like your parents.

Today, students are the most common victims. They are not only in danger on their way to school, but also, they are not safe at school. Some schools offer online classes as an option for students to attend classes from home. The best way for students to learn more and be safe is to take classes online. \n\nFirst, students will focus more on their classes. I knew a guy who took online classes. He said it was great because he could focus more, and classes were more smooth. Students can learn more and find out more about themselves without fear of being teased. They can also meet new people.\n\nSecond, parents will be more at ease knowing their children are safe at home instead of worrying about their safety. This is good for both students and parents. My aunt had a bad experience with her son. His school was shot, and seven students were hurt, three died. She was afraid to send him back to school, so she paid for online classes. She said it was expensive, but she wanted the best for her son. After three months, she saw how her son was doing better than before.

It's what every parent wants because the streets can be very dangerous at those times. If teenagers go out after midnight, it can be risky because of the kind of people who are out there. Parents would be happy if teenagers didn't go out during those hours. However, teenagers wouldn't like this idea because they think it would interfere with their lives and they wouldn't have privacy.

I go to Generic_School.\n\nToday, I want to tell you about middle school and how it's different from elementary school. I want to give you an idea of what middle school is like and some things you should know. In middle school, you don't have to walk in a straight line. You can walk anywhere in the hallways, but you have to be quick. You have six minutes to get to your next class, and you have about four classes a day. We have bells that tell us when it's time to go to class or when class is over. We get out of school an hour earlier than you do, but we have to wake up much earlier.\n\nWe have lockers to store our bags, books, and school supplies. Sometimes your locker gets stuck, or it's too far from your class, or you get distracted talking to friends and become late. Being late is not good because it affects your attendance. If you're late many times, you might get in trouble. The first two weeks, teachers are okay if you're late because you might get lost. Some teachers want you in class before the bell rings so they can start the lesson right away. We have buses after school on Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday, so you can stay after school to do homework, retake a test, or hang out with friends.\n\nOn your first day, you might be confused, but you'll get used to it. It gets easier as time goes on. Make the most of your time in elementary school because you'll miss it later. You should enjoy elementary school - it's easy, fun, and full of good memories. As you go on, it'll get harder, but you can do it! Make sure you do your work in class and try your best on tests.\n\nThanks for listening, and have a great year! If you have any questions, ask now."}

To make this happen, we would have to remove some of the students' favorite foods.

This makes it hard for students to focus in class because they have too much energy. It would also help keep students healthy. Some students want to stay in shape and eat healthy, but they can't because there aren't many good and healthy foods at my school. This means students might not eat for a whole school day.\n\nHaving a healthy school lunch menu is a great idea. It would keep students healthy. More students would eat at school because there wouldn't be unhealthy food. Students would be able to focus in class and pay attention. They wouldn't eat too much sugar or fat, so they would stay on task and not get distracted.\n\nSome people think the school shouldn't change the lunch menu because some students like the food. But we need to think about keeping our students healthy. Many students try to eat healthy, but they can't because they have to eat what's on the menu. This means students might not eat or eat because they're hungry and have no other choice. So, the school lunch menu should be changed to help our students' health and well-being.\n\nIn conclusion, the school should change the lunch menu to keep our students healthy.

If they break this law, there will be consequences. Some people think a curfew is good because parents would have more control over their kids. However, teenagers might feel they don't have enough freedom and become more rebellious.\n\nFirst, a curfew would mean teenagers don't have enough time to hang out with friends or play outside. For example, if they want to see a movie that starts at 9:30 on a weekday, they wouldn't be able to go because they would get out past curfew.\n\nOn the other hand, teenagers don't like being told what to do. They want to be free and try new things. They often ignore their parents. So, if they get a curfew, they might just ignore it too. They do this because they're not mature enough to understand that their parents want the best for them.\n\nSome teenagers don't like staying at home, so they stay out late. Maybe they have problems with their parents, or they just get bored at home. For example, if there's no TV at home, a teenager might get bored and leave to find something fun to do. Whatever the reason, they'll try to stay out late, even with a curfew.\n\nIn conclusion, if the city is thinking about a curfew, they need to consider that teenagers need time to hang out with friends, want to be free, and some don't like staying at home all day.

I was sad and didn't want to see him.

But I knew I had to have a good attitude, even when everything seemed to be going wrong. I told myself, 'If the world is against me, then I will be against the world.' After a few months, one of my close friends came back and apologized, and we became friends again. My ex talked to me again, and now we're friends. I met my new boyfriend in an after-school program.

This takes even more time.\n\nSecond, changing the lunch menu is a bad idea because it will cost more money. The school might want to buy expensive products from stores. Also, students who don't get free lunch might have to pay more. Keeping the same menu helps keep costs low and the food tasty.\n\nSome people think changing the menu is a good idea because the food will be healthier. But we need to think about the fact that they might stop serving our favorite foods. For example, Italian Thursday is a classic that everyone loves. My class also loves the ice cream they've been serving since 2017. Kids don't want a change in lunch menus because it might get rid of their favorite foods.\n\nI'm writing to the principal to keep the same lunch menu.

That's why the school should change the menu. I heard that 'good food, good life,' and we need that in our school.\n\nThe school needs to change the menu in many ways. One way is to stop serving unhealthy food like greasy hamburgers and pizza. These foods don't have good vitamins for our bodies. Instead, the school should serve healthy food like veggies, natural juices, and fruits like strawberries, apples, and oranges.\n\nI had a bad experience with the school food. I ate a pizza and felt sick afterwards. I couldn't pay attention in class because I felt so bad. That's why we need to make a change in our school.\n\nFor a healthy life, we need to eat good food. We spend many hours in school and eat breakfast and lunch here. Some students don't eat all day because they don't like the menu. They wait until school ends to eat something they like.\n\nWe can change the menu by adding more fruits and veggies.

When we fail, we face more obstacles that make it harder to succeed. Instead, we should work every day with the same passion we had on the first day and make the impossible possible.\n\nOne reason why failing over and over doesn't help is that it creates more problems to overcome.

For example, if my friend lost her enthusiasm after failing, she would never succeed because she wouldn't try to improve. Many people give up after failing, and that's why they fail again. You have to keep trying to achieve something, even if you fail. Trying again is a big part of being successful.\n\nMy second reason is that you can be better prepared the next time. For example, you can look at your old test and see what you did wrong, so you can do better next time. You can also study more if you didn't have enough time before. Being better prepared helps you understand the questions and see what you did wrong.\n\nSome people might disagree with Churchill's statement because they've tried it before and didn't succeed.

Some people think failure doesn't lead to success and makes them feel disappointed. However, as Churchill said, failure helps people learn from their mistakes and find new ways to succeed.\n\nOne reason failure helps people succeed is by teaching them from their mistakes. Sometimes, people fail because they can't do what they wanted or set goals that are too high. They might think mistakes can't be fixed, but that's not true. They should go back, think it through, and use those mistakes to their advantage. When people learn from their mistakes, they build self-confidence, make better decisions, and become successful. Mistakes also give people a chance to think and try again.\n\nAnother reason failure helps people succeed is by showing them new ways to succeed. For example, if a student fails a test, they can retake it, take summer courses, or stay after school. These are choices that can help them succeed.

I retook the test and got a \"B plus.\" I was proud of myself because I learned from my mistakes and improved my grade. Failure gives people a chance to feel better about themselves and realize there's always another way.\n\nIn short, failure plays a big role in achieving success. Without failure, people won't learn from their mistakes, which can lead to less determination and fewer opportunities.

People often don't think about how their actions will affect them in the long run. They don't consider how their habits and choices will impact their health. Health is crucial because we need to stay healthy and make good choices about what we eat and drink. We all make mistakes and learn from them. We can change many things in life. If we think positively, we can achieve our dreams.\n\nPeople have different personalities, and they often say positive or negative things about others. The knowledge we gain from our mistakes can be very valuable. It can help us reflect on our actions and do better in the future. It's also important to be open-minded and have a positive attitude. We should not be afraid to ask for help when we need it. Having a positive mindset can help us develop and grow in life.\n\nWhen we understand what's needed in the real world, we realize that it's not easy. We have to work hard and make tough choices. It's okay to make mistakes and learn from them. Having someone to help us, like a friend or parent, can make a big difference. They can help us reduce stress and depression. Our parents want the best for us and want us to stay on the right path. They want us to have faith in ourselves. In the real world, it's important to be simple and honest about who we are. We should think before we act, or we might make bad decisions. People often say that bigger is better, but we should not be afraid of failure."}

For example, people who work a lot, like me, can study from home instead of going to school in the morning.\n\nThe school also offers online videos and conferencing to help students. Videos can help us understand what's happening in the world and how to do assignments. I like conferencing because I can talk to real people and get clear explanations.\n\nStudying from home has many benefits. For instance, students who can't attend regular high school in the morning, like girls who need to take care of a baby or young men with full-time jobs, can still get a high school diploma. This is a great option for people who want a diploma but can't attend school during the normal schedule.\n\nIn conclusion, some schools offer distance learning to help students get their high school diploma.

It can affect their education and even lead to them getting hurt or killed. It can also make them tired for school the next day. Setting a curfew can help prevent these problems.\n\nTeens love to go out at night with friends or family. They go to parties or just hang out and talk. This wastes time they could use to study or finish schoolwork. They might stay up late to finish their work, which can make them tired and affect their concentration at school. Having a curfew can help them finish their work earlier and sleep earlier.\n\nThat's why teens should have a curfew to get enough sleep and finish their schoolwork.\n\nAt night, there are more dangers like gang members, rapists, and drug dealers. They come out because there are fewer people around, making it easier for them to commit crimes. Teens are often their targets because they're easier to attack. A curfew can lower the chance of teens getting hurt or killed.\n\nSome people might disagree and say that teens need to go out at night to relax and have fun. But if they do, they'll just get more stressed because they'll be avoiding their schoolwork. Having a curfew can help them finish their work, reducing their stress and helping them succeed.\n\nIn summary, a curfew helps teens in many ways. It reduces crime at night, helps teens get more rest, and improves their education by making them finish their schoolwork. If used wisely, a curfew can be very helpful."}

School teaches many valuable qualities like honesty, friendship, respect, and leadership. One of the most important things we learn in school is how to interact with others.

{"text_id_kaggle": "37344DDF73D9", "output_essay": "As teenagers grow up, they form opinions that affect their lives in many ways. There is a debate about whether teens should choose a career early on. Some students think they should decide right away, while others believe it's better to take their time. I don't agree with those who think teens should commit to a career immediately. In my opinion, it's better for students to take their time to figure out what they want to do after high school.\n\nMany students want to take their time to think about their careers, so they go to college to experience life outside of high school and learn to take care of responsibilities. For example, students will find out that life after high school is not easy and they need time in college to get used to having responsibilities and studying for their major. Some students attend community college to try out programs and get an Associate's degree, which helps them prepare for a higher education. Community college helps students figure out what to do and transfer to a university that fits them best. Many students are passionate about many things, so they need time to figure out which hobbies or interests suit them best for their careers.\n\nHigh school students are young and don't know much about life after high school. They like to try many things and want to do something they love. Students join clubs and teams to see what it's like and what it takes to achieve their goals. For example, if someone doesn't know what job they want, they can join a club that interests them and see if they want to continue. On the other hand, if someone wants to be an athlete, they can try out for a sport and see if they want to keep getting better. High school is about finding what to do in life and doing what's enjoyable. If students are forced to rush and think about their career choices quickly, it can cause a lot of stress.\n\nSome people say students should take their time to think about their career path because time is limited. Others argue that students should rush and come up with their ideas quickly to prepare for the future. However, it's important to consider that rushing can cause stress, which can lead to depression or other serious issues. Since time is limited, students should take advantage of it to have fun and focus on finishing classes and homework. Students will have time to think about their futures and what they will do in life. If students are rushed, it can cause them to have a mental breakdown or become depressed.\n\nIn conclusion, students want to take their time to figure out what to do by attending college. Nobody likes being rushed, and nobody likes doing something they don't enjoy. Students need time to think about careers since life is short. It's better for students to take their time instead of rushing when they're in high school."}

To do this, they need good drawing and writing skills. Sometimes, there's a contest to see who can create the best yearbook design. Students can also be a student council member for a day. This means helping out in the office, making sure everything is okay, and assisting teachers with reports and other tasks. This can make them feel helpful and even help them become a teacher one day.

Parents will know where their teenagers are, and many teenagers will be safe because night is a dangerous time.\n\nThe curfew will keep teenagers out of trouble because they won't be hanging out with friends at night. This means they won't be in car accidents. Many teenagers take drugs, so the curfew will give them better protection. One of my friends got in trouble because he was with gang members who committed a crime. He didn't do it, but he was there, so he got in trouble too.\n\nParents will know where their teenagers are because most teenagers don't tell their parents where they're going. This is a problem because if something bad happens, parents won't know, and they might get in trouble too. Even if parents don't let them go out, many teenagers sneak out, and parents are responsible if something happens.\n\nNight is a good time for criminals to commit crimes. We all know about Ted Bundy, a famous killer in the US. He did most of his crimes at night. Night is a dangerous time for everyone, not just teenagers. If we have a curfew, we can give them more protection, and there will be fewer crimes. We can't stop all crimes, but we can make it safer. If we protect our teenagers, they will focus on school and stay out of trouble. The curfew is a good way to prevent crimes.\n\nIn conclusion, a curfew is a good way to keep teenagers safe. I know teenagers won't like this law, but if parents agree, they will be giving their teenagers better protection.

What did he want to say? This phrase means different things to different people. To me, it means that a problem is a way to improve, learn from it, think about what to do, and find the best solution.\n\nFor example, let's say you had a problem with your parent about not cleaning the dishes. Your mom is very angry with you because you didn't do what she told you to do. There are many ways to solve this problem, but which one is the best? What will help the most? What will you do?\n\nFirst, let's look at the problem: you didn't do the dishes, and your mom got angry. The best solution is to talk to your mom, say sorry, and promise to do it next time.\n\nDo I agree with Duke Ellington's phrase?\n\nSome people will agree, and some will disagree. But I completely agree. Why? Because problems teach us to be better, show us what not to do, and help us keep moving forward. Every problem has a solution.\n\nAnother example is big companies like Amazon. How many problems did Amazon have? They had many, but they found ways to solve them.

I agree with part of the curfew because it can be dangerous for them to be out until midnight. If a teenager is outside at 12 P.M., it's not safe. Parents can set a rule that their kids can't be out at this time because something bad might happen. But 10 P.M. is not too late to be out with friends. My dad says I can't go out after 11 P.M. because it's too late and something bad might happen. But I think an 18-year-old can go out with friends because they're almost grown up and know what they're doing. However, parents need to know where they are and what they're doing because at 12 P.M., only bad things can happen. In my opinion, teenagers can be out at 10 P.M. because it's not too late, but they need to be home before 12 P.M.\n\nWe see many teenagers getting hurt in the news because they're doing bad things and their parents don't know. It's better if the curfew changes and says that 18-year-olds can't be taken in, but if they see a 17-year-old at midnight, they need to be taken in because it's not good for them to be alone on the streets. But teenagers can also have fun, just not until midnight, and with caution.\n\nI think the curfew can help if they see a teenager under 18 who doesn't have a family, house, or friends and is doing bad things on the streets. For me, 'help' means giving aid to people who really need it. If the curfew takes in teenagers, they should also take in people who are abandoned and need help more. The curfew can take teenagers on the streets at midnight and call their parents, and the parents can pick them up. But people who are abandoned are the ones who really need help. I think parents should be responsible for their kids, not the curfew, because the curfew should help teenagers who are abandoned and dream of having a family and love.\n\nTeenagers need love from people, especially their parents. But I don't agree with the curfew rule because it's like they're helping other teenagers who don't need help.

I think it's important to choose a career, but I don't think students should do it at a young age because they're often unsure, irresponsible, and should focus on college.\n\nHigh school students are often unsure about their career because they don't know what to do after graduation.

Students should prioritize their education and think carefully about their decisions.\n\nStudents should focus on their education instead of their career at a young age because education is key to success.

{"text_id_kaggle": "8EF1139A2B72", "output_essay": "Why is it important to tell the truth? Honesty can hurt people's feelings, but it's still the truth. Sometimes it's okay to tell a small lie, but not all the time. Honesty means not lying and telling the truth with confidence.\n\nWhen you lie to someone, you'll have to deal with the consequences. It's okay to tell a small lie once, but if you keep lying, it will lead to trouble. The person may not want to talk to you again, and worse things might happen. It depends on the lie you told.\n\nTelling the truth is also important. It can help you avoid many problems with people. Yes, people might get hurt, but the truth is the truth. If you make up a lie, they'll believe you, and then they'll find out if it's true or not. If it's not true, you'll face problems.\n\nYou should also be confident when talking to someone. If you're not, they might tell secrets about you and cause trouble. You'll face many problems if you're not careful. You should always be confident in what you say, because it's too late to change your mind later.\n\nSo, I think you should always tell the truth, even if it hurts someone's feelings. The truth will always be the truth. It's okay to tell a small lie once, but if you keep lying, you'll face the consequences. That's why I say, always tell the truth, no matter what."}
{"text_id_kaggle": "A9679CC0C18F", "output_essay": "A city council is discussing a 10 pm weekday curfew and a midnight weekend curfew for teenagers. If the curfew is adopted, teenagers on the street after those hours will be breaking the law. Do curfews keep teenagers out of trouble, or do they unfairly interfere in young people's lives?\n\nHaving these curfews is good for us teenagers because it keeps us away from dangerous drivers or people who may be drunk around those times. It's best for us to be home around those hours because that's when many kidnappings happen, and people are getting home from parties, which can lead to injury or even death. This is because they can get drunk. That's why, when kids are out late around these times, they can get in trouble with their parents or the law. Our parents get very worried because they know how dangerous it can be.\n\nMost of us teenagers can make mistakes and end up drinking and driving, not realizing how dangerous it is. So, it's best if all teenagers stay home around those hours because you never know what can happen to you in just a couple of hours of breaking the law. It can lead you into trouble, so that's why the law wants to be strict, because they and your parents want you to have fun but be safe. Not everyone can stay out that late and be safe during party hours.\n\nHowever, many teenagers break these laws and sometimes get away with getting in trouble or even driving while drunk. Some people get lucky because, when they are at parties, they stay long, and when they see the time, they want to rush home before the curfew, and that's how most teenagers get pulled over for speeding.\n\nThis is one of the most common ways to get pulled over around these times because cops are always looking for speeders. But many teenagers really like being out and having fun with their friends on the weekends, partying, and when they are in the moment, they never think about what could happen next because of how much fun they are having.\n\nIf all these teenagers were to listen to the law and do what they are told, many drinking and driving accidents would not happen. It's surprising how many drinking and driving accidents come from teenagers, and it can be avoided when these curfews come into effect. Once these laws come into effect, they can save many lives and keep many of us safe from being harmed by mistakes that can be easily avoided by how long you are outside. Many teenagers love having fun, but the problem comes when they want to have too much fun, to the point where they don't know when to stop, and that's when the problem occurs, and they don't know about the consequences.\n\nBased on this argument, I think this is beneficial for us teenagers because I think this council for curfews can save many teenagers' lives because of how dangerous it can be in those hours, and these curfews can help many people still have fun and be safe at the same time if they just follow the rules and listen to what they are being told."}

{"text_id_kaggle": "F8A1AC1C01D6", "output_essay": "Distance learning is a choice or an option for many schools. Some people think schools should offer distance learning so students can attend classes from home, while others think there are better ways. This is important because distance learning is a good option for students to attend classes from home. Distance learning is the best option for students because it gives them more time at home, keeps them safe, and makes them feel more comfortable.\n\nFirst, distance learning is good for students because it gives them more time at home. Students have many tasks to finish at home, so distance learning helps them have time for important things. For example, students with chores, part-time jobs, and personal projects need time for these things. If they can do classes at home online, it makes their lives easier and gives them more free time. They can finish their classwork and homework on time and then do other things at home, like mowing the grass or cleaning the house.\n\nAlso, distance learning keeps students safe at home. Many students are afraid of getting hurt or sick at school. If they catch a sickness from another student, it can spread easily. Distance learning prevents this by teaching classes online. This way, students and teachers don't get sick, and everyone stays safe. Some schools have used distance learning to prevent the spread of sickness during the coronavirus pandemic. This helps decrease the number of infections in school and prevents quarantines.\n\nHowever, not everyone agrees. Some think a different option would be better for students because it would make them more comfortable. But they forget that distance learning makes students comfortable at home. Many students feel more comfortable at home, where they can sleep and eat as they like. This makes them behave better at home and prevents interruptions in class. Students with anxiety or disabilities often feel better at home with a parent or guardian, which gives them comfort and care. For this reason, students would likely choose distance learning because it's more comfortable for them.\n\nIn conclusion, distance learning is a better option for attending classes at home. It gives students more time, keeps them safe, and makes them feel more comfortable. Distance learning is still a good way for schools to educate students online, and it can make students and teachers more educated. Attending classes at home is a good choice for anyone who wants to use distance learning for a better future."}

{"text_id_kaggle": "314E8BECDC81", "output_essay": "I believe that 'Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it.' I think this because not everyone likes what others want for them. When you choose your own character, you can be happy and decide what's best for yourself. I also think it's more enjoyable to make your own choices than to follow someone else's.\n\nThe first reason I think this is because if you don't like what someone else chooses for you, you won't do well. For example, my dad wanted me to play on a team two hours away from home. But I wanted to stay close to home and play with my friends. He took me to the other team, but I didn't like my new teammates, and they didn't like me. The coach changed my position, and I didn't get to show him what I could do. I told my dad I didn't want to play on that team, and he agreed. I went back to my old team, scored 18 goals, and won the championship. I was named the best forward on my team. This shows that choosing your own character can help you achieve great things.\n\nThe second reason is that when someone else decides for you, it might not be a good idea or you might not like their decision. For example, I went to a wedding and wanted to wear jeans and a dress shirt. But my mom wanted me to wear a suit and tie. I didn't like it, but she made me wear it. When we got to the wedding, I saw everyone else wearing dress shirts and black jeans. I was the only one in a suit, and I was embarrassed. Since then, I don't let my parents decide what I wear. Another example is when I let my friends decide what I should eat for dinner. They chose a spicy rice dish, but I didn't like spicy food. I couldn't eat it, and it was a waste of money. This is why I think you should make your own decisions because not everyone knows what you like or don't like.\n\nThe third reason is that when you choose your own character, you can do something you enjoy and find fun in it. For example, I like fixing cars. I challenge myself to finish the job quickly, and I time myself to stay focused. Another example is that you might have a job that pays well, but if you don't enjoy it, you might quit or be stressed every day. When I was little, my parents wanted me to go to church, but I didn't enjoy it. I think going to church was a waste of time for me.\n\nI think having the choice to make your own decisions can bring happiness to your life. Making your own choices without anyone else's input can help you find what's best for you. And doing something you enjoy can help you find what you really like and want to do.

When I was at my cousin's house, she pushed me into the pool. I almost died, and my mom saved me. That's when I became afraid of pools and oceans. So, I want to visit oceans, but I can't swim. When I go, I like to look at the view and maybe get in the water with someone who can swim nearby. I'm scared because the ocean is very deep, and the waves can push you into the deep areas. I've seen on the news that people die from shark attacks, and some lose arms and legs. That scares me. When I go to the beach, I look around for sharks and other animals like that."}

Teenagers should not be on the street at midnight; they should stay home. On weekends, they need to go out, but not at midnight because it's not safe. Bad things can happen at midnight, and it's against the law. For example, if teenagers go out at midnight, they might get in trouble for doing illegal things.

If you're honest, you don't have to lie. Honesty means telling the truth. For example, if a girl asks if she looks fat in a dress, and you think she does, you might not want to tell her to avoid hurting her feelings. But if you tell her she doesn't look good in it, you're telling the truth and being honest.\n\nSometimes honesty hurts people's feelings, but it's better to tell the truth than to lie. If someone finds out you lied, they won't trust you. When you're not honest, you're kind of lying. You're either not telling the truth, not saying what you think, or not telling how things really are. If you're always honest, people will trust you.\n\nIt's hard to tell the truth sometimes because we worry about what might happen. But we have to be brave and tell the truth. If we lie, something worse might happen later.\n\nMany people are dishonest because they're scared of what might happen. I think honesty is a good choice. You're telling the truth. Sometimes it's better to say what the other person wants to hear, especially if they're going through a tough time.

People like food like pizza, tacos, and quesadillas, so if they remove these from the menu, many students won't eat at school and will bring food from home instead. Think about it: you don't like vegetables, and they take your favorite food, like a hamburger, off the menu. You won't eat something you don't like, and if this happens, many students will leave the school and find another school with the food they like.\n\nSecond, the school can't make decisions on its own because we're all part of the same community and school. If they want to make a decision, they need to ask us and work with us to make a better decision. The best thing to do is to vote. We, the students, community, and town, can vote, and then whoever wins can decide about creating a healthier school lunch menu. This affects parents too, because some of them eat with their kids at school. They want to eat something that fills them up, like steak and cheese or Chinese food. We all like sodas, juices, and coffees, but they're unhealthy.\n\nThird, what can a school do without students? What can a town do without people? Everyone will leave, even teachers, because we all need balanced food. We need salads, pasta, and protein sometimes. All humans and animals need balanced food to stay healthy and not get sick. If a school does this, students and teachers won't be happy, and they'll quit their jobs or leave the school. Countries and schools are similar because they both have rules, and one rule is that people have the power to change things.\n\nIn conclusion, the school can't change the lunch menu without asking students, teachers, and parents. If they do, people will get mad and leave the town. If people leave, the economy will suffer, and it will affect the state. All parents and teachers want the best for their kids, and sending them to school is one of the best things for kids."}

I agree with Duke Ellington because you can learn from your mistakes, improve on not making those mistakes, and teach others so they don't make those mistakes.\n\nFirst, I agree with Duke Ellington because you can learn from your mistakes. One day, I was playing soccer and realized I was kicking the ball the wrong way. A professional soccer player showed me the right way to kick. At first, I still missed some shots, but with practice, I started scoring goals. Later, I saw the player again and thanked him for teaching me. Another time, I was playing baseball with my brother and made only one home run. A friend showed me how to hold the bat correctly, and I started making more home runs.\n\nSecond, I agree with Duke Ellington because you can improve on not making those mistakes. Some people think you shouldn't take problems as chances to do your best, but I disagree. In science class, I was struggling with a project, so a classmate helped me with research. After that, I did a better job on my next project. Another time, I was walking to the store and got into a car with strangers who were wearing masks. I quickly got out and realized I could have been kidnapped.

Some don't join because their parents don't let them stay after school.\n\nI think parents should let their kids join activities after school. It's a good way to meet new people and learn new things. You can learn by watching others and trying new things. Joining activities is also a good way to get to know teachers and students you don't usually talk to.\n\nSome students can play sports, while others can help out in school.

When employees get along, it's good for the company. They are more likely to be successful. On the other hand, if employees don't get along, it can affect the business. For example, it can be hard to make decisions or solve problems as a team. Even if you have experience, it can still affect how people work. I consider myself open-minded and listen to others.\n\nHiring new employees with no experience can benefit the company in different ways. Teaching them their job allows them to learn and bring new ideas. I like to share my ideas and opinions on projects and try to make the company better. It starts by listening to others and being open-minded. I'm a creative person who always thinks about how to improve. There's always room to learn more.\n\nStarting a new job in a field you're not familiar with can be scary. But you can make someone feel welcome. If I get the chance to work in a new field, I'll make sure new employees feel welcome. Making people feel important is crucial. I'll do this by having lunch with coworkers and making them feel valued. It's good to make everyone feel important and included because it makes them work harder.\n\nThese are some reasons why I think it's a good idea to hire new employees with no experience.

I believe our character is shaped by things beyond our control.\n\nFor example, people might think they can change who they are by trying hard and making an effort. But I think our character is shaped by things we can't control. The reason is that our character can change. For instance, my sister was very shy until she was in the 2nd grade. Her teacher thought she might have a problem, but she just needed to come out of her shell. When she switched from a Japanese school to an American school, we worried she wouldn't make friends. But she worked hard and started speaking up more. A few weeks later, she became more outgoing than before. Now, she's the most outgoing of all my siblings.\n\nEveryone has their own character made up of their traits. But we can also change ourselves by making an effort. For example, if there's something you don't like about yourself, you can try to change it. I used to be too nice and couldn't say no to my friends. I thought it was a good thing, but it meant I always did what others wanted.\n\nSo, I started saying no to things I didn't want to do and explained why. Slowly, my character changed. I became someone who could express my opinion without caring what others thought.\n\nThe last reason is that we can grow by changing ourselves. As I said before, we can change and create ourselves. When we do, we feel more grown-up, not just physically, but mentally. We develop new traits and think more like adults. For example, before I changed, I thought like a kid, but after I changed, I started thinking about what I wanted to do and wasn't scared of what others thought. Now, I can make my own decisions and have my own ideas. I feel more grown-up, and my way of thinking is more adult-like.\n\nIn conclusion, changing our character by making an effort makes us more grown-up. Changing ourselves, creating our own traits, and growing mentally make us more active and better people.

For example, if a friend pressures you to smoke or drink, and you do it, they are controlling your actions. This is where peer pressure comes in. When you let someone control you, you're not making your own decision.\n\nOur character and behavior reflect who we are. If others see that you don't know how to behave or don't have respect, that shows in your traits. The choices we make can change who we are.

I don't think students should be forced to do something they don't want to do. Students shouldn't be pressured into doing things they're not good at. If they're pressured, they won't do their best. They'll feel like they have to be perfect for everyone. But students should be encouraged to do these things. They just shouldn't be required to do them.\n\nIn P.E., athletic students take it very seriously. For example, if a class is playing basketball and someone misses a shot, everyone yells at them. The person who shot felt pressured to make the shot. Some students are not good at any sport, so it should be a choice to participate. Even if someone is great at art, they shouldn't be forced to join the yearbook if they don't want to. Some students don't want to join student council, sports, or the yearbook, so it should be a choice. Not everyone is brave enough to do these things. Student council is a big deal and should be a choice.\n\nStudent council can make students nervous because they help make decisions. They might feel really nervous. If they make the wrong decision, everyone might get mad at them. Being on student council is not bad, but it's a big deal. The student can feel a lot of pressure and stress. They have to be perfect, like everyone wants. Like I said, it's still the student's choice to join student council or not.\n\nEvery activity should be a choice. Not everyone is good at sports, the yearbook, or student council. No one should be forced to do something they don't want to do. Everyone has a choice. No one should be forced to do an activity."}

If a teacher designs the project, they can give you something that keeps you focused. For example, you might think about the project and learn how to do things correctly.\n\nSome people think students should design their own projects. They might just do the project because they have to, not because it will help them in the future. They might not care about the project and would rather play with their phones or watch TV. On the other hand, if teachers design the project, students might try harder if it looks interesting. They might learn new things about the topic.\n\nIn conclusion, if teachers give students the right project, they will spend more time making good choices instead of just playing. If students practice making projects about things they like, they can do great things. It's about taking care of their homework and making good decisions in life."}

Most students like the idea of taking classes from home, but it has some bad points.\n\nOne problem is questions. If you have a question that needs a detailed answer, you can't get it at home. For example, in math, you might need help with a problem. In English, you might need help with commas, periods, and capitalization. My teacher helps me with these things.\n\nAnother problem is time. Some subjects need a lot of time to understand. Online classes don't give you enough time. For example, World History is hard for me. I need my teacher to explain it slowly and clearly.\n\nHomework is also important. Some people think it's not necessary, but I think it is. My Algebra teacher gives me homework to practice what we learned in class. This helps me remember what to do on the test.\n\nSome students think online classes are great because they don't have to wake up early, do homework, or spend a lot of time in class. But I think they're wrong.\n\nI think going to school is better because I can talk to my teacher directly, share ideas with my friends, get more information about a topic, and tell my teacher what I understand and what I don't.\n\nIn the future, schools will have better technology, and students will want to take classes in a classroom to use modern machines and learn easily."}

You can get good at baseball too if you practice a lot and eat healthy food. If you're really good, you can even make a living from it. But it's not just about being good; you also need to respect your coaches, parents, and teammates.\n\nBaseball is not just a competitive sport; you can also play it for fun. It's a spring sport, so you get to be outside and run around. If you make a mistake, your teammates will cheer you up. Baseball teaches you to work with others and be a team player. There are different positions to play, and you play them based on your skill level.\n\nThe positions in baseball are catcher, pitcher, first base, second base, shortstop, third base, left field, right field, and center field. In baseball, you can't hesitate because the ball is thrown fast, so you need to run straight to the base without looking. Coaches at the bases will also tell you what to do. If you hit the ball over the fence, that's a home run, and you get to run around the bases. You can teach others about baseball, and they might want to join in.\n\nIf you want to play baseball, you need to keep your grades up and attend practices. You'll also have games and need to travel to other places. There are usually two teams that practice against each other. You'll get a uniform for your team, and a company will usually sponsor it.\n\nYour coach will give you a schedule for the games and practice times. You'll also get a workout sheet to fill out by the end of the year. Playing baseball is amazing, especially with friends. Baseball is usually for boys, but girls can play softball. That's all I have to say, and I hope you'll sign up for this sport."}

I remember one day I was feeling really down, and I didn't want to do anything. But when I started playing video games, it changed my mood. When I get home, I do my homework first, and then I play video games. Video games are not just fun; they can also teach you something new. For instance, in a game like Fortnite, you have to do math to figure out how many people are left in the game. I play video games for about two hours, and that helps me learn and get better. It's a skill because you don't give up, and that makes you a better person. Video games can help with math because many games involve numbers and problem-solving. If we didn't play video games, we might not be as smart as we are today. Of course, we learned a lot in school, but video games can still help. Video games can even distract you from feeling hungry, but don't forget to eat! It's not a talent, but it's a skill to never give up on what you love. If you give up in school, how will you take care of yourself when you're older? Your parents won't be able to take care of you forever. Thanks for reading my essay! I hope you liked it!"}

Many people face this problem, but they always try to be nice to others, even when they're struggling. They don't take out their frustrations on others.

He had lost his job, his wife, and his home. But despite all this, he still smiled and was kind to me, a stranger. I got to know him better and learned about his struggles. Even though he was down on his luck, he always tried to be friendly to new people he met. Just because someone is having a bad time doesn't mean they can't be kind to others.\n\nBad times can lead to good times, but not everyone gets that chance. They might think they'll never find happiness. But if we all show them kindness, they'll feel happy and good about themselves. They'll forget their troubles. When we show someone kindness, they'll do the same to others, and it can spread to many people.\n\nHaving a good attitude is important because it makes others think we're nice people. It also shows we care about others and want them to be happy. Finally, when we're kind to others, they'll respect us no matter what. There are many benefits to having a good attitude, but I'll just mention three. One example is when someone is having a bad day, we can show them kindness because we've all been there too. We want them to be happy and have a better future. Many people struggle, but when someone shows us kindness, we do the same to others."}

{"text_id_kaggle": "5C9EADFD09C9", "output_essay": "Imagine your school changed the cafeteria food. I wouldn't agree with that because school food is different from what parents give. One big reason is that students are used to the food they have now, and they like it. They wouldn't like a change and might even protest. A few students can make a big difference.\n\nMany parents don't give their kids the same food the school serves. Sometimes, kids prefer school food because it's their favorite, and their parents don't give it to them. Parents don't always give kids what they want, and kids might get upset. School food also has snacks and treats that kids like, even if they have to pay for them.\n\nChanging the cafeteria food would be hard for students because they're used to what they have now. Once kids get used to something, it's hard to change it. Most kids aren't very healthy, so this change would be tough for them. Some kids might not mind, but for others, it would be a big deal.\n\nIf one student gets upset about the change, others might think it's okay to do the same. This could lead to a big protest, and many kids would join in. When kids feel powerful, they might take advantage of it and want their old menu back. That's why the change shouldn't happen.\n\nIn conclusion, changing the cafeteria food might seem like a small thing, but it's a big deal for students. Adults don't always see things from a student's point of view, but students wouldn't want to adapt to a new menu. Changing the cafeteria food wouldn't be a good idea, considering how students would react."}

However, expecting them to make this choice at a young age can be stressful and affect other areas of their lives. It's a good idea for students to have a career goal early on, but they should also have time to explore different options.\n\nFirst, choosing a career early can help students stay focused and avoid wasting time. Some students may not be ready to decide on a career, but they should keep learning and finding what interests them. Others may not be motivated to learn, but they should still try to find a career path that suits them.\n\nIn addition, students should have time to try out different jobs and see what they like. They need to be confident in their choice, as it will affect their future. Many students are pressured by their parents or choose a job randomly, without thinking about what they really want.\n\nLastly, students need to have some idea of what they want to do in the future before it's too late. The purpose of school is to learn and discover what they want to be. Choosing the wrong career can lead to regrets and waste the money spent on their education.\n\nIn conclusion, it's a good idea for students to have a career goal early on.

They just want to eat what they like, not what's good for them. But I think that's not true. Many students, like athletes and cheerleaders, want to eat healthy to take care of their bodies.\n\nEating healthy also helps students with their weight and development. Doctors recommend eating a lot of fruits and vegetables because they provide important vitamins.

I think my skill is martial arts because I learn, practice, and have fun with it.\n\nFirst, I learned martial arts at a place called 'Generic City.' I watched my teachers closely to learn how to punch and kick. When I struggled, they helped me get my arms and legs in the right position. Once I got better, I learned combos and self-defense. They taught us how strong and fast we should do them.\n\nAfter I got good at combos and self-defense, I took a test and did well. Then I got my blue belt. I learned more advanced combos and some judo. But I had to quit because it cost too much money. Since then, I've learned more martial arts at home by watching YouTube and WikiHow.\n\nNext, I practiced at home to get better. After school, I would do punches for 20 minutes, kicks for 10 minutes, and self-defense for 10 minutes. Before I practiced, I worked on my arms and chest to get in shape. I did punches and kicks slowly so I wouldn't trip. Sometimes I practiced with my eyes closed in case I had to fight more than one person. I've been doing this for a year and a half.\n\nSome days, I skipped because I was tired from gym class or just lazy. But even when I'm lazy, I still practice so I don't forget my skills. Right now, I still practice to keep my skill.\n\nI also use my skill for fun when I'm bored. When I have nothing to do, I do martial arts in my bedroom or living room. Before I start, I put away things like my phone to get some space. I put on music to help me focus and feel great. Sometimes I watch TV and imitate characters fighting each other.\n\nIn movies, I see moves I haven't learned yet. When I see new moves, I watch and then imitate them slowly so I can do them right later. I do all of this alone so I don't get attention. This is what I do for fun.\n\nI still do this at home, and nobody bothers me.\n\nIn conclusion, I think my skill is martial arts because I learn, practice, and have fun with it. I developed my skill by learning and practicing. I use it for fun when I'm bored. I think you should find your own skill. You should have a skill because it's not good to be good at nothing.

He told me things like, \"Don't do this because it can lead to trouble,\" and, \"Listen to what people say.\" What others tell you is important because if you make a mistake, you can remember their advice and avoid their mistakes.\n\nOne reason I think it's important to learn from others is that if you make a mistake, you can go back and remember what they told you. When my cousin warned me about something, I knew I shouldn't do it. He wanted me to be safe. I've noticed that my family cares about me and doesn't want me to get into trouble.\n\nAnother reason I think it's important to learn from others is that you can avoid their mistakes.

Also, they might give it to their friends or tell them to try it, and their friends might get addicted too.\n\nMy second lesson is to stay out of trouble. If you get in trouble, you'll have to meet with your parents and teachers. You might even get lunch detention and can't hang out with your friends. Another reason to stay out of trouble is that you might have to go to a special room called BIP if you do something bad.\n\nThird, don't do silly things that can get you in trouble, like running in the hallways, play fighting, or talking back to teachers.

They want me to be successful, and it will make me feel proud of myself too. My family is very important to me, so having them feel proud of my achievement will be the best reward.\n\nHaving an advanced high school diploma can open up many opportunities for my future, like getting into a good college and finding a good job. To become a medical scientist, I need to attend a good college to learn what I need to know. A good college will provide a better learning environment, which is important for studying. It can also help me find better job opportunities. I think having an advanced diploma will have many advantages when it comes to finding colleges and jobs.\n\nBy graduating from high school, I'll be one step closer to my final goal.

{"text_id_kaggle": "109CBA5203BB", "output_essay": "One thing I want to do when I grow up is build schools in Sudan. In my home country, Sudan, there has been a lot of conflict with the government and President Omar al-Bashir. This has caused many problems for children. They can't eat, go to school, or feel safe. Schools help students learn and get a good job after graduation. They can even go to university and have a good life. I want to build schools in areas where many people are poor.\n\nThe conflict in Sudan has been very bad. It started in 2018 and has continued to this day. President Omar al-Bashir is the main cause of the problem. In 2018, people started protesting against him. Teachers and students didn't go to school. The president's army used tear gas and shot at protesters, mostly children and young adults. They even kidnapped leaders and protesters. This caused prices to rise, making it hard for people to buy food and other things. Children were too scared to go out and play, pray, or go to school. If I build a school, it will be like the ones in America. It will have security, cameras, good education, free meals, and internet. Students will want to come to a safe school and get the food they need.\n\nSchool should be a place where kids can learn, have fun, and feel comfortable. In Sudan, schools are not like that. They only focus on learning and reading without making mistakes. I want my school to be different. I want kids to learn in a fun way. They can memorize their Quran in a fun way, like singing a song. They can learn math by doing activities and getting rewards. I want to help kids so they don't have to worry too much. I want them to graduate and have a chance to go to university. I want them to get a job and have a good life. At my school, they can do activities after school, like playing sports or making a club.\n\nI want to build schools in areas where people are suffering the most, like Al-Obied, Khartoum, Bahri, and Port Sudan. These areas had many riots, and the kids there need extra help. They mean a lot to me because I'm from Sudan. If I didn't get to come to America, I would be in their situation. Seeing kids suffer because of one person makes me want to help. I want the kids in those areas to learn, graduate, get a job, and feel safe. Building this school is important for the children. It will help them and keep them safe.\n\nIn short, I want to help Sudan by building schools with security, cameras, free meals, and internet. These schools will keep kids safe and occupied so they can learn and get a good job. With fun activities, kids will enjoy school. Sudan needs to take care of its children because they are the future. This is very important to me because I want my country to thrive, and I want the children to succeed. These schools can change Sudan for the better. I can make a difference."}

They have to join a club they didn't choose, and it might take up a lot of their time. This can leave them with less time to do their homework, and they might have to stay up late to finish it.\n\nAnother reason is that students might get very tired, which can affect them negatively.

Time is very important for a student. Sometimes, not getting homework done can be very stressful. But if the school helps the student manage their time, it gets better. That's why I think schools should control student involvement in extracurricular activities. This way, students can complete their school work without excuses. The school will make sure the student gets involved in activities without a doubt. Students will learn how to use their time wisely with the school's help.\n\nThe school will make sure the student has enough time to complete their homework, assignments, and essays. Although, the student is responsible for doing it. I think if the student feels the school is helping them, they'll feel responsible to do what the school wants. This will help the student get better grades and have a better chance to get a scholarship, especially if they're almost ready to graduate. Good grades make the student's GPA go up, and that can take them to a nice college. But the student has to work hard for it. The school will try to help the student, but the student has to do the most.\n\nThe school will make sure the student gets involved in an activity without a doubt. The school will help the student make the right decision. If the student makes the right decision, they can choose to have many activities and less time or pick one activity and have equal time for school work. If the decision doesn't work, the school will guide them to make the right decision. That's why the school has to control the student's activities because the student or their families don't have the knowledge to help them in an educational way. The school will try to give the student the activities they want, but it depends on the student.\n\nThe student will learn how to use their time wisely with the school's help. The school will play a major role in controlling the student's activities and helping them manage their time. The student will learn how to use their time by having an educational experience and being responsible for school work. This will help the student in their future career or adult life. I understand some students prefer to control their activities, and that's okay. But at a young age, it's difficult to manage time correctly. Some students may say it's not fair if the school controls their activities, but it's the best option for the student to have a good reputation in school and out of school. I know some students may have different opinions, but I have my own.\n\nI think schools should control student involvement in extracurricular activities because it's the best option for students. Students will be able to complete their work, have an educational experience, and learn how to manage their time. They'll have time to do everything, and their grades will be higher due to time management. All these reasons are why I think schools should control extracurricular activities.

You don't have to ride the bus or walk, and it's easier to study at home. There are some benefits to going to school classes and studying at home. You can use video conferencing without attending school, use the internet to study, and benefit from homework and projects. However, you can cheat on tests using online resources, which may hinder your learning.\n\nOn the other hand, some schools offer good online resources that make studying at home a better option. You can join video conferencing to complete homework and share information about assignments. You can use internet resources to complete your work, projects, and assignments. It's easy to find answers, but you can also cheat on assignments and share resources with others. Instead of using the internet, you can ask people for help and information.\n\nYou can also do video conferencing with your teachers and staff. They can explain what you need to do to complete your homework and schedule project assignments. If you attend classes from home, you might lie about exams and may not pass the class or even the entire school year. If you cheat or lie on exams, you might need remediation classes instead of online classes.\n\nYou can do video conferencing with classmates and present projects without attending school. Some students don't like attending school, saying it's boring, and they never do homework or attend classes. They use excuses to avoid attending classes, resulting in many absences throughout the year, which can worry them about passing the school year. School staff can assign homework to students using email addresses and schedule when they need to complete class homework.\n\nFinally, students need to agree to use trustworthy resources and never cheat on their tests, projects, or with their partners. Studying at home is a good option; you don't need to come to school, and the assistance will be a better solution.

They might not have the skills or resources to pursue a career, so they focus on finding a job to support themselves or their families. Some people even drop out of school because they can't afford it.\n\nSecond, all young people have the chance to study anywhere.

He had many health problems, like breathing issues. Foods high in oil gave him stomach problems, such as diarrhea and stomachaches. My mom was worried and talked to the school principal, but the principal didn't do anything because they thought the unhealthy food was at home, not at school. My mom decided to move my brother to another school and took him to see a doctor.\n\nIn my country, schools don't care much about the food they serve because they just want to make money. They don't care if it's healthy or not.\n\nSome people think it's okay not to change the school menu because some students like the food. But I think it's better to change the menu because some foods have too much oil or calories, and students can get sick or have stomach problems.\n\nSome people who don't want to change the menu say that not all students like to eat salad or veggies. They like pizza, chicken, French fries, or hamburgers instead.\n\nBut I think changing the menu is a better idea because some foods have too many calories. For example, pizza, hamburgers, and French fries have over 300 calories. When people cook these foods, they sometimes use old oil.\n\nChanging the menu is also better because eating too much unhealthy food can make students sick or overweight. It can cause problems like diarrhea, stomachaches, or heart and breathing issues.\n\nIn conclusion, many school foods are not healthy, and over 100 students can get sick or become overweight. Students eat over 300 calories in one day. Imagine how many calories they eat in a week or month! Many students don't like to exercise, and they eat more than they need, which can be a big problem in the future.

{"text_id_kaggle": "9.92E+12", "output_essay": "Have you ever thought about asking different people for advice? Asking for advice is a great thing to do and is very helpful. When you ask different people, you get many opinions. This helps you make a better decision, see the good and bad points of one person's advice, and feel more confident.\n\nAsking more than one person for advice helps you make a wise choice. About half of the people make the right choice. My father once told me a story about asking for help. He asked many people for advice and it helped him make the right decision. The lesson is that asking many people for help leads to making the right choice.\n\nGetting many opinions from different people helps you see the good and bad points of one person's advice. By comparing one person's advice with others, you see the good and bad points. Seeing the good and bad points helps you avoid making a mistake. Many people make mistakes, but some people ask for advice and avoid mistakes. My mom is one of those people who asked for advice and avoided a mistake. She used to ask only her friend for advice, but then she talked to her teacher and got a different opinion. Her teacher told her that her friend's advice was wrong. My mom realized she should have asked more people for advice. It's a good idea to see the good and bad points of one person's advice, and I recommend it.\n\nLastly, having many opinions on a topic makes people feel confident. When you're confident, you don't regret your decisions. Confidence comes from working hard and asking for advice. About 65% of confidence comes from asking for help. When you're confident, you don't doubt yourself.\n\nThere's a big difference between asking one person for advice and asking many people. Asking many people for advice is very helpful because it helps you make the right choice, see the good and bad points of one person's advice, and feel confident.

For the next summer, my counselor talked to my new English teacher and told her that I needed to read a lot in English. My counselor also told my English teacher to give me books to read during the summer, and she did. That really helped me improve my English skills, and I didn't forget anything.\n\nSome people think that teachers shouldn't design summer projects because students won't have time to learn what they want.

I both agree and disagree with this quote.\n\nOne thing I disagree with is that having a problem doesn't always mean you can fix it. For example, if your family is going through a tough time, you can't just try your best and fix it. Sometimes people want to solve their own problems and don't want help. It's good to be positive and try to help, but you can't force it.\n\nAnother thing I disagree with is that you don't just have one chance to do your best. You have many chances to do your best in life, like on a test, in sports, or at school. You don't need a problem to prove you can do your best. You can try your best every day, like helping your mom or dad at home.\n\nThe third thing I disagree with is that this quote can make people feel bad about themselves. If someone thinks they didn't do their best, they might feel worse about themselves. Maybe Duke Ellington had a good life, but not everyone does.\n\nIn all, I don't completely agree with this quote.

If you learn about a career early, you'll have many options in the future and know what to expect.\n\nMy second reason is that it's not a good idea to wait until the last year of high school to decide on a career. If you start thinking about a career early, you can try it out and see if you like it. You can even change your mind if you don't like it. For example, if you want to be a doctor, you can take classes in high school to see if you like it. Students should think about a career by the time they enter high school so they can make a plan.

In this essay, I'll argue that setting a high goal and falling short is still better than not trying at all. I'll use examples of getting good grades and getting a college scholarship to make my point.\n\nFirst, let's say you want to get all A's in your classes for a semester. You take challenging classes and work hard. You do your homework, study for tests, and get good grades. But you don't do well on two projects and end up with two B's instead of all A's. You still have great grades, with five A's and two B's, and a 3.8 GPA. You even make the AB honor roll at your school.\n\nAnother example is wanting to get a football scholarship to Louisiana State University. You work hard to get ready to play at your best. You eat well, exercise every day, and go to camps to meet the coaches. You become the best player in your area, but you still don't get the offer from LSU. You might feel like you're not good enough to play at the next level. But then your second-choice school, Clemson University, offers you a full scholarship to play for them.\n\nSome people might say that if you set your goals low and achieve them, you'll feel good about yourself. But what if famous athletes like Michael Jordan, Tom Brady, and LeBron James had thought that way? They wouldn't have achieved what they did. They kept setting new goals and working hard to achieve them. Tom Brady, for example, was asked how he keeps playing football at 42 years old. He said it's because he still has goals to achieve. He has six Super Bowl rings, over 7,000 completions, and is second in most touchdowns thrown. But he still doesn't feel like he's done.\n\nIn conclusion, setting a high goal and falling short has its advantages. You might not achieve perfection, but you'll still be at a high level because you worked hard to get there. So, take this away from my essay: set a high goal and work hard to achieve it. We need more people with that attitude."}

They focus more on the topic and want to learn about it. For example, when students have to write freely, they often don't know where to start. But when they're given a topic, they start writing right away. They want to keep writing because they're interested in it. They put effort into their projects because they have more time during the summer.\n\nIn conclusion, summer projects should be designed by teachers, not students. When teachers design projects, students have many advantages. They learn interesting things and are more flexible with a topic given by their teacher. Therefore, schools should always give teacher-designed projects to students during their breaks. Students will be better prepared for their classes next year."}
{"text_id_kaggle": "838852A4CD54", "output_essay": "Winston Churchill, a former British Prime Minister, once said that success comes from going from failure to failure without losing enthusiasm. I agree with Churchill's statement about the importance of failure in achieving success.\n\nI agree with Churchill because it's true that you can't succeed without failing. You won't always be right, and that's okay. Churchill means that to succeed, you will fail many times, but you shouldn't give up. \n\nFor example, if you want to be an FBI agent, you will fail many times before you succeed. This is because you need to learn and understand many things before you can do the job well. It's normal to fail, and it's important to keep trying.\n\nSome people think they always need to be right, but that's not true. Everyone makes mistakes and fails sometimes. It's okay to be wrong and fail because it doesn't mean you've failed in life. You can always try again and keep working towards success.\n\nI also agree with Churchill because he likely failed many times in his life. He knows what he's talking about, and he has good reasons for saying what he did. Failure is a big part of becoming successful because you won't always be right. You need to try your best to succeed. That's why I agree with Churchill."}

Talking to people with different views can help you think more clearly and get good ideas.\n\nGetting advice from others can have good and bad effects. The good effect is that you can learn something new from them. The bad effect is that someone might give you bad information, which can cause problems. If someone gives you bad advice and you feel it's wrong, trust your instincts. Advice can help in many ways.\n\nOne good thing about asking for advice is that you can learn new things and even make friends. For example, if you ask someone how to change a car tire and they teach you, you'll learn something useful. If you keep talking to that person and find you have a lot in common, you might become friends.\n\nIn conclusion, asking for advice can help you learn more about life and how to succeed."}

But we can learn from our mistakes. We're not perfect, and we'll have ups and downs. If someone fails or succeeds, it's not a reason to give up. We should keep fighting for what we want.

They can learn at their own pace, it's peaceful, and they have all the time they need. Watching videos at home or online helps them focus on one thing at a time. Some students need to be homeschooled because they're slow learners or don't understand well, so they need to take their time on one lesson. Others want to attend classes from home because they don't feel confident at public school or want to do what they want.\n\nStudents can take their time to attend classes from home because they can stop the lesson and try to understand every part they don't know. It's good to take their time because most people need help to understand the lesson. The teacher won't pressure them to know everything, so they won't be as stressed. The student's biggest problem is staying on target because they're having a hard time understanding it.\n\nAttending classes from home is peaceful because students won't be distracted by other students. They can focus on one lesson and understand more information. It helps them stay on task and finish assignments quickly. Students have all the time they need to finish assignments at home because they're online or through video conferencing. They'll feel relaxed doing classes from home.\n\nSome students prefer public school because they don't want to be lonely and want to communicate with others. It's the main reason they go to public school and need help to understand the lesson. It depends on the student; they can choose to go to public school or attend classes from home. It's not a big deal to go to either one; it depends on the student who will focus more.\n\nThis is why I prefer attending classes from home: to focus more, not get distracted, and have more time. Some people think it's not good to attend classes from home because they think public school is the best way to make friends and have more perspectives. But it's not a big deal going to public school; having friends is not the most important thing. Attending classes from home helps students be ready for anything they learn."}

He meant that failure leads to success, and it's okay to fail. He was right; failure plays a big role in achieving success.\n\nWhen people fail, they should get back up and try again. Successful people do this. They don't give up. Benjamin Franklin didn't give up after his fourth failed attempt. He tried again, and now we have electricity. Many famous people tried and failed, but they got back up and tried again. This led to many amazing things we have today, like cell phones, cars, laptops, and safe houses.\n\nIt takes a few tries to find what you're good at. Failure doesn't mean trying the same thing many times and then giving up. It can also mean trying new things to find what you're good at. For example, if you want to be a doctor but it's too hard, you might become a nurse instead. You need to try something and fail to find what you're actually good at.\n\nYou need to practice to be good or the best at something. To be the best, you need to practice and make sure you're getting better. For instance, I like to sew, but at first, it was hard. I kept making mistakes and couldn't do advanced skills. But I kept trying, and now I can sew anything. I'm even starting my own clothing brand.\n\nSome people don't try to follow their dreams because they're scared to fail. When they fail, they don't get back up and try again. They take the easy way out. Those people will never know what would have happened if they had kept trying. Winston Churchill was right; we need to fail to succeed and find what we're best at."}

It's important to learn from others because their experiences can help us avoid mistakes, make good decisions, and gain an advantage.\n\nWhen someone shares their mistakes, we can learn what not to do. For example, when I was learning to ride a bike, my dad told me about the time he fell off because he let go of the handlebars. After hearing that, I made sure to hold on tight and didn't fall. My dad's story helped me avoid a mistake.\n\nPeople's experiences can also help us make decisions. They can share stories about the choices we have to make, which can help us decide what's best for us. For instance, I had to choose between two summer camps, and my dad had worked at both. He told me about the activities and atmosphere at each camp, which helped me pick the right one.\n\nSomeone's experiences can also give us an edge. They can share tips and advice that can help us succeed. When I had a babysitting interview, my dad gave me tips on how to impress the family and connect with their kids.

But most students can understand their online classes because they often struggle with their homework too. To take classes from home, students need to have the right mindset.

Honestly, being able to take classes online is a great opportunity for students who want to do great things in the future.\n\nSome students prefer taking classes online because it helps them learn peacefully. When you have good education, you'll have good benefits in the future. Online classes are better for some students who want to learn a lot.

We learn new things every day, not just in school. As we grow up, we become more mature and learn more than we did yesterday. Education is a lifelong process. If we want a good career, we need a good education.\n\nExpecting students to choose their career at a young age can be stressful. We cannot rush through our studies because it can cause negative effects and be really stressful. Our brains do not fully mature until we are 23-25 years old. Being mature is also part of our education. As we learn new things, we become more mature every day. Most importantly, we need an associate's degree to get a job and make money.\n\nWe cannot change our past, but we can make a better future. Everyone wants a better career to make more money. But we need a good education and should not rush through our studies. At a young age, making decisions is not easy because we are not mature enough. However, no one is perfect. Some students may have problems choosing a career due to physical limitations. Schools should encourage students to try new things and be creative.\n\nIn school, we learn different things every day. Students often change their career choices before high school because they do not know what it takes to make a good career. High school is important for our future, and I think students should take challenging classes and pass their exams to graduate. Colleges and universities come after high school, so we need to graduate first. Students can choose their career in high school because they will know more about their options.\n\nGoing to high school makes life easier; we learn what we need for our future. We make mistakes to learn how to fix them. High school prepares us for college or university. We learn to write essays to fix our mistakes, and this skill is useful in college or university. However, students may not choose their specific career in high school because they will learn more and may change their minds. There are many opportunities for students before and after high school. We should take advantage of them because not everyone has the opportunity to get a good education.\n\nIn some countries, like Afghanistan, people are not educated because they are scared of the Taliban. The Taliban do not want people to get an education. If we have the opportunity, we should take it and get a good education. There are people in Afghanistan who work in companies, hospitals, and schools at a young age, but they did not get enough education. This affects the people they serve, not just themselves.\n\nSome people are rich and do not want to waste their time in school because they have enough money. But education is important for everyone, men and women. Making a career is important; it takes time and patience. We should not rush to make our career; we need to study and be patient. If we want a better life, we need a full education. Sometimes people get bored with studying, but if we do not put in the effort, we will not have a better life. We should try our best in everything; nothing is impossible. The more we study, the more we will learn and become mature. There is no rush to choose a career; people make their careers at different ages. So, we should be patient and not make decisions we will regret in the future."}

However, going to school is better than staying at home, because students pay more attention in school and meet new people.\n\nSome people might say that school is stressful, but it also offers fun trips and helps students make friends. These things can help reduce stress. Schools also provide programs and counseling to help students deal with stress.\n\nIn school, students focus better on the lesson being taught.

In school, students can ask questions if they don't understand something, which is not always possible online.\n\nSchool is where students make friends and have fun. They get to attend school events and make memories. School also helps students learn from their mistakes and figure out who they are. At home, students miss out on these opportunities.\n\nIn conclusion, going to school is better than staying at home.

I got interested in it from watching cartoons, my sister, and my mom. When I was a kid, I would watch videos of girls doing makeup, and I would ask my sister to do it for me. My mom would tell me I was too young for it.\n\nAs I grew older, I collected more makeup. I would get it from my sister's old makeup or ask her if she had any she didn't want anymore. I started doing makeup in 7th grade, but I was really bad at it. So, I started watching videos and asking friends for help.\n\nMy mom knew I had a lot of makeup, so she let me use some of it, but not all of it, because I was still too young. In 8th grade, my mom would give me money for helping her, and I would spend most of it on makeup. The more I had, the better I got, because people in videos and friends would tell me what to buy and how to use it.\n\nNow I'm better than I was last year. I know this because I compared pictures from 7th grade and this year. I also practiced more often. My friends told me they saw a big difference after summer. My sister doesn't test makeup on me anymore because she tests products before she buys them. She's really good at makeup and inspires me to do it too.\n\nIn conclusion, trying new things you like is good because you can get better and better with time.

Every day, we make important decisions that affect who we are and show our true character.\n\nAnother reason I agree is that I can relate to it in my personal life. I used to not know who I was or how I wanted to be, but I knew I could change. For instance, a few years ago, I decided to learn an instrument just for fun. I ended up loving it and wanted to learn more. This decision made me passionate about music, and it's now a part of who I am. I saw that I didn't give up when things got hard, and I always gave it my all.\n\nHowever, there are times when life gets tough, and we let it affect us. Three years ago, I lost a friend, and it hit me hard. I let it change me, and I became a more serious and calm person. But I realized I can control who I want to be. I can choose what affects me and what doesn't.\n\nOn the other hand, I also see how our characteristics can be shaped by things beyond our control.

A smart man once said, 'Success is about trying again and again without losing hope.' This is true because everything we go through makes us stronger. After many tries, you will get it right, and good things don't come easily.\n\nEverything we go through makes us stronger. For example, think about someone who has never been to the gym. They might think it's not for them and don't want to try. Some people don't like their body, but they're too scared to try the gym. Then they see others who have changed their lives by going to the gym. Their friends encourage them, and they start to believe in themselves. One day, they decide to try the gym. At first, it's hard, but after a while, it gets easier. Their body starts to change, and they realize that anything is possible.

If they had been in a bad mood, they would have argued with his dad.\n\nProblems always come up. Some problems teach us something, while others we try to avoid. If people have a good attitude, they're less likely to have problems. For example, there was a guy who was always mean and rude. He got into fights because nobody liked him. If he had been nice to everyone, nobody would have had a problem with him.\n\nHaving a good attitude helps people stay calm in any situation. It makes them better and helps them avoid problems. So, having a good attitude is always a good thing."}

I think this means that being kind is never a waste of time, even if the other person is not kind back.

If they're not respectful to you, that's their problem. Being kind is important because if you're respectful, you can earn respect in return, and people will like you.

If we fail at something multiple times, we can figure out what went wrong. Failing many times can ultimately lead to success. When we fail, we shouldn't give up on our goals. Instead, we should learn from our mistakes and keep moving forward.\n\nFailing many times gives us the chance to improve and be better in life. It doesn't matter how many times we fail; what matters is that we learn from our mistakes. If we don't learn from our failures, we'll make the same mistakes again. So, failure can lead to success if we pay attention to what went wrong and work to improve.\n\nWhen we fail, we shouldn't lose our enthusiasm. Enthusiasm is what drives us to achieve our goals. Without enthusiasm, we can't succeed. Imagine if workers didn't care about their jobs or students didn't care about their classes. They would fail and fail again because they lost their motivation.\n\nWe need to know what we want to achieve and be willing to work for it. If we choose something we don't like, we'll probably fail. So, we should choose something we're passionate about and be willing to fail and learn from our mistakes. This way, we can achieve success.\n\nIn conclusion, failure gives us the chance to improve and become better people. But we shouldn't lose our enthusiasm. When we fail, we should learn from our mistakes and keep moving forward. If we fail many times, it's because we didn't put in enough effort.

A curfew won't stop all violence or bad decisions, but it can help teens have a better sleep schedule. This means they won't be sleepy during school hours. Even if teens don't go to sleep at exactly 10 p.m., a curfew can reduce the chances of teen violence at night. This can prevent bad things like kidnappings or fights with older people who might be involved in gangs or other dangerous activities. \n\nSecond, a curfew can help parents who have to wake up early for work. They might worry if their kids are out too late. If the law is adopted, it's important to remember that underage people shouldn't be outside after 10 p.m. unless they're with an adult. This way, if an emergency happens, families can stay together. \n\nThe curfew law can make a positive change in society. If teens can't do whatever they want at night, there might be less violence and bad decisions. Teens would be safer in many ways. \n\nOnce the city council makes this law active, it can improve security. If a teen breaks the curfew, they might get a short punishment. This will help teens understand that the law is serious. In the end, a curfew can benefit the city by reducing violence and helping teens get enough sleep.

Many teenagers get into trouble and do bad things with their friends because they think it's cool.\n\nI'll give some examples of why I think a curfew is a good idea. First, it will help teenagers sleep better. Most teenagers stay up late and then don't want to wake up early for school because they're tired. If they have a curfew, they'll get enough sleep and be healthier. And it's only on weekdays, so they can still have fun on weekends.\n\nSecond, a curfew will keep teenagers out of trouble. Many kids my age, 17-18 years old, do drugs or drink alcohol, and no one stops them. I've seen kids on social media getting drunk or making bad choices. Sometimes they even get into car accidents or die because they were driving drunk. It's a sad reality, and I know many teenagers are wasting their time by making wrong decisions.\n\nThird, a curfew will make parents less worried about their kids. When I was 15, I used to sneak out of my house, thinking I was living my best life. But I was really hurting my mom, who was worried sick about me. One day, I saw her crying because of me, and I realized I was hurting her. I felt bad and decided to change. I want to be a better person for myself and my parents. I imagine many parents are in the same situation, and they don't deserve to worry about their kids all night.\n\nSome teenagers think a curfew is unfair because they want to do what they want.

This would be great for students who live far from school or have a tough life. For example, my cousin has a hard time at home and needs to work a lot. He only has a few hours free at night. If the school had online classes, he could study and get a better job.\n\nOnline classes could also keep students safe. When students study at home, they can't meet people who might want to hurt them. This might seem unlikely, but if we can't control something, bad things can happen, like what happened at Virginia Tech.\n\nAnother good thing about online classes is that they could protect students from getting sick. We've seen this with the Corona virus. Many people got sick, and some even died. The virus is easy to catch, especially in crowded places. Many schools had to close because of it. Right now, we don't have a cure or vaccine for it. If schools had online classes, students could avoid getting sick.\n\nIt might be hard to change to online classes, but it would bring many benefits. It would be good for students who can't go to school, it would keep students safe, and it would protect them from getting sick."}

The principal says all students must join at least one activity. I don't agree with this because most students won't want to participate. They might just sit there, do nothing, or fall asleep. There are more reasons why students shouldn't have to join activities.\n\nThe principal made this rule, but students who don't want to join will get in trouble. This can affect their life and grades. Students should have the right to choose what they want and don't want. It's not fair otherwise. For example, students might need to stay after school for an activity, but they can't go. Extracurricular activities can be fun because you get to hang out with friends, but when you're forced to join, students get mad. I wouldn't join an activity because I don't have time to do my stuff at home when I get back. Students get annoyed when teachers tell them to do something they don't want to.\n\nAll schools in Generic City have good and bad rules. They don't let you do what you want, and you can get in trouble for not going to activities. Students often don't have time for activities or don't think they're important. They might be scared to join because they're afraid of getting bullied. There are many reasons why students shouldn't join activities. If you pick a sport like soccer, you can get hurt. People get bored when they're just sitting there listening to the teacher. They can get distracted easily and get in trouble for talking. Teachers can be too strict; they get mad if you're chewing gum in class.\n\nTeachers can make fun activities so students can enjoy their time with friends. Some students are lazy and don't want to think about activities. People have different ideas, and some don't think like others. The county should make more exciting activities so students can learn and understand that activities aren't that bad. Students might look distracted, but maybe they're not; maybe they just don't know how to do something. That's why I don't agree with the principal's decision."}

However, having a 10 p.m. curfew on weekdays and a midnight curfew on weekends could be a good idea. This would help them avoid trouble, get enough sleep, and have time to study.\n\nWhen teenagers break curfew, they can get in trouble with their parents or the police. Many think it's no big deal, but it really is. I remember when I was 13, I slept over at a friend's house and we went out at 11 p.m. to hang out with friends. We didn't care about curfew until we got in trouble with the police and our parents that night. We were out past 1 a.m. without our parents' knowledge, and we got in trouble. Since then, we don't go out past curfew until we're 18 or older.\n\nHaving a curfew is good because many teenagers don't get enough sleep. We need eight hours of sleep every day for our health. Most teenagers only get five hours or less of sleep because they stay out late with friends and come home whenever they want. I see kids in my school sleeping in class or having dark circles under their eyes, and I think it's important for us to get enough sleep. When we sleep in class, we miss important information and might fail our tests. Some teenagers even get into car accidents because they fall asleep at the wheel due to lack of sleep.\n\nMany teenagers don't have time to study or don't study at all before their tests. Some go out drinking at night and don't realize it's past their curfew. Others go out late, saying they'll come back and study, but they don't. Teenagers who don't study are often those without curfews because they know they can come home whenever they want without getting in trouble. In my opinion, studying for tests is important, and if we don't, we'll fail. If we had curfews, we wouldn't go out late and would have time to study.\n\nTeenagers should have curfews on weekdays and weekends because it would help them avoid trouble, do better in school, and stay healthy. Even though many won't like the idea, it would be better for everyone."}

If you ask five people, you'll likely get five different answers. This helps with decision-making by making better choices and doing the right thing. Different opinions come from people with different personalities, which can affect how you react.\n\nOne way seeking multiple opinions helps is by making you a better person. People's opinions can change each other, for better or worse. Some opinions help people in their situation, leading to better choices and personal growth. If someone's opinion is negative, do the opposite and make positive choices that affect you and others.\n\nAnother way seeking multiple opinions helps is by generating ideas. People's opinions can affect how you think and come up with ideas. Someone's opinion can stick with you, and you'll start to think differently. This can lead to positive ideas, like fundraising or giving back.\n\nA third way seeking multiple opinions helps is by influencing others. People's opinions influence each other to do positive things and give them ideas. This can create a cycle where one person's opinion inspires another to do good, and so on.

He's right when he says, 'Success is about going from failure to failure without losing excitement.' Many people today chase money, not success.\n\nBeing successful in life is rare. It's easy to make money or be famous, but being a truly successful person is hard to achieve. People often understand what success means too late, but they still try to achieve it. Those who don't give up, even when they fail, are the ones who keep trying. Yes, being successful in every situation is not easy; you have to work hard. Not everything in life is easy; we have to work hard to get what we want. For example, when I want to succeed, I work hard and try to reach my goal, but I may fail. If I lose my excitement, I've given up. The main point is that even if you fail, you can still have hope.\n\nChurchill is right in many ways. There are people who give up when they're not successful, but if they read this statement, they'll have hope again. Personally, I learned something new from Churchill's statement; it gave me hope and showed me it's okay to try new things, even if I fail.

{"text_id_kaggle": "7501BA9973AC", "output_essay": "Many people think about what kind of person they want to be. They choose their own traits or their actions show what they're like. A person can have many traits or just one. Traits help us see what paths we can take to be successful. We should feel okay about choosing our own traits.\n\nMost people with many traits want to be different from others. Nobody likes to copy someone else's trait because it's not true to who they are. I want to have many traits rather than copying others because being different makes me feel special. I tell myself, \"Different is a good thing.\" This makes me feel unique. It's good to have different traits from others, and some people might have one or two traits in common.\n\nBeing honest is good for our society. When people choose their own traits and are honest, we can see who they really are. When someone tells the truth about their traits, trust grows between people. Lying is not good. It's best to tell the truth about who you are. When I tell people my traits, they believe me because they know me. You should always tell the truth, or people will get the wrong idea.\n\nMany people feel confident about being themselves. When people have many traits, they're usually confident and passionate about them. This shows others how to have positive traits and be confident. I think about my traits every day because it helps me feel confident when I face challenges.

{"text_id_kaggle": "4994A639ED75", "output_essay": "Do you think you can choose your own personality traits, or are they shaped by things outside of our control? I agree with John Lubbock: what you want to be depends on you and how hard you work to get there. I think choosing your own traits is better because you can follow your own path, focus on what you want to do, and keep working hard to be successful.\n\nFirst, if you want to follow your dreams, then do what you want to do. When you think, 'I want to be a doctor or engineer,' you think about what it will help you achieve and your interest in that path. If you want to follow your own path, you need to have a passion for it. For example, if I want to be a criminal investigator, I need to follow that path and want it badly. That passion will help you follow your own path. Don't hesitate about what you want to do in the future.\n\nSecond, if you want to choose your own traits, then focus on what you want to do. You should work towards your dreams by focusing on what you want to be. One of my friends wasn't sure what she wanted to be because she wasn't focusing on what she was good at. But after talking to teachers and a counselor, she decided to try something new. Today, she's enjoying painting and paying attention to it. This example can help you figure out what you want to do, so just focus on what you choose.\n\nThird, hard work is the key to success. If you decide to choose your own traits, then you're in control, and you can choose what you do in the future. If you want to succeed, then hard work is the main key. Even if you're about to take a test, if you didn't study, you'll fail. But if you prepared, you'll pass with a good grade. This example shows that whatever you do has a purpose, and that's to work hard and succeed.\n\nI also disagree that our traits are shaped by things outside of our control. If you're interested in a field and someone recommends it, you'll do it because you want to. Nobody can make you do something until you want to. You have a desire or feeling to do something. Don't ever think, 'I can't do that,' or 'it's too hard.' Always believe in yourself and be confident. You can choose your own destiny by completing your dreams, and then you'll be proud of yourself.\n\nTherefore, I say go after your dreams and try to fulfill what you want to do. Nobody can influence you except if you're interested in that field. If you have a passion, then go forward until you finish it. In the future, these steps will help you remember how to achieve your goal. Always remember, no one can tell you what to do; it's your life, and you're in control. Hard work, focus, and following your path are the steps to succeed."}

If they don't attend classes, they won't learn.\n\nSchools can make education more accessible by letting students who can't attend traditional schools take classes online from home. With today's technology, it's easy to access. The internet helps people do their work, including homework. Schools with internet access make it easier to complete assignments. Today, students can talk to their teachers about their homework, and their teachers can help them from home. The internet is helpful if used correctly.\n\nHowever, some students waste time on the internet by playing games and doing other non-academic activities. This prevents them from completing their work at home. On the other hand, some students don't have access to the internet and can't attend school due to lack of transportation or proximity to schools. This makes it impossible for them to learn. In such cases, we need to help people who want to learn but can't due to lack of access to the internet or devices.\n\nLearning is not hard if you want to learn. You just need to try.

After we recover, we remember how much fun it was to ride. We might have always wanted to ride competitively, and now we have the chance. We don't want to go back to our old boring job, so we decide to try riding competitively as our new job.\n\nI agree with Duke Ellington's quote. I have faced problems, and they made me do my best. Duke Ellington probably didn't find it easy to become a great jazz musician. It likely took him months or years to learn to play and get really good at it. He even wrote his own songs and became famous for being one of the first black men in America to succeed in jazz. Duke Ellington made jazz music popular all over the world."}

This means they don't have to deal with small problems like getting to school on time. Many students wish they could learn from home instead of going to a public or private school. They could take the classes they need and learn things that will help them in life.\n\nFirst, students wouldn't have to worry about getting to school. They could relax knowing they don't have to rush to get there. Getting to school on time can be very stressful because teachers get angry when students are late. But with online classes, students can learn from home and don't have to worry about being late. They can do their work at any time of day because the classes are available online. They can also take their time on certain tasks and don't have to worry about bad weather.\n\nSecond, students wouldn't have to go to school when they're sick. Many schools tell students to stay home when they're sick so they don't get others sick. With online classes, students can still learn from home without getting anyone else sick. Missing school can be a big problem because students have to catch up on a lot of work. But students who take online classes can still learn from bed when they're sick. They don't have to wait to take a test or get a zero on their grade.\n\nLastly, students can learn at their own pace. In public schools, students have to learn at the same pace as the rest of the class. But with online classes, students can make the teacher repeat themselves and go at their own pace. They can also get more attention from the teacher because they're not in a big class. Students who take online classes can learn faster because they don't have distractions and can give the teacher their full attention.\n\nSome schools in the United States offer online classes from home. This helps students who have trouble getting to school, lets them learn at their own pace, and helps when they're not feeling well. Many students wish they could take online classes, which are better than going to a regular school."}

But now, the principal says all students must join at least one activity. I think this is unrealistic. Many students, including me, are very busy and can't stay after school. It's hard to balance schoolwork, social life, family life, and personal problems. Adding an after-school activity would make things even harder. I know staying after school can have benefits like finding new interests and making friends, but many students can't do it because of their busy schedules.\n\nOne reason I disagree with the principal is that many students are too busy to stay after school. They have commitments outside of school, like work or taking care of a sibling, which make it impossible to stay after school. If they were forced to stay, they would lose their jobs and responsibilities. This would cause them a lot of stress, which could affect their mental and physical health. Parents wouldn't want their children to risk their health and jobs for an extra activity.\n\nAnother reason is that many students are already participating in activities outside of school. They might be in sports teams, tutoring programs, or community clubs that meet every day. They can't commit to more activities. \n\nForcing students to stay after school would also affect the school's budget. The school would need to spend more money on activities, equipment, and staff. They would also need to pay teachers for extra hours and provide transportation for students. This would take away from the school's main budget.\n\nIn conclusion, I disagree with the principal's decision. Some students are too busy, others are already active outside of school, and it would cost the school too much money.

So I decided to show her I'm responsible by helping more around the house and taking care of my siblings.

When you're honest with yourself, you can be honest with your loved ones, like family and friends. They will always help you. \n\nBeing honest with those you care about is crucial. If you lie to them, you'll keep lying, and that can get you into trouble. You'll face consequences because you can't be honest with the people around you. If they trust you, don't repay them with lies. Just be honest, or you'll lose the people who were there for you.\n\nFor example, lying is why many people ruin their relationships. They don't have trust in each other because they can't find a way to be honest. Sometimes, when you hurt someone, it's like hurting yourself because you can't fix the pain you caused. That's why I think before I say something that might hurt others. I think about how they might feel, think, or react.\n\nIf you're honest with others, you'll have a normal life with honesty, not lies. For instance, if you go to a job interview and lie, it won't end well. If you keep lying, you can't control yourself, and you won't get the job.\n\nAll I'm saying is to be honest with your friends, family, and those who have been there for you. Just be honest. If you're going to say something that's not true, don't say it. Think about it twice. Try your best, and don't live your life with lies. At the end, you'll realize what you said was wrong and not true.\n\nI remember a story my mom told me. A man had sheep and lived in a small town. One day, he screamed for help, saying a wolf was attacking him. The townspeople came to help, but there was no wolf. The man laughed because they believed him. The next day, he did it again, and the townspeople got mad and left. When the wolf really came, the man screamed, but nobody helped him because they thought he was lying again. The wolf ate all his sheep, and nobody believed him ever again.\n\nI learned a valuable lesson from this story: be honest with others. If you lie and keep lying, they won't believe you. So, be honest with yourself and others. If you can't say something honest, don't say something you'll regret. Think before you speak, or you'll hurt others."}

Middle school students, aged 13-15, usually don't go out late because their parents don't trust them. In high school, aged 15-19, you start making your own decisions and preparing for adulthood.\n\nAt this stage, parents should trust you to go out and come back at a certain time they set. But what if that time is past 10 p.m.? There are many reasons you might not make it back on time. You might have sports practice or a game that runs late. This isn't your fault. You might also be going to another school, which takes time.\n\nAnother reason teenagers shouldn't get in trouble for staying out late is because of their jobs.

Not everyone agrees it's a good idea. I'm unsure about it too.\n\nEveryone wants to have more free time.\n\nI want to share my thoughts on learning through online video conferencing. I think it's both good and bad, so I'll give two examples.\n\nA student can learn at home through online conferencing instead of going to school. I think this is great because they can do daily tasks like cooking, watching TV, cleaning, and even driving while learning. This is a useful app.\n\nStaying at home can be beneficial. You can also take care of your kids.\n\nI don't think you should spend more than one hour on this. You'll have more time for yourself. Most people want to do this to have more time. However, I don't think this is a great idea because you might not understand, and if you ask questions, you still won't learn.\n\nWhat do you learn from online video conferencing?\n\nPersonally, I think this is both a bad and good idea.\n\nIt's bad because you might not understand, and good because you have more time.\n\nParents like this process because it's great for them. They have time for their activities, but for kids who don't work, going to school is better because kids can be lazy, and if parents let them do this, it's bad.\n\nI. WHAT ARE THE CONSEQUENCES FOR KIDS\n\nWHO STAY AT HOME AND DO THIS PROCESS\n\n- They become lazy.\n\n- They don't do anything.\n\n- They gain weight.\n\nNB: There's no advantage for kids.\n\nII. WHAT ARE THE ADVANTAGES FOR PARENTS\n\n- More time.\n\n- Time with your kids and husband.\n\n- Maybe more freedom.\n\n- Freedom.\n\n- Can work.\n\nIII. WHAT ARE THE CONSEQUENCES FOR PARENTS WHO DO THIS PROCESS\n\nFirstly, they don't understand the course.\n\n- Nothing is understood.\n\n- Don't study at home.\n\n- Waste time.\n\nIV. CONCLUSION\n\nCreating this process is a good idea, but not everyone should use it.\n\nIn conclusion, I think it's not a good process for kids.

There are many ways to work hard. For example, you can study every day, even if it's just for a little while. You can also stay after school to get help from a tutor in subjects like math, science, history, and reading.\n\nIf you work hard, you may get into your dream college. The college may even give you some of the books you need for free. If the college is expensive, don't worry. If you have good grades, like a 4.0 or 3.8 GPA, the college may pay half of the cost. You won't have to worry about the rest because the college wants students who study and work hard.\n\nIf you work hard, you can achieve your dreams. You can become the President, an astronaut, a lawyer, a judge, or a police officer. These are just a few examples of the many jobs you can get if you work hard. These jobs need people who are responsible and know what they're doing. That way, they can do a good job and avoid making mistakes."}

One of his famous quotes is, 'The greater danger for most of us lies not in setting our aim too high and falling short; but in setting our aim too low and achieving our mark.' Do you agree or disagree with Michelangelo's statement? In my opinion, I agree with him. The quote means that when you want to achieve something but don't give it your all, you're not being honest with yourself. I have three reasons to support Michelangelo's statement.\n\nFirst, I remember trying out for a soccer team in ninth grade. I wasn't ready, so I didn't make the team. But I practiced all summer and tried out again in tenth grade. This time, I was prepared and made the team. I achieved my goal because I aimed high and didn't give up.\n\nSecond, I remember taking a math final in eighth grade. I wasn't ready and guessed on the whole test. I didn't pass, but I got a chance to retake it. I studied hard and passed the retake with a high score. I was proud of myself because I aimed high and achieved my goal.\n\nThird, my favorite soccer team, Real Madrid, lost a big game in 2010. But they learned from their mistake and worked hard to improve. They got new players and a new manager, and the next season, they won the league title. They achieved their goal because they aimed high and worked hard.\n\nIn conclusion, I agree with Michelangelo's quote. I gave three examples to support his statement. First, I tried out for a soccer team and succeeded after aiming high. Second, I passed a math final after studying hard.

For example, if someone asks to use your address, you can say no. That's making a decision. It's the same at school. If an adult tells you to do something you don't want to do, you can say no. But if it's helpful, you can do it.\n\nThe principal decided we have to join at least one after-school activity. This means we have to stay after school and do something other than our homework.

At home, I type a lot on my phone, and at school, I have to type for English class. We have to do SOL Prompts, and we have to finish seven every day. When I got my phone, it helped me learn to type faster because the phone and computer have the same keyboard. It's easy to type fast on both, so it's easy to do my work. When people get a new phone, they don't know the keyboard, and it's harder for them. But when you have had it for a long time, it's not a problem. When I first got my phone, I didn't know where the keys were because I never had a phone before. It was hard, but I learned, and now it's way easier. This skill helps me in school a lot, and it helps me finish my work faster. I know I'll use this skill again in the future. I'll probably use it at work or on a job where I can type a lot. I think this typing skill is easy to learn; you just have to type and practice a lot. I think it's easy for people to learn this skill. When I type fast, you can hear the keyboard click, and my mom gets mad because she always hears it. Some people may have better skills, but this is one skill I think everyone should learn and use because you may need it for something important.

If you don't fail, you won't succeed in life. I've failed many times, but that's how I get better at what I do. I agree with Winston Churchill that to be successful, you must learn from your mistakes. Learn about what you want and see how others do it. Take it one step at a time until you get it. For example, to learn how to ride a bike, you need to know how it works. You start with training wheels, then take one side off and balance. Later, you take the other side off, and when you get better, you won't need them. The more you ride, the easier it gets. To get where you want to be, you have to be willing to fail. Even when you think you've got it, something will come up and stop you from succeeding. The most successful people failed many times before they got where they are. From their mistakes, they learned what to do and what not to do. I want to work on cars, and to get better, I need to practice on a car I don't care about. I need to learn how it works and how to fix it. Taking the engine out is hard, but I can do it. I need to follow the steps, or it won't go well. I remember not knowing how to take something off the car, so I looked it up on my phone. I learned what to do, what tools I needed, and how to do it. To be successful, you need to learn from your mistakes. It won't be easy, but you can do it. Some people think success comes from luck, but it doesn't work that way. You need to put in the effort and learn from your mistakes. That's why I think failing is good for success. You need to fall, fail, and get back up to succeed in life. No dream is too small if you put your heart and soul into it. To have a business, you need to be willing to fail. From failing, your business will grow and make you more money in the long run. Failing is not bad; you just need to learn from it and keep going. Don't let failing stop you from getting where you want to be and making money."}

For example, if someone steals or robs, their choices will affect them, and they won't change. We need to realize that our actions are bad and will affect our character.\n\nThe people we surround ourselves with also affect our character. If our friends skip school, they might pressure us to do the same. When we're with a group, they can influence how others see us, even if we're not doing anything bad. They might think we have the same character as our friends.\n\nAlthough we shape our character, other things beyond our control can also affect it.

Instead, we should use our failures to achieve our goals. People learn from their disappointments, but if we never experience failure, we won't know how to handle it when it happens.

My mom says, 'Where there's effort, there's success too.'\n\nMany people, including me, don't like to fail. But in life, we can't avoid failure. Everyone has to try to overcome it. I failed my math class once, which meant I couldn't be an exchange student.

It's up to you to make the right choice.\n\nMy final message is don't give up on yourself. Think before you do something, and think about the advice people gave you. It's really important. If you have no friends to help you, find an adult who can. That's if you make the right choice. Keep going, and don't give up."}
{"text_id_kaggle": "552B02536F4A", "output_essay": "People share their experiences with others. One experience that changed my life is a quote from my father: 'Act the way you want to be treated.' This quote changed how I see the world. But what does it mean, why is it important, and why should we learn from others' experiences? I still remember this quote because it made sense and was valuable.\n\nFirst, what does this quote mean? It means that if you want to be treated well, you should act well. If you act badly, you'll be treated badly. I saw a video about a man who helped poor people every day. One day, he had a car accident and needed money for surgery. The people he helped came together to give him the money and took care of him until he recovered. They fed him and gave him clothes, just like he had done for them.\n\nSecond, why is this quote important? My father shared this quote with me because he had experienced it himself. He told me about his first day of work after college. He worked hard and helped his coworkers. One day, he needed help, and the CEO of the company gave him a promotion because of his kindness. When I heard this, I wanted to be like my father, helping others instead of just helping myself.\n\nThird, why is it important to learn from experiences? Learning from experiences makes a big impact on society and helps people improve. When you learn from your mistakes, you become a better person. You won't make the same mistake again, and you'll understand the world in a different way. I remember my grandfather telling me to stay away from a dog because it bites. But I didn't listen, and the dog bit me. My grandfather had the same experience, which is why he warned me.\n\nLastly, learning from experiences is important. It makes you wiser. You should always act the way you want to be treated. Do good, and you'll receive good. Learning from experiences helps you learn from others' mistakes and improve. Wisdom comes from going through a situation and learning from it. People share their experiences with others, and we can learn from them."}

I believed in myself, and I became first out of 10 people. It's simple: if you put your mind to it, you can achieve your goal.\n\nIt's all in your mind. If you want to achieve something, you can do it. People say that if you put your mind to something, you can achieve it.

I once got a summer project about whales, which didn't interest me. I didn't work on it during break and waited until the last week to do it. I didn't do my best on it. If students choose a topic they care about, they will want to learn more and work on the project.\n\nStudents should design a project they feel confident about. Everyone is different, and we all like different things. My sister got a project about cooking, which she loves. She finished it the same day it was assigned. She already knew a lot about cooking, but she learned more while doing the project. She felt confident doing it. Students would feel better doing a project about something they already know a bit about and want to learn more about.\n\nThe projects they design would let them have fun and learn at the same time. I have more fun doing projects about things I like to learn about. I learn more when I'm interested in the topic.

That's why people make plans to have fun after school. The principal wants students to have fun in these activities.

I think having a problem is a chance to try again, because when you have a problem, you can learn from your mistakes and see what went wrong. You can ask someone who has succeeded for help and look at what others have done before.\n\nYou can learn from your mistakes by looking at what others have done to succeed. Making mistakes isn't always bad; it's a chance to start over, knowing what didn't work and what to do differently. For example, you might face a hard challenge on a project, and you'll have to try many times to get it right. If you make a mistake in a relationship, you can work it out and try to be a better person. You'll face challenges in life where you have to try again and again, and that's how you learn from your mistakes.\n\nWhen you have a problem, don't worry too much; ask someone for help. Ask someone who has already dealt with a similar problem, so you can get advice on how they handled it. Asking for help can make you feel better, because someone has already been through what you're going through. For example, scientists make mistakes, but they keep trying until they get a good result. Math teachers face hard questions, and they keep trying until they find the answer. We all face problems every day, but we shouldn't give up; we should keep trying until we solve the problem.\n\nWhen we face a problem, it's our chance to do our best by asking for help and learning from our mistakes. When working on a project, don't be afraid to ask for help or advice from someone who has already succeeded.

{"text_id_kaggle": "B4C9A418B2C2", "output_essay": "Do we choose our own character traits, or are they shaped by things beyond our control?\n\nThe most important thing we develop as we grow is our character. How do we choose our character, or how is it shaped if we don't control the things around us? It's a big achievement to stay true to ourselves in a world that's always changing, and to choose how we act. That's why I believe we choose our own character traits; because it's what we make it.\n\nMy first reason for believing this is that nobody can change who we are deep down. If we want to succeed in school, we need to have the character of a winner. Our character helps us stick to our goals and keep fighting until we achieve them. As Paulo Coelho said, \"If you want something and you keep trying, the universe will make it happen.\" That's when our character shows its strength.\n\nMy second reason is that our personality shows we can think for ourselves. Our character is the link between what we do and why we do it. Sometimes, people make excuses, saying, \"My character is strong, so I did that...\" or \"I can't do it because my character is weak.\" But it's up to us to make things happen. A doctor once told my mom, \"Your little daughter's character is forming, and she's like a sponge, learning everything around her.\" People judge us by our personality, but we decide how we act, and we can shape our character.\n\nIn conclusion, choosing our own character traits is a big privilege.

Some people think it's a good idea to know what you want to do so you can get a head start. Others think it's not a good idea because you might change your mind later. I think choosing a career at a young age helps students prepare for college, reduces stress, and gives them direction.\n\nFirst, knowing what you want to do helps you prepare for college. For example, if you take similar courses in high school, you'll have an easier time in college. If you don't know what you're doing, college can be very difficult. Another reason to choose a career early is so you know what to expect and won't be too surprised.\n\nSecond, when you know what you want to do, you're less likely to change your mind later. You'll already know what you need to do, so you won't worry about not liking your career. Many people worry about their future because they don't know what to do. Having a plan or a backup plan can really help.\n\nThird, choosing a career at a young age can help you become more professional and achieve more. For instance, if you want to be a singer, you'll need to take singing lessons. Some high schools offer performing arts classes that can help you prepare for college. Even though college is different from high school, you'll still be prepared with the help of your teachers.\n\nSome people disagree with choosing a career at a young age because students might change their minds. Parents might want their child to pursue a certain career, but the child might not like it. This can cause problems. However, it's not bad to change your plans. You can take a break and figure out what you really want to do. This is why it's good to choose a career at a young age - so you know what's best for you.\n\nChoosing a career at a young age is a good idea.

They also need to know what classes they need in high school.\n\nThe problem is that students can't spend a lot of time thinking about careers while they're in high school. It's too early to think about what career they want before high school.\n\nAnother reason is that students are too young to think about a career before they enter high school. They need to get to their junior year to start thinking about what career they want to take when they graduate. They need certain classes and credits to help them choose a career.\n\nIt's not a big deal to start thinking about a career at a young age, just after middle school. You want to plan what you want to be when you graduate from high school. We have plenty of time to think about it and finish high school.\n\nIn conclusion, these three reasons are why I disagree that students should decide on a career when they enter high school. They're too young to think about a career. They need certain classes and credits to help them choose a career. This is why I choose these reasons and disagree because it's just a young age when they have plenty of time to think and finish high school.\n\nStudents need time to think about the choices they want while they're in high school, not in college.

This is helpful for students who need to learn and take online classes during the summer when there is not enough space in school. They can also study through video conferencing when they cannot go to school.\n\nOne reason is that some students do not have enough space in school to graduate on time. Taking online classes from home can help them. For example, a student from Vietnam moved to the United States and needs more time to learn English and graduate. She is nineteen and has been in high school for four years. She needs to graduate this year, but she still misses one more class, which is English 12. Her teacher suggested taking an online English 12 class in the summer, and now she can graduate on time.\n\nAnother reason is that students can study through video conferencing when they cannot go to school. This is helpful and easy for students to study at home. Even if they miss some days of school, they can still keep up with the class. For example, if a student gets sick or has to go somewhere for a few days, they can still learn at home.\n\nLastly, some students may have had an accident or illness and need to take time off from school. Taking online classes and studying through video conferencing can help them catch up on their work. For example, university classes are hard and expensive, so students need to study hard to graduate. If they cannot go to school, they can still learn, do their homework, and pass their class.\n\nIn conclusion, more schools should offer online classes or video conferencing for students. This will make it easier for students to organize, study, and do their homework. They can take their time to do their work anywhere, anytime."}

Some people think it's better for students to attend class from home, but I think students should go to school because they get to interact with their classmates, teachers, and friends, and they can do many different activities.\n\nSome people say taking classes online is good for students. They say students waste a lot of time getting to school in the morning. They have to wake up at 6:00 a.m. and catch the bus at 7:00 a.m. Students need at least 7 hours of sleep to be active and healthy. But they often stay up late to do homework, study for quizzes and tests, and feel confident. They can also record the class online, which helps them review what they learned. And they might feel more confident speaking up in class because they don't have to face their classmates. However, online classes can cause students to miss classes and not pay attention.\n\nOn the other hand, students should go to school. In school, they meet their classmates, friends, and teachers. They can make friends and develop their relationships. If they take online classes, they might cheat or not focus. They might think they can find all the answers online and don't need to study. Moreover, students can participate in many activities in school, such as labs, seminars, projects, and festivals. So, this argument is valid because students experience many things in class and can do extracurricular activities after school.\n\nIn conclusion, students should go to school because they interact with their classmates, teachers, and friends, and they can do many activities.

This means they will not get sick and will be healthy. People who want to change the food are right because everyone needs to take care of their health and education.\n\nBody Paragraph 2:\n\nWe need new and healthy food, not just chips and sugary drinks. These foods do not have vitamins that help students' brains and bodies. If we change the food, I hope we get more fruits and salads that can help a little.\n\nBody Paragraph 3:\n\nStudents can try new food for the first time. If they eat the same food every day, they get bored and might not want to eat the next day. This is bad for them because they will stay hungry at school.\n\nBody Paragraph 4:\n\nNew healthy food is better for students' health. Changing the food can help students improve and take care of themselves.\n\nConclusion: I hope the school leaders will change the food to help students. I think this is a good idea, and I agree with it. This can help make the school better in the future."}

You'll learn not to trust everyone.\n\nIn 2006, a girl didn't understand the US school system and had to decide about summer school. She asked her friends and family for advice. Her friends said summer school wouldn't help her pass, but her family said it would. She trusted her friends and didn't go to summer school. She failed the grade because she didn't pass her classes. She realized her friends didn't care about her and gave her bad advice. If you trust someone who wants the best for you, everything will be okay. But if you trust someone who doesn't care, you might make a bad choice.\n\nAnother reason to ask for many opinions is that you won't make a mistake and lose an opportunity. \n\nIn 1990, a smart girl won a scholarship to a top college, but she didn't know what to do. She asked her friends, and they told her not to accept it. She listened to them and didn't take the scholarship. Later, her parents told her they couldn't afford college, and she stayed home. She missed her chance because she only listened to her friends.\n\nThat's why it's important to ask for many opinions so you can make a better choice and not miss an opportunity.\n\nFinally, asking for many opinions helps you make a better choice and know what's best. You won't lose an opportunity, and everything will work out well.\n\nYou can know what's best because you have many opinions to choose from. You won't lose an opportunity because you have many options. Everything will work out well because people gave you advice to help you.\n\nIn 2002, a 14-year-old boy wanted to join a theater club. He asked his friends, family, and teacher for advice. He had many opinions and chose the best one. He joined the club and became very successful, even famous.\n\nAsking for many opinions helped him make a better choice and not miss his chance.\n\nIn conclusion, asking for many opinions can help you avoid mistakes and make better choices.

By learning this, they will be ready for college or the workforce.\n\nOn the other hand, if students take too many extracurricular activities, they will have less time to study or do homework.

{"text_id_kaggle": "2B63A9B12B5B", "output_essay": "Winston Churchill, a former British Prime Minister, said that 'success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.' I agree with this statement because trying to be successful always involves failures, and we can learn from those failures. Failing is not always bad; it can help us learn what we did wrong. Giving up gets us nowhere in life, and if we give up, we miss the chance to become successful.\n\nMy first reason is that if we take the easy way out when we fail and don't try to fix it, we will give up more often next time. Giving up can change who we are, from being confident to being doubtful. Some people think giving up is the best choice when things get tough, but it can have a bad impact on our lives.\n\nMy second reason is that learning from our failures helps us understand what we did wrong. It not only helps us improve but also opens up new opportunities. Trying to be successful and failing is like learning to ride a bike. You fall, get back up, and try again until you get it right.\n\nMy third reason is that people who don't give up on a task they fail at have a better chance to overcome other problems in life. Being successful gives us a good feeling and encourages us to do more. The more we solve problems, the better we get. Being successful has many benefits, such as a better job, a better personality, or a better life. Giving up won't make us happy; it will make us sad.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe giving up is never an option. To be successful, we need to go through failures and learn from them. Giving up won't help us be successful; it will just make our problems worse. No matter how many times we fail, if we don't give up, we will always find better ways to fix our mistakes and learn from them to improve our problem-solving skills."}

I agree with this idea because, as a high school student, I think teenagers often get into trouble because they don't think ahead. Most teenagers feel comfortable at night because there are fewer adults around. Curfews can also teach teenagers to be responsible. When it's dark, it's easy to get into fights or danger. I did some research and found that curfews can help keep teenagers out of trouble and away from bad influences. Curfews can also help teenagers do well in school by studying and finishing their work on time. They can also help teenagers get enough sleep. If there were no curfews, many teenagers would get into trouble and break the law. Curfews can save lives by keeping teenagers from walking or driving alone at night.\n\nIn conclusion, curfews teach teenagers to manage their time wisely so they can be safe at home. Teenagers need curfews to help them with their daily lives. I know this because I'm a teenager too. One night, I didn't have a curfew and I stayed out late with friends. I had a test the next day, but I failed it because I didn't study. Curfews can keep teenagers from getting distracted by friends or troublemakers.

They get overwhelmed by all the job options and lose focus on their studies. They try to find a career that seems good at the time, but they don't think about the long-term effects.\n\nAnother reason is that there are many job options, and not every job is right for everyone. For example, a girl might want to work in construction, while a boy might want to work in fashion. But schools often don't listen to students and put them in classes they don't like. Most students are not mature enough to make such big decisions.\n\nMy final reason is that students should not be pressured by teachers and adults to find a career too early. They are still kids and should enjoy their high school years, play sports, and participate in after-school activities.

I think this because some teachers might be too hard on their students and give them too much work. For example, teachers might make the projects too long and not give students enough time to enjoy their breaks.\n\nAnother reason I think the projects should be student-designed is that students can choose a topic they like and not have to do a project they dislike all summer. I also think it's a good idea for the projects to be student-designed because students can manage their time and finish the project before the next school year starts.\n\nIf the summer projects are designed by teachers, they might take advantage and give their students too much work.

If the school projects were student-designed, students could make a project based on what they like. It's bad enough they have to do a school project over the summer, but at least they could enjoy doing it if it was student-designed. For example, if I were to make a school project, it would probably be about science because it involves fun experiments that can be done outside in nice weather.\n\nIf the summer project was student-designed, students could plan it out and make time for it so they can turn it in complete. For example, they could make trips with friends and family and plan out what they need to do for their project and how much time they would have left to have fun. If the project was designed by a teacher, they wouldn't know what to expect and would have to cancel some trips they had already made just for a school project.\n\nIn conclusion, the best choice would be to make the school projects student-designed. Everything would be just right for that student, and it can assure teachers that most students would complete the school projects. With the project not being too much work, students can enjoy their summer. If the project were about a subject the student likes, they would have fun and learn at the same time during the summer. Students would have a huge advantage if they could plan everything out and have good time for the project if it was student-designed.

Michelangelo was a great artist who once said, 'The biggest danger for most of us is not aiming too high and missing, but aiming too low and hitting our target.' I don't agree with this because I think the biggest danger is aiming too high and missing. Michelangelo's statement can cause us stress and make us behave badly.\n\nWhen we aim too high, we can get stressed. This stress can make us feel like giving up on what we want to do in life. If we give up, we'll feel hopeless and won't try again. Stress can also make us feel tired and lazy. When we're tired and lazy, we can overthink and have negative thoughts. These are the reasons why aiming too high can be bad for us.\n\nAiming too high can also make us behave badly. If we focus too much on our goals, we can forget important things. For example, we can forget to spend quality time with our family and friends. We'll lose our connections with them if we only focus on one thing. Aiming too high can also make us act badly and forget our manners. For example, if we focus too much on our goals and spend all day on them, it can ruin our sleep schedule and make us cranky. These are the reasons why aiming too high can make us behave badly.\n\nSome people think the biggest danger is aiming too low and hitting our target. They think this because if we aim too low, we won't care much about what we want to do. For example, if we just want to rest or relax, they think we don't really care about finishing our tasks. Another reason is that we won't focus on important things in life if we don't achieve our goals first. Even though this may be true, I still think the biggest danger is aiming too high and missing because it can cause more problems.\n\nMichelangelo's statement is not good because it can cause us stress and make us behave badly. It can make us stressed if we aim too high, making us behave badly if we focus too much on aiming high and missing. By aiming too high, it can cause us to be stressed and make us feel like giving up. It can also make us stressed by not getting enough sleep if we're only focusing on one thing. These are the reasons why I disagree with Michelangelo."}

Then, they will tell someone else, and the world will become a better place.\n\nAsking people for advice also gives you more knowledge. I used to watch my mom work hard every day. One day, I asked her to teach me. She showed me how to cook and wash dishes. The more I worked, the better I got. Now, my family asks me to cook for them. I also help my mom with washing dishes. I made a good choice by asking for her help.\n\nNot everyone has the same opinion. Asking for advice can be hard because you might not like what they say. I asked many people, and I got confused. My sister and brother gave me different answers. But it's good to ask for advice because anything can happen, and it's good to get help.\n\nAsking for advice makes you work harder. I asked my parents, friends, and family for advice. They might not agree with you. Many people told me that advice is not good, but I didn't listen. My dad gave me advice on how to work hard and never give up. I listened to him, and it helped me. I never give up on my work. Listening to my dad's advice helped me get where I am today.\n\nMany people, including kids and adults, struggle with hard times every day. You never know what's going on in their life. They might be hurting inside even if they laugh. If you have a friend or family member like this, please give them advice. Tell them how much they're worth and how amazing they are. If you compliment them, they might change their mind. That means you just saved someone's life, and they made a better choice. Giving people advice is really helpful."}

Many people discuss the summer break because it's a long time for people to relax and take a break from school. Some students like to plan their own program to review some topics, while others prefer to have a program set by their teachers. Although some students might not like doing summer projects designed by their teachers, teachers know which topics students need to focus on to be ready for the next school year.\n\nTeachers have a good understanding of how students developed during the year, so they're the best people to assign projects to work on and review what's been done. This way, students have a clear plan to work on and can see where they need help. They don't have to spend time deciding which topics to focus on, and they can get feedback from their teachers. By doing the assigned work, students can gain confidence and be better prepared for the next year. Being better prepared, they can take advanced classes and earn more credits.\n\nStudents who complete the project can get a grade for the project and another for participating. This can motivate students to stay active during the summer by doing the project, getting feedback, and earning a head start for the next year. Teachers can even give some prerequisites for the units they'll cover, so they don't waste time on them at the beginning of the year.\n\nDoing assignments and projects during the summer break is the best way to start the next school year.

It's a way to have fun when you're not in class. You can do something you like to pass the time. Helping others is also good - everyone benefits. Having something to take your mind off stress is always helpful. Taking time to enjoy yourself while you're young and doing fun things that can also help you in the future is great.\n\nSports can help you feel less stressed and take your mind off school worries. You have more responsibilities because you're focused on the sport, not school. Most students are stressed about school. Sports or other activities can take away stress from school or other things. However, there's a downside. If you focus too much on the sport, your grades might suffer. You have to balance schoolwork and sports. If you want to do an activity, make a plan to get everything done on time.\n\nStudent counseling, where students help each other with problems, is a good idea. Students understand each other's lives, so they can help a lot and make each other feel more comfortable. They might be friends, so they'll feel comfortable talking about their problems. However, if the helpers aren't professional, they might make things worse. It's also an activity outside of class.\n\nA yearbook, with pictures of everyone, is a great idea. Students know what they want in the yearbook, but they might not like the school's choice. If students decide, it could be more profitable. Students who work on the yearbook might be stressed because they want it to be easy or they're bored and want something to do. There could be many different designs and themes for the yearbook. It could be a zombie theme or something else, making the yearbook more interesting.\n\nHaving these activities can change things for people. They can meet new friends and communicate with others. It helps them feel less stressed about schoolwork and focus on the activity. When they go back to school, they're less stressed and ready to focus. They can look forward to making new friends when others join. Having a sport, a yearbook club, or something else, you can't always focus on the activity; you have to focus on school too.\n\nTry doing something outside of class; you never know what you might like until you try it."}

For instance, if students don't like the new menu, they might be allergic to certain foods or just not like the taste. They might have to bring their own lunch to school instead.\n\nFirst, some students have food allergies, so the school could get in trouble if they serve something that makes them sick. Parents might get angry because they think the school is responsible for keeping their kids healthy. If students eat outside of school and get an allergy, the school might get blamed for not providing safe food options.\n\nNext, some students might like or dislike certain foods. They might not like the new menu because they're used to eating food from their country or regular food at home. They might not want to try new things.\n\nI think some students will like the new menu, but we can't be sure. The menu will have some foods that students like, but they might still decide to bring their own lunch. \n\nIn conclusion, I have three reasons why I think we shouldn't change the menu. Some students are used to eating certain foods, and all foods have different tastes. For me, it's a good idea to have a new menu because I like trying new foods and learning about different cultures.

Many students who like these teams or clubs take on extra work in their daily lives. Schools should keep an eye on students who do extra activities during and after school, because they might get too much work or miss classwork.\n\nThe extra work students do for these activities is very demanding and tiring. Even those who are used to it can find it hard, because our bodies get tired and need rest. In fact, students who do many activities get tired, and even if they don't feel it, their bodies will show it later. A student in more than one team has a lot of work, like attending all practices. If both teams practice at the same time, the student has to choose which one to attend and how to catch up on what they miss. This can be very stressful. The teams' travels can be far and late, like a presentation in downtown, and students will come back home late, leaving no time to study or rest. In fact, the extra work affects their studies.\n\nStudents who do many school activities gain extra experience, which can help their future.

They might not think it's necessary to do a project if a teacher doesn't assign it. This could lead to students failing.\n\nSummer projects should be easy and fun. If you had a project, wouldn't you want it to be enjoyable? Letting students create their own projects gives them a chance to show what they can do. It also helps them see that projects aren't just about thinking hard, but about doing what they love. Even if others disagree, wouldn't you want your project to be enjoyable?"}

This curfew really gets in the way of teenagers' lives. The curfew should not be adopted because it limits teenagers who want to do good things. Students who work or play sports after school will be affected. Some teenagers who drive might get into a car accident trying to get home on time.\n\nThe first reason is after-school activities. A student at my school plays soccer and works after school. He has to stay for practice with the team on weekdays. After practice, he goes to work at the mall. It takes him almost an hour to get there. He starts work at five and finishes at ten. He won't have enough time to get home without breaking the curfew.\n\nThe second reason is driving consequences. A friend got her driver's license a few months ago. Like other teenagers, she likes to explore and visit many places. She also likes to hang out with friends and have family reunions. The risk is high because she has to be home on time to avoid the curfew and might get into an accident by driving too fast. Doing all those things takes a lot of time, and the curfew would take away her freedom.\n\nThe last reason is that not all teenagers do bad things. In my school, there are clubs that help students focus on new things and stay out of trouble. These clubs give them the chance to choose the good side of life. Some statistics show that teenagers are more likely to avoid gangs when they're involved in activities like sports and clubs at school. It also helps them have a more successful life. It's not fair to punish teenagers who want to do good things for those who break the law.\n\nCurfews should not be adopted because they take away teenagers' freedom and limit what they can do, like playing sports and having a job that will help their future."}

There are three main reasons for this.\n\nFirst, students will not pay attention. They will do other things instead of listening to the teacher. But if their parents check on them often, they might stay focused.\n\nSecond, students will be distracted. They will play with their phones or video games. The teacher cannot see what they are doing. Going to school is better for learning.\n\nThird, students can cheat on tests. They can find answers online. The teacher cannot help them if they cheat. But if they try hard, they can finish the test quickly.\n\nIn conclusion, students should attend public school. They will learn more than staying at home watching video conferencing. It's not the same as going to school and staying home. Going to school is learning, and it's easier to understand because teachers explain in person.\n\nSincerely, Generic_Name"}

This is a good idea because every student can enjoy a delicious lunch every day. Students won't need to bring lunch from home, and they can eat their favorite, healthier meals daily.\n\nOur school cafeteria needs a lot of funding to produce new food for school lunch. However, students are very happy that they can have a delicious lunch every day. Before the new menu, the school lunch was not good, and students didn't like eating at school. They wanted better food to eat and stay energized all day. Now, they're joyful about the food they want to eat, and having better food is good for them.\n\nEven though students don't need to bring lunch from home, some students used to bring their own food because the school food was not good. Now, they don't have to bring food because the cafeteria has changed the menu. Students can eat the food they want, like hamburgers, rice, meat, milk, fruit, and more.\n\nAlthough it's good for students to eat healthier food, some school food still has cheese, which is not good for our health. Students need food to stay focused and energized throughout the day. Now, students are happy to eat their favorite food, and they can learn quickly.\n\nHaving good food in every school is necessary because students are the future of our country. They need to have a healthy body and a strong mind. Students who want to achieve their goals work hard, wake up early, and need positive and strong minds and bodies.

Others go to a club or technology room because they think it's cool. The principal might want students to have fun and not be bored at home. They want students to try new things, meet new people, and have fun. But some people don't like staying after school because it's boring or they're tired. They might need to help their family or take care of a brother or sister. Sometimes people get bored with school and don't want to stay. They might say they'll stay, but they don't.

So, should the school switch to a healthy menu?\n\nSome people think the current menu is fine, but it's not a bad idea to change it to a healthier one. A healthy menu helps keep our minds and bodies in good shape. It also helps us learn better. At a young age, we need to make sure we're eating well both at home and at school. Many students like to eat unhealthy food, like chips, instead of the school lunch.\n\nAnother reason is that healthy food gives us more energy to learn. It also provides the vitamins our bodies need to stay focused in class. Students who play sports need energy to get through the day, so healthy food is a good choice for them. They need a lot of protein, which some school food doesn't have, making it hard for them to stay strong.\n\nIn conclusion, having a better lunch menu is a good idea and something to look forward to in school.

I think that if I play many sports and keep my grades up, I'll have more chances to succeed because I'll have more opportunities and won't struggle as much.\n\nFor example, I met a girl who joined many clubs and played sports like track, volleyball, and basketball in middle school and high school. This helped her earn the credits she needed to graduate. If she hadn't focused on school, she wouldn't have enough credits. Everyone should make sure they get enough credits before graduating so it's easier to find a job and be successful.\n\nTo play sports, she also needed good grades. If she didn't have good grades, she couldn't join anything, which would make it harder to get credits and graduate. It would be harder to find a job too. So, we need to focus on what we need, not what we want, to be successful and avoid struggling. But we also need to work for what we want. I also want to learn other band instruments because it's fun. You get to experience new things. For example, in 6th grade, I was in band and played the trumpet. We went on field trips, played at different places, and had a lot of fun.

{"text_id_kaggle": "9A7B94968ABD", "output_essay": "John Lubbock said, 'Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it.' But do we really choose our characters? Our characters are shaped by the things we see on social media and in everyday life, which can be good or bad. We use these things to create because they give us ideas or, in a way, influence us to use the characteristics we see.\n\nFirst, social media has a big impact on what we think and do. It shows us images or things to follow. For example, the Kardashians; many people see them as the perfect life. When they first appeared on TV, they were very popular. They were what every viewer wanted to be: rich, good-looking, and living a great life. Our world revolves around these things, which can shape our minds into thinking that's what we want. Social media also influences us through apps like Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter. These platforms can influence how we do things and how we live. They show us ads or attractions that make us like or buy things.\n\nSecond, in our daily lives, we meet many people with different characteristics. One big characteristic is emotions, which we use in everything from talking to acting to creating characters. People in our lives can influence us, like our heroes or role models. We look up to these people because we're inspired by them or think there should be more people like them. Our heroes are what we want to be when we grow up or what we want to become. They could be our parents or friends who have made a big impact on our lives. Some characteristics can be bad influences, like having a tough childhood or being bullied. These things can affect our character by making us mean, shy, sad, or angry.\n\nSome people think we can create characters using only our imagination and not be influenced at all by the outside world. But we can create characters with emotions and feelings that can be easily influenced to make a character. We can also use our imagination to create a fantasy.\n\nIn conclusion, many things influence us when creating a character. We're influenced by social media, like Instagram and TV, and by people, like our heroes and role models. We can be influenced by anything. We're influenced by everything from daily life to the internet."}

They won't do well in school, and their grades will drop because they don't have energy.\n\nIf students don't eat the food, it will go to waste, and we will have to throw it away.

Imagine how hard it is for kids born in other countries to achieve their goals in America. They spend more time playing outside and forget their cultures of hard work and helping their families, which disappoints their parents. Our character is shaped by things we can't control, like where we move to and our social situation.\n\nFirst, where we move to can change our character. For example, a refugee named John from Africa lives in America. Back in his country, John wanted to be a lawyer and was a hardworking student. But in his American school, he became lazy and stubborn, unable to finish his schoolwork. John hangs out with lazy people in America, and now he's like them too. Moving to a new place can make us adopt others' character traits.\n\nSecond, our social situation can also shape our character. For example, I wanted to convince my mom to buy me a new phone. I told her I wanted the new iPhone 12, but she said it was too expensive and I didn't deserve it. So, I showed her all the things I do at home and my good grades at school. Finally, she agreed to buy me the phone. People often change who they are to get what they want, and this is something we can't control.\n\nSome people think we choose our own character traits. While it's true that we make choices, our character is also shaped by things we can't control, like our environment. Even though we decide who we want to be, we can't change who we were born to be.\n\nIn conclusion, sometimes people fail to control or change who they are because they rely on others. Moving to a new place and being in certain social situations can make us act differently. Those who think they choose their own character traits may be right, but most of us are influenced by the people we want to be like.

This means we can decide our own character, or is it shaped by things outside our control? In my view, our character is shaped by things outside our control because others try to influence us. They try to make us angry, sad, or happy. From my experience, people have tried to push me to my limits or cheer me up. I have many reasons to believe our character is shaped by others or something.\n\nOne thing that can shape our character is how we feel. The way someone or something makes us feel can create a new character trait. I have felt this way about many things, like when I express myself or tell someone how I feel before things get out of hand. For example, when my dad tells me to do something I don't want to do, I show him I really don't want to do it. This helps me build a new character trait. A good experience, like scoring three goals in a soccer game and having my family and friends cheer me on, can also shape my character. Each new experience becomes a part of who we are.\n\nFeelings and character traits are similar but not the same. A feeling is what creates a character trait. Each feeling we have becomes a part of who we are. A character trait is something that stays with us for a long time, but a feeling is what we feel in the moment. For example, 'I'm mad at him because he took my book' is a feeling, but 'I hold on to my books because he'll take them' is a character trait.

{"text_id_kaggle": "A7ED341B576D", "output_essay": "Is taking career courses a good idea for students? Some people think it's a good idea, while others don't. This is important because career courses can affect a student's life. Taking career courses is a good idea for students because they help students find their future job, improve their skills, and help the economy.\n\nFirstly, career courses help students find the job they want. They show students what they can do and help them make a decision. For example, a student takes a nursing class in high school. She decides she wants to be a nurse in the future. After high school, she chooses nursing in college because she already knows about it. Career courses are helpful for students. So, if students want to find their dream job, they should take career courses.\n\nAdditionally, career courses help students learn new things. When students take career courses, they get new information. For example, a student takes a computer class in high school and learns how to fix a computer's problem. She can make money by fixing computers. Career courses improve students' knowledge. They can get a good job in the future. So, if students want to learn new things, they should take career courses.\n\nSome people don't agree with this. They say taking career courses is not a good idea because students' interests and opinions change. People's moods and opinions change every day. Students' interests in learning new things will change. For example, a student takes an army class in high school because he wants to be in the army. After a month, he wants to be a doctor instead and doesn't like the army class anymore. He wasted his time. However, this argument forgets that career courses are good for students because they help the economy. A country has a good economy when it has smart students. They make the country's future. For example, a student takes an economics class and learns how to pay taxes. When he learns about taxes, he teaches others. Everyone knows how to pay taxes. When people have good jobs, they make money and pay taxes. The government uses taxes to build hospitals, schools, and libraries.\n\nSo, if students want to help their country, they should take career courses.\n\nIn conclusion, taking career courses is good for students. Most importantly, career courses are a good idea because they improve skills and help find a dream job. Every student should take career courses. Students, take a career course because it's fun and helpful, and your country's future is in your hands."}

Security is a big problem that people all over the world worry about. They live in fear and don't have much hope for a better future for their children. This often happens in places where gangs or other dangerous groups are in control. I think it's a good idea to have a curfew to protect people's lives. It's very important for our lives.\n\nOne reason this is a good idea is that it makes people safer. If the city council makes this curfew, people won't be able to go out too late because it would be against the law. For example, if you're walking home alone at night and you see a man on the corner, you might feel scared. You don't know if he's a bad person or not, but you feel unsafe. This curfew tries to prevent bad things from happening.\n\nAlso, this curfew says that teenagers who are out on the streets after 10 P.M. on weekdays and midnight on weekends would be breaking the law. This is another good reason for the curfew, because it means less trouble for teenagers. We know that many teenagers do bad things to fit in with their friends. This gets them into big trouble that can even lead to jail or death. This curfew might seem like a big restriction, but it's not. It just wants to keep teenagers safe.\n\nAdditionally, this curfew could mean less crime in the city. Crimes are increasing every year, making people feel hopeless. When we talk about crimes, we mean things like vandalism, theft, and kidnapping. If the council approves this curfew, these problems will decrease over time because of the strong law. This will make the city a safer place for its people.\n\nOn the other hand, this curfew could be unfair. For example, my aunt works late at a restaurant and has to walk home. She might get in trouble even though she's not doing anything bad. Also, if you have an emergency and need help, you might need to go out. I think these are good arguments against the curfew, but I believe it's better to keep people safe.\n\nIn conclusion, making this curfew possible is a good way to keep the city calm. It keeps teenagers out of trouble and makes a better city for them and for everyone."}

Some people might think healthy food is bad, but it's actually good because it's good for our bodies, doesn't make us gain weight, and tastes good.\n\nOur bodies need healthy food. For example, goats are always healthy because they eat a lot of vegetables. This shows why healthy food is good for us. Our bodies need water to survive, and healthy food like vegetables has water in it. So, eating healthy food is good for our bodies and helps prevent stomach problems.\n\nAlmost all students are overweight because they eat too much fast food at school. But we can change this by eating healthy food. Some people are afraid to eat too much because they don't want to gain weight. Some go to the gym to exercise, and some go on a diet to lose weight. They all have a routine to stay healthy. Instead, students should start eating healthy food, which is an easy way to stay healthy.\n\nI love healthy food because it tastes good. I like my vegetables with ranch dressing, which makes them delicious. Some people like their vegetables with different sauces. I think vegetables go well with any food. I first tried vegetables in 9th grade, and I really liked them. The next day, I had them again, and my friend introduced me to ranch dressing. I loved it and started eating it every day.\n\nWhere I come from, we ate a lot of vegetables. We cooked them and made a vegetable sauce to eat with Fufu, which is made from cassava. It's like mashed potatoes, and it's really good with vegetable sauce. That's my favorite meal, and it still is. This shows all my experiences with healthy food. So, eating healthy food is a great choice to stay healthy and in shape.\n\nWe need vegetables in our diet to keep our bodies safe. For example, eating a burger every day is not good for our bodies. So, eating healthy food is the only way to keep our bodies fresh and healthy."}

It's helpful and makes it easier for students to take online classes or video conferencing from their homes using a computer or other technology.\n\nI think attending classes from home will help students learn. Some people may not agree with me, but I believe it's beneficial.\n\nWhen taking online classes, students can work in a quiet place without distractions. They don't have to deal with noise from others, and they can focus better. They have all the time they need to work on a topic without a teacher telling them how much time they have left.\n\nStudents can use technology like computers, tablets, or phones to do their assignments. They can save all their work in one place, and it's easier to stay organized. If they need help, they can use Google to find information or ask friends for help online.\n\nIt's great that some schools allow students to attend school online.

I don't think students should be able to attend classes from home because it can cause problems. It's easier for students to make friends at school. Some students don't have internet at home, and they won't be able to join a school sports team.\n\nMaking friends is easier at school. For example, my sister went to online school from first grade to high school. She spent most of her time on her computer doing homework and didn't get to meet people. She had a hard time making friends and talking to people. My parents were worried about her mental health, so they put her in a public school. She was able to make new friends and spend time with them. Some people say students can make friends on social media, but I don't think you can build trust with friends through a phone screen.\n\nSome students don't have internet at home. For example, my friend didn't have internet and was homeschooled. Her parents had to take her to the public library every day, which was hard for them. She couldn't focus in the library, so she went back to her school after a year. She did better in school and made new friends. Some people say students can go to their friend's house to do online classes, but I don't think students will have the time or a ride to go to their friends' house every day.\n\nStudents won't be able to join a school sports team if they attend classes from home. For example, my cousin took online classes because she moved to a new school. She got tired of online classes and went back to her new school. She found out her new school had a good soccer team, so she tried out and got in. She even got a college scholarship. Some people say students can play soccer with friends without attending school, but I don't think students will get the same motivation from a school team, and they can't get a scholarship.\n\nIn conclusion, it's important for students to attend school so they can socialize with people and make friends. When they grow up, they can tell their kids about their high school years and how they had fun. It will definitely affect their future by helping them socialize and make conversations with friends and family. I believe students should attend school because it helps them in many ways, like being friendly, being active, and getting them away from their devices for at least 6-7 hours."}

Some students don't do their work if classes are online, and not all students have a computer or internet. That's why I think online classes are not a good idea.\n\nOne reason is that online classes are harder for teachers. They have to do more work and prepare lessons for many students. They can't be sure if students understand the lessons because it's harder to know. Sometimes, teachers have to do too much work at home, and it's hard for them to take care of their families.\n\nAnother problem is that some students don't have a computer, and it's a big problem if classes are online. Even if schools provide computers, it's still a big responsibility. Many students don't have internet at home, so they can't take online classes. This means some students might stop studying because it's too hard, and their parents can't afford a computer or internet.\n\nSome people think online classes are better because you can stay at home and don't have to wake up early. You can also save money on food. But for me, the bad things about online classes outweigh the good things. Some students don't do their work because they don't have to, and some might stop studying because it's too easy to quit online classes. Their parents might not have time to help them, and they never see their teachers.\n\nIn conclusion, there are many reasons why online classes are difficult. The only good thing is that you can stay at home, but for me, online classes are harder for teachers and students. It's expensive, and some parents can't help their kids. That's why I think it's better to take classes in school."}

Good manners help you make friends, have a bigger social life, and create happy memories with friends.\n\nA good lesson is to learn good manners both in and out of school. Good manners mean helping others, like helping an older person carry their things or making breakfast for your grandparents. Eating out with your grandparents and paying for the meal is very kind and shows you care about them.\n\nSaying kind words is another way to show good manners. You can say good morning or good afternoon to your family and friends, have friendly conversations, and compliment people on how they look or how nice they are. If someone helps you, say thank you. When you buy something, say thank you and have a nice day.\n\nTreating others with respect is very important. My teachers always told me to treat others with respect if I want to be respected too. If you want to be treated nicely, you have to treat others nicely too. Don't call people names or fight with them.

Some people think schools should control the activities students take because they take up time and energy, leaving little time for studying or homework. Others think students should choose their own activities because they know their abilities and needs better. I believe giving students the decision is better because they know their schedule, needs, and capacity.\n\nMost students have their own calendar to plan their daily tasks and responsibilities. They choose activities based on their schedule. In my sophomore year, my math teacher required me to take an extra math class on Fridays. It was hard for me to stay after school and attend basketball practice on Saturdays, tired. I was often late to the mosque or had no energy to go. If I was in charge, I would choose another day to practice math. Since schools don't know students' schedules, it's better to let students make their own plans.\n\nEach student has a dream career they want to pursue. Extracurricular activities can help them practice their desired major, which is more important than doing homework. It gives them the skills and experience they need after graduation. If schools choose activities, they might pick something students aren't interested in. I read an article about volunteering requirements in schools, and it said it's wrong to make students do something they don't like. This can confuse them when choosing a career, like what happened to my brother. He entered college undecided because he did activities the school chose, which weren't in his interest.\n\nPeople are born with different skills and capacities. Students know how much activity they can handle. Schools sometimes give all students the same workload, but not all students can handle it. Our English class had after-school activities, which were too much for some students. While some succeeded, others failed. Schools should let students choose their activities and amount of workload. If the school finds it's too much or too little, they can contact parents to find a solution.\n\nThe purpose of school is to teach students and prepare them for society. Students should learn to make their own decisions and know what's best for themselves. Schools should let students choose their own activities because they know their schedule, needs, and capacity best."}

Our principal, Generic_Name, has decided that all students must join at least one extracurricular activity. I think this is a bad idea, and I strongly disagree with his decision. He should have asked the students what they think first.\n\nI have many reasons why I disagree with Generic_Name's decision. First, not all students have time for these activities. We already have five other classes, and most classes have homework. When will we have time to do our homework? We might finish it, but we won't have as many breaks during the day. These activities won't make us better at school or smarter.\n\nAnother reason is that some activities are after school, and many parents work. This means we wouldn't have a ride home. Most students don't like staying at school after hours. For example, I don't like going to school, and staying longer would be unfair. It's like my whole day is gone, spent in school.\n\nThe most important reason to me is that we need time to relax and do the things we love. If we join these activities, we won't have time for that. Taking care of ourselves is important. If we don't, we can get depressed or sick. I don't want that to happen to me or anyone.\n\nAnother reason is that all this work and stress will take us away from the things we love. We won't see our friends as often. We won't have time for our hobbies or talents. We won't see our parents if they work late. We'll have to work on weekends and holidays, which would be terrible.\n\nI think Generic_Name should think this through again. He should ask his coworkers and teachers. He should have a poll or survey. If many people disagree, like me, we shouldn't have to join these activities. Or he can ask us what activity we like, and then he can have classes that we would like. For example, I like cooking; if he had a cooking class, I would join. Maybe not every day, but it's something I enjoy. That's why I disagree with the classes and the timing."}

Sometimes, students have a hard time figuring out what they want to be in the future. During school, they can learn more about their future goals by doing what they enjoy.

Learning more about computers can help them decide if they want to work with them or not.\n\nOne good reason to decide on a career early is that students can learn more about their future goals. If a student wants to be a doctor, they can volunteer at hospitals and help at retirement homes. They can also talk to doctors who can teach them more about the job. The doctors can tell them what classes to take to become a doctor.\n\nAnother good reason is that students can take classes that will help them achieve their goals. If a student wants to be a writer, they can take English and Creative Writing classes to learn how to write better. These classes can also help them write their own stories.\n\nA third reason is that some students are not good at schoolwork but are great at sports. They can join a sports team or club to focus on becoming a professional athlete. For example, some students in other countries can't go to school, so they focus on sports because they know they can play at a higher level later.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe it's a good idea for students to decide on a career early in life.

Many students on campus pay for apartments and books, but online classes can be a better option.\n\nSome students prefer online classes because they can avoid the stress of traveling to campus, which can be affected by traffic or accidents. My reason for supporting online classes is that technology allows us to do many things online, such as working, taking classes, or talking to professors from anywhere in the world.

For example, in my country, we get different food every day, but here it's the same food every day.\n\nFinally, changing the menu is one of the most important changes the school can make. Lunch should be healthier and longer, so students will have more energy to pay attention and learn throughout the day.\n\nAlso, students will learn to eat healthier, and the school will make more money because people will buy the food. So, changing the menu will be good for everyone.\n\nIn conclusion, I think the principal should change the menu because it's important for students who don't like the food and for those who skip classes. We need healthier food that's good for everyone, the school, and the kids' health. Many kids have obesity, so the principal should change the menu and serve healthy food."}
{"text_id_kaggle": "2EB01D782D2C", "output_essay": "Most students have internet access and devices at home, so online school gives them the freedom to attend classes and do coursework anywhere. They can also sleep in later because they don't have to wake up early to go to school.\n\nMany students have jobs after school, so they don't have much free time and often don't get enough sleep. Online school helps students have more time in their day to do things beyond schoolwork.\n\nSome students struggle more than others, so online school lets them learn better one-on-one with the teacher. Students can video chat with their teacher to get extra help when needed. They can also discuss assignments and ask questions about things they don't understand.\n\nOnline school is also safer because students can do coursework at home, avoiding bullying. They can spend more time with family and friends and have more fun. These are just a few reasons why online school is a better option."}
{"text_id_kaggle": "60EAF2CDEB66", "output_essay": "This essay is about curfews for teenagers. A city council is discussing a 10 P.M. weekday curfew and a midnight weekend curfew. This means teenagers on the street after those hours would be breaking the law. There are different opinions about this curfew. Some people think curfews will keep teenagers out of trouble. They say some teenagers still go missing and get hurt at night. Since it's nighttime, there aren't many places open, so they might go to a place that's open at night to hang out with friends. This could lead to more serious problems due to exposure to alcohol and drugs.\n\nOn the other hand, some people think curfews unfairly limit teenagers' freedom. They believe teenagers should have the right to control their own time. For example, what if teenagers get hungry at night and want to get food from McDonald's, but they can't because it's after 10 P.M.? This curfew is similar to what happens in North Korea, and it will increase the number of people who break the law.\n\nThere are two different opinions. I think curfews will help parents and teenagers keep them safe and away from trouble. Some bad things happen at night, such as robbery and kidnapping, which cause teenagers to go missing. However, I think the curfew law is too strict, as it limits teenagers' free time. Although it makes teenagers safer, there are other ways to keep them safe. For example, we can add more police officers at night, so they can patrol and respond quickly to accidents. We can also educate teenagers and parents on how to be safe at night.\n\nIn conclusion, I think curfews are a good way to keep teenagers safe, but it's not the best way. Keeping people safe is very important. We can change the curfew time to 11 P.M. on weekdays and 1 A.M. on weekends, and educate teenagers and parents on how to be safe at night."}

When you're trying to do something, like learn a new game or practice a sport, don't give up. The more you practice, the better you'll get. If you keep trying, you might even achieve your goals. Never quitting can help you succeed in life if you keep working hard. It's worth it in the end.\n\nBeing kind to others makes you a good person. Even a simple smile can make someone's day better. When you're nice to people, they think well of you. Being kind also means more people will want to be your friend. You can show kindness by helping others, like older people, kids who need help, or people going through tough times. A small act of kindness can make a big difference.\n\nAnother important lesson is to chase your dreams. When you have big dreams, you'll want to work hard to achieve them. If you have many dreams, some of them might even come true.\n\nIn conclusion, three important lessons for kids are to never give up, be kind to others, and chase their dreams."}
{"text_id_kaggle": "0F14FEA19E2A", "output_essay": "Do you think students would benefit from taking classes from home? Taking classes from home can be helpful for some students. It gives them more time to finish their work and rest when they feel tired. However, I don't think students would benefit from taking classes from home because they might cheat, they need teachers to explain, and they might not take it seriously.\n\nFirst, students might cheat if they take classes from home. For example, I know a student who took classes from home in high school. He used his phone to cheat on every test. At the end of the year, he took the SOL test for that class and failed because he didn't understand anything. Taking classes from home can lead to cheating.\n\nSecond, students need teachers to explain things they don't understand. For example, I know a student who took classes from home to graduate. He skipped some lessons because they were hard to understand. He needed a teacher to explain them. Sometimes students can't understand without a teacher's help.\n\nSome people think taking classes from home is good because it gives students time to think. This is true because students can think about things they can't think about in school. However, nowadays, students might not take classes from home seriously. For example, I know a lazy student who didn't do his work on time. He took classes from home to graduate, but he didn't take it seriously and failed.\n\nIn conclusion, students might not benefit from taking classes from home because they might cheat, they need teachers to explain, and they might not take it seriously. When students take classes from home, there's no one to stop them from cheating. Teachers can explain things easily, and students can't find help when they're at home. Students are more serious in school. Taking classes from home is not helpful for students."}

They get to choose their own extracurricular activity, like sports, yearbook, or student council. This way, they'll make new friends.\n\nAnother good thing about this rule is that students will spend less time on their phones and more time doing something useful. They'll benefit from their activity and show that they're willing to try new things. This might even help them find a job they love.\n\nSince students get to pick their activity, they'll want to spend more time getting better at it. The school will find a way to help them keep doing what they like. There are many activities to choose from, like basketball, baseball, swimming, and football. If they choose a sport, they'll get exercise too. Other activities include tutoring and helping others with their schoolwork.\n\nI think this rule is a good idea because students will learn something new from their activity. They can use this knowledge in school or later in life. It can even help others. For example, joining the Girl or Boy Scouts can teach them how to be safe and how to help in emergencies.\n\nIn Scouts, they'll learn how to handle sharp objects, make a fire, and find clean water.

They try to make learning fun and create new things like clubs and activities. The principal says every student needs to join at least one club or activity. I think this is a great idea. What the principal is offering is valuable because it can give us new opportunities, help us try new things, and make us feel like we belong. Every principal works hard, and I think this idea will bring students together and make them happy."}
{"text_id_kaggle": "5BDDDFAD603A", "output_essay": "I believe that people with good attitudes have a better chance at having a successful life. They are not like those who are mean and rude. You don't want to end up like them, living in bad conditions and regretting their choices. But when you have a good attitude, you see life in a different way. People trust you and want to be your friend. Good attitudes also bring better opportunities in life.\n\nIf you want people to trust you, you need to be nice and caring. They will think, 'I like that person, they have a good attitude.' You can get friends who know you and think you're trustworthy. I remember when I was 11 years old, my sister had a 2-year-old baby, and she visited to take my mom to the doctor. They couldn't take my baby niece because she was crying. My mom and sister knew I could take care of the baby. So it was just me, my baby niece, and my younger sister. They came back in 2 hours and said, 'We can trust you.'\n\nWhen you have a good attitude, you can get better opportunities in life, like when you apply for college or a good job. They will likely pick the person who is kind, generous, and confident. My brother applied for college and was very confident. A few days later, the college wrote back and said, 'We want to talk to you about joining our school.' My brother is a generous and confident person, so I knew he would get in. He did get in and now studies at college.\n\nThis means that having a good attitude and a positive view of life will give you people you can trust and better opportunities. Just by having a good attitude."}

I believe it's not always the best choice.\n\nAn old saying says honesty is the best policy, but it can hurt people's feelings. Here's why. Honesty can hurt people because it can make them do harmful things to themselves, start a fight, or even make them feel so sad they want to end their life.\n\nLet me explain these reasons. If you hurt someone's feelings, they might hurt themselves over and over again. If you're honest with them, they might want to fight, and that can lead to more problems. If you're honest with someone you've known for a long time, they might become very sad and feel like their life is bad. This sadness can get worse and worse, and in extreme cases, they might even end their life.\n\nSo, the old saying that honesty is the best policy is not always true. Honesty can hurt people's feelings and lead to serious problems. Honesty is just something we think about, and it's about being kind to everyone we know and don't know. That's how we can make the world a better place."}

It can change their thinking, give them a better idea, and show them what others think.\n\nOne reason advice helps is that it can change your thinking. For example, if you're not sure about something, someone else can give you an idea that helps. John was working on a project and couldn't think of ideas. His dad helped him, and that showed how others can help us think.\n\nAnother reason advice helps is that others can give you a better idea. For example, they can help you with a project, work, or test. John and Emily were doing their homework. John had finished, but Emily hadn't. John gave her some good ideas, and that helped her understand better.\n\nA third reason advice helps is that people with experience can give you ideas for your life. For example, your parents or older people have lived through things. John would ask his grandpa about what he did when he was John's age. This shows how some choices can help you in life."}
{"text_id_kaggle": "4689DDBC445C", "output_essay": "I believe it's a good idea for students to decide on a career at a young age. This way, they can have a clear idea of what they want to be in the future. When they graduate from high school and college early, they can find a job and make money early, or they can keep studying and work part-time. If they earn money early, they can plan their life, buy a house or car, help their family, or invest in a business.\n\nI'm 19 years old and still in high school, and it's hard for me because I'm not sure what I want to be or what career I should get. I'm just thinking about paying the rent or bills and paying for my car. I'm going to school, but I have a part-time job, which makes it difficult to study for a career.\n\nIf students identify a career by the time they enter high school, it's helpful because they can try it out and if they don't like it, they can choose another career and have time for their parents to help them. I think that if they're 21 years old or more, their parents may not help them as much, maybe saying they're old and should have graduated already.\n\nMy dad told me when I started high school, \"I'll help you graduate, and then if you want to keep studying, you have to work and study.\" I want to find a career and keep studying and working at night because I know studying is important and will help me in the future when I find a good job.\n\nIt would be a good idea if parents ask their children what they want to be when they grow up. Children have dreams when they're young because they watch adults and what they do, and sometimes parents tell them they can't do that because of their situation and limitations. But if parents say, \"Yes, you can do it,\" and help make that dream a reality, they'll do it.\n\nFinding a career at a young age helps students stay focused on what they want, and teachers can show them more about the career and they can learn more. When students go to college, it won't be difficult for them, and it will be easier to learn about the career.\n\nIn my opinion, it's a good idea because sometimes I ask friends what career they want, and they say, \"I don't like school; I prefer to work in construction or a simple job because I need money now.\" But when they work in construction, they say it's too hard, and I ask myself, \"Do they think about what would happen if they took a career? Maybe life is easier and better with a career?\"\n\nSometimes it's too difficult to have a career because many students want to study, but they don't have money or time because they work and pay for their trip to the United States, and they work part-time and go to high school. That's why students don't want to keep studying because they think work is more important than school. But in reality, I think school is more important because students learn a lot about their profession, and then after they graduate, they can find a job and earn a lot of money because they have a title and earn for what they know.\n\nI think that in the United States, there are many opportunities because they help Spanish students find a career and learn English. But it's hard for many Spanish students because they came to the United States just to work; they don't want to see the opportunities this country has. If they saw it in another way, I think many Spanish people could be millionaires, have companies, businesses, or be artists or presidents.\n\nStudying is the most important part of life because we learn so much in school, and we can do a lot in the future. We can educate our children, help them make their dreams a reality, or find a good career where we can earn money just for what we know. In the future, we'll have time with our family, take vacations with friends, or earn money doing what we like.\n\nChoosing a good career helps us live a good life; choosing something we love to do is better because if we do a career that's not ours, we'll live uncomfortably. Sometimes parents tell their children what career to take, and maybe the children don't like it; they'll live uncomfortably for the rest of their life doing a job they don't like.\n\nI think it's a fantastic idea that students identify a career by the time they enter high school, and their courses are selected to guide them toward a specific career. I think school is the best place where we learn a lot of things, and that helps us be good workers in the future and good people."}

I have heard that some students disagree with this change, and I am one of them.

Second, students won't do well in school because they won't be eating. Third, the cafeteria staff will have to throw away the food because students won't eat it.\n\nIf you take away students' favorite foods, they won't eat lunch at school. This can cause many problems. For example, students might leave school to buy food they like and not come back to class or be late. This is not good for the school. Also, going outside of school can be dangerous for students. It's the school's job to keep them safe. Some students might even transfer to another school because they don't like the food here. Parents might also be upset because their kids are not eating, which can affect their health.\n\nIf you change the school lunch menu, students might not do well in school because they're not eating well. They might feel hungry in class, which can be uncomfortable and distract them. When I'm hungry, it's hard for me to focus or I feel sick. Some people think eating healthy is a good idea because it can make students healthier and smarter. But most students don't like to eat vegetables or healthy foods.\n\nAnother reason I don't like this change is that the cafeteria staff will have to throw away the food. This is a waste. We all know it's not good to throw away food, especially when some people don't have enough to eat. The food could be given to them instead. The cafeteria staff will also be unhappy because they'll cook and then throw away the food. I think it's unfair to waste food like this.\n\nIn conclusion, I don't think changing the school lunch menu is a good idea. It will take away students' favorite foods, and the food will be wasted. Students won't have the energy to do well in school, and the cafeteria staff will be unhappy. I hope you read my letter and think about my concerns.\n\nThank you for your time.\n\nSincerely, Generic_Name"}

Sometimes, advice helps you make better choices and have better opinions.\n\nAsking one or more people for advice is good because they have experience and know what's good or bad for you. They've learned from their mistakes and can give you great advice for your life and future.\n\nBut sometimes, asking for advice doesn't work out because the person doesn't understand what you're saying. They might give you bad advice. So, you need to find someone else who really knows what to do and has been through what you're going through.\n\nAsking for advice is good because you can use it in the future. For example, my grandma told me that not everyone is your friend, and when you get older, you'll only have a few real friends. My dad told me to be independent because no one will always do things for you. Getting advice from an adult is best because they know what to do and have been through what you're going through. We also ask our teachers for advice because sometimes our parents are too busy to talk to us.\n\nWhen you need advice about something personal, talk to someone you trust. Getting advice from different people is good because they share their opinions and experiences. It gives you a choice and helps you make better decisions.

I agree that our personality is shaped by things beyond our control because we try to be like someone, we hide our true selves, and we try to be better than others.\n\nTrying to be like someone else doesn't show our true character or feelings. If we copy someone, it doesn't help because we might do things we don't really want to do. For example, my sister loves a famous singer named Cardi B. She started dressing like her and wearing makeup. One day, she said something that worried my family and me. She wanted to change her body. My parents talked to her and told her it's okay to like Cardi B's music, but she needs to be herself. At first, she was upset, but eventually, she understood.\n\nWhen we don't show our true selves, we make random choices and don't do things because we love them. If we don't be ourselves, it will be hard for us because we won't make good decisions, take care of ourselves, or do things we love. I had an experience where I almost smoked marijuana at a party. I was 15, and my friend offered me a cigarette. I said no, but he called me names, and I almost gave in. Then I remembered what my parents told me - that they wouldn't love me as much if I smoked. I threw away the cigarette and called my parents to pick me up. I learned to make good choices.\n\nTrying to be better than someone can change how people see us. But everyone is equal, and we all have the ability to learn. My cousin tried to be better than everyone in my family, but we told her that everyone is equal and can learn. No one is better than anyone else.\n\nIn the end, not being ourselves and not showing what we can do in life means we won't achieve our goals. If we show our true selves, we'll think before we act, do things because we love them, and show people what we can really do. Being ourselves is the key to being successful in life."}

A 10 p.m. weekday curfew is a bad idea and should not be implemented because teenagers need freedom. If there's an emergency, the fear of getting caught by the police would make the teenager hesitate or not act.\n\nTo a teenager, freedom is everything. When they lose freedom, they find it hard to control themselves, and they want to break rules. Teenagers are very impulsive and do things on a whim. This gives them a thrill that can't be explained. Setting a 10 p.m. curfew triggers these emotions and impulses.\n\nIn some states, teenagers are not allowed to drive between 12 a.m. and 5 a.m. However, over 70% of teenage drivers still drive during this time. When asked why, they say things like, \"I'm hungry,\" \"I'm going home from work,\" or \"my sister is sick, and I need to take her to the hospital.\" Teenagers don't go out at night to harm people; they just want to have fun with friends. There are many car accidents in the U.S., but people still drive every morning. There's no law banning people from driving, even though it's risky. This is similar to the 10 p.m. curfew; the risk doesn't outweigh the benefit. Police would be focusing on the wrong thing when real crimes are happening elsewhere.\n\nSome people think teenagers can't be trusted at night and that the government should make a 10 p.m. rule to control them. These people have a narrow mindset and are not leaders.\n\nThe 10 p.m. rule should not be a law because teenagers need freedom, and in an emergency, they would act quickly and correctly without mistakes."}

Some people think it's better to set low goals and achieve them, but others believe it's better to aim high. I think people should aim high because it makes teens work harder, teachers inspire students, and adults teach kids to be optimistic.\n\nSome people think students shouldn't aim high because they might lose hope if they fail. Others think teachers don't challenge students enough, and adults can have a bad influence on kids.\n\nFirst, teens work harder when they aim high. They focus more in school, study extra hours, and ask for help when they need it. They can even learn from their mistakes. For example, they can stay in after-school programs or work online from home. This helps them learn that nothing in life comes easily and that they can bounce back from failure.\n\nAdditionally, teachers inspire students when they aim high. Teachers support students and help them keep going even when they fail. Students feel more comfortable and inspired when teachers believe in them. For example, when students are nervous about a test, teachers give them support and help them do their best. Teachers also get inspired by students and try new ways to help them succeed.\n\nLastly, adults teach kids to be optimistic when they aim high. Adults show kids that it's okay to dream big and that they shouldn't give up. They can inspire kids from a young age and help them develop a positive attitude. Being optimistic also helps adults reduce stress and complete their tasks more easily.\n\nIn conclusion, everyone should aim high because it helps teens work harder, inspires teachers and students, and teaches kids to be optimistic. If people don't aim high, they'll never know what they're capable of, and they'll only give a small part of themselves to the world. People should aim high and not be afraid to fail because that's part of life. The goal is to keep trying."}

Life can be tough when we try to reach our goals. The key to success is to stay enthusiastic. Sometimes, when we fail, we learn new skills that can help us in the future.\n\nFirst, success is about not giving up because we gain experience. For example, I wanted to become a teacher and move out of my parents' house. My parents told me it was a bad idea, but I didn't listen and moved out. After three months, I couldn't pay my bills and had to move back in with my parents. Even though I didn't reach my goal, I learned from my mistake, and that can help me in the future.\n\nSecond, success is about not giving up because we feel proud of ourselves. For example, I wanted to pass my math exam, but it was very hard. I studied for two days and managed to pass the exam and graduate. When we work hard, we can achieve our goals, even if it's difficult.\n\nSome people may say that success is not about trying again after we fail. But I think success is about getting back up after we fall. For example, there was a man who had everything, but then he lost it all because of a girl he loved. He had to start over and work at a barber shop. But he didn't give up, and he was able to recover his life.\n\nTo summarize, success is about not giving up even when we fail.

We want students to focus on their goals, and if online classes help, then that's okay.\n\nMany kids have health problems that need to be checked often. If not checked, they could get very sick and end up in the hospital. At home, parents can help them remember to take their medicine or do their daily check-ups. Doctor's appointments can also be a problem. Sometimes you can't get the time you want, so you don't miss school. But with online classes, you don't need to worry about that. You can take the class later or bring your computer to the appointment and work on it there.\n\nSleep is very important for our health. It helps us feel ready to do things and focus on our work. When kids don't get enough sleep, they don't want to get up in the morning, are late, or fall asleep in class. With online classes, you can choose when you want to do your work, so you'll have the energy to finish it easily.\n\nAs a parent, your child's safety is the most important thing.

This is because kids can focus better on learning in person rather than online. It's also healthier for students to get 8 hours of sleep. When homeschooled, kids can sleep whenever they want. The government should decide what's best for our kids.\n\nIn schools, teachers and principals have ways to help students who are used to being homeschooled. They want these students to have fun with sports, clubs, and activities. Students would have a better understanding of their surroundings and how they should be taught. Some countries or states believe kids should only be homeschooled. However, the government should take charge of education and decide what's best for kids.\n\nAttending classes from home shouldn't be required because of late sleeping hours, too much technology use, and not participating in activities.\n\nStudents should get 8 hours of sleep, but they don't because they use too much technology. This keeps them up late. They also do homework late, watch TV, play sports late at night, and play video games. These things keep them from sleeping.\n\nWhen homeschooled, kids have trouble focusing on school work because of technology. Technology affects students with social media, games, and texting.\n\nHomeschooled kids often don't get enough energy and time for sports or activities. Some parents who teach their kids sports haven't had experience with these activities. Homeschooled kids often don't join clubs or sports.\n\nKids who are homeschooled by their parents can't connect with friends or school learning. Parents should provide more opportunities for their kids to learn from experienced teachers and connect with the world."}

They change who they are to fit in with a group or to seem tough. They don't think about the trouble they can get into.\n\nI've seen friends change because they wanted to fit in with a new group. They changed how they looked and acted just to be friends with certain people. But they didn't think about the problems they could have. They could get in trouble at school or get left behind by their new friends.\n\nOlder people often influence younger people to do things they shouldn't do. Kids do things that aren't really them just to fit in. I know someone who changed because their friends told them to. But when they went back to their old friends, no one treated them the same.\n\nMany kids pretend to be tough to impress others. They act like they're someone they're not just to fit in. They get influenced by older kids who seem cool, but who might not be good friends. These kids often bully others just to look good in front of their friends. They get into trouble and might even get hurt.\n\nTeens in high school often act tough to seem better than others. They pick on kids who are just trying to do their work and get through the day. They do it just to get a laugh and seem cool.\n\nMany teens try to look cool by doing things they shouldn't do, like skipping class or not doing their work. They think it's more important to look good than to learn. They get influenced by bad friends and get in trouble at school and at home. They don't think about the consequences and just want to seem cool.\n\nIt's sad to see people change like this. It shows that anyone can be influenced and changed. People can't blame anyone else for their choices. They have to take responsibility for who they become.\n\nPeople often change because of bad influences and never go back to being the same person. No one sees them the same way again. They believe what others tell them and it ruins their life. They choose to follow the wrong path and it changes who they are."}
{"text_id_kaggle": "05577F21EC4A", "output_essay": "Should schools control students' extracurricular activities or should students and their parents make the decision? I think parents should talk to their kids and decide together. However, some students might have more important things to do, like getting a job or doing homework, instead of joining school activities.\n\nAs students grow up, they need to learn about the real world and its challenges. They will need to get a job and take care of themselves one day. For example, a 17-year-old girl named Generic_Name has a job and goes to school every day. She wants to become a businesswoman, which is not easy, but she can handle it. She believes that success requires hard work and sacrifice.\n\nStudents should not spend too much time on their phones, so they can focus on school work and have time for other important activities. As a student, I know it can be hard to keep up with homework and projects, and sometimes we just want to give up. For example, a 16-year-old student named Generic_Name used to have good grades, but now she struggles because she feels pressure from school and her personal life. She got distracted by social media, but now she is trying to fix her problems and improve her grades.\n\nAs teenagers, we need to prepare ourselves to be independent and not rely on our parents. We need to take care of ourselves emotionally and financially. For example, a 27-year-old woman named Generic_Name still lives with her mom, but she is working hard to take care of her two kids. She has two jobs and is trying to move out of her mom's house. We need to be responsible for our decisions and think carefully before making them."}
{"text_id_kaggle": "669A736CF0B4", "output_essay": "Michelangelo, a famous artist, once said, 'The greatest danger in life isn't aiming too high and falling short, but aiming too low and achieving your goal.' I think this is very important because it's true in many ways. Working hard and falling short can get you close to your goal. Aiming low is easier, but you'll never know how high you could have gone if you tried harder.\n\nFirst, aiming high and falling short is okay. At least you tried hard to achieve your goal. That means you just need to work a bit harder to get there. I once studied hard for my science final exam and aimed for a high score, but I failed by one point. Then, I took it again and passed with enough work and determination. So, take your best shot and don't be afraid to fail.\n\nNext, I believe there are no shortcuts in life. Having low goals is pointless and won't get you anywhere. Wouldn't you want to make something good out of your life and be happy? Trying to reach high goals won't hurt you. The worst thing that could happen is failing, but that shouldn't stop you. The only thing that can stop you is yourself for not trying. So, get up and aim high.\n\nI also dislike it when people say, 'I wouldn't have made it anyway.' How would you know if you could have reached your goal if you never tried? It's impossible to know if you don't give it a shot. People don't become the best in their field without trying, failing, and finally succeeding. I never thought I could be a good athlete until I practiced hard and started getting better. Aim high and try to reach your goal, but never aim low and settle for something you don't want.\n\nFinally, these are my reasons why I agree with Michelangelo's quote. I understand why others may disagree with my beliefs. They might say that you control your life and how it works. This may be true, but as long as you don't give up on your goals, you can be anything."}
{"text_id_kaggle": "A43056665FEC", "output_essay": "The famous American jazz musician Duke Ellington once said, 'A problem is a chance for you to do your best.' I agree with him, and I think we should encourage people to do their best when they face problems. A problem is a great opportunity to show what you can do. It's also important to believe in yourself because it's easy to get discouraged. Some people get shy and give up when they have a problem. But we should help people solve their own problems because they are the ones who can choose to do their best.\n\nFirstly, a problem is a chance to do your best because it makes you work hard. For example, my friend told me about a math test she took. She was struggling with some questions, but she didn't give up. She worked hard and passed the test with a high score. She said, 'The problem was a chance for me to do my best.' This shows that even if you don't know how to solve a problem, you should keep working hard until you find a solution.\n\nIn addition, a problem is a chance to do your best because you won't want to give up. For example, I read a book about a person who faced many problems but never gave up. One time, he entered a running competition, but he didn't know where to stop. He kept asking other runners for help until someone told him. Because he didn't give up, he won the game. This shows that you should never give up and always do your best until you find a solution.\n\nIn conclusion, when you have a problem, you should work hard and never give up because it's a chance to do your best. If my friend didn't tell me her story, I wouldn't have learned this important lesson. And if the person in the book gave up, he wouldn't have won the competition. Let's encourage ourselves and others to always try our best because a problem is a chance to do your best, even in difficult situations."}

Schools require students to do these projects to keep learning during their two-month break. Summer projects are like homework, but during the break. School is where students learn new things to get a diploma and a future job. Schools shouldn't require summer projects because students will get lazier, no one will do them, and students will forget what they learned.\n\nSome people think schools should require summer projects because students don't do anything during their break. Some students only play video games and sleep. Others think students need to be prepared for the next school year, so they won't struggle with new topics. But these people are wrong.\n\nSchools shouldn't require summer projects because students will get lazier. Teenagers are already tired of school, and if they have to do projects, they'll dislike school even more. Students don't like homework, and summer projects are too much work. People need a break from everything. Many students work during summer break to save money for college. They can't work long hours during the school year, so summer break is their only chance. Working too much can harm people's health, both emotionally and mentally.\n\nThe School Board shouldn't require summer projects because no one will do them. Students are busy during summer break, spending time with their families or going on vacations. Vacations help people avoid depression from school. If schools give students projects, they won't enjoy their vacation and will feel frustrated. People need a break from school, and everyone needs rest.\n\nSchools shouldn't require summer projects because students will forget what they learned. Students can finish their project quickly, but they won't learn anything. Finishing work without learning doesn't make sense. Summer break is long, and if schools give students work, they'll forget what they learned. People do many things during summer break, like going on vacation, which helps them relax and forget about school stress.\n\nSchools shouldn't give students summer projects because no one will do them, students will forget what they learned, and they'll get lazier. If schools didn't give students projects, they could save money and relax their minds from school."}
{"text_id_kaggle": "B2C0ECB08687", "output_essay": "I think students should take part in class activities because it shows teachers what they know about a topic. When students participate, teachers don't have to repeat the material. For example, if a teacher puts a game on the smart board, students need to participate to play. This helps them review what they don't understand. To pass the SOL, students need to review everything discussed in class. When students participate, it shows teachers that they already know the material and are following directions.\n\nI once participated in every math class until I understood everything, and then I got better. No student had to complain about not understanding the material. I know some people don't like participating, but it's important. Like my brother, who never participates, but he needs to participate for his grades.\n\nSome people don't like to participate because they're nervous or shy. They might be scared to stand up and answer a question. But I think we should participate when we want to. It helps us learn. We need to get used to talking in front of everyone. I know it's hard, but we'll get used to it. In high school, we'll have to do it, so we might as well start now.\n\nI used to be scared to participate, but then I got to know everyone, and it was fine. I'm friends with my classmates, and I'm not afraid to stand up and say something. I think if we get used to what we're afraid of, we won't have to worry anymore. We can just speak up and participate.\n\nStudents go to school to learn what they don't know. I want to learn something new every day. When my mom was thirteen, she didn't go to school, but now I go to school, and I want to tell her everything. I want to learn about the coronavirus and how to help my family get through it.\n\nI think people should participate in class activities, even if they're scared. It helps us learn. Once I participated in math class and answered my teacher's questions, I kept trying to get the answer. My parents want me to have good grades. I see some students who don't want to work or participate because they don't want to learn. But grades are important, so I say yes to participating, even if it's hard. We'll keep trying to finish and pass."}
{"text_id_kaggle": "8C83DC94D668", "output_essay": "What do you think about changing the school lunch menu? Is it a good idea or a bad idea? I think it's a good idea because some students don't like eating the same lunch every day and want to try different foods. \n\nA student gets tired of eating the same food served at the school cafeteria every day. I've seen many students waste their food because the menu hasn't changed in years. For example, my brother used to bring his lunch from home because he got tired of eating the same unhealthy food served at our cafeteria.\n\nEating the same food can make you lose your taste for other foods. For example, when I was 10, I got sick and couldn't eat my favorite food, but my mom made me soup every day. After a while, I couldn't taste my favorite food, but it came back after a few weeks.\n\nIn my country, schools had canteens where students could buy different foods and drinks every day. More than half of the students bought their lunch from the canteen, and the money was used to improve the school and change the menu. \n\nThat's the benefit of providing students with different lunch menus: students will eat more, and they will pay more for the food. I think our principal should follow my home country's policy to get more students to buy lunch from the school. If not, maybe one day every student will bring lunch from home, and the school food lines will close.\n\nSome people disagree because they might not have the opportunity to bring lunch from home or they like eating the same food every day. But I think changing the school menu is a good idea because it will help students get different foods every day. \n\nI think our principal should change the school menu to include healthier options like salads and fruits instead of sandwiches. Last time, he added more sandwiches and removed nutritious ice cream and apple juice, which are my favorite. I think he should add more healthy options to help students get nutrients and learn better in school. \n\nI believe the principal should focus on providing nutritious food and remove junk food that affects students' health. Students who don't like healthy food should be concerned about their health and understand the consequences of eating unhealthy food. I think all schools should provide students with healthy food to make our next generation healthier and stronger.\n\nI hope my response will encourage the principal to take action and change the school menu to give students different options and stop wasting food. Students who waste food will end up with empty trays if we have a good nutritious menu like I had in my country."}

This company helps students who love nature and animals. I think it's great because students from other schools don't get to do as many fun activities with their schools. I have many reasons why I think students, including myself, should join your company. When young students have big dreams, adults like teachers or parents should help them find activities that relate to those dreams. I'm very passionate about my dream, and I know school is important for achieving it.\n\nMany schools work with local companies to give students hands-on experiences. I like to challenge myself and try new things. When I was a little girl, I used to watch TV and tell my mom I wanted to be a veterinarian. I loved watching the movie Madagascar because it was about animals. My favorite character was Gloria. I used to drive my mom crazy by asking her to play the movie over and over again. I remember what she told me once: 'You and your cousin will be great veterinarians when you grow up.' My cousin and I are like best friends, and we both want to be veterinarians. We like to learn about nature and animals by watching TV shows and doing things like going to the park to watch birds build their nests, feeding ducks, or going to the beach to observe fish. I'm a friendly person, and I like talking to new people every day. I learn from their experiences and dreams. Some people told me they wish they could do activities related to their dream jobs. I know that when I do things I enjoy, I learn more.\n\nI should join the safari because I love animals and like to explore new things. Feeding animals and being around them reminds me of when I told my mom I could achieve my dream. My cousin once said, 'We can both chase our dreams and work as veterinarians.' His words inspire me.\n\nI'm also a cooperative person who likes to do the right thing. When schools work with companies, students need to be cooperative and patient because not every kid likes to do the right thing. Animals need love and care, just like us. I remember feeling sad when I saw homeless pets in Puerto Rico. I told myself I would adopt pets when I'm old enough. I love watching how different animals interact with each other. I'm very passionate about doing activities with animals. When students from other schools do activities they enjoy, it's very helpful, and they might even find what they like to do."}
